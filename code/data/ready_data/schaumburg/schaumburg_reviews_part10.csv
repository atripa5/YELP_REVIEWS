Slimy cilantro and old onions, questionable meat all cooked on a dirty grill.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this place has caused trips to the ER. Gross.

I have, however, ordered take-out from the Lee Street location and was impressed with the quality of the food and better service. The place is a total dive so I&#39;ve always gotten our food to go.

The food is cooked fresh right in front of you and if you judge this book by it&#39;s cover, you will miss out. They are a pretty darn good restaurant.

The chicken used in their tacos and burritos includes some grilled onions, so beware non-onion fans, like me!

The steak they use is not the best cut of meat and can be a little tough, but they season it very well.

The double up their corn tortillas for their $2 tacos and that&#39;s helpful for your folks that put salsa and junk all over it. I am not a fan of all that, so I just eat the inside tortilla. Ask for some limes on the side and squeeze them over your steak taco or burrito. It will add some freshness and lighten up the greasy-ness that is your lunch. 

They charge you for little things like cheese ($.50) which is kinda lame, but what are you gonna do, they gotta make money. 

You can have a pretty decent sized burrito for under $7.00 and they make spanish rice too for $1.75. It&#39;s a small bowl/cup. I think sometimes it sits too long because you will get the clumps of rice mixed in, but the taste is decent. 

They aren&#39;t the fancy sit down place you may be thinking they might be. It&#39;s an order at the counter- they will holler out your order- you will pick it up at the counter and find a place to eat.

Now, my office is just down the road, literally, and I prefer to eat in their place than take anything back because it&#39;s just so fresh on site and I recommend you do this too.

Give them a try. And if you like variety- have one chicken taco, one steak taco and some rice. Enjoy!"

I&#39;m from Germany, living in Arlington Heights for the past year and a half and the Burrito at Las Asadas is seriously my best food experience ever. (dont think it can get any better) I always get a burrito de carne asada con cebolla, cilantro y queso and it is soooo delicious!! the meat is just kissing your tongue and with the green spicy sauce its just perfect! Omg, just thinking about it makes me crave one so bad...

I love this place so bad that I told all of my international friends about it - and of course they love it as well  :).. now, most of my friends returned to their home country and cant stop talking about this little little place in Des Plaines. Best Mexican Food ever. You guys make me so happy all the time, seriously... oh and the horchata is awesome too!

I&#39;m gonna leave America this August but I sure will come as often as possible for this perfect heavenly burrito.

That&#39;s why it gets five stars.  Not because it&#39;s fancy or has good service, but because the food is so damn good.  You order and get your food at the counter, sit down and enjoy, and then clean up and go.  It&#39;s so simple and so focused on deliciousness that it succeeds.

The food is really simple taco shack fare: tacos and burritos with the standard selection of meats.  You can get a plate, but I&#39;ve never seen anyone do that, so don&#39;t.  My favorite is the carne asada and they do an alright barbacoa.  The pollo isn&#39;t their strong suite, but it&#39;s not bad either.  If you want to get adventurous, there&#39;s lengua.  The salsa verde they serve is an absolute must.  It&#39;s sooooo good.  It&#39;s just bursting with flavor and a healthy amount of heat.  I usually end up emptying out half a bottle for three tacos.

Las Asadas isn&#39;t about being an amazing dining experience, it&#39;s about getting you goddamn amazing tacos and burritos for cheap.  The place is always full of Hispanics and Latinos because it&#39;s authentically good cheap Mexican street food.  Now go get yourself some tacos, cover it in green sauce, and enjoy!"

Because it&#39;s so good, it should be fattening. Wait..it is. Okay, it&#39;s so good, it should be illegal. Yeah, that works. It&#39;s so good, I almost don&#39;t feel worthy of enjoying it&#39;s greatness. Like I am committing a crime. Getting away with robbery, humping the Pastors daughter on stage like Akon, or finally kicking the crap out of that neighbor kid who keeps teasing your dog. Yes, THAT good.

It&#39;s about as close to a Mexican style barbaque as it gets, except indoors. I once again watched in amazement as the guys behind the counter grilled tons of skirt steak over the grill, filling the air with such magnifiSCENTS. Wow that was lame. Anyway, I truly wonder why more places don&#39;t cook their meat over a flame. It makes such a drastic difference in the taste. Digging into a burrito filled with this divine steak really makes you feel like you&#39;re eating some excellent street vendor food in the old country. You&#39;ll have to shell out a little more cash than most places, but definitely worth it. I highly recommend you come check it out for yourself."

Pork is definitely a mainstay here. When I walked in I was greeted by the remains of a pig under a heat lamp. Perhaps that&#39;s a delicacy for some; it made me reconsider vegetarianism.

Once seated my waitress brought these really thick corn tortilla chips and, the best part of the meal, four types of salsa: two mild, two hot. As others have said, this is a very traditional spot; when they say hot, they aren&#39;t kidding. 

I told the waitress I wanted a chicken dish with vegetables. She suggested the chicken salad. It was a sautéed piece of chicken cut in strips sitting atop a tasteless bed of iceberg lettuce with a few slices of tomatoes, avocados and a large chunks of white onion. No dressing served, only a few pieces of lime. The chicken was tolerable and the avocado fresh, that&#39;s the most I can say.

The refried beans were nasty. They tasted like pork and were dried out. I took one bite and almost lost it. I can&#39;t remember the last time I didn&#39;t clean my plate.

Much as I like the staff, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be returning any time soon."

We ordered a large thin crust pizza with pepperoni, garlic, and green peppers. This is our specialty combination of toppings. It was plenty for the two of us with another set of servings to take home and eat as leftovers. We are not typically thin crust people - We prefer &#34;double dough&#34; - but we enjoyed this pizza. The garlic nicely permeated every bite, as if it were incorporated into the sauce. 

The craft beer selection was mostly bottled, though we found A Lil Sumpin Sumpin on tap and enjoyed that. We were there on a Saturday at around noon and had the bar to ourselves. There is another wing to the restaurant with dining tables and booths but a birthday party was being set up there so we opted for the bar. There is not much in the way of upholstery or fabric to absorb sound so sound tends to bounce around a lot. That&#39;s something to think about during busier hours, if your voice can&#39;t compete with bar noise, like mine. 

Almost forgot about dessert. We shared an ice cream dish with a warm, giant cookie on the bottom and three cherries on top. It was a lot so be sure to share if you get that! It&#39;s too tasty to wasty.

We had fun. No regrets."

Really one of the best deep dish pizza around (in my opinion)! Way better than Giordano&#39;s, Lou Malnati&#39;s, and Gino&#39;s East. 

Peqouds is known for their &#34;crusty pizza&#34; with the caramelized crust. I love peqouds. However, when I&#39;m in the mood for something soft and more cheesy, this is my go-to place. It is slightly more expensive compared to peqouds but it&#39;s worth the cost! The ambiance is very &#34;adult like&#34; with better looking dining area then most places. There is a huge window that peeks into kitchen if you want to physically see the ETA of your pizza. The parking lot and other stores around give you the &#34;the glen&#34; feel in Glenview. 

The mozzarella sticks here are WAYYYYYY better than at Peqouds or any other deep dish place. It&#39;s $8.25 for 7 mozzarella sticks. 

Our waitress was nothing too special, in fact I&#39;d say she was slightly below average. She was slow to refill our waters/drinks. Also my sister&#39;s drink was flat. However, the food made up for it."

Though Georgios is A-OK and decent, it&#39;s not somewhere I would wait to dine at when South Barrington has a plethora of choices right outside the door. 

When I was there it was in the heat of the summer and there were some temperature issues. The bar seemed like it wasn&#39;t air conditioned or if it was, not enough. Everyone was sweating sitting around and the bartender was sweating an extra lot. Something grosses me out about seeing sweat drip off the person serving me food. 

We actually ended up moving to the main dining room from the bar once our table was ready and the temp there seemed perfectly fine. We had a very nice and attentive server. Pizza was decent though (cliche coming) nothing to write home about.

First off, the interior itself it really well done.  The waitstaff was more than friendly and the experience overall was really outstanding.

We ordered the dough nuggets for an appetizer.   They were good, but the marinara dipping sauce stole the show.

Next we got a small thin crust.  I got the papa on my half and the other half was vegetarian.  The crust was crispy, the sauce was killer, and the toppings were fresh!

I think it was like the day after Christmas, or maybe second day after Christmas, and it was D-E-A-D in here. Needless to say, we were seated right away into a lovely booth right next to the large windows. Booths were large and comfy. Lots of seating in the dining area, and even a really cool super-large booth right at the entrance to dining room (for like 10 people or something, see pic).  The main room is nice and bright, due to all the large windows.  They&#39;ve also got a fireplace, and a few scattered t.v.&#39;s. 

You&#39;d think since it was really slow that we&#39;d have great service, but unfortunately the service was HORRIBLE, which is why the rating is 4-stars. would&#39;ve been 5 if we&#39;d had good service, cuz the food is GREAT! We ordered two pizzas, and they were just delicious! In addition, we also got those little fried dough thingies as an appetizer, and holy-sweet-mother-of-God are they amazing.

Was here for a private party and the restaurant did not provide enough seats for the agreed upon amount of guests. 
One third of our group was forced to sit outside of the banquet room, which was very awkward.  
The appetizers were served in such small quantities that all guests could not be served.  
Additionally, management was very unresponsive to requests and the compensation (discount) offered for all the issues was borderline offensive."

There deep dish to be specific. The service is excellent and very quick. There regular thin crust pizza is pretty much average, so if you do go here you must order the deep dish. It has the perfect amount of ingredients. 

The calzones are probably the best calzones I have ever had and it is very large. I would assume two people could be full after eating. 

I definitely will recommend to anyone to at least go and try this place out! I promise you won&#39;t regret it."

The pizza was pretty good nice sauce with good amount of cheese.  The location is clean and very nice place.  The only issue we had was one half of the pizza was supposed to have bacon on it and I had a entire piece with only one small piece of bacon.  Then I had another piece with a bunch of bacon all over it.  I just think this might be a one time concept but worth mentioning."

We sat ... And waited waited waited for someone to acknowledge us and finally our server says he&#39;ll be right there 10 minutes later he comes over and we order because were starved . Now it&#39;s 10 more minutes until we see some water and our beers that we ordered. No management presence at all someone should help this  guy ( actually maybe train him that would work) ! There are a lot of people walking around but they don&#39;t seem to be doing anything
. Finally a hostess is helping him out buy bringing drinks to the tables . Actually it was the hostess fault in the first place You don&#39;t triple seat a server it doesn&#39;t work 
Meanwhile the floor is filthy dirty old French fries and an empty sugar packet is my view next to me
So finally another hostess brings our beers I has little sumption and Jim had the Pils both by Lagunitas  And then we get our salads both side salads with Italian quite good crisp lettuce tomatoes and cukes. So next up thin crust cheese sausage mushroom onion black olive.
First bit really crunchy crust which I love. The ingredients are generous and I see fresh mushrooms which is sort of a pet peeve to me I mean rly why would you use canned mushrooms?? But there&#39;s are fresh the sauce has a shuttle sweetness with a little acidity. Sausage I would of liked to see a little more fennel flavor but it was good. Cheese   Creamy and a bit salty . I like a lite more gooeyness to the cheese.
But all in all a pretty good pizza. Even with the mayhem when we first sat I would def still come back. Oh and if by chance anyone from the management team reads this you should train your servers not to spray the cleaner on a table right next to one that is seated especially if I&#39;m still eating I really don&#39;t want to taste cleaner with my pizza"

The servers were nice and the pizza is good.  Grabbed a spinach deep dish and a Papa Georgio thin crust pizza which were awesome.  The Papa Georgio is a meat lovers pizza and when it comes right out of the oven it is phenomenal. I&#39;m not usually a fan of deep dish pizza, but I enjoy eating their deep dish.  Prices for the menu was a bit high, but its probably one of the better if not the best pizza joint in the area if you can&#39;t make a run to Chicago all the time.

If you&#39;re on the 50/50 border of whether to try this place out, I think its worth a shot.  Everyone has their own preference on pizza toppings/crust/style, so just try it!"

But the real reason to come is for the pizza and Holy Cow was it delicious!

She&#39;s been one of my servers before, but she always delivers an incredible experience. This time, my friend had a BAD work day. The critical start of the meal was going to be that first beer. He struggled between ordering one he knew and a new one he wanted to try. She seemed hesitant about the &#34;test&#34; one, so she asked if she could bring a sample. She did, and after a sip or two, we found she was right. Tonight was a time for the tried and true brand - purely survival.

Dinner was simple though. We ordered the artichoke dip and thin crust sausage pizza. The dip was the perfect balance to snack upon while discussing the day&#39;s events, and the pizza was 90% great. The flavor - perfect. The past few times I&#39;ve had the thin crust there, the edges were burned some. I worked around it, but I still think the restaurant is wonderful and not as busy/chaotic as Cooper&#39;s Hawk (which I also enjoy) nearby. Ask for Stephanie...and you won&#39;t be disappointed all night. She let&#39;s you enjoy your meal and isn&#39;t pushing you out the door.

I was so caught off guard by his awesome question I looked at my hubby like, omg! What do we say??!??! lol.  Im sorry but to me I just think that is just so cool to ask...maybe its a standard thing in restaurants, but as much as we have gone out to eat with our baby, no one has ever asked that.

Anywho, this place has a nice set up with plenty of seating!  Their staff is amazing and extremely attentive and courteous!  They have a great and extensive (but not overwhelming) drink menu with good pricing (beer ranging $4-7 and mixed/martinis in the $8 range). ..not to shabby eh!?!

Their pizza is delicious!  The hubby and I ordered a thin crust 14inch pizza half cheese half pepperoni and it was so good!  We had about 5 squares each to take home.  We have also been obsessed with that cookie and ice cream dessert at restaurants so we ordered that too...yum...enough said.

Our bill was $47 for 3 beers, 14 inch pizza and dessert.  They have a rewards club that is free to join.  Once you get 300 points you get $20 added to your card! Its free...so why not join!?!?

Its in the South Barrington Arboretum, so it can get busy over there, but otherwise there is plenty of parking.  Its near the movie theater FYI. :)"

They don&#39;t take reservations, but they will put you on their wait list if you call ahead of time.  I usually call half an hour before getting there and then only have to wait five minutes at most.

Love the large comfy booths here.  Plenty of flat screens for game watching. Watched Joaquin Noah break his ankle against the 76ers last night.  Over and over and over again.  Ouch.

Thin crust 10&#34; small ($13.49) for specialty pizzas. Crust was amazing. Wafer thin.  Oh so crunchy. We ordered the Papa Georgio crispy peperoni and bacon, sausage, onion and were not disappointed. Also tried their dough nuggets ($6.99) fried pizza dough in a Parmesan garlic butter sauce serves with a side of their homemade marinara sauce.  Too garlicky. Pepsi products-boo.

On our second visit, we tried their deep dish pizza.  Took about 30 minutes to cook.  Not bad.  Small specialty spinach &amp; cheese deep dish ($17.49) 6 slices. Strong garlic flavor.  A little too cheesy for me.  Crust could have used more flavor, a little dry.  Took half of it home.  Think we&#39;ll stick with thin crust from now on.

A HUGE plus....you can order a bloody Mary here for dinner.  It comes served in a pint glass with salt &amp; pepper rim (my favorite). Hearty garnish of black olive slices, giardinero pepper, Swiss cheese, pepperoni, salami, and celery. Asked for olives &amp; they added two big green olives. All for $5.

Service was friendly but not always attentive on our first visit.  Our glasses sat empty a while until we could track down our server and we waited about 10 minutes for our credit card to be run.  Their saving grace was when one of the hostesses ran out after us in 19 degree weather to remind us that we had forgotten our leftovers.  Service was much improved on our second visit."

We booked a private room at Georgio&#39;s for our rehearsal dinner last month, and there really aren&#39;t enough good things I can say about the staff here (Oh yeah, and the food is really good too!).  Even though things were a little fuzzy for me at nights end, I can&#39;t think of one thing that wasn&#39;t perfect. 

We had a party of about 50 people for the event, and we got a pizza package with a customized drink menu of various wines and beers.  Dominique was our coordinator for the event and she was awesome to deal with.  She was readily available by email for the months leading up to the event, and was very accomodating with any requests we had, such as special entrees for vegans (I&#39;m not one don&#39;t judge me!!!), and setting up a projector for slideshows and videos.  She even sent us thank you cards after the event, which was really cool.

On the day of the event she was around to coordinate the buffet style setup and prepped the rest of the staff on our package details.  I have to give a shout out to the service staff that night, they kept the drinks coming fast, and we were a big drinking group. Even towards the end when we were all hammered and trying to get up to our minimum with shots, they were patient and quick with the tray. 

As far as the food goes, unless you are a complete pizza snob who can&#39;t find it in your &#34;born on the south side, raised on da bears, chi-town or die!&#34; heart to give props to a suburb deep dish joint, you will absolutely enjoy it.  Everyone in our party loved the pizza, and we even had a frozen one we took to go and reheated it last week and it was still awesome.  I haven&#39;t tried anything else there, but I&#39;d imagine you would be satisfied with whatever you order. 

Best part of the night is we signed up for a rewards card the night of the event, and with the money we spent for the party, we now have an extra $100 to spend there.  See you soon!"

Growing up in the small town of McHenry, for dinner we would go to Crystal Lake since there was more options and in that town was the amazing Georgios.  It was actually one of our first dates and we had always missed it since moving to the Burg.  So one day we are in South Barrington and see the Georgios sign... now can that be, the same awesome Chicago style pizza from Crystal Lake?!  We got home, pulled up the website and yes, oh yes, it was the same place and now its only minutes away.  I have no idea how we never noticed it before... but now its all we can think about.

Came here for an impromptu double date and started off with the dough nuggets--hello deliciousness!!  Totally flaky and fluffy all at the same time and the potion is HUGE.  All four of us just totally devoured it and patiently waited for our deep dish pizza, thank goodness they take a while cause we were getting full.

Once the pizza comes out its pipping hot and they serve you the first slice.  The crust is so buttery and I was all-too-happy to dip it in ranch or hot sauce.  I did wish, however, that their price for toppings wasn&#39;t so expensive.

Anywho, our waitress was a complete doll, always helping us out with food and/or drink suggestions.  Never pushy and came by the right amount of times to see how we were doing.  I really wish I remembered her name so I could giver her a shout out--our friend was a former waitress and she was equally as impressed."

Their spinach mix is nice and garlicy, and I always ask form them NOT to cut it because it has just the right amount of time to rest from baking until I cut into it.  Perfect buttery crust and if you have a jones for deep dish pizza out in the burbs, this one is hard to beat."

CPK, Lou Malnati&#39;s and other high-end eateries charge about $8-15 for their pizza servings, so I&#39;m not sure why I volunteered nearly $20 for a deep-dish of just cheese, pepperoni and too much salty-sauce with a mediocre crust.

You know how even crappy pizza is good pizza when you&#39;re hungry? (Think about that; it&#39;s true!)

Well, this pizza is fresh but kind of blah... expensive but not worth it.

The ambiance is like that of a hotel lobby and yet they call it &#39;Georgio&#39;s&#39; as if it&#39;s a boutique eatery with a unique Italian feel. It&#39;s not any of those.

The &#39;dough nugget&#39; appetizer sucked too. It&#39;s just pizza dough chopped into squares and deep-fried. The word &#39;nugget&#39; implies a chewy, doughy piece with crispy exterior; instead, it&#39;s $8.00 of air-filled dough skins.

I was just disappointed with this place. You know, you can spend $8 at Panera and get consistently delicious food. Heck, I can order the $10 Pizza Hut pizza in hand-tossed style and it&#39;s really awesome, ESPECIALLY for Pizza Hut.

So why did I feel like I fell for the First-Time Customer Fleecing at Georgio&#39;s? Live and learn."

We ordered for takeout 2 pizza&#39;s both where great. We got a Papa Georgio&#39;s and a White Pizza both thin crust. 

Cannot wait to go back and try the Deep Dish."

You can&#39;t go wrong with either thin or pan pizza, but the pan is my favorite (filling)! We live downtown and take the time to drive out to South Barrington as it beats any of the downtown staples for pizza. Owner always has fantastic beer selection and does a great job keeping this place in tip-top-shape!"

Love the spinach and cheese which is only available on the deep dish. I have tried much of anything else besides their pizza. Even thin crust is really good. Their garlic knots/dough nuggets are really good for appetizers. The wife and I usually split a small deep dish and a salad with some garlic nuggets. We have been here and have carried out many times.

This place caught the corner of my driving through here the week before and I wanted to try it out. Figured it couldn&#39;t be that bad seeing as the parking lot surrounding the place was packed and it looked pretty busy through their windows.

Walked in, not too sure of the dress code, and was pleasantly surprised to see my flip flops were not frowned upon here. 

Our lovely, and very attentive server, twisted my arm and talked us into the truffle fries app. It was VERY garlic-y. I love garlic, more than most, but it was garlic to the extreme. The amount of fries they serve you is a smingen too much for only 2 people and they don&#39;t really reheat, so it&#39;s best to try these bad boys when you are a party of 3 or 4.

I typically am not one to go out for pizza, but the deep dish looked really good and our server told us it was very popular. We ordered a sausage deep dish. It took quite a while to cook, as most deep dish pizzas do, so don&#39;t be in a hurry if you want to try this pie. Its cheesy and they do a layer of sausage on their deep dish. 

Between the two of us, we just about half of our pizza and the left overs reheated beautifully in the oven for dinner the next night. 

Their thin crust looked very good, as well and that will be on my list to try soon.

There are plenty of TV&#39;s to watch, its a very cleanly facility, and the service was superb. The manager knew when was a good time to stop by and check on the table and made it point to circulate throughout the entire room over the duration of our meal. 

They also have a very nice bar which is separated from the loud restaurant which I thought was a great idea on their part. 

I am looking forward to trying the sausage with vodka sauce on my next trip in; as I understand, it&#39;s very good.

I hope you make it a point to stop in next time you&#39;re in the S. Barrington area!!!"

I don&#39;t get it.  Had the dough nuts which were okay.  The sauce had a good flavor.  Also ordered a Cesar salad. I came out so over dressed it was not edible. It was literally like 3 dollops of mayo on a cup of lettuce. When I asked to have it less dressed, a new salad came back with no dressing. Umm...

We also had a couple of thin crust pizzas and a couple deep dish pizzas. I would compare the thin crust pizzas to a frozen pizza. It is even served with the cardboard round so you feel right at home. The deep dish pizza was decent. It seemed fresh and had good flavor.  I know there are better options for pizza in the burbs. Gas prices are low. Drive to better option a few miles away."

It was a chance encounter that I had dinner with friends and we went to Georgio&#39;s. I&#39;ve been going back ever since. It&#39;s totally worth the drive from Naperville.  

Let me say I LOVE the Second City thin crust pizza. It&#39;s like a barnyard on a plate. Ground sausage, bacon, pepperoni and ham... how can you go wrong? I love the deep dish pizza too. It just oozes the cheese and sauce and usually one slice is enough (they&#39;re huge!). Everything taste so fresh and it&#39;s great to watch your pie being made in the kitchen. 

Another plus: the appetizers. The wings are meaty and the cheese fries are packed with yummy cheesy bacony goodness. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the selections. 

Alcohol? Yes sir, they make a really good Hurricane which is kinda rare out in this part of the country. When I want a fruit flavored drink, I head here. 

The one downside is they don&#39;t really take reservations. That&#39;s never been a problem because we usually walk in and can get a table in under 15 minutes.

Great atmosphere. Plenty of parking. Good service. Comfortable seating. Delicious food. These are the reasons that I will be back very soon. 

We tried the cheese fries with bacon on our most recent visit. I am not a big cheese fan, but wanted to get something that my family would enjoy. Enjoy?  Yep...all three of us did. They were really good. The deep dish crust is very bakery bread-esque. It&#39;s good. I think I like it more than my hubby, but he didn&#39;t dislike it and he ate the leftovers without complaint so I think he&#39;s a fan. The thin crust is nice with just the right amount of crispiness and a good amount of toppings. Again, good stuff!  

My only real complaint is that the menu is somewhat limited. If you don&#39;t feel like pizza, the choices don&#39;t go too far beyond.  Thankfully, we really like the pizza."

We had two different servers as there was a large party in their private room but they both managed to keep up with everything and not get frazzled.  Since we knew we wanted to try a deep dish (40 min wait) and we had already waited a half hour for a table we were starving.  Dough nuggets &amp; a beer flight to the rescue!  We liked how you can choose the three different brews to sample for the flight as well.  

We had the Papa Georgio deep dish minus the bacon.  Their menu says their large pizza serves 3-4 people...I&#39;d say it would easily serve 6 guys, at least for deep dish.  I could only eat 1 slice and hubby had 2 so we had TONS of leftovers to bring home.  I&#39;ve heard others comment on their sauce being on the salty side.  I would agree it could use a tad less salt but it wasn&#39;t bad.  I was disappointed in the amount of toppings they put on our pizza.  When you are paying $2 per ingredient on a large pizza I&#39;d expect they wouldn&#39;t be as stingy - and I&#39;m not talking just the meat, even the veggies were scarce.  It&#39;s because of this I didn&#39;t give them 4 stars.  Since we&#39;ve only been here this one time I don&#39;t know if this is normal for them or not.  The taste overall was very good.  I still like my Lou&#39;s the best BUT I will say Georgio&#39;s deep dish crust is THE BEST crust I&#39;ve had.

**Minor update, not worth doing a formal update, but I&#39;ll just Edit my review to add:  We went to the Arboretum for the 2013 Burger Bash on Sept. 21st.  5 restaurants from the shopping center participated &amp; after sampling burgers from each you got to vote on your favorite burger.  Our group of 3 all agreed - Georgio&#39;s had the tastiest burger!  They had a flavorful &amp; juicy meat with a hint of sage, and a good buttery pretzel bun.  Ironic, since none of us would have ever thought of going to Georgio&#39;s for a burger.  (The other restaurants who competed were:  Mago (2nd place agreement by our threesome), Cooper&#39;s Hawk (3rd place agreement by our threesome), Pinstripes &amp; Ruth Chris (our group thought their burger was the worst!)."

Ever since I had Giordano&#39;s stuffed pizza for the first time last summer, I&#39;ve been constantly on the prowl for some delicious, oh-so-cheesy pizza. After discovering that South Barrington only had one Chicago-style pizza spot, I eagerly drove over and picked up a deep dish to share with a coworker. The pizza was warm, smelled so great as I drove it back to the office, had the potential to be delicious, but unfortunately was just okay. Maybe I was spoiled by my Chicago adventures, but Georgio&#39;s deep dish pizza just didn&#39;t seem to do it for me. The tomato sauce was bland and the crust was just okay. I&#39;m glad that it was around so I could get some deep dish pizza, but next time I&#39;ll probably head back towards Chicago."

Oh. My. Gosh, the deliciousness!!

Being on a pizza kick lately, I thought it was only necessary for my friends and I to order take out from Georgio&#39;s for our date.  Only two out of the six of us have ever had their pizza, and I can pretty much guarantee we will be back again and again!

We got the Papa Georgio Deep Dish Pizza, a cheese deep dish, and the gluten free with sausage.  BTW, mad props to Georgio&#39;s for making that a possibility for our gluten-free friends!

But that being said, I didn&#39;t try the gluten free pizza--there was no need since everything I could ever want/ask for/dream of for a pizza was sitting there right in front of me within the confines of the Papa georgio.  There wasn&#39;t an ingredient on that mound of deliciousness that wasn&#39;t fresh, hot, and amazing to my tastebuds.

I had a bit of the cheese deep dish, and although it was very delicious, nothing holds a candle to the Papa Georgio.  And I doubt anything from there ever will.  

But I am determined to try!!"

I have only tried deep dish pizza (spinach and mushrooms) which was really good however if you order deep dish be prepared to wait a little bit longer-around 40 minutes for it to be served. As Thin crust pizza also looked promising. We also had hot wings and they were fine nothing on the special side.

Get ready!! Get Set!  GO! :) 

-----

Georgio&#39;s Chicago Pizzeria &amp; Pub is a local family-owned pizzeria, which has their flagship in Crystal Lake.  It was so popular that they opened a NEW Georgio&#39;s Chicago Pizzeria &amp; Pub in South Barrington in the Arboretum.

I had seen this place open up not too long ago, and I have been meaning to try it.  I LOVE pizza, but since I&#39;ve went on a special diet since April(part of the reason of the lack of reviews since I mostly review restaurants) I had to wait until the right time to try it.

We first went to Georgio&#39;s in the mid-afternoon with the kids.  There were a few patrons in the dining area and a few in the bar.  We started off with two thin crust pizzas: a Papa Georgio (sausage, bacon, pepperoni, mushroom, onion, green pepper) and a plain cheese pizza for the kids.  We also ordered an appetizer of their Parmesan Truffle Fries.

I&#39;ll have to tell you those truffle fries are so awesome!  Crispy, truffly with just a hint of shaved parmesan on them.  Not a lot, just enough!  Talk about your carbgasm! YUM YUMMMM!   

As for the thin crust pizza....well....

O M G!  Lemme tell you...maybe it was because I hadn&#39;t had pizza in weeks/months?, BUT that was one of the crispiest, freshest pizzas I had had in a LOOOOOOONG TIME! 

Seriously! It was darn tasty! The crust was perfectly done, crispy like a cracker almost and the ingredients were FRESH, especially the veggies.   OH, and they do NOT skimp on the toppings. The sauce was not overdone at all!  Just enough to give you that light taste of tomato sauce.  

You are getting a LOT of toppings for a pretty darned good price! $14 for a 10&#34;(enough for 2 people) or $21 for a 14&#34;(enough for 4)  

The kids RAVED about the pizzas saying, &#34;It is the BEST pizza ever!&#34;  and I&#39;d have to agree....IT IS! YUMYUM!    

We&#39;ve been to Georgio&#39;s at least one more time after our initial visit and have not been let down!  

The interior is very modern and chic!  Not just some &#34;usual family pizzeria&#34;  Dark woods, leather-bound booths, and they have a good number of flatscreens.  They had them around the main dining area as well as a small semi-private room, which could be used for a private function.

It wasn&#39;t too loud in there, very family-friendly and had a good comfortable hip vibe to it.  The service was top notch, food came out quickly enough and the food quality was spot on!

We have not tried any of their desserts or their version of Chicago Deep Dish, but I think that is next on our agenda! :)

Oh, also, they have a Rewards Club, which is totally free.  For every $1 you spend at Georgio&#39;s you get 1 point.  Collect 300 points and you get a $20 gift card added to the Rewards Card.  The higher the points you get, the more rewards you get!  And you can use it not only on dining-in, but take-out as well!

If you are in the South Barrington area and are craving some REALLY good pizza....Georgio&#39;s is IT! :) GO, GO NOW....GO! :)"

The atmosphere of this place is great. When you walk in, to the right is the bar -- with great seating and great views of the game. To the left is the general seating area. The booths are large and comfortable, and no matter where you sit you can see the game on tv. 

We were greeted quickly by our server and got our drinks. I required a martini after being at the competition for the majority of the day, and the Flirtini was really good - though I did feel that the martinis were pretty weak.

Appetizers: I let my son pick and he opted for the dough bites. Dough fried, then rolled in olive oil, garic and oregano with marinara dipping sauce. Some of the bites were more doughy, and some crispy. They were really good. In fact, my son ate so many of them that he hardly ate any pizza.

Main Course: My daughter had the kids pizza, which came with a side (she picked fries) and a soda (total: $4.50) My son and I had a sausage and pepperoni thin crust, well done. This pizza had the crispiest, cracker thin crust. It was so good. Loved the pizza, sauce and everything. 

Dessert: Did not try. 

We will absolutely return. The price was reasonable and the food was great.  I&#39;d like to try the deep dish."

The crust has a cornmeal flavor to it, which I really like.  It&#39;s almost the same consistency as a graham cracker crust on a pie.  The sauce could use a hint more herbs/garlic, but I do like that they put some herbs in or on the cheese to make up for it.  I also really like their appetizers and french fries when I&#39;m not feeling like gorging myself with cheese and sauce.  :)  This is a great place for families for lunch or dinner.  The waiters and waitresses are attentive, and for some reason they&#39;re all good-looking.  Haha."

The service here is always great and the pizza is always made fresh and served piping hot. Geogio&#39;s is one of the best deep dish pizzas in the area. They load it up with cheese and have a nice light crust. Unlike other places the crust here doesn&#39;t feel like it sits in your stomach for days. The service here is also always great. They are good with refills and always friendly.The cheese stix here are also very good. They have a slight hint of garlic which gives them a great flavor. The dinning room is inviting and has plenty of tvs around to catch up on the games. Over all Georgio&#39;s is one of the best Pizza places in the area.

My mother was in town from Phoenix and figured I would take her out for some authentic deep dish. It was a toss up between Lou&#39;s and Georgio&#39;s. I figured since we were closer to the Barrington location we would give it a shot.
The service was great and the pizza came out scolding hot within 30 minutes. It was absolutely perfect. Probably the best deep dish I&#39;ve had. Very impressed with this restaurant today and looking forward to retuning again in the future."

Time of my visit: Lunch

I have been to this place before, when I was working for a different company and since I got a new job closer to it again, I have decided to re-visit.

In the past I have eaten gyros and hot dogs there, but today I have decided to try their combo.  I must say I was not disappointed.  It was good!  The amount of beef that came on the sandwich was good and the sausage was nicely grilled.  Beef was moist and soft, easy to bite into!  A solid A!

Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood!  Next time I might try their breakfast egg sandwich people are so raving about.

Service is really fast here and food is good! A!"

and nothing about wieners....

So, my friend has a business in the area not far from Lu &amp; Ton&#39;s.  He say&#39;s he stops at this place on most Saturdays to pick up egg sammies for his workers (very nice gesture I might add) and that his guys&#39; love em.  Now, I&#39;ve drove past this suspicious looking joint many times, as it&#39;s located in a heavy industrial area virtually across the street from UPS.  It&#39;s been here for a very, very long time...and I&#39;ve always wondered how this place is still in business, cause, well - it looks kinda lonely and has a not-so-good rap...

So, my friend keeps bragging about these sandwiches...he just never shuts up about it.  Then he proceeds to tell me how nice the woman behind the counter is, how great the beefs, gyros &amp; polishes are, and how they have all these different menu &amp; breakfast items.  I&#39;m thinkin, are you pullin my leg?  I was given a burger from here once, but didn&#39;t think much of it...So, &#34;how could this place be any good?  I thought only the local workers ate here purely out of convenience&#34;?..  He kept reassuring me, this was not the case...

So one morning, my friend stops over unexpectedly, white paper bag in hand and says:
&#34;I brought you an egg sandwich from Lu &amp; Ton&#39;s&#34;....(imagine my sudden fear and perplexed disposition at the thought of having to eat this, I was scared...really scared)  of course I appreciated the thought, but my friend will eat virtually anything - yes ANYTHING.  He even thinks BK&#39;s tacos are the BOMB (to give you an idea..)  yeah, I agree - ewwwwwww.

Knowing I had to face the music - or egg sammie in this case - I pulled from the bag a politely wrapped, monstrosity....upon unwrapping, I noticed thick Texas toast (nicely griddled), comprised of 2 THICK slices of ham, perfectly melted cheddar cheese and very attractive fried egg - a little sunny and oozy with the fluffiest egg whites I&#39;d ever seen - in fried form.  A perfect fried egg.

After one bite - to my utter and complete surprise, I was in egg sammie heaven...OMG...this was one of THE best egg sandwiches I have ever eaten!!! Definitely better than my own, and makes the Egg McMuffin look like a BK taco (well, not exactly, but you get the point).  I don&#39;t even usually order egg sammies....  This was super filling too.  I could only eat half (saved rest),  it was pretty hearty &amp; probably not very healthy, but WOW this was DAMN good!

I&#39;ve only had this once.  But the next time I crave this (not only will I ask my friend to grab it) - I will  opt out of the ham, &amp; get the bacon instead - if I&#39;m gonna splurge on fat, I might as well go all out...

And so now I know why Lu &amp; Ton&#39;s is a popular spot and has been around for so long.  They know how to make a delicious, one-of-a-kind, famous egg sammie (among other things I&#39;m told), have the friendliest workers, and all I can say is -   I&#39;m a lucky girl for having had a bite of famousness......

ps.  Never judge a book by it&#39;s cover

pss.  Never judge a friend who thinks BK tacos is the greatest invention since sliced bread, cause, sometimes, they&#39;re tastebuds are spot on....SOMETIMES....."

I got a pizza puff from them at the end of last year.
I was ok. I next day I was so sick to my stomach I had to leave work.
I had just started a job right by this place and was upset that I had to leave work.
Maybe people don&#39;t get their pizza puffs often and they were setting in there freezer for a long time.
I told myself I wouldn&#39;t  eat there, and a lot of my employees say they don&#39;t go there. A few time I got my lunch and with this place being so close.
I would go get a hotdog, with are okay as while. Well at least I didn&#39;t get sick. I seen a lot of people eating there burgers
So I got 1 of those before too. My stomach was upset but not as bad as before and I wasn&#39;t that good either.
I&#39;ll just stick to the hot dogs if I forget my lunch. There shakes and fries are a 5."

Anyway, stopped in here for some breakfast items this time because I happened to be driving by at the breakfast time period. This place has an off the beaten path location so I give it props for being able to stay in the restaurant business which is a tough biz to be in.
One other person eating in here during my visit. Ordered Biscuits and gravy and a Ham and Egg sandwich. Both were pretty good. Solid renditions at a decent price. Service was fast.
I shall return.

There are a few Vienna Beef umbrellas just outside the door and a handful of parking spots. Initially when trying to locate this eatery I had thought my GPS was deceiving me as this place is in a seemingly unlikely location for a hot dog stand. 

In walking in I decided to try a hot dog and fries. I placed my order and in no time at all was on my way. The hot dog I purchased came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. The bun was soft but had slight dryness on the bottom. There was a huge pickle spear sealing the contents of the hot dog in, directly behind the huge pickle spear were two very large tomato chunks followed by onions, relish and mustard. I didn&#39;t detect any celery salt on the hot dog. The frank itself was skinless, well heated and fairly tasty. The application of the mustard, relish and onions was fine. However the pickle taste overpowered the rest of the hot dog flavor. 

The fries were of the crinkle cut variety. They were crispy on the outside and a bit saltier than most, overall they weren&#39;t bad and were a nice compliment to the hot dog. Overall Lu and Ton&#39;s Wieners is a solid hot dog place. I&#39;d say it ranks within the realm of average, meaning if you happen to be in the area it&#39;s worth stopping for a quick bite. However, it&#39;s not worth going out of the way to visit. Three stars."

I can&#39;t believe I was missing out on it for all these years! I&#39;ve already been back twice because I now crave it which is crazy because normally I am a dog and burger guy.

Just driving by one day and wondering what kinds of people could be found having after work drinks here at McKenna&#39;s.  Being that it was about dinner time, I and another Yelper, stopped for dinner and drinks.
Many of the dishes are priced $6-$20.  Most appetizers and sandwiches are under $10.  Entrees like steak, pork chops or ribs are about $14-$20.  Ordered the pork chops and a chicken pasta Alfredo.  Both entrees came with soup or salad, bread sticks, additional bread and butter.  Also veggie options like, mixed veggies and garlic mashed potatoes.  I opted for garlic mash, they were yum.  I&#39;m guessing they make it fresh, only because almost the entire helping was whipped smooth, but towards the ends there were some lumps.  Pork chops were served with some kind of brown colored wine gravy.  It was good.  I scarfed down every last bit of it.  Meat cooked just right.  The Alfredo was just, eh.  &#34;Take it or leave it&#34;  
Sat at the bar.  Most of the other people were elderly.  I&#39;m guessing there was maybe a singles 50+ thing or Ben Gay party.  (Just kidding)  Most would&#39;ve been staying at the hotel. 
They had a daily draft special, bottles are $4 or get an 18 oz goblet of draft for the same price."

Had salmon and mashed potatoes- the salmon was way over cooked and rubbery while the potatoes, served in a ball on the plate, were cold in the middle. Told the waitress that the potatoes were cold, and she said &#34;yeah&#34; and walked away. Either that&#39;s how they are always served or she just did not care.

The bartender was ignorant and actually argued with me when I asked what was in my drink. 

My fiancé and I stayed at Holiday Inn for a birthday party two weeks ago, the manager at the front was such a disaster that he comped us a $30 voucher for this restaurant (it&#39;s attached to the hotel) I was not too happy to be returning, but it was free, so I didn&#39;t complain.

Walking in, the first thing I noticed was that it was the same awful bartender from before. She must be the night time bartender. Our party was sitting by the bar, so we joined them. We asked for menus &amp; she asked us whether we wanted drink menus or food menus, we asked for both. She then informed us that the restaurant didn&#39;t have drink menus.... Then why would she offer them? 

I ordered the chicken quesadilla, which arrived without chicken. It was soggy &amp; had too many onions in it. (The bartender admitted to forgetting to add chicken to my order for the kitchen) My fiancé ordered the chicken fingers, those were alright. Compared to what everyone else ordered the chicken fingers looked like the safest bet. 

The bartender really needs to take some mixology classes, and an attitude adjustment wouldn&#39;t hurt either. Being more personable would make people want to stay longer, not get their drinks and run."

I ordered the Imperial Chicken for the reviews everyone gave it.  Most of the people who ordered this seemed to have liked it and it wasn&#39;t so bad.  It was just a little bit on the salty side and would have been much better with white rice instead of the fried rice.  The fried rice was okay too.  As for the Spring Roll, it had the right amount of crunch when biting in to it and tastes best with the sweet and sour sauce.

My boss ordered Chicken with Peapod and Water Chestnut which was pleasant to the pallet, not to salty and not bland either .  As for my co-workers, one ordered the Shrimp with Lobster sauce.  The Lobster sauce was not lobster sauce, the ingredients mentioned was &#34;Shrimp stir-fried with fine-cut pork in a black bean garlic sauce with egg white and yolk.&#34;  Where&#39;s the lobster in the sauce?  Shouldn&#39;t say Shrimp with black bean garlic sauce?  This one is very misleading.  Another order was the Sweet and Sour Chicken - I was not able to taste this one.

For my boyfriend, I ordered him Beef and Broccoli.  He barely touched it and ended up just eating cereal.  He&#39;s not really a fan of Asian food and feels that they all taste the same..  It&#39;s too bad because there are a lot of Asian Restaurants that can change his mind.  But, because he&#39;s had so many bad experiences, he just doesn&#39;t care for it.  In this case, I understood why he did not touch his lunch at all.  The Beef and Broccoli was just not cooked correctly.  There was an after taste to this and it also looked like it was cooked the day before, just reheated and packaged.  I am not saying this is the case, this is just an opinion of what the food tasted like and an observation.

I would give five stars but only because the customer service and the people who took my order, and helped me when I picked up the food were awesome.  Unfortunately, to me the food I ate did not reflect anymore than three stars that I had given because the overall taste of the food was just okay.  Like they say, you get what you pay for.  The cost for Lunch Special is no more than $6.75 plus tax.  If we paid for the normal price and not a special price, then maybe it would have tasted better?  I&#39;m sure this is just one day of okay review.  Possibly if I was to eat again in the restaurant and order other items that were not in the Lunch Special, I probably would have a different review.  But, we&#39;ll see when that time comes."

My main reason for doing so was because my local favorite is closed on Mondays. I remembered eating here once before and I enjoyed the food but never made it back. 

I called to place a take out order by phone. What is neat is you have the option to place an order online and this month they are offering 10% off online orders. Once I realized you need to insert card information, I decided to call in. I would rather pay cash for $7 worth of rice. 

The small rice is a nice size for one person. It is full of various meats (shrimp. chicken and bbq pork). It has green onions, eggs and bean sprouts. I enjoyed it and will definitely keep this place in mind as a nearby back up."

Tofu and Veggie--pretty good.  Nice sauce, fresh veggies. 
BBQ Pork Fried Rice--Excellent. Not greasy, great flavor, every bite had a bit of BBQ pork.
Orange Beef--we ordered medium spicy and it was just ok. The sauce was kind of gloopy and bland. And even though we wanted medium spice, it was pretty mild. 
Egg Rolls--not good at all. Even though the wrapper was nice and crispy, the filling was pretty mushy.
The famous potstickers?  Just OK, the filling was good, but there was just too much dough. 
Crab Rangoon--Delicious. Probably the best ones I&#39;ve had in the Western Burbs."

Having been to china a few times I would call this place a bad interpretation of what Chinese food should be (Panda express being the worst). If Chinese-American food is what you&#39;re looking for than this place is decent. Over the years I&#39;ve had the:

Dry Beef Chow Fun: Large portions even when you order the small. Lots of beef and vegetables with chow fun cooked very well. This is my go to dish when I need a quick bite. 

Pot stickers: Big, thick skinned. Pretty standard generic pot stickers.

Hot and Sour Soup: Also very generic starch laden soup. 

Fish Filet in Garlic black bean sauce: Probably the only actual fish item on the menu outside of shrimp and scallops. A small order gets you about 60%vegetables and sauce with only 40% fish pieces. I only got like 5 small pieces of fish in my order.  Probably not ordering this again. 

Deliveries usually take a while (Average 40-50 minutes) for me but pick up is ready in 15-20 which I usually go for. Being actually chinese I admit I am overly biased towards these so called &#34;Chinese&#34; restaurants but I also understand they cater to Chinese-American tastes so I&#39;m not gonna hate.

This is our third time eating here. We ordered the pot stickers for an appetizer, and boy, I really wish every Chinese restaurant would decide to pan-fry them instead of steaming. Pan-fried, they&#39;re a bit crispy on the sides, and taste much better. They&#39;re served with a fermented fish sauce and red chili sauce -- use both, although if you&#39;re sensitive to hot foods, the red chili sauce can get very hot.

Just for kicks, I ordered a Silver Shrimp and Scallop from the house specialties menu. Theoretically, this dish shouldn&#39;t work - it&#39;s shrimp and scallops, breaded, then pan-fried, then drenched in a sweet cream (?) sauce, with sesame seeds and steamed broccoli. 

Despite questioning the wisdom of covering fried breading with white sauce, this was fantastic--the scallops and shrimp were cooked just right (not rubbery), and the sweetness of the cream sauce wasn&#39;t distracting.

My wife ordered the Empress Chicken, which features fried, breaded chicken, green peppers and carrots covered with a sweet BBQ sauce and sesame seeds. This was also made perfectly.

Is this authentic Chinese food? Probably not. But it&#39;s the best place to find Chinese food if you don&#39;t intend to drive into Chinatown itself--and from my experience, Silver Lake now beats, hands down, some of those popular restaurants in that neighborhood."

The empress chicken, crab rangoon, egg drop soup, sesame chicken, and silver scallop and shrimp (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called...I forgot) are all great. Items that don&#39;t have a thick sauce to them tend to be somewhat bland, but I&#39;d rather have that than something loaded with MSG.

And that&#39;s how you judge the caliber of the restaurant based on that one dish.  For some, its pad thai...for others, mac &amp; cheese.  

For me, I judge a Chinese restaurant mainly on their potstickers because I am a potsticker fanatic.  (Btw does anyone else get irked when a restaurants list gyoza as potstickers when they are clearly different??)  

And no matter how many Chinese places I go to in Chicago, there isn&#39;t one place that competes with Silver Lake in that category (and believe me, I&#39;ve been looking...who wants to go all the way to Roselle for potstickers if you&#39;re in the South Loop?).  

So yes, best potstickers ever!  They&#39;re filled with delicious pork and are HUGE.  I believe those are the biggest ones I&#39;ve seen and each bite is so good...especially with the soy sauce/chili sauce combo.  I could just eat those and be content.

However, another great dish to note is their general tso&#39;s chicken and this may also be in the best category.  It&#39;s done really well here where the sauce is very flavorful and the chicken is nice and crispy.  I got my previous boyfriend obsessed with this dish and so I would have a companion who was willing to make the drive to Silver Lake so he could get his chicken and I could get my yummy potstickers.

#2 The General Tso&#39;s: Not too spicy, sauce was excellent, good sized chicken pieces. 

Tried the fried rice, chicken lo mein, and the pot stickers. Now I&#39;m not a pot sticker man myself, but the previous reviews led me to trying them. I&#39;ll be hot damned if I wasn&#39;t converted by how good they were.

What I DON&#39;T like is that the manager is incredibly rude. I have given this place quite a bit of business just the past year because of how often I order, and when out of all of the times I ordered I made a complaint twice. Each time I did, the manager was just a hands down jerk and instead of apologizing for the quality of the food for those instances, he ARGUED with me and tried to tell me that I had made the mistake and he would suggest that I order something else. Really? To yell at a customer who had issues over the phone and try to make me feel stupid that something I had ordered hundreds of times was my fault that that one time they effed it? No apology, no kindness, just a literal argument. That is not good business. 

Food is one thing but poor service and outright rudeness is unacceptable. 

Also, they recently changed the menu and increased the prices. The crab rangoon also now comes in four instead of five. They are small to begin with. Also the spice levels on the dishes always does vary, the extra spicy was always not too spicy and then all of the sudden the last time we ordered it extra spicy it was almost too much to even taste anything."

We have never dined in, so my review is based on take out only.  We always get General Tso&#39;s Chicken and egg rolls.  I don&#39;t know what they use for their chicken, but it lately it seems to be some gross chewy mush mixed with a little bit of chicken.  I don&#39;t expect any cheap, Chinese take out to be the highest quality of chicken, but I do expect it to be edible, not requiring me to spit half of it out because I can&#39;t chew it.  It is unfortunate that their chicken is such poor quality, as I do think their General Tso sauce is one of the better tasting ones I&#39;ve had.  Now to their egg rolls... awful, hands down the worst egg rolls I have ever had.  They are too mushy and all you can taste is peanut butter.  Maybe some people like the overpowering peanut butter taste in their egg rolls, but I do not.  

Do yourself a favor and spend your money on Chinese take out elsewhere - there are plenty of other good, edible, places in the area."

My favorites are pot stickers and any of the chicken dinner choices. The chicken fried rice is sometimes too oily. I wish it weren&#39;t so oily and had more variety of vegetables. 

Lately I&#39;ve noticed the egg rolls are over cooked and not very tasty. Perhaps they have changed the supplier of the ingredients because they used to be crisp and flavorful.

Portillo&#39;s  meatless sandwich options are either the halibut fillet sandwich or a tuna sandwich.  My family members  and I went with the halibut fillet sandwiches.  So fresh and delicious!  Always love the crunch of fish fillet sandwiches.  

For sides we kept it simple and went with fries.  Great crinkle cut fries.  Perfectly done.  Nice crunch as well.

This was my first visit to the famous Portillo&#39;s.  Definitely  will not be my last.  I am looking forward to bringing my family members from California  to have check out the famous hot dogs and beef sandwiches.  Although, I can&#39;t have beef sandwiches  or hot dogs here, I am confident  my family will enjoy them.  I understand  this was one of many locations.  

My mom observed  the 50s  diner style decor and it somehow took her back to her time in Graceland in Tennessee.  Portillo&#39;s  is a charming place to casually dine and will not break the bank doing so."

I only get the fish sandwich with fries and sometimes onion rings. It&#39;s always good!! My friends love their pasta and dessert options! 

When it looks busy, expect to wait a little bit more at this location  . You order at the register and then walk over to a counter where the workers call out your number when your food is ready. If you got a group of 6+, expect some people to get their food later then others.

Note: You can request to get fresh fries at the waiting counter. So instead of giving you the ones that may have been sitting their for a while, they&#39;ll wait for the next batch to come out and give that one to you!"

Just perfect with a Big Beef or Cheddar Croissant.

If you&#39;re a cheddar fan, go with the latter. But get the sweet either way. Go for an extra side of sweet while you&#39;re at it. And fries. Shake? Nah, go malt!

The fries here are always awesome &amp; the cheese fries are even better.  The hot dogs here are good as well &amp; the poppy seed bun makes the hot dog that much better.  In recent years the prices have gone up a lot but for food that is really good it is worth it.

What don&#39;t they do perfectly?  Seriously?  They can process thousands of people (it seems), in minutes, faster than Dakau, ok bad analogy...but you get the idea.

Their food is, for fast food, spectacular.  I always get the combo, Italian beef and Italian sausage nestled together on a bun in a way that Italians use as visual aids to teach their kids about sex. Add mozzarella and some peppers and you have the perfect sandwich.  No need for anything else except soda.  Although their crinkle fries are great, just substitute that for some much needed Maalox for later.  It is really incredibly good!  You&#39;ll want a &#34;George Costanza&#34; desk under which to sleep the rest of your work afternoon, or do what I do and make up a sales call and go home early to sleep it off, then hit the gym!

Their Oriental salads are decent. I only caution that their won-tons are really a bit stale, but no matter a decent salad. 

Their chocolate cake is really exquisite and quite a value, $20 for a whole cake!  It&#39;s moist with very &#34;fudgey&#34; frosting distributed over 2 layers.  Just marvelous!

Greasy filling food that we should not be putting in our bodies. But damned if I didn&#39;t go three times on a recent business trip.

Had the Combo Beef &amp; Sausage every time so I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t give you more variety. The Cheese Fries (Fries with a side of Cheese) were awesome, hot and tasty.

The Combo was Greasy with a sausage that snaps when you bite into it and the beef steak to round it out. Topped with Sweet and Hot peppers you can&#39;t go wrong.

The soda&#39;s machines were pumping out good product and the ladies taking our orders were friendly and smiling.

Will stop again when in/around Chicago."

I honestly cannot think of anything menu items here that I don&#39;t like.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever ordered anything that I haven&#39;t loved. Here&#39;s some more detail.

Just hearing the word Portillo&#39;s (or as my friends and I affectionately call it &#34;Por-dillos&#34;) makes me hungry. Everything they do is good, and the mojo is off the charts. I&#39;ve ordered just about everything, but to me, their stand out items are their hot dogs, beef, cheese fries &amp; chocolate cake shake. I&#39;ve even ordered salad here and been pleasantly surprised.

Bottom line, I love Portillos. It has such a cool vibe, and there&#39;s nothing about any of the locations I would change. I read a review from another Yelper saying this was one of the worst locations. I would have to disagree. I think one thing Portillo&#39;s has got going for themselves is consistency.

Chicken was cooked well with very little fat. Toppings were fresh and tasted just right. And their fries and root beer are awesome.

A few things that have always irked me about Portillo&#39;s...why are we still using styrofoam cups (nevermind the price and lack of refill)?

So I&#39;d hate to rate it so low, but for the quality and the price... it&#39;s just not worth the price.  The lettuce was not very crisp either.

The service is kind of mediocre (they&#39;ve goofed many of my orders over the years) and on occasion, their chopped salads are not of high quality like other Portillo&#39;s eateries.

For example, the chopped salad I bought was kind of soggy; not very crisp and the lettuce a bit &#39;blah&#39; in the mouth. I called them and they said to come in for a freebie whenever I had time (points for not making me come in with the same salad). However, I came in and the manager kind of interogated me and said that their salads are ALWAYS fresh. I&#39;m like, it was soft, not crisp and the moisture content was too high, as if they didn&#39;t really dry the lettuce after washing it or whatever.

My internal thought: &#39;Manager lady, just wish me a nice day, admit fault and let me get on with my day... don&#39;t pass the blame.&#39;

My hamburgers have been incorrect and my orders were missing things I only realized once I was miles away, but why describe in detail more than one event? They just need to get their act together a bit there."

After meeting my boyfriend (who&#39;s from Illinois), he told me that Portillo&#39;s was one place I &#34;have to experience&#34;.  Not knowing what this place was and with only tid bits of information provided, I had summarize this place to be another &#34;fast food&#34; joint.

I&#39;m not particularly fond with the fast food markets of McDonald;s, Burger King, Wendy&#39;s Culvers, etc.  It all just seems to taste like &#34;cafeteria&#34; food; you get the same meat, toppings, drink only difference is the type of bun(s).

Portillo&#39;s was a whole other story.  I had the Bacon Cheeseburger here and could not be any happier.  The bacon was not too crispy and didn&#39;t hold all of that oil that bacon usually absorbs.  The meat was charbroiled so it had the taste that was unusual yet satisfying. The topping: lettuce, tomato, and slice of cheese was fresh and blended perfectly together.  I&#39;m picky with the lettuce and tomato as I am highly disappointed to see a tomato dry or lettuce wilting on the side of my bun.  The burger was fulfilling and a great lunch or dinner choice.  I also had my share of the cheese fries. Oh how I low fries in general.  I must say that my first choice of style are crinkle fries and that is exactly what Portillo&#39;s delivers.  They were made just right in being that they were not too soggy and not too crispy.  The steaming cheese that is served on the side just tops everything off. Delish...

The decor of the restaurant was very 50&#39;s-60&#39;s.  You have juke boxes, neon lights, and vintage images on the walls.  You walk in and it works like any other &#34;fast food&#34; places. You walk up to place an order and step aside to grab your meal when it is announced.  The staff is VERY diligent and FAST.  This place is known to take business partners/friends for a quick and delicious lunch.

After my visit here (for a company lunch) I have been back plenty of times for the fast and tasty meal."

This was my first stop before heading first class to Delhi internation airport. My business partner being from Chicago told me portillos was a must if i had a long enough layover.. Well my 6 hour layover left me plenty of time to hop in cab and get to the nearest portillos.

I had a chicago style hot dog, hot beef sandwhich with sweet and hot peppers, fries, piece of chocolate cake, and a soda.

The hot god no doubt was the best ive ever head especially when the peperoncini&#39;s exploded in my mouth. MMMMMM booya

the hot beef sandwhich was sooooo good as well. I probably couldve eatin a second one but had to save room the cake. The cake was good too which put me over the top for sure.

Enjoyed the atmosphere and scenery in the building, a lot of old fashoned signs and what not. 

It costed me 60 dollars in cab rides to get to Portillos and back to the airport for my next flight. Well worth it seeing as how i was reimbursed by work.

The feel of this place and the type of restaurant that it reminds me of is a McDonalds but with Italian beef sandwiches; the food is made quickly with a lack of quality. The only reason I gave this a three-star is only because I have not tried very many options in Chicago to really understand what a true Italian beef sandwich is, but I&#39;m almost 100% sure that this is not what it should taste like.

Time of my visit: Around opening

I wanted to try this place based on all Yelp! recommendations and it did not disappoint!

I am from former Soviet Union and I still have extensive family living in the region, so I go back very frequently.  A lot of times I miss the cooking, so after reading all the reviews, I figured I would give it a shot.  I thought what&#39;s the worst that can happen?!

I got their just after they opened and there were 3 people in front of me already.  All three customers were Ukrainians, which is a good sign in my book!  I bought 2 dozen potato pierogis and 6 cabbage rolls.  I got home and figured I&#39;d have so for lunch.  Let me tell you at first bite, it brought back the memories of my delicious grandma cooking!  Both the pierogi and cabbage rolls were delicious!  Very authentic!  You&#39;ve got a new customer! A+

On a side note, I was informed you can could call a head for pick up, anytime after 12pm on Friday and they would put it aside for you.  They are only open on Saturdays between 8am and 2pm.

A+!"

I spent a large chunk of my college years trekking through the Balkans, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all the way to Poland and Ukraine. In some countries I had a better grasp of the languages than in others, but every single place spoke my language loud and clear. I&#39;m not talking English - I&#39;m talking ethnic cuisine, particularly carbs and meat. Furthermore, the culinary art of combining the two.

Pierogi are my weakness (Please note that they are spelled pierogi and not pierogis with an S. Pierogi is already plural. Don&#39;t make me pull out my red grading pen!). I was eating them almost daily when I was in Poland and Ukraine. They are a staple there and I never found a bad one. My favorite are filled with meat, but I also like potato and cheese when done properly. I even continued to eat them here in the US because Chicago has such a huge population of Eastern Europeans that you can pretty much pick up a rock, chuck it in any direction and you&#39;re likely to hit a store that sells this food (but I don&#39;t encourage vandalizing). I have found it&#39;s a little harder to locate these shops in the suburbs, but it&#39;s not completely hopeless.

A couple friends raved about the St. Andrew Ukrainian Kitchen and I live relatively close to the Orthodox Church. I pass it a couple times a week and always marvel at how beautiful it is. I had no idea that they also prepared and sold food, so I did a little research -  Everything is prepared by the St. Sophia Sisterhood and the St. Andrew Brotherhood. Food is sold out of the Kitchen (the common building to the right when you enter the grounds) on Saturdays from 8am until 2pm, but you will want to arrive early or pre-order to guarantee you get what you want. I arrived around 11am and nabbed the last 8 pastries.

Their menu isn&#39;t huge, but there is a decent assortment and it makes ordering very simple. They offer 1 Dozen Pierogi/Varenyky/Pelmeni in Potato, Cheese or Sauerkraut for $5. You can also order 2 Kielbasa links for $8 or Stuffed Cabbage Rolls/Holubtsi/vGolabki/Golubtsy/Sarma for $2. Kolachky are 50c each and come in different flavors (Cherry is quite good). They also make fresh White Bread and Rye Bread and sell Honey from a farm. There are specialty items (Smoked Bacon, European-style cakes, etc) on sale for holiday events.

I spent about 15-20 minutes standing in line, placing my order and patiently waiting for my Styrofoam take-out containers of goodness (I hear lines can be out the door in nicer weather). Everything was hot enough to eat as soon as I got it, but I stopped at the local Jewel-Osco to get Sour Cream for the Pierogi (Do this!). By the time I got home the food was still pretty warm, but I placed it in the microwave for a couple minutes and it was good to go. It blew my mind! If &#34;The Old Country&#34; had a taste then this would be it, and I was able to feed 3 people for $20. This is the real deal, so you HAVE to stop in on a Saturday and see what&#39;s cookin&#39;.

I ordered a dozen cheese pierogi and some kolachky, while Wolf R. requested sausages. It was past noon and they were out of sausages--they suggested we call ahead to preorder next time. The amazingly sweet lady behind the counter didn&#39;t want Wolf to go empty-handed, however, so she brought out a half-dozen potato pierogi for him for free! Amazing!

They have Kolachky, polish sausage and cabbage rolls. For full descriptive details see Ericka A&#39;s review....Oh yea. You can call your order ahead or wait about 10 minutes in line. Worth it though.

The cabbage rolls are big, fat and stuffed with the most delicious rice and meat mixture, topped with a delicately yummy tomato sauce.  The cost is minimal for the labor and love that goes into making these.  They are packed tight with a lot of the filling and look elegant in presentation.  I would be proud to bring these to a pot luck.  

The pierogi are out of this world as are the cookies.

The staff are very warm and nice people.

We bring our own container, a big Rubber Maid plastic cake pan with lid other wise they will gladly put your yummies into a Styrofoam container.   

Get there early, we were there last weekend at ten and we were told, they were almost out.  We get about a dozen so I can freeze some for the work week and give some to our sons who live near by.

These taste home made, fresh and with quality ingredients.  

They are open only on Saturdays from 8 am to 2 pm.

If you decide to get a lot of Cabbage Rolls for either Easter or Christmas Dinner, you need to call two weeks in advance and place a order.   

If you want some home made comfort food, you can&#39;t go wrong here.  Whoever makes the food at St. Andrew&#39;s Kitchen,  really knows the art of fine cooking.

Lastly I believe this is carry out only, no dining in and they only accept cash.  Very reasonably priced."

What about my Mother in Law? Can St. Andrew meet the pierogi high bar set by my her?  I love her home made pierogi,  but she only makes them for Holidays or special occasions.  So you can imagine how that  weekly Saturday sign at St Andrew always beckons me to come by and order up some Pierogi to take home. 

The verdict?  St. Andrew&#39;s Pierogi rocks.  It&#39;s not as good as my MIL&#39;s, but it&#39;s still delicious.  As are the other goodies I purchased to bring home. 

Potato Pierogi, Cheese Pierogi.  Both very good.  they were a bit doughy for my personal taste, but still very good!  (tip from Ericka A--Stop for some sour cream before you get home! )

Smoked sausage--basically what I can get at one of the Eastern European delis around here, but it&#39;s nice to be able to pick them up while I&#39;m here. 

Stuffed Cabbage *whispers* I hope my MIL doesn&#39;t find out I&#39;m saying this, but these were delicious and honestly rivals her home made stuffed cabbage rolls.  I don&#39;t know what St. Andrew&#39;s kitchen did to them, but the cabbage didn&#39;t have a lot of bitter flavor and the stuffing was really really good. It could have used more tomato sauce, but still quite delicious. 

Best tip I&#39;ve gotten from the reviews (ahem Osi V) ?  Call your order in! I called in at 845 am (before my workout) and told them I&#39;d pick it up about 1015. While I was putting my change away, the gent behind me wanted to order some cabbage rolls but was told there were only 2 left! 1015 in the AM folks! They close at 2!"

There was also a sign on the door of the building directly across from the beautiful church building indicating where to enter for pierogies. Upon entering, there is a small counter displaying the short menu and pastries complete with an ATM in case you forgot to bring the only form of currency accepted here--cash.

We ordered a little bit of almost everything including, potato, cheese, and sauerkraut pierogies, cabbage rolls, and kielbasa. I wanted to dig right in but there isn&#39;t a place you can just sit down and do this so we took our wonderful smelling food home and picked up some sour cream on the way.

All the pierogies were fantastic and some of the best I&#39;ve had. I&#39;m far from a pierogie expert but I really enjoyed the fresh, delicate, chewy dough and flavorful fillings. This was the first time we&#39;ve ever had cabbage rolls and we enjoyed them although I was slightly reminded of that canned Chef Boyardee tomato sauce smell and taste on the rolls. After I grilled up the kielbasa on my grill just enough to get the casing a little crisp for that snap, we dug in and really enjoyed the fresh smokey flavors and were thrilled to find that the kielbasa was not overly salty like the store bought variety. 

It was a lot of food and it set me back $27 but it was more than enough for two meals between two hungry people. Quantity AND quality both being present, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back for more in the future."

OK, I kid I kid, only one of them is...Whichever one made the pierogi that I had is my Grandma and I love her cooking. 

After hearing about this mecca from Osiris V. and then reading the reviews of her Chrissy W. and Ericka A. I had to try these pierogi.  So one rainy Saturday afternoon, I loaded my baby in the car and headed out in search of pierogi divinity.  Didn&#39;t bring the rest of the family because I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to share these bad boys. 

After an hour drive, we arrived at the church, the smell of pierogi in the air, I unloaded the kid and sprinted for the entrance.  I ordered 

12 Sauerkraut 
12 Cheese
10 Kolacky Cookies 

Needless to say, most of this was gone by the time I made it home; I had wolfed down 12 Sauerkraut, 6 Cheese and 5 cookies.  By the time my husband made it home from his day out, the rest was gone too. 

So since my husband never saw any of the goods and now thinks this place is a myth, I have to take him back on my next trip.

We stopped in on a Saturday night and it was later in the evening so we only had a short 10-minute wait at the bar.  The menu is extensive and features traditional Asian food like classic kung pao or sesame dishes in addition to signature plates, noodles, appetizers, sushi and maki,  We had a calamari appetizer and two noodle dishes: wide rice noodles with chicken and spicy dragon noodles with chicken.  The appetizer and the drinks were just okay, but the noodle dishes were amazing.  The wide rice noodles were plentiful with lots of chicken and vegetables. The spicy dragon noodle were absolutely incredible with flavorful noodles in a spicy sauce with chicken and vegetables.  We had too much on our plates so wound up taking home leftovers.  Our teenager finished everything off and asked when we could go back!  While the food was good, our waitress was not terrific and seemed like she was doing us a favor waiting on us.  It is good that the food was good so we will probably do take-out next time."

We sat in the bar area and it was very perfect for a date night with its dark lighting and big booths and high tops. The bar itself is nice and spacious with a large flat screen TV. Food was good. Big portions and you can choose white or brown rice which I love. There are tons of selections on the menu. We chose Chinese food tonight but will be back to try the sushi. We got a specialty chicken dish that was a little sweet for my taste. I wish it was spicier, but the chicken was tender and veggies nice and fresh. You can probably ask for spicier or sweeter. The noodle dish with beef was good too, but the beef was thinly sliced. Wish it was a little thicker. Service was slightly slow, especially at the end waiting for the check. Overall good experience. Make reservations."

She and my cuz have been before and they did not steer us wrong. The service was really great. I unfortunately don&#39;t remember our servers name but she was super nice and totally accommodating because we were the annoying table of females who were talking too much to look at the menu... several times. 

We had the spring rolls and edamame which were very good. I am normally a strictly Sashimi gal in a Sushi restaurant, but I tried the wide noodles with beef on their recommendation and they were great. Too bad I left my doggie bag in my cuz&#39;s car when I jumped out to catch the train... yum, lunch for her... no lunch for me. :("

They have a cool looking bar and the overall decor of the place feels like a trendy restaurant you would find in the city.

I actually really enjoyed the food. The portions aren&#39;t that big, but I would say its balanced by the great flavor. My go to dish is hands down the black peppered garlic beef. I&#39;m a garlic lover and this beef definitely passes my standards. If you go with a group, they&#39;ll usually bring white or brown rice for the table instead of individual portions.

The downfall of Pl8 in my opinion is the terrible service. I&#39;ve been here several times and even hosted a lunch event for work here. Every time I&#39;ve been here, the service has been extremely slow. I especially recall one time, all we wanted was a refill of rice because they just gave us one small bowl for the 4 people at our table. Our waiter didn&#39;t check up on us frequently even though the place wasn&#39;t busy, and even after we were finally able to ask him for more, he just flat out never brought it.

While I think the food has good flavor and it&#39;s a cool looking restaurant, I&#39;ll probably choose to go somewhere else for my lunch hour because of the slow service."

I&#39;m always a sucker for a sushi place that offers brown rice in their rolls which is what sold me. We got the spicy scallop roll, autumn roll, sunrise roll, and caterpillar roll. Even though we came in a bit before close on a slow Sunday night the fish tasted very fresh and the presentation was beautiful. We left sufficiently full and even took leftovers. We sat and the bar and Patrick served us. He was absolutely wonderful. Extremely personable and gave amazing service. I would go back solely for him and his company. Super nice and didnt make us feel rushed or anything. I can&#39;t rave about him enough, truly a great employee. 10/10 would recommend and will hopefully be going back again!"

Food was good but the service was terrible. Repeatedly had to remind the waitress to bring various items. At one point, we had to go to the bar to get a glass of wine. Although she was nice, her service was not. Pl8 is extremely noisy inside to the point of being unpleasant. Also, the restaurant is in desperate need of a thorough scrubbing down, including the filthy bathrooms. Our table was dirty with leftover dried  food spills when we arrived.

However, went back again recently and found it to be just OK.  The bartender was a screwball who didn&#39;t radiate much hospitality and the wine offerings seemed very retail name oriented.  We settled for some Sake which was tasty.

The Sushi was good, but certainly not great.  It appears to be a tough area for restaurants as I saw Barrington Bistro across the parking lot has closed its doors.

I don&#39;t believe I will be returning to pl8."

I&#39;ve insisted to keep giving them a try since they are the closest restaurant in the proximity of my home but after my last visit, I think I&#39;m ready to write them off. (Note: I have never sat down in this restaurant. I have always ordered my food by phone and taken it to-go). 

Can&#39;t comment much on the atmosphere of the place since I&#39;ve never dinned in but I can say every time I&#39;ve been there to pick up the place is basically pitch black. Very low lighting inside.

As far as the staff goes, no problems there. The staff has always been friendly over the phone and in person when I pick up my food. 

My problem is with the quality of the food I&#39;ve been served and how it compares to it&#39;s price point. I&#39;ve tried a few dishes now and a hand full of the sushi rolls. Every dish I&#39;ve had on the menu has stated to be served in some sort of a sauce. Well, their sauces are basically water, no consistency at all. Water thin, with a few coagulated spice clusters and a minimum amount of other ingredients that are stated to be presented in the dish. Spicy Dragon Noodles, would be good if the sauce was not... water, it didn&#39;t wreak of ginger (not stated as included ingredient.. I don&#39;t like ginger and try to stay away from it), and if the noodles weren&#39;t stuck together into one large mass. Thai Basil Shrimp.. a $16 smaller portion of borderline medium quality shrimp soaked in water with maybe 3 crushed peanuts and 2 small/medium basil leaves (stated as a spicy dish, no heat at all). Sushi rolls are nothing at all special and some of the smallest I&#39;ve ever seen. One specialty roll I had (can&#39;t remember the name of it, possibly been replaced on the menu) consisted of spicy tuna (or salmon, can&#39;t remember) and was deep fried and then drizzled with some sort of sauce. Cost me something like $14 for the single roll and was smaller than a standard 6 piece spicy tuna roll. I couldn&#39;t believe it when I saw it. Felt ripped off. A lot better sushi rolls around at this price point in surrounding towns.

Anyways bottom line. I felt disappointed after every meal I&#39;ve had from this restaurant. Poor quality and in some cases very small portions. You definitely don&#39;t get what you pay for."

PROS: Food = full of flavor, fresh, absolutely delicious. We ordered the potstickers for an app and they were tender and full of flavor. The ginger soy sauce ... Oh my ... I could drink it with a straw. At our servers recommendation, I ordered the Seven Flavor Chicken and it did not disappoint. Our server (who was excellent, friendly, knowledgeable) tailored the dish to fit my palate for not overly spicy food (took the dried chiles out). Huge portion, had it for leftovers. My hubby ordered off their specials menu -- the Asian fish and chips with sweet potato fries, Asian slaw, and wasabi tartar sauce. He enjoyed every bite. The fish was fresh and flaky, a nice light crisp tempura batter. Oh, and the sake sangria is delicious, but sweet! Definitely give it a try. They make a powerful mai tai also.

CONS: Loud! They also don&#39;t have a section for those who are waiting for a seat, so it makes it extra noisy and crowded in there. Our view was mainly of waiting patrons, which was distracting and annoying. Those two cons are the only reason Pl8 gets 4 stars instead of 5.

We will absolutely be back again! Can&#39;t believe it took us so long to go there. Can&#39;t wait to try more delicious items off their menu."

Barrington isn&#39;t known for having a foodie scene and this strip mall definitely needed something special after G Whiz moved to another location, taking most of the traffic in the neighborhood with it.

I&#39;ve been here probably 10 times now and I have not had a bad meal. We have a few fan favorites like the Black Mamba and the Crabby I Yam but there is not a bad roll on the menu. They normally have specials which CANNOT be overlooked, one of my favorite rolls is the Cinco de Mayo roll (sadly no longer on the menu, maybe next year!) The tempura appetizer also is a good mix of veggies/shrimp and even our vegetarian friends rave about the veggie only rolls. The service is always impeccable, drinks are kept full (and strong). The mai tai is a must for your first visit or if you are going alcohol free their iced green tea is the best.  

You can easily make a reservation open table and during the summer they have patio seating. We hosted a birthday party here and they were very accommodating and the prices are on par with the area. We don&#39;t come here for anything but sushi so I can&#39;t speak to the other dishes but this has quickly become our go to sushi place in the suburbs!

It was the best thing we tried. A close runner up was the scallops followed by a special - black peppered shrimp. The MaPo Tofu used very soft tofu but had a thick (almost too thick) spicy sauce.

Chili fish was OK, flavor was mildly spicy but too soft in texture and needed more umami. The dry shredded beef had strips that were not shredded at all and it was not as flavorful as we expected given the description. Not bad, just not what we expected.

The calamari were crispy with a panko coating that was a bit too dark from over frying.

Spring rolls were delicate and crisp. Best app was the tuna tatami(?) chopped up spicy tuna on wonton crisps. Tuna poke roll was great.

Mixed drinks were tasty - the Mai Tai was very authentic and the Gin2 had a nice hot of ginger and gin."

My husband had the Fireworks Salmon Roll and gobbled it up so fast.

The staff checked the order before giving it to me.  When I arrived home and opened the bag I realized that they did not give me gluten free chicken but instead breaded shrimp which is not gluten free and which I cannot eat due to dietary restrictions. I called Pl8 and spoke with the manager who said she had packed the order (but apparently didn&#39;t pay attention to the fact that the receipt said GF chicken, not breaded shrimp).  The manager&#39;s solution was for me to drive all the way back to the restaurant for the food I ordered or get a credit for next time.   A credit for next time did not solve the problem that I still had nothing that I could eat for dinner.  I drove back to the restaurant to retrieve my food.  I asked the manager if I could receive a credit for the inconvenience of returning to the restaurant to pick up the proper order as it was 100% their error.  The manager stated they didn&#39;t do that and turned her back on me and walked away. Pl8 has a gluten free menu but management is clearly ambivalent toward patrons with dietary restrictions or food intolerance.  Management is also not interested in satisfactorily correcting their errors and clueless about customer service.  We will not be returning and I would not recommend this restaurant to family or friends. Skip it if you want to avoid poor customer service."

Be forewarned this place gets packed on Saturday nights to be prepared to wait about an hour if you do not have reservations.

I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  It has a contemporary Asian flair to it.  I love how the bartenders go down a couple of steps to the bar so it looks lowered.   The drinks here were also really good.  I tried the ginger ale which was homemade and had a cocktail that I do not remember the name of.  They also make two different iced teas both were really good and I am not a big fan of iced tea!

Our server was super friendly and informative.  He let us know which dishes were popular and his personal favorites.  Everything we tried was fantastic.  The Hot and Sour Soup was awesome and the Crab Rangoon Sticks were to die for!  I was a huge fan of the string beans.  I also got a dish with wide rice noodles... super yummy!

The place was packed and in fairness to them, they tried to see if they could accommodate us in a reasonable time, but we were too hungry to wait and promised to come on SUNDAY as we had a reservation!

I am so glad we did.  The decor is so urban chic with clean lines and not too much stuff.  They have seats at the bar as well as table and booths.  

The server  (Pat) was very knowledgeable and made a great recommendation of their Basil Shrimp dish and he did not steer us the wrong way.  It was incredible.  The Szechuan green beans were tender and cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The wide noodle dish with chicken could not have had more taste, and my fave. the 7 season beef was out of this world.

Their special martini (Pear) was fresh and tasty.  I had their fresh ginger ale and they have an assortment of Asian beers as well.

We were seated right next to the kitchen which wasn&#39;t ideal but overall the ambiance is nice and it&#39;s relatively quiet despite a good sized crowd. 

We had edamames and spring rolls for appetizers. The sea salt edamames were the best I&#39;ve ever had and the spring rolls were fantastic too. 

I ordered the seven flavor chicken at the recommendation of our waitress and my mother-in-law. It was very good although slightly sweeter than I like. Prefer spicy.

This is old news for anyone who regularly dines with me. I don&#39;t discriminate. I love it all. Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Thai... So naturally I was insanely excited to venture back to my hometown to dine on a little of each. 

Upon walking in, I immediately noticed the chic and contemporary Asian flair - as well as the gorgeous Chinese dragon hanging from the ceiling. We were immediately seated (thank goodness for a reservation) and began to peruse the massive menu. I have to admit, I was overwhelmed with the amount of dishes. As much as I like options, the menu was just too big for me. 

As far as the dishes go, it was overall pretty darn good. I opted for the basil chicken which was both sweet and spicy. I loved the mix of both the light and dark meat and loved it even more that it wasn&#39;t fried. The bf ordered the Spicy Dragon Noodles with beef. Delicious. Spicy. Hot. The dish was on fire but packed a ton of layered flavors. The rest of our dining party ordered a variety of sushi dishes. I had a piece of the Autumn roll - which was unbelievable. I love a good veggie roll and Pl8 does veggie rolls right. Our table also ordered the edamame and veggie spring rolls - both were generic and  somewhat forgettable - especially for the price. One thing important to note, the portions are huge. Massive even. With that said, so are the prices. 

Service was also fantastic. Our server was attentive, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. He was able to provide &#34;healthier&#34; options and knew exactly how each dish was made, making special requests very easy.

Overall - Chic ambiance. Great food. Stellar service."

After striking out at the Onion Pub due to a private event renting out the entire patio my fiancée remember that PL8 had a few tables outside.  Hardly the same setting as the Onion&#39;s private pond (at PL8 you face the parking lot) and based on my previous 2 star review not the same level of excitement to eat there.

But we had been looking for an excuse to try eating here again as we always hoped they would capture some of Ben Pao&#39;s excellence, which it still misses the mark on.

We found we both liked our food a bit better on the second trip, but the roll I got as an appetizers still below average IMO.  The freshness of the fish is just not there, so if we do return I&#39;ll just stick with cooked entrees."

Food is great only negative thing is the service is really slow. We arrived at 1230 and there were about 10 other people in the entire restaurant. Still it took almost 40 min to get out food. Time went by because we were talking but we looked at our watches and realized how long it took.  So if service was a little better I would give it a closer to a 4 star than 3

Prices are reasonable but kitchen was horrendously slooooow!  Service was OK - slow too.  Asked for additional plates - never got them.  Water refilled once.  Was not checked on.

Three of us had lunch there this past week ordering a few of our favorites as we have frequented this restaurant but had not been in a couple of months.  All of our entrees had chicken and all three were abysmal.  We concluded that it was the chicken.  It was not quality chicken at all.  Perhaps even chicken &#34;parts&#34;.  Unfortunately, none of us have any real desire to return.  On another recent visit, we could not even get a pot for the tea we ordered as they were all out...it was not a busy lunch visit.  Apparently all were chipped or broken so only had &#34;a few&#34; tea pots left for service.  And the cups and saucers provided did not match, meaning the cup did not fit in the saucer.  Not a contrived mismatch type of thing.  Attention to details and quality product are apparently waning and now they are not the only Asian &#34;show in town&#34;."

The drinks were very good. My date ordered the Barringtini, which was essentially a ginger martini and was really tasty and not too sweet. I ordered the tsing tao, a Chinese beer akin to Stella Artois.

We only ordered two rolls between us, the candy cane roll, one of their holiday specials, and the spicy scallop roll. Both rolls were on the spicy side, but we both enjoy spicy food. They were well put together and did not fall apart between chopsticks. Both rolls were delicious.

The part that stood out the most was the service. We had Austin, a younger guy, as our waiter. He was excellent with his knowledge of the menu, what his favorites were, and consistently coming back to check on us. 

Bottom line: Multiple components of this restaurant will have me coming back and put this toward the top of my sushi list!"

We were at the booth right across the kitchen entrance (so that if someone from management reads this they may figure out the waitress assigned there tonight). She took 20 minutes to get us our first drink, took our order and never returned for 40 minutes  with a side salad. It took another 30 before our food came out (after getting 2 out of the 4 dishes wrong. My 5 year old had to wait for a 1.5 hrs to get her kid meal). All in all this place is packed because the food is good, the service is absolutely horrid. If you are okay with that - knock yourself out. But, if you are like me - someone that expects some level of service when you are spending $100/pp, then avoid this place like the plague. It&#39;s really pathetic."

Genmai tea is real good:
 - loose tea leave and real toast rice 
 - very flavorful 
 - good presentation

Ma Da-i nigiri is real fresh - thick slices can wrap around the rice

Tuna Roll - generous amount of tuna for an ordinary item on the menu

Spicy Scallop Hand Roll - expect small/ground-up scallop; but it came with big scallop that sliced thinner to layer evenly in the roll - that scallop is very fresh.
Spicy sauce is a smooth spice/mayo blend - scallop taste is undisturbed.

Recommend this place.

The staff (server, host and bartender) were very professional and really knew their stuff about sushi. I am a huge sushi fan and their Salmon is so fresh! I would like to recommend their Crab Rangoon as well, it is homemade and wrapped in a spring roll paper. The spring roll makes the Rangoon feel a bit more light, even though all the goodness of cream cheese and crab are still in it! What really impressed me about this Asian Restaurant is the Management. Meghan stopped by our table to see how our dining experience was and was sincere when asking about it.

I ordered the vegetable pad thai. It wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. The veggies were pretty good and crunchy. My friend ordered the Kung Pao chicken which was good and flavorful. I should have ordered that. 

We ordered the crab Rangoon sticks. I&#39;d recommend skipping that. They aren&#39;t great. I prefer the &#34;traditional&#34; kind which they do not offer. We did have the vegetable spring rolls which were good. 

Overall, for a &#34;last minute&#34; Asian fusion place it wasn&#39;t bad. The prices are reasonable for sure.  I think I&#39;d rather make the effort next time to go out of my way to my favorite Thai places though if I&#39;m really craving good pad thai."

Is the food still good?  Yes, the food is still good.  But, service is also a big part of a restaurant experience, and the last time we dined at Pl8 the service left us with much to be desired.  

We called a few weeks in advance for a party of 8 for a birthday dinner and requested the round table in the corner on the right side when you first come around the corner into the bar.  We were told that &#34;they don&#39;t reserve specific tables, but they would see  what they could do.&#34;  Fair enough, although I&#39;m not sure why a specific table can&#39;t be reserved.  It&#39;s not like George Clooney may stop by tonight and ask for his favorite booth or something - we are in Barrington, you know - not Manhattan.

Fast forward a few weeks and we call to confirm our reservation and ask about the table.  Now we are told (by a rather haughty individual) that &#34;someone else asked for that table a few weeks before you did.&#34;.  This is obviously a bit of a surprise since we were told before that specific tables are NOT reserveable.  When asked about this, Miss Haughty made up some laughable excuse that they told us that &#34;because they thought the other party would cancel, therefore they told us the previous story because we didn&#39;t think it would matter.&#34;  Huh?  This makes no sense whatsoever, and frankly it left a bad taste in our mouth, as being lied to tends to do.

Did we still have a good time?  Yes - it&#39;s not the end of the world.  But, I did check out the party that miraculously reserved the table I wanted so far in advance of me, and I didn&#39;t see George Clooney anywhere.

So, Pl8, not to be an ingr8, but may I say that your hostess may like to misst8 or is  deadw8.

Put that on your next billboard."

Pl8 is a good restaurant. 

Period.

Really impressive stuff going on here. From the hip ambiance that is far more Sunda than P.F. Chang&#39;s, to the notable - and expansive - menu that boasts a myriad of Asian delights, there&#39;s a lot to take in at Pl8 and even more to like. Starters of perfectly crisp and light King Crab Gyoza and a lightly sake-miso dressed bowl of Big Eye Tuna and Avocado Sumiso apps perfectly highlighted exactly what to expect throughout the remainder of our meal. Well-executed, visually appealing, expertly layered flavors. 

Score! 

Great &#39;must trys&#39; can also be found in the smoky and delightful Mei-ji Shrimp, the perfectly sinful - and my favorite - Mongolian Beef, or, lest I forget to mention... the SUSHI! Tons of sashimi, nigiri and maki options abound at Pl8. My California native dining partner went full sushi for her meal and loved every spicy super white tuna bite. Take that as a ringing endorsement, trust me.

There are high marks all around

The entire place was hip, from the light fixtures, to the sunken bar with petrified wood stools, it just looked cool to walk into.  This is a great spot for a date.  

They offer sushi as well as traditional Chinese fare, so the clientele has a nice mixture of ages.   I am partial to old world Chinese food and theirs hit the spot.  From the pot stickers to the peanut noodles, the apps were delish.  The beef dish that I ordered had great cuts of meat, a large portion of veggies and a tasty sauce.  The noodles were spicy and different from pretty much any other noodle dish that I have ever had (in a good way).  

Quite an enjoyable experience overall!"

Pl8, situated in a stereotypically snobby luxury &#34;strip mall&#34; in Barrington, is simply genius.  Asian fusion.  At really reasonable prices.  Done impeccably well.  With super affordable drinks to boot.

We ordered LITERALLY everything.  Rolls, sashimi, calamari &#34;2 ways,&#34; pad thai, the shrimp basil special, banana wontons... The vast majority of the food we were served was on par with the best, most innovative Asian fusion we&#39;d ever had.  Our server (Julie) was sweet, fun, prompt, and simply delightful.  Great chic indoor dining room, even better outdoor dining space.  

Food synopsis:
Snow crab roll with honey wasabi drizzle.  Need I say more?!
The basil shrimp is the BOMB.
The sashimi samplers are SUPER reasonable, SUPER fresh, and awesome.
The pad thai was just ok.
The pear martini&#39;s AMAZING.

Suggestion for guests (and proprietors): The specials are on a chalkboard immediately upon entry and they&#39;re easy to miss.  The hostess may mention the specials in passing.  Awkward as it may be, take a moment on your way to your table and study them.  They&#39;re fresh.  They&#39;re delicious.  I highly recommend them."

We&#39;ve been there before, and enjoyed it well enough but it had been a while due to the price/value. I&#39;m happy to be spendy once in a while, but I do feel it&#39;s a bit overpriced here.

My issue is not with that, however. I can read a menu and decide if the price point is acceptable before I order. What I cannot do, is predict that the fire alarm will go off moments after our meal arrives. And go off it did, sending what appeared to be the manager or owner rushing around to tell us there was no fire. But you know, those things are painfully loud. And it went on for 15 minutes AFTER I looked at my watch, which was an incredulous several minutes after it began. We can thank Barrington Countryside FPD for that, but that&#39;s another story.

When the din finally ended, we were ordering dessert and asked whether it would be &#34;gratis&#34; due to the alarm essentially ruining our meal. No reply.

And of course, when we got the check, it was for the full pop, appetizers, drinks, and dessert along with meals. I think that&#39;s lousy customer service. If the manager did not have the &#34;power&#34; to do offer something in a case like that, the place is not run properly. I&#39;ve had that happen in other restaurants ( we admittedly dine out a lot) and have always had some generous offer of compensation.

So even though this is the closest restaurant to our home, I really don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back. We certainly didn&#39;t feel valued. The place only had 5-6 other groups in it, too."

Walking in the space has a strange shape to it, bar area in the center with tables surrounding it. The restaurant kind of throws you off because the lighting is pretty bright, and it was a bit loud because it was a Saturday night. 

We ordered edamame and the spicy lovers roll for appetizers, along with an excellent Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. The maki roll was really not spicy at all but the quality and amount of salmon was very good- for $6. The orange peel chicken was ok ($10$ it came with a side of rice- it would&#39;ve been better crispier.

My chicken pad Thai ($10) was not good. At all. The noodles were not al dente, tasteless- almost watery. The bits of chicken were very bland as well. I couldn&#39;t get past 4 bites and ordered another sushi roll- the tuna and avocado- which was fine, though my date was pretty much done eating by the time it arrived. The service was ok. We appreciated that they had interesting Valentine&#39;s Day specials like themed cocktails, surf and turf, and red nori rolls. 

I&#39;m giving this place 2 stars really for the portion sizes, prices, and wine.  But for an &#34;Asian-fusion&#34;/Americanized restaurant you&#39;re better off at Big Bowl in Shaumburg."

We started with a spicy tuna roll which was not the most adventurous selection or execution. We also had potstickers which were piping hot and served with a dilicious vinager-soy-scallion sauce, they were excellent.

My wife had the shredded garlic beef with scallions and I had to try the spicy chili fish based on the raves. My wife liked her beef dish but it didn&#39;t stand out to her in any way. We both loved the chili fish though. The whitefish was cooked to soft, moist and tender perfection and I almost never say that about fish. It comes with bamboo, snow peas, smoked tofu and blackened little chili peppers.

If I could make one change I would say the chef should capture the chili flavors but should not put in the tiny, hot, dried and scorched chili peppers in the dish because everyone picks them out. Try a signature cocktail like the Barringtini order one of the classics like Kung Pao, Mongolian Beef or the amazing Chili Fish and you will have a great time."

The outside didn&#39;t look like much since it was in a shopping center and didn&#39;t give it any distinction. If you didn&#39;t know what you were looking for, you might miss it. The inside was modern with dramatic decorations such as a wall that looks like the side of a shipping container. 

My lunch companion and I shared edamame, potstickers, hand grenade, crunchy lobster, and pepper road. The edamame and potstickers were very ordinary - it&#39;s something you expect all Japanese restaurants to serve and don&#39;t really mess up. The thing that I do appreciate is the size of the maki pieces. They weren&#39;t these ridiculously gigantic pieces that you can&#39;t fit in your mouth and with so many ingredients that you can&#39;t really taste the flavor of the fish. These were nice, bite size pieces that you could manage and taste the star of the show.

Which is why I wonder about this place.  The food is marginal, although about 34% more than most Chinese restaurants.  they do have a few things that are kinda cool- like a bar that makes you feel like your squatting on a tree stump but that dosent make up for the lame Wonton soup they slop at you. The sushi is not rolled well,and even simple dishes like come out tasting like you offered the cook from Denny&#39;s a night job.  Keep Trying PL8"

Ordered the wild rice noodles and they were doughy and carb-o-licious. They didn&#39;t have a whole lot of flavor tho, I ordered them to be made spicy. They came out not spicy at all so the waitress gave me chili paste which bumped up the flavor. 

My husband ordered the mix n match tempura which we would NOT recommend. 

We also shared a delicious sushi roll (can&#39;t remember the name) , it came with honey mustard drizzled over it and it was amazing.

We will be back to sit at the bar and enjoy some sushi for sure. And try their Lychee Martini!"

I had a couple different maki rolls and their &#34;crab Rangoon chopsticks&#34;. It&#39;s not the worst sushi i&#39;ve ever had but it wasn&#39;t too far away. Crab Rangoon was bland.......maybe just not what I expected.

Staff was nice."

The decor is nice.  Our waitress brought our drinks - yummy blood orange martini, but my friends had the lychee and it was bitter, yuck - and took our appetizer order, then ignored us for nearly 30 minutes.  We had to flag her down to get another round of drinks and place our dinner order. 

We had the carpaccio and tempura apps and the carpaccio was pretty good - a bit heavy on the olive oil, but the fish was very fresh - and the tempura was fine.  Nothing special.  

For dinner we shared a poke salad which was seriously overdressed and had only one raggedy piece of fish on it, the crunchy lobster roll which was tasty, and the spicy garlic noodles, which had neither spice nor garlic, unless you count pre-packaged, toasted bits of garlic as the garlic. One friend ordered the miso soup as well but it was so watery and tasteless she sent it back. 

All in all, for the price, I&#39;d rather go to PF Changs for Chinese and Tokio Sake for sushi.  Too bad - we have so few restaurants in Barrington, I was hoping for a great new place here in town.  But I don&#39;t see myself going back."

Only minor complaint is it is a bit pricey. My wife, son and I cost over $110 for 2 appetizers, 2 alcoholic drinks, 3 entrees, and 2 desserts.

We ate from both sides of the menu and it was all good. Fresh ingredients, good tastes, and nice portion sizes. Dessert portion size was a bit underwhelming (grilled pineapple - 1 ring, and 1 scoop of ice cream for $5), but all in all a good experience.

Will definitely try again."

Definitely a place you tell your friends to check out. Love sitting at the bar. It&#39;s very low to the ground and the bartender is somewhat below you. Needs a better beer menu. With a place like this in the city you&#39;d expect a solid craft beer menu..solid date spot as well. Service and food all great.

I went to Pl8 while visiting my parents out in the suburbs last night, and I honestly wish that there was one in the city so that I could visit more regularly (i.e., tomorrow night).

We started out with the Chong Ching Noodle Soup for the table (4 of us) and it was completely out of this world. I want this recipe... apparently it&#39;s like hotpot. We finished it all - I think that this would be a great meal for 2 people to share.

For entrees, my boyfriend and I both got the Spicy Chili Fish after rave reviews, and we weren&#39;t let down. Just delicious. Large portions; I took home half of it.

Service was great. Our waitress was very sweet and hospitable; she humored my dad, who I will admit can be a bit much....

Delicious and fun for the whole family :)"

We really enjoyed it.

We stayed to the Chinese side of the menu and had pot stickers as an appetizer.  We really liked them.  A very flavorful sauce came with them.

For an entrée we tried a few things to sample a bit of everything.  We tried the Sesame Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and Chicken Fried Rice.  We really liked them all and would order them all again!  We are eager to try other things on the menu and will be more adventurous next time!

The dessert menu was so tempting.  We simply had no more room for it!  Next time for sure.

Portions were large and we came home with at least another meal.  You won&#39;t leave there hungry.

We even ordered some items to take to a family member who couldn&#39;t join us.

The staff was professional, informative and very friendly!  Very willing to answer any questions we had.

We will visit again very soon I&#39;m sure!

Well worth a visit and a return to try new things the next time!"

The place has a cool downtown vibe with hip music playing in the back ground, the decor is gorgeous!! The bar is awesome here, it&#39;s going to be my new favorite place to sit and try some more of those awesome martinis (barringtini is a must). I love that every wine listed is offered by the glass and bottles are all under $40.00 and there are some great selections.

The crab rangoon chop sticks and the hand grenade were delicious and the chocolate banana wontons were to die for!

Fine, but I ordered a green tea. She took care of this and on to the food. We had the calamari two ways and to my surprise the grilled calamari was much better than the fried! I had the pad thai with shrimp and my husband had a fish/bean/curry. The pad thai was good and almost a surplus of shrimp but very delicate flavors--same with the fish dish.
Dessert was AMAZING. I mean, mochi, right? But this was so fresh and delicious, one mango, one tiramisu and one chocolate and coconut. We also shared the grilled pineapple which is pretty much my new favorite food. So five stars for dessert but three for entrees and not the most attentive service."

Sadly there are not many Asian places to compare it to in the burbs as opposed to the plethora you encounter in the city so it is not difficult with a little effort to be one of the better Asian restaurants in the burbs. I dine at pl8 on monthly basis. I keep going because the food is consistent and I am always pleased by the service. I always know I am getting something fresh. The quality of the sushi is always top tier. Quick picks guaranteed to be enjoyed: Fireworks Salmon Roll, Kung Pao, the veggie spring rolls, and the fried rice is awesome not greasy very light for fried rice. For desert the lemon ginger cheesecake is to die for it is made for them by Ambrosia which is a french bakery in the same shopping center they are located. I think the price of everything is perfect if anything a bargain."

Excellent service, great food in a cool atmosphere not typical for the NW burbs. It is obvious to me the owners are paying attention to past negative reviews and adjusting accordingly. We found portions were large at a very reasonable price. Dragon noodles were plentiful and delicious with large shrimp. Well spiced too, not dumbed down. The wine, beer and sake lists were small but diverse and interesting, telling me the owners care about the overall experience. Unlike so many suburban Asian restaurants that put the usual grocery store stuff on their lists. Chong Ching soup was enough for 4 people.  Very different and interesting dish.   We real can&#39;t say enough good things about our first experience and can&#39;t wait to go back to try more dishes."

Pl8 is really reasonably priced, has a lot of menu offerings, and good sized portions.  The dining room isn&#39;t big - so remember to make a reservation on weekends.  They have a cute little sunken bar area that is helpful for grabbing a drink if there is a wait.  The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. We had a bunch of plates and shared them - the crab rangoon chop sticks were great! So was the Kung Pao chicken (they ask how spicy you want it- nice touch). The pot stickers were a good starter too.  If you are in the area and looking for Asian - check it out :)"

It was a beautiful night and the setting could not have been better.

The food was excellent.  We had so many compliments on how delicious the food was and how full they were.  We did a family style service and had more than enough food to go around.  

We chose to host the event at PL8 because we enjoy the atmosphere, service and food ourselves.  It is one of our regular places to meet and dine.  Creative dishes and drinks that are always fun and delicious.  We also find the prices reasonable.

Chairs were put on top of tables, the waiter asked for our salt shakers. we were told we could not get coffee because the kitchen was closed before we finished eating. This might be understandable if we arrived shortly before closing but we arrived at 8 to a restaurant that closed at 9! There were still people at the bar when we left..earlier than we wanted to.

Wow, there&#39;s a heavy hand in the kitchen with the salt!! My friend had the spicy sushi platter and I had a sashimi assortment. Again, nothing to rave about, just ok. The prices are on the high side considering the food is average. I had a small bottle of San Pellegrino which they charged me $4....now that&#39;s a bit ridiculous, don&#39;t ya think?

she  was like oh you mean Danny&#39;s and I was like I guess so I didn&#39;t pay attention to the name on the box just remember the pizza was good, even the next day cold for breakfast, and it was thin crust but hand tossed and cut into little squares, something I have missed the last 23 years as I have been living either over seas or in Seattle, and no one does pizza like Chicago I don&#39;t care where you go, I have been to all 48 states and over 30 different countries and the pizza here rocks

They have really good food, in my opinion. I&#39;ve tried lots of different meals from here and have not been disappointed. 
A tip for the burrito lovers: if you don&#39;t like your burrito loaded with refried beans, order your burrito without the beans!! It is a the over powering with all those beans! The only things I don&#39;t like from here, is the queso fundito, and their queso dip.. The fondito is too hard. Impossible to &#34;dip&#34; your tortilla. The queso dip, tastes like the smell of burning plastic, orange cheese that was most definitely microwaved.. 
Prices are a little bit high for what you get, unless you get the coupons in the mail for buy one, get one free. I have never tried out their alcoholic drinks, so I&#39;m not sure how the mixed drinks tastes. Staff is ALWAYS friendly. 
One time when my grandparents were here, my grandpa was using the washroom, and saw the cook walk out of the bathroom without washing his hands!! He informed the manager, and I believe the manager said something to the cook. 
I knocked off two stars because of the semi-high prices, and because of the cook not washing his hands after using the bathroom.. I mean, that&#39;s just gross and it&#39;s common sense to wash your hands after using the washroom at a restaurant you cook food at. Otherwise, beyond that grossness, I would recommend."

I ordered a fish entree and my husband ordered the steak tampiquena. Our orders came quickly but that&#39;s when everything went downhill for us.  His steak was so thin, overcooked and salty.  So salty that you can feel the salt in your tongue at every bite.  The cheese enchilada that came with it was so dry and the sauce poured on top tasted like it just came out of a can.
As for my fish,  it was bitter charred on the bottom and it was so salty.  The minced garlic garnish on top of the fish came out of a jar.  Underneath the fish were mixed vegetables that came out of a frozen bag.  
When it was time to get the check, it took ten minutes to get our server back out in the main dining area because they were watching tv in the bar area.

The Cadillac Margaritas and the Daiquiris are spectacular

We don&#39;t eat meat so I can&#39;t speak to those items.  We love coming here and getting Chiles Rellenos (very good), roasted jalapenos and the vegetarian fajitas.  Lots of mushrooms in the fajitas, which is a nice and authentic (had lots of mushroom tacos in mexico) touch.

When they cater, the portions are Huge.  We had a smaller party catered by Toreo a few weeks ago and were able to feed our family for the next three meals with the leftovers.  

I give a 4/5 because their food is I would say on par with expectations (maybe above par on the Chiles), but the staff and drinks are above the bar.  Always very accommodating and makes us feel welcome and valued.  Lots of parking as well and they tolerate us parking our bikes outside when we ride over."

Additionally the entire staff is very attentive. The restaurant has a good variety of tequila. When you are seated, a server will bring you chips, a red salsa and a green salsa with pickled jalapeños, onion and carrots. 

Portions are good sized, enough for left overs the next day. On our last visit my husband had the al pastor and chorizo chimichangas, I had the beef and my son had the &#34;Maya&#34; special all came with rice and beans. My hubby stated the chimichangas were good, my son enjoyed the different enchiladas but both stated the rice and beans lacked seasoning.

The two of us had the Cadillac Margaritas, one was too sweet and they quickly replaced it without hesitation. My son had the horchata, a rice, milk, vanilla and cinnamon drink. He said he loved it. 

The overall consensus is that we&#39;ll be coming back again.

We should have known when we walked in on a Saturday night and there were only 4 or so tables with people sitting at them.  Hmmmm....  

Well, to be short and sweet, service was mediocre, even slow at times.  Food came out very quickly, but we felt like an annoyance to our server. Mixed reviews on food:  husband loved his burrito grande, but I did not enjoy my flautas.  Chicken was extremely dry.  Thank goodness for the chips, salsa and the extra guacamole we ordered.  All three were delicious. Guac was not made at the table, which I&#39;ve kinda grown accustomed to, so $7 seemed a little high for a side.

Cadillac Margaritas were okay, not great or bad. Definitely not fresh lime, but from a mix.

Not only did we have to flag down the waiter to place an order (about 20 minutes after we received out drinks), but we had to flag them down for refills AND to find out where our order was (about an hour after we arrived).

Or is it called El Torero. it seems to have 2 names. i have many years of experience eating at all types of Mexican restaurants, from authentic dives, to Tex-Mex, to Mexican-American, and many very upscale authentic Mexican. 
Toreo is your standard Mexican American with a leaning toward Mexican/Authentic. Not upscale authentic, just rice and beans style authentic. 
Very clean and friendly atmosphere, VERY moderately priced. 
Fresh chips with 2 salsas and pickled veggies are complimentary. 1 sauce red and 1 green. I asked for more heat and they gladly obliged by bringing a bottle of Cholula and a bottle of green El Yucateca. I suspect most of you will not be able to handle the El Yucateca.
I don&#39;t know why, but I ordered Chimichangas. I NEVER order these. Now, if you have ever been to Mexico Uno-in downtown Palatine, then you probably already know that the bar for Chimichanga&#39;s is set very high. Mexico Uno serves a grilled version that is lights out. I asked if these were grilled or deep fried and was told that they were deep fried. Whatever, I ordered them anyway. Deep fried anything is going to be pretty good. 
Well, let me say that these were outstanding. I had one with ground beef and one with carne asada-like a bbq pork. Both were great. The flour tortillas were perfectly crisp and layered and did not taste greasy at all. 
I see many bad reviews that are completely daffy. One gal say&#39;s that she ordered the Chimichangas and could not believe that they were served in a flour tortilla instead of corn. In all my days, I have never seen a chimichanga made with a corn tortilla. They are basically a grilled or fried burrito. 
Someone said the rice and beans were no good. Well, mine were perfect. Not cold and not dry. 
As for Quinn B.-why not just send them back and get a freshly made plate of food if yours was cold and dry. Instead he trashes the place on Yelp. You are not funny. These people work hard. It is obviously a family run business and I think that they are doing a fine job.
You cannot compare this to places like Frontera Grill, or even Mago or other upscale Mexican places. It is what it is. Decent food and a very good value."

We bought a Groupon and called ahead to see if they would honor it the same day we paid for it (some Groupons are mailed to you and you have to wait until you receive it), which they did. The food was very filling and satisfying. 

We were greeted right when we walked in and were seated immediately. Our waitress asked if we had ever been to the restaurant and we said we had not. She then said, &#34;I bet you&#39;ll be back; I think you&#39;re gonna love El Torero.&#34; The way she said it kind of made us laugh. She brought out chips and two kinds of salsa; neither were too spicy. She also brought a little cup of guacamole, which was free because our Groupon included it along with the half price deal. We paid $15 for $30 worth and got more than enough food; we were full about half way through eating our appetizer, the queso fundido. It mean cheese fondue and is basically a little pot of melted cheese sitting upon a small fire to keep it warm and melted and comes with soft tortilla shells. It&#39;s basically like a make-your-own cheese quesadilla. We ordered two entrees: a chorizo chimichanga and a combination plate. Since there were few vegetarian options, we asked about making the combo plate vegetarian and our waitress accommodated no problem. 

When we received our bill, our server pointed out that we had not spent the full $30 that our Groupon was worth, and that the remaining balance could not be applied towards tax or tip, so we ordered a red sangria; it was pretty good. 

I would like to go back and order different entrees since they offer so many."

At $15 it seems a good value but while it looks great, the flavor seems flat.  As others have mentioned, it seems like the sides are a plate from a can - just bland and  dull rice and bean sides.  The service is improving - very friendly and the prices at lunch are a bargain, but overall it doesn&#39;t merit going out of your way, at least at dinner.

Went in wanting to like El Terero. It&#39;s close to where I live and it&#39;s Mexican food. Those two things skewed me towards liking it before I sat down. The ambiance is exactly what you want from a Mexican restaurant, semi-divey, spanish music, spanish staff and fresh margaritas.

The menu is your typical Mexican fanfare and doesn&#39;t bring anything new to the table, but then again I&#39;m not sure what &#34;new to the table&#34; Mexican food would even look like.

My complaint lies mostly in one location. Flavor. There was none! The food was edible and there were no issues with how it was presented/prepared, but when it comes right down to it I expect some flavor out of Mexican food. There was no lime taste, no cilantro taste, no spicy taste, nothing. It was fundamentally cooked beef with sour cream and lettuce. I had a combination of a tostada, burrito and enchilada. All three were fundamentally flavorless and while I don&#39;t like to complain about price El Torero does tend to cost about 25% more than your typical Mexican food.

It&#39;s not the worst food I&#39;ve ever had, but definitely some of the least flavorful. The restaurant itself was nice and the staff was friendly, but I have a hard time believing that I will go back any time real soon."

The service was a bit over-the-top. Every 5th second a new person came by to ask how we were doing. Maybe they were just messing with us but it became excessive after awhile.

The margarita I had was meh but the server swore by it and tables were order pitcher after pitcher of them. Despite the lack of pizazz, it was served in a cactus-shaped glass and that wins me over every time.

I liked the sass our server gave us. Fun guy.
Most importantly, the food was tasty. I sampled/stole/forked some desserts from the others at my table and I learned that adding honey, sugar and cinnamon can make anything really good.

They bring you chips and salsa when you sit down.  All of it&#39;s good (they bring a red salsa, a green salsa, and peppers) but the red is extremely awesome!

Staff is very hard working.  

My best suggestion?  Try this place out just one time.  I guarantee that it will keep you coming back.  We got a few times each month and try and bring friends and family that have never been there before and all of them love it like us.

We ordered margaritas, guacamole appetizer, chicken fajitas and a combination plate with a taco, tostada and &#34;burrito&#34;. 

You may be wondering why &#34;burrito&#34; is in quotations and I suppose an explanation is the best place to start this review. The burrito in question was really an enchilada and a poor one at that. Flour tortilla (what - no corn?) wrapped around a spoonful of bland, mealy ground beef slathered with enchilada sauce and some American cheese. Yuk. 

The tostada was seriously inedible. Soggy corn tortilla piled high with the same unseasoned beef, lettuce and a dollop of sour cream. The taco was just as bad. I blame the meat. How can a Mexican restaurant NOT season their meat? To top it off, the consistency was so foul, we could hardly choke it down. Have had better ground beef from Taco Bell, I kid you not. In addition, I have a soy allergy that causes my lips to swell when eating soy protein. As soon as I took a bite of ground beef, guess what? My lips started to get puffy! Definitely seems they cut their ground beef with soy. 

The chicken fajitas were also bland. Nothing was seasoned. At least the peppers seemed fresh. Thankfully, an unseasoned pepper is easier on the palate than unseasoned chicken. Only 3 tortillas (flour of course) were given for a hefty fajita plate. Definitely unbalanced but no matter because I couldn&#39;t force myself to finish it anyway. 

Guacamole was also bland and an alarming shade of green. The margarita was watery and overpriced. In fact, everything was overpriced! Our bill was around $40. Now I&#39;d be okay paying that if the food was actually good. Obviously, it wasn&#39;t and definitely not worth $10+ a plate. 

Important to note: Absolutely zero Hispanic people eating in the restaurant. All Midwest white folks who probably can&#39;t tell the difference between authentic Mexican cuisine and amateur slop.

Please, please don&#39;t go here. Drive down towards Whole Foods and stop at La Presa. It looks like shit but it&#39;s amazing. I don&#39;t even know why we decided to try someplace else. Good Mexican food at half the price and surprise... everyone who eats there is actually Hispanic!"

While I wasn&#39;t knocked out by lunch, it WAS appropriately UNDERseasoned in my opinion so that you CAN slather on whatever YOU think makes it your &#34;authentic Mexican&#34; etc etc. instead of the usually inedible salt bomb that I detest.

Very clean, well lit dining area with booths or sunny tables by generous tall windows. There were also 4 good sized outdoor tables with umbrellas in front. Simple straightforward menu made ordering refreshingly simple for a first visit.  I don&#39;t think there were are any fish choices. Largely unappealing strip mall location has plenty of parking and the insides were much cheerier and brighter than expected. Staff was helpful warning my companion off spicier dishes she would not have liked and showed up only when we needed them. Fresh guacamole and chips were also not drowned in salt and salsa and my cheese chili releno was perfect and I DID expect it to be hotter than it was and no I didn&#39;t then pour a bunch of green or red sauce on it.

I have gone here every couple years for quite a while, keep giving it a chance because it is right around the corner to my house. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt..

Well I went back one more time because of the name change, I thought it was new owners, and I got a good deal on a coupon at www.restaurant.com. Went there with 4 others, meet on a saturday.
We all ordered miscelanous stuff, very limited choices.

No Al Pastor Tacos? really? How is this possible. The rice and beans are barely edible (exactly what I can but in a can for 79 cents. And the mole tasted like salsa that has been burnt in a fry pan.. nachos with about 15 chips and melted cheese and bottled jalapenos for 7.00? really?

Here&#39;s the kicker, 5 people each having a beer with our meal got a bill for over $80.00 for mediocre mexican at best? And after our meal they tell us they no longer accept the coupon? I called restaurant.com and they refunded me my cost thank goodness.

But yet the are still selling them on the site two weeks later? What a shady place. I won&#39;t be going back. Just looked now and I guess restaurant.com booted them because they are no longer available..

How about this, look into offering real good mexican at a good price and people will come back. But not me, 3 big strikes over 10 years and I am not going back any more. 

I have learned my lesson, don&#39;t waste your time here."

But I am a HUUUGE mexican food connoisseur and thought it would be in peoples&#39; best interest that I honestly reviewed it. First of all, the food was mediocre. However, what REALLY makes this only one star was the service. WOW! Horrible.

My companion and I sat outside because it was one of the last few warm nights of the summer. Not knowing if we just seat ourselves, we walked into the establishment to ask and found multiple servers not even bothering to stand up and treat us as new customers. I might as well have been their grandmother. ha So taking that with a grain of salt we chose a table outside on our own. Then, all of the following happened during the rest of our meal:

-Wait staff hardly checked on us, maybe 2 times total and not even to ask us how it was going. More or less just &#34;passing us&#34;
-Waters never got refilled
-A waiter spoke on his cell phone 10ft away from us in the parking lot while kicking the rocks towards my car. I was about to say something and then he stopped.
-Two waiters (neither one being our original waiter) came out to give us our food while giggling the whole time like school girls....just to put the wrong plate in front of us. It was a 50/50 chance to mess up and they did.
-Took a millllion years to get the waiter to come back and take our credit card so we could get the hell out of there. I seriously contemplated just leaving. It felt like an eternity.

I can&#39;t recall if there was anything else, but that&#39;s enough to say we didn&#39;t enjoy our visit there, right? Two HUGE thumbs down!"

I asked if they could make me a chilli rellenos burrito... usually this presents a pleasantly surprisingly good dish at a fraction of the cost of the rellenos meal.... the best they could do was offer to let me order the meal and charge me for a tortilla so I could wrap it up in it.... not exactly a burrito.  They did take a few cents off my bill to make it an even $15, service was pretty good and nice, outside seating was great for the nice night.  The flautas I opted for were good... but nothing special and came with the standard $10 meal price.

It was nice to eat outside, but I think I&#39;ll head back to the place on Brockway."

This past visit, as I entered, I see in the vestibule a crummy Ikea low shelf unit with a few dusty phone books scattered on it. Lousy first impression. The food is decent enough, but the prices are too high for a place with store-bought chips and guacamole that is pre-made and served too-cold from the refrigerator.

What is arguably the most important aspect of a Mexican restaurant? THE CHIPS AND SALSA. Toreo has great restaurant-style chips and serves them with a few different salsas and jardinera. Margaritas are standard.

The menu is expansive and has many combinations. Some of their steak dishes are very good, but my favorite is the chimichangas.  They aren&#39;t really special compared to other Mexican places, but there is nothing wrong with them either. They serve large plates of good and basic Mexican food.

Service is average and the decor is festive with pinatas and such hanging about."

It was about 2pm on a Sunday when I walked in to order take out and the weird smell in the restaurant told me to turnaround, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I ordered the Tacos and Quesdeias and I thought it strange when the waiter hovered over me for payment. 

Checked the food in the car and it looked okay, but it was a different story when I got it home. Both meals were gross, where the meat was barely meat, the tortillas tasted like the weird smell in the restaurant and everything was just dry.

What a mistake. We were about to get seated by the hostess when a waitress butted in and said that we couldn&#39;t sit in a table because there was a large party coming in. We had to wait for them to clean a booth and were then forced to sit in the really cramped booth. Then not 2 minutes later, 4 people get seated at the same table she said we couldn&#39;t sit at? What!!!??? And the &#39;large party&#39; never shows up?? 

She then becomes our waitress. My friend asks if she can order flautas with cheese instead of meat and the waitress explains that they cannot fry a flauta with cheese inside. My friend then tells her that she&#39;s had it plenty of times at other restaurants and even at other&#39;s homes in the past. The waitress looks pissed as she says she will go ask the cook if he can do it for her. 

5 minutes later, a man comes over to take our order, not even indicating that he knew that my friend had asked a question. She completely blew us off and dumped us onto another server. 

We almost got up right there and left. We decided to stay and try the food because we had already driven there.

The food was barely seasoned, I make better guacamole at home using jarred salsa and avocado. The rice was bland, refried beans were crusty (ewww!), and they didn&#39;t give my husband any sour cream with his tacos. And he was 3/4 of the way done before they asked us if everything was ok.  We ate as fast as we could just to get the heck out of that place. We will NEVER come back to this restaurant, and I hope Groupon will never feature this restaurant ever again to save others from having such a negative experience."

Their chips and salsa is the best i have found in all the suburbs. It might not be homemade, but both the red and green sauces are excellent. And the carrots/jalapenos are outstanding.

The portions are always a good size, and they serve a much better quality steak product than many other places around here. I am a huge steak fan, and too many places serve really poor quality and overcooked steak(if at all). But Toreo does it right imo. I usually get the burrito grande de steak. A huge flour tortilla which i get topped with their spicy tomatillo saace. It is filled with nothing but steak and onions. 

The service is not always the best, but most of the times it is pretty decent. The service is the only thing that i can really complain about, but since the food is so good i can overlook it."

Chips and salsa were also pretty standard, well, maybe above average. Both salsas were better than other Mexican restaurants I&#39;ve tried in the area. Every single a time any server walked by our table, they asked if everything was OK or how we were doing. It got comical after awhile, but nice to see they were attentive.

Came here with a few friends on a Sunday night.  Dinner at 7:30PM with no wait. The decor and ambiance is modern and clean, despite being in a little strip mall that doesn&#39;t look as inviting from the exterior, the interior is done well.

We ordered sodas that came out super flat, our server switched them out for us immediately. 

The Better
Complimentary hand wipes are a plus, our server was nice and helpful with ordering as well. 

The Best
We ordered the following rolls:
Volcano - your average deep-fried volcano roll.  Still very good, not over-fried or heavy.
Fire Dragon -  amazing. This is a baked roll with cream cheese and special sauce.  We ordered this one twice - it will not disappoint! 
Mango Tango - I have had Mango Tango, or some variation of this roll at other sushi spots, and this was a good roll, but nothing out of the ordinary.
Dynamite - great.  This roll has been seen on many other sushi menus, but the presentation and taste was elevated.  A hint of heat with the eel sauce, crab meat and cream cheese makes it a good roll."

My favorite was the babaganoush (no idea how to spell it...) and the mango yogurt drink. The restaurant itself isn&#39;t anything special in terms of physical aesthetic, but the food comes quickly in large quantities and literally everything was delicious. Even my sister and cousin who are picky eaters found dishes they really enjoyed! 

There were 7 of us that split the large family platter (it&#39;s the one with rice and lots of meats) and we also ordered babaganoush and hummus and something else with vegetables and we had lots of leftovers."

We stopped by here for a Sunday lunch while in the neighborhood.We ordered from their lunch specials, 3 signature rolls for $33. The server recommended a few rolls from which we chose: Godzilla Roll, Mango Tango and Sapporo Roll. Our favorite was the Godzilla, the other two had too much sauce and not enough flavor. The service was a bit slow and the server did not come to check on us after dropping off the food, which was a bummer because we wanted more wasabi. It would not be my go to place for sushi but I would come back for the Godzilla to-go."

When we were seated I noticed how fantastic the interior was. So that was a good start, but that&#39;s also where the descent began. I ordered the lunch bento box, Chicken Teriyaki. It came out in a time manner, but good God the Chicken Teriyaki was bad. Dry chicken, small portion, not hot, drizzled with a sauce which was the only thing giving it flavor. So at that point I would&#39;ve stepped out and given this place 2 stars. Luckily the sushi was a lot better! But I was grabbing pieces off of my friends plates hoping I like this place more after a couple pieces and I did. So the three stars, could be a lot better, but I will be giving it another shot soon!"

I can be picky, and seriously, I can&#39;t tell you how happy it makes me to know Sake is the real deal. After ordering the two-roll lunch special, I was so surprised at how generous the overall meal was. The miso soup and salad that accompanied my two rolls hit the spot, and the mouthwatering Boston and Spider rolls almost looked too good to eat. Beautiful presentation, extremely fresh ingredients and enough sushi for two. 

I&#39;m also always a fan of places that include photos of their speciality rolls in the menu, because no two places ever make one roll alike. One could easily order up a storm off this menu! There was also a selection of pad thai and other noodles that looked equally delectable, and its easy to let your eyes be bigger than your stomach.

The interior of the restaurant is very simplistic, clean and modern. Our server was very pleasant and attentive, and the service alone deserves five stars. Sake is great for just about anything-- to catch up with friends, have a date night or conduct a business meeting. Can&#39;t wait to try it again the next time i&#39;m in town!"

The sushi is all delicious- no complaints there. We have tried MANY of the rolls and they were all great- highly recommend sticking with that.


Unfortunately the main dishes did not meet the same standard. Their pad Thai was way too sweet and had too much sauce on it. The chicken teriyaki was overall a disappointment. On the menu next to the teriyaki dishes, there is a photo of a bento box filled with all of the typical goodies- sushi, salad, and tempura. However when the dish arrived, it was not a bento box at all. Just a regular plate of what looked like plain diced chicken breast drizzled with teriyaki sauce on top. My grandma who is Japanese and knows her bento boxes was not happy with this dish. 

The service has always been good here, and the decor inside is very nice. I think we will come back again, but hope to see some menu improvements!"

I came here with my boyfriend for a late lunch. I really enjoyed the atmosphere in this restaurant and the service was great. We ordered a couple bottles of Sake and I loved the glass sake carafe used to keep the sake cool. 

We ordered the Crab Ragoons and Edamame which was a great start to our meal. We both ordered one of their Signature Rolls and this process took us awhile because they all sounded good! I asked if the roll I wanted could not be deep fried as it suggested on the menu and they had no problem following this request. Taste and presentation are on point.

If you can, go for the lunch special, Its 3 signature rolls for $33 (something like that) and comes with miso soup and their house salad

The staff were very friendly and happy and they didn&#39;t try to cram us in the smallest table being that there were only 2 of us dining. Space is important to me. Upon entering, you&#39;ll notice a sign with some alcoholic drinks special. They sounded great but I decided on some unsweet tea. I started with the ika salad and ordered 4 rolls to share: spicy tuna, Sapporo, spicy scallop, and the rainbow roll.

The ika salad was good. Nothing too surprising as far as flavors go. It tasted the same as everywhere else I have had them from.  The rolls were also good. The spicy tuna actually had a good kick to it. It&#39;s a pet peeve of mine to order something supposedly &#34;spicy&#34; and get an end product an infant could consume because it is not even slightly within the spicy category. The spicy scallop was good but I didn&#39;t like how slimy the cucumber surrounding the scallop had made the rolls. The scallop pieces were falling out of the roll slices and I tried putting the entire thing in my mouth, only to feel like the cucumber rolled around the scallop not working out. I felt like it was a choking hazard. Either that or you have to dismantle the roll in order to eat it as it is not possible for me to get a bigger mouth. If I were to do it all over again, I would definitely skip that roll as it was my least favorite.

The sushi rolls were sizable and were reasonably priced. If ever in the area again, I would be most inclined to come back and try a different roll or 2.  I had the chocolate and green tea mochi for dessert which were delicious. I think there were tiny pieces of chocolate chips within the chocolate ice cream. The presentation was very nice.

Service was excellent here. We had to have the check split in an odd way but she got it right the first time. Many thanks go out to our waitress for the wonderful and efficient service!"

First of all, place is clean with nice decor. Service is great! I was kinda full already before I came to this place. But I still had miso soup and yellowtail roll. Miso soup was refreshing after walking all day in the city.

The Uni with quails eggs sake shooter were Hugh!  I would have preferred more sake and less ponzu sauce.

The grilled oysters wee smothered in raw garlic, not smoked as on our last visit.
My wife once again loved the lamb shops and we enjoyed a sashimi platter with Ichura Sushi!  Service was VERY attentive.  Maybe prepping for  a shift change.

It&#39;s no surprise that they are rated so highly- Kyle actually said he doesn&#39;t understand why they&#39;re not all 5 stars!!! The environment is modern, but still very relaxing. We loved the decor and indoor arcitecture. The music was current pop, which we didn&#39;t have a problem with since it wasn&#39;t overly loud. All of the associates were so friendly and helpful! They just really seemed like they enjoyed being there, even with it being a little busy! The menu was excellently designed. It showed pictures of many of the items and the descriptions were easy to understand. We ordered three different rolls to share between the two of us (ended up taking on a little more than we could handle, so we brought some leftovers home). Our first roll was Godzilla. This roll came with shrimp tempura, crab, avocado, cucumber, cream cheese, and masago, then it was topped with crunch &amp; spicy mayo and eel sauce. Those sauces were unbelievably delectable. I joked that if we were ate home I would, no question, lick that plate clean! This roll was a little filling, but we couldn&#39;t just try one on our first adventure to this wonderful sushi kingdom! The next roll we had was the Dynamite. It was a fried roll that had cream cheese, spicy tuna and avocado inside. It was then topped with baked crab meat, scallop &amp; eel sauce. Again, the sauce was incredible, but this roll overall was my favorite of the night! The insides just melted perfectly in your mouth while the toppings gave you a burst of flavor (with a hint of spice) that when mixed together was like God, Himself, created this masterpiece of joyfullness inside your mouth. I think that&#39;s the best way I can describe it anyway. Moving on, at this point I was definitely full, but my stomach was DEDICATED. Our third, and final, roll was the Fire Dragon. This roll had shrimp tempura and cheese inside (can you guess we love shrimp) and then topped with salmon and white tuna before it was baked with a mysterious special sauce. We both excitedly shoved a roll in each of our mouths, only to realize the internal temperature was scalding! It was definitely just taken out of the oven... but we didn&#39;t regret it because the sushi masters again created an amazing piece of art for our tastebuds. I only had that one piece and brought it home (and it still tasted incredible the next morning!!!)

The bottom line here- Kyle and I have gone to many, many sushi restaurants, as it is our favorite delicacy. Sake Sushi &amp; Grill is hands down one of the BEST. We are very thankful that Yelp brought us to this establishment and you can bet your butt we will be returning many more times! I have ABSOLUTELY ZERO COMPLAINTS! Thank you for all you do, Sake Sushi &amp; Grill, and please don&#39;t change one bit!"

At first it seemed odd since the restaurant is located on the corner of a small and quiet plaza, but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in. 

The atmosphere is a nice relaxing dim ambiance with semi private booths in the back. The prices are reasonable - around $7 for regular rolls and $13 for specialty rolls, and if you really want to go for it, $15+ specialty rolls. The hubs got a Tempura Udon which had a really nice broth. The tempura that comes on the side could use a dash of salt after frying, though.

I got the Tuna Natuto Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. The Naruto Roll had beautiful large pieces of tuna, which I am all for! The cucumber wrapping, however, could have been thinner - although I love a good crunch of cucumber, the thickness made it difficult to eat each piece in one bite because it was way too big. 

I&#39;m not used to the Spicy Salmon Roll having the tempura crunch inside, but it was not a bad texture. In fact, that roll - though it&#39;s just a regular roll and very simply made - was my favorite for the evening.

We also shared a Fire Pheonix Roll. It was a little hard to find a specialty roll that did not have either tempura something or crab meat in it - both of which I don&#39;t like that much - but I may have to chalk that up to &#34;then just don&#39;t eat it.&#34; It would be super nice to find a specialty roll that is vegetarian, though! In the end, the roll was still yummy and my husband liked it. The cream cheese inside the roll helped cut through the delicious heaviness of the crab and sauces.

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the grill - Totally recommend this place for a date night or casual outing!"

One of my favorite foods hands down. So I&#39;m very pleased to say that I&#39;m a fan of Sake.

I stopped in for lunch and was happy to find they have great lunch specials! I always love a good deal, but to be honest - the menu had my eyes wandering all over the place. So many delicious options. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach, so I stuck with my gut and ended up going with the 2 roll special (don&#39;t be fooled, this was still more than enough food!). 

For only $9.95 I got 2 sushi rolls, miso soup and salad. It was a hard decision, but I went with the Spider roll &amp; Sweet Potato roll. The spider roll was just as good as I expected (one of my favorite rolls regardless of where I am). I had never had any type of sushi roll that involved sweet potatoes, so needless to say I was intrigued. I loved that roll even more than the Spider! I highly suggest trying it. The miso soup is also to be mentioned. I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m pretty particular when it comes to my miso soup - only because I&#39;ve had some that&#39;s been really really great, and some that&#39;s been pretty terrible. Sake&#39;s miso soup however is delish! You better believe I cleaned that bowl before starting on my main dish.

Check. Sake really delivers it when it comes to a place you can get a great Japanese lunch without breaking the bank.

Best thing about their lunch specials is that it covers a wide variety of items from sushi to noodles to entrees to tempura and it&#39;s even available on Sunday!

Overall every item I had was good, but a couple items really stood out:

Salad - Fresh tasting and chilled to just the right temperature. The lettuce leaves were nice and crispy.

Shumai - Fried to give it a nice crisp texture, the filling was not too salty.

Alaska roll - Creamy avocado with smooth salmon are a wonderful combination.

Sweet potato roll - Surprisingly tasty, had a texture that was so meat-like I was surprised at first.

You don&#39;t have to come up with fancy dishes or serve rare items to be a good restaurant. Good execution on simple dishes with good service and a nice atmosphere make this restaurant deserving of 5-stars."

I don&#39;t remember the sushi that I ate here, but it was one of their signature rolls and was baked.  It was delicious when I added a tiny bit of wasabi.

My coworkers have been raving about this place for weeks, and when it was time for one of them to celebrate a birthday, Sake was a no-brainer.  Reservations were a breeze; we were able to set it up online with instructions for separate checks even, which was a complete bonus!  We got a private table in the back with ample room for all of us.

The sushi was very fresh and tasty, and our lunch special also included a salad and a bowl of miso soup.  The soup and salad were standard, but they really hit the spot.  Everyone ooh-ed, aah-ed, and mmm-ed over their sushi as we devoured it.  The rolls had really fresh ingredients and were nice and tight, something that this chronic soy/wasabi dipper really appreciates.   

Our attentive waitress asked if we needed anything else once the meal had concluded, and we just asked for the checks.  Apparently the staff had something different in mind.  Two servers brought out 2 platters of tempura bananas, enough for each of us to have 2, and plates, spoons, and napkins to accommodate the lot of us.  Just when I thought I couldn&#39;t eat another bite, I couldn&#39;t stop eating the crispy/creamy confection.  

Once we paid and rolled ourselves out of the restaurant, we all agreed that Sake was THE place for sushi lunch around our office.  We will be back, oh yes, we will be back."

The miso was great, the seaweed salad was perfect, and the nabiyaki udon was awesome (I enjoyed the basket for my shrimp instead of directly in the broth). It was a little cold so I needed some nabiyaki instead of sushi but based on the quality I&#39;d be back. Grandma and Grandpa picked some Americanized Asian dishes and I&#39;m not sure they really enjoyed it, I think it was too spicy for them. But what can I say, you shouldn&#39;t order that stuff.

A posh interior and piano music playing from the speakers for a sushi restaurant. Sake Sushi and Grill is probably one of the most fashionable additions to Schaumburg. 

I felt like I was underdressed and should have worn a sport coat. Rather than asking me to leave since I was in shorts, I was given a warm welcome from the manager. Expecting the menu to be overly expensive, I was shocked to see the lunch special that includes 3 maki rolls, soup, and salad for only $11.95. We ordered the sweet potato roll, spider roll, spicy tuna, fire dragon, and tempura udon. The maki rolls were prepared well from the temperature of the fish to the texture of the rice - bonus points for the right ratio of rice, creativity, and presentation. Service was great too and the manager even came by for follow up. 

If you are used to eating sushi in the city, then you&#39;ll be used to seeing $5-7 for basic rolls and $12-17 for larger fancier rolls. Even if you are not a fan of sushi, there are plenty of other items to choose from like pad thai, Mongolian beef, and fried rice.

It&#39;s hard to tell from the outside, but as soon as you walk in you&#39;re pretty much smacked in the face with the high-styling ways of Sake&#39;s bamboo-top sushi bar and custom-cut stone walls. It definitely looks like it could be a steakhouse or great date-night destination.

I came in for the lunch special (runs til 3:30 during the week), but made sure to peep their rather expansive regular menu as well. There were so many rolls, ranging from $4 through $18 for the highest signature roll, but most seemed to be around $8 range. 

There are several options for lunch specials, one is a hot menu and the other a sushi one. The sushi rolls you could pick from were really varied, which is nice since a lot of times it&#39;s only the five most basic things on the menu, but not here... plus, you get a miso soup and salad that alone almost fills you up. 

* Two sushi rolls for with a miso soup and salad - $9.95
* Three sushi rolls for with a miso soup and a salad - $11.95
* Two sushi rolls, four nigiri, a miso soup and a salad - $11.95
* Three sushi rolls, 2 nigiri, a miso soup and a salad - $13.95

I opted for the three sushi roll option and got a spicy tuna, tuna and avocado and a Boston roll. I loved the tuna and avocado. The tuna chunks were large, it wasn&#39;t overloaded with rice and it was the creamiest avocado I&#39;ve ever had. The Boston roll was good as well, though not quite what I was expecting, it was an absolutely huge roll. And the spicy tuna is normally my go-to roll, but this one wasn&#39;t mt style as it had the panko crumps surrounding the inner tuna mixture and I&#39;m just not a fan of breading flavor on my sushi rolls, though I know that&#39;s really popular with some folks. 

I started to get full after the soup and said so really only finished half of my 3-roll plate. My total with tax was $13 and I left with enough leftovers to get me through dinner. I can&#39;t speak to the dinner menu, but for lunch with a little date-night ambiance in this area, you really can&#39;t beat it."

Sake Sushi &amp; Grill has just opened three days ago and I must say it is quite the classy edition to the Schaumburg sushi scene. I&#39;m super happy there is a really nice, big option for the raw fish to enter my belly.

Sake Sushi &amp; Grill can be found in the same plaza as Smashburger next to Portillo&#39;s on Golf. They haven&#39;t yet had a grand opening so you may not have heard of them just yet but they are fully operational right now with normal hours.

The decor is so swanky and upscale. I loved the cool mosiac windows, tall bamboo shoots in the center, and chic bar area. Our waitress was super nice and we had great service throughout our lunch.

They have a menu with a wide array of options to dine on but also have a lunch special menu with strictly roll &amp; sashimi options. We both opted for the 2 rolls with soup &amp; salad for $9.95 from that menu. It&#39;s a great deal if you pick the right rolls ;) (aka compare if you&#39;d be better off getting your rolls separate). I ordered a Philly and a Sweet Potato Roll - both were well rolled and great. I have an obsession with sweet potato rolls and this one did not disappoint, delicious! The Philadelphia roll had big, fresh chunks of salmon, cream cheese and avocado - loved it! I also tried my friend&#39;s spicy tuna and it sure had heat! I also loved this roll.

My friend and I just did a test run today in hope of bringing our usual work lunch crew and Sake has passed with flying colors! We will absolutely be back and I think it&#39;s a great addition to the dining scene in Schaumburg."

There were a few flubs, but they&#39;re still in the first week of their soft launch and figuring things out. They just got their liquor license and will be offering a drink menu soon.

First, I loved the decor! There was a great ambiance thanks to the custom wall furnishings, dim lighting, and jazzy piano music that made me feel like I was in a downtown steakhouse. They also had a semi-private area in the back that looked like it&#39;d be great for parties.

The menu features a number of vegetarian rolls, including a deluxe roll topped with avocado. For tonight, I decided to go with the futo maki ($6.25 for 5pc). It was very flavorful due to most of the ingredients being inherently sweet, savory, or pickle-y (i.e. tamago, avocado, kampyo, oshinko, cucumber, and little slices of inari (the sweet tofu wrapper stuff)). Also, it was garnished with a gerbera daisy! My only complaint is the avocado was kind of squished to the side in the rolling process so most of the pieces barely had any and one piece had a whole lot, lol. But I&#39;d definitely order this again.

I was excited to see that they had a robata grill (haven&#39;t seen that anywhere in the Chi burbs), but unfortunately they&#39;re still learning how to use it. I ordered grilled portabella ($4) and what I received was 3 pieces of cold shiitake mushroom. When I requested that they fix it, it came back hot, but just barely grilled -- a tiny bit of char on the very edges instead of a nice crispiness all over, and too salty. When I relayed this they were very nice about taking it off the bill. The fried potato that came with it was really good, though! Wolf R. enjoyed all of his grilled items, but said that they weren&#39;t crispy/charred either.

The manager, Tom, was our server tonight, and he was very friendly and great to chat with. I was a bit disappointed that he didn&#39;t write down our orders, and there ended up being a few mistakes; however, he really put in the effort to make things right. Deducing that I was vegetarian, he gave me some tamago slices on the house.

I&#39;m looking forward to returning after a number of weeks to see how the place matures, and I hope they figure out their grill because my fellow Schaumburgians (Schaumburgers?) really need to know about robata!"

I&#39;ll start by saying that I was very impressed with the atmosphere.  The place was very clean and the design pleasantly modern.  My date and I were seated at a cozy corner table and greeted by a smiling, friendly waitress.  I really can&#39;t complain about the service, as I have seen other reviewers do.  

So why only three stars?  Because the sushi was mediocre at best.  I am by no means an expert, but I tend to be a nigiri fan.  As such, I will usually order the Sushi Deluxe or equivalent at most sushi places.  As is the case here, it usually involves a selection of nigiri along with a California roll.  I like it because it gives a sampling of different fish, without having to order pieces individually.  I was massively disappointed when our order came and I saw that four of the ten pieces of nigiri we&#39;re salmon.  Granted, this was a Sunday night, which is probably the worst time of the week to get sushi, especially nigiri, but if they had some sort of fish shortage in the kitchen, they could have at least asked me if I was okay with the lack of variety.

The nigiri itself was bland.  Not overly fishy or offensive, but it was obviously not the freshest.  Again, this could be attributed to it being a Sunday, but it was still disappointing.  The California roll was equally uninspired, and the pieces kept falling apart as I picked them up.

My date, on the other hand, ordered a couple maki rolls and said they were delicious.  Whether she meant it or was saying it for my sake, I&#39;m not sure.

So, to summarize my experience:  great atmosphere, decent service, but sushi that couldn&#39;t quite live up to its setting."

-My friend cannot have shellfish and she made sure he didn&#39;t get any even in the sushi that normally came with it. 
-Pina colada was pretty good
-I ordered  a California and a Godzilla roll. Both were good, but they are huge. My jaw got tired of chewing such huge pieces so I had to take some home. 
-Our waitress was a little slow later into the meal. 
-My friend was impressed with the quality
-It was a bit pricey.

They have a great selection of signature rolls. I prefer good, fresh fish to the deep-fried fish in rolls with lots of hot sauce and other sauces that overpower the fish. There Nigiri and Sashimi are fantastic.

The staff was friendly and knowledgable.  It&#39;s rare for management to spend time with customers without reason. Their manager personally spent the time to explain their menu."

Love that&#39;s the sushi is not all just a bunch of rice like some other places. They have a huge menu so for anyone that doesn&#39;t like sushi to much there is so much more to choose from. The inside is really nice and clean. They have a cute bar area to with a TV so would be great to watch some games at! Prices are very fair.

Prices are comparable for the quality. Signature rolls are $15 or so, but the rolls are very fresh. Atmosphere is relaxing and inviting. I started with the Miso soup. Excellent taste. 

I asked the friendly waitress what she recommended even though I already wanted the often reviewed Fire Dragon Roll. Excellent baked roll with a lot of taste bud stimulation. The red sauce complemented the fish. I think i am going to ask for jalapeno slices next time to make it spicier.

After deciding what my tastes were, I took her recommendation and tried the Sunny Roll. I was not let down. The freshness was exactly to my taste. The wasbi sauce was the perfect compliment. Wouldn&#39;t change a thing.

With a beverage I paid $40, but I enjoyed the quality. I will be back."

Had it been sushi, it would have also been the worst sushi ever!  The white tuna was so cold that it might have just been defrosted and it was water logged, the (regular) tuna was tasteless as was the salmon.  The snapper was just OK... I also got Kani and shrimp... which person that orders the most expensive deluxe sashimi wants reconstituted fish in their plate?  Certainly not me.  I have to guess the great reviews come from people who do not get to taste the fish under the gooey, sweet and overdone rolls.

There were a lot of choices, a lot of runners up but the winner was ultimately picked based on its proximity to Gameworks and because of some of the things written by all my friends on Yelp.  From start to finish, this place made my special meal just that....special.

We were immediately seated and I wanted to choose a special drink to celebrate the day.  Fortunately for me, Sake had lots of choices but I went with some sort of cherry martini.  I ordered a variety of rolls - The Sunny Roll, Spider Roll and Spicy Scallop Roll.  I also ordered a couple of salmon sushi just because this is how I generally judge the freshness of the fish.  The rolls were all good - the sunny roll had great fresh fish on it but I didn&#39;t love the sauce.  The salmon was super fresh by the way.  

Without knowing it, my husband tipped the manager off that it was my birthday.  To celebrate the occasion they brought me some tempura fried banana.  It was a great touch and the waitress and manager wished me a happy birthday and gave me a coupon to use the next time."

I pulled a Brittney - oops, I did it again. 

I met Candice G here as I was hankering for sushi in a really insane way and I had Sake bookmarked for months and months. When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the decor - modern, clean line, pretty fixtures and very low lighting. If you were to avert your eyes from the parking lot side, you wouldn&#39;t think you were in a Schaumburg strip mall just a stone&#39;s throw away from David&#39;s Bridal. 

Service was particularly good, with our server being friendly and just attentive enough over the lunch hour. As for the eats, as mentioned above, I pulled a 180 and decided to forgo my original intention of the (very) affordable lunch special. Instead I opted for two rolls - the Mexican roll (jalapeno, yellowtail, cilantro, avocado) and the Spicy Crispy Tuna roll (cucumber, crunch &amp; jalapeno topped w/ tuna, white tuna, cilantro, sesame oil, ponzu sauce). Both rolls were fresh, filling and tasty. If I can nitpick, I would have liked a bit more heat and bit less rice in the Mexican roll. However, the Spicy Crispy Tuna was completely delicious. The crunch was perfection and the hearty chunks of fish were delightful. 

It&#39;s also worth noting that you can order online through their very clean site for &#34;express dine in&#34; or pick up. I&#39;ll be back soon!"

The service was quick and we had our food shortly after ordering. The burritos were both really good. The meat was juicy and flavorful.

Today, I got a chicken taco and a lechon taco with chips and a drink. I ate in and wasn&#39;t aware that I got free chips and salsa as part of the deal, or for that matter, table service. Next time I&#39;ll leave a tip when I pay... or pay after the meal is done. Whoops. Total cost: $6.10.

The chips are still homemade and still fantastic, and the salsa that comes with the chips is just as good as ever (today, I particularly noticed the crunchy raw onion and fresh cilantro). 

The tacos in particular have taken a step up in quality. I love that the small, soft corn tortilla shells actually taste like corn. There was plenty of meat and veggies on the tacos.

And speaking of the meat, I deem the lechon taco 100% Filipino-approved. What a fantastic, smoky cut of meat. Diced small, crunchy bits where some skin made its way in. This the perfect taco. The chicken taco didn&#39;t lack, either; it was pulled dark meat, so far as I could tell, seasoned nicely.

Combine this great food with awesome prices, and you have a place that I&#39;d recommend to anyone in Carol Stream."

We tried to get something different, so we can try a variety of food. My husband had the steak burrito. He enjoyed it because besides the steak, it had beans and spanish rice inside. My son had the Pastor torta. He is a big guy at 6&#39;4&#34; and he found it very filling. My other son had several of the tacos: chicken, pastor and lechon. All were great! 

I ordered the Poblano burrito. At first there was some confusion, but then I understood that I can choose any filling of burrito and then they add the poblano to it.  I opted for the chicken poblano burrito. I could not have made a better choice. The burrito was filled to the brim and then the placed a roasted poblano pepper on the burrito and covered it with melted cheese. OMG...to die for....yummy!!!!

Both the green and red sauces were good, but I liked the red better....my husband, the green. When I walked in to pay for the order I placed over the phone, the lady was very nice. I informed her that this was our first time and that I had ordered plenty food to try for our family of four. I did not want her to think my husband and I could possibly eat all of the food. She was happy to hear we were trying their food. When our food was ready, she informed me that she gave us free chips and salsa to add to our meal. That was a nice surprise.

I picked up carryout menus for myself and each son to take home. I know we all will be ordering from there again. Homemade, good food, at reasonable prices!!!!"

Nachos have some weird squeeze cheese. Tacos are ok, burrito suizo was yucky.
It wasn&#39;t so much the burritos fault though, but the salsa. The salsa is just bad. It doesn&#39;t taste like salsa, it tastes like spaghetti sauce.

However, in spite of all the bad, their guacamole is excellent. Fresh, and with big chunks of avocado in it.

Why are the tacos so good? Well because they offer them the real Mexico City street food way where they grill two tortillas along with your choices of meat and then serve the tacos very simply with onion, cilantro and a squeeze of lime. Thats how they are supposed to be served so you can really taste the delicious meat! 

Of course you can get the americanized version with shreded lettuce, cheese and tomato but the people that come here are not the type looking for a Burrito Bell Grande so I haven&#39;t seen anyone order them the Taco Bell way.

I will say that the grill and kitchen are spotless and the cooks are good at making this food. My favorite meats for the tacos are the cubes of steak or the marinated pork. The steak is simply seasoned and seared and the pork is marinated in a red sauce with cubes of pinapple and is delicious.

If you want Taco Bell then I will never see you because I will be at Gary Burritos."

The food was absolutely fantastic! I ordered three tacos; Pork, Steak and the Chorizo &amp; Egg, sooo good. The meat on all three was tender, juicy and packed with flavor. It was also abundant, for a $2 taco, you sure do get a lot of meat!

We were also given complimentary chips and salsa while we waited for my tacos, three types of salsa!

We were the only people inside at the time, the place was very clean and the staff was attentive and very polite/friendly. I am already looking forward to my next visit!"

It&#39;s a clean restaurant with a small amount of seating on the inside.

I decided to try both a chicken burrito and a steak taco. The steak taco I received was excellent, the steak meat was juicy and not too grizzly and had a nice flavor to it. The tortilla used had a nice taste, the lettuce was fresh and the cheese was good.  This was a very solid steak taco.

The burrito I received was a slightly different story. First off the burrito&#39;s here are huge, if you&#39;re very very hungry for only 4.50 this is one huge burrito. However, it has a much higher percentage of rice and bean dip than other places I&#39;ve tried. There&#39;s onions in the burrito, which I wasn&#39;t used to seeing mixed in with the lettuce. The chicken inside was nice and like the steak was soft and juicy. Overall the taste of the rice and bean dip overpowered everything else on this burrito.

Overall and especially considering the value, Gary Burritos isn&#39;t bad a place to go. I liked the taco and I would come back here, though I would be unlikely to try the burrito on a future visit."

The menu isn&#39;t super large, but that is probably a good thing.  What they do, they do well.  It is a family owned joint, I went there when a mother and her son who couldn&#39;t be more than 14 was helping out.  It is great to see a family trying to make their own way and doing it the best they can.

The tacos and for that matter the rest of the menu is wonderful.  I ordered extra to put in the fridge and I am glad I did to have a little late night food.  My only beef is their red &#34;mild&#34; sauce like most other smaller taco places was a little weak.  If that was better, honestly, I would never go anywhere else for a taco or burrito.

If you haven&#39;t gone there yet, try them out.  They are not super easy to find, in a little strip mall next to West Suburban Bank.  Support this place so they can stay around and provide great food and support their family.  I will probably be back tomorrow."

I didn&#39;t try it right away when it officially opened as the name kind of threw me off as it did for another poster until my boyfriend pointed out that it was named &#34;Gary&#39;s Burritos&#34; because it&#39;s on Gary...DUH.  Okay so with that aside, I have to say, that as an avid authentic mexican food seeker from Southern California, I was so abundantly pleased when the green sauce was actually tangy, fresh, and flavorful!!!  I usually get the red sauce b/c it has more kick but even then i tend to watch how spicy the red sauce can be...but at Gary&#39;s...it&#39;s pretty damn good - either way: green sauce, red sauce, they are both a win.

The service staff have been nothing but friendly, courteous and willing take orders when they had already packed up with purse and all! for the night!  I say that&#39;s some dedication.  I love that I live close to it but it can also be a bad thing since I&#39;ve been going there once or twice a week since my boyfriend ventured there the first time a few weeks ago!  

The other noticeables that I appreciate about the steak tacos (cannot imagine eating it &#34;american style&#34; - ALWAYS have to have it in its original glory: cilantro and onions!  it seems that there is less sodium than in other Mexican authentic hole in the walls I&#39;ve been too which is nice when I&#39;m drenching my steak tacos in the green sauce.  

Also, the jalapenos and carrots are very spicy and tangy.  I made the fatal mistake of biting into the entire jalapeno after eating the mild marinated carrots and onions...i bit into a whole jalepeno, drooling from the carrots and onions and i went to another side of the world.  I had to guzzle milk to soothe the heat in my mouth for 10-15 minutes, then a fudgesicle to cool off a still burning mouth.  The Jalapenos are no joke!

I highly recommend this local and new restaurant.  Give it a try, it&#39;s very affordable!"

Anywho, I met a friend here for lunch last week and was pleasantly surprised! I thought it was tasty, authentic Mexican food. The complimentary chips and salsa were really tasty and I really enjoyed the chicken taco and steak taco that I had. They also brought us several different whole jalapeño peppers. I&#39;m

Gary Burritos is definitely in my rotation. I stopped by GBs on a Friday I was working from home for lunch. When trying a new Mexican restaurant for the first time I always try the chicken tacos. I tend to think of it as a benchmark of sorts.

We started out with the complimentary bowl of chips and salsa. Everything seemed to be made fresh. I didn&#39;t SEE the chips being made but the salsa was for sure.  I believe we ended up finishing two bowls of chips.

Then out came the tacos. They were fantastic and immediately convinced me of a return trip. They were complimented by a side of refried beans 
and rice.  The meal was great and the service was very friendly. 

I was very happy with my first trip to GB and will definitely be back."

As well as their tacos Al Pastor, I am from Chicago where taco joints are a dime a dozen and it is real easy to find good tacos.  Curb appeal wise, I didn&#39;t think this place had what I was looking for but when my husband finally tried it after we have lived in Carol Stream for over 6 years we were upset at ourselves for &#34;juding the book by its cover&#34; =) .

Great steak tacos they are actually full of meat.  No they aren&#39;t huge but that&#39;s how these places usually are.  I have no complaints on the size as of the tacos.  Also their salsa is very good.  Their salsa is thick yes but guess what thats because they aren&#39;t putting a bunch of water in it to make one tomato last a week.  I appreciate that for once I can taste the tomato.  So the reference to spaghetti sauce is a bit surprising as a Mexicana who knows what salsa is supposed to taste like.  But everyone has their preference and they have more than one variety.  

I have yet to find a spot better than this for steak tacos. Again as for the rest of the menu can&#39;t say much.  This is our spot for tacos that are quickly done and haven&#39;t had any problems with service."

I had tried Chipotle and Qdoba, but wasn&#39;t satisfied. I had a coworker recommend Burrito Brothers in Glendale Heights, but I wasn&#39;t happy with that. I found this place here on yelp. I went in and liked what I found. A nice little dive where I could watch my food be made. I ordered a beef burrito and a large drink, and walked out the door for $7. I get to work and bite into this treat. So full of flavor and a filling meal for so little money. I had a mild food block I hit about 20 minutes into my shift.

I skipped my normal burrito place (Burrito Fantastico in Roselle) to checkout this Gary Burrito place.

Maybe I read too many reviews and got overhyped or maybe a lot of you just haven&#39;t had good mexican but this place is just &#34;eh&#34;. I suppose for cantina-style tacos it works since you can&#39;t really screw up corn tortilla, steak, cilantro, and onion. But american style was sub-par.

First off Burritos with Rice is an instant point off. A lot of the mexican places in the Loop use rice in their burritos, but I&#39;ve never seen it in the suburbs until now. Rice does NOT belong in a mexican burrito.

The rest was just so-so..  Nothing here to make me go back. It looked like it was a small family business just starting out and I appreciate that. But some tweaks on the recipe are needed. The horchata, on the other hand was fantastic... so thats something. 

If you really want a good burrito in the area, Burrito Fantastico in roselle on lake street is very good. If you want an amazing burrito, Los Burritos Tapatios in Hanover park is the best in dupage.

I dont like to give bad reviews, but sometimes fair criticism is needed to cause improvement. Just make your food taste like El Famous.. instant win."

I&#39;m eating a cold slice now as I&#39;m writing this. I will say they have the best thin crust sausage pizza I have ever tasted and will ever taste anywhere else. PURE. PERFECTION.
The sauce is addicting. I could drink a gallon of the stuff. Don&#39;t you dare steal my corner pieces fool!
The crust is great and stays dry. You would think day old bacon pizza would be a bit nasty. NOPE. Their bacon pizza is magical. Not greasy at all!
Cheese and spices completes it and makes a pizza that&#39;s best in town.

Pricing is cheap too! Forget Dominho&#39;s. Spend a little more and get something made with LOVE.

I told him that I missed read the review and meant to order the western bbq pizza. He explained it was a favorite and I should try it. I am now writing my first review for the bacon pizza while waiting for the western. 2 pizzas in 1 week equals HIGHLY RATED.

Incredible prices! Outstanding Italian fare. We like the stuffed peppers, stuffed shells, pizza, and even nachos. Great selection of appetizers for a party! Also, the house salad dressing is delicious.And, they catered an event for us which went off exceedingly well. Friendly staff too.

They have great sub sandwiches, and do a fantastic job catering."

I first came because I saw some good reviews and someone suggested trying the bacon pizza.  I&#39;ve now have had it three times and it is my go to pizza. Way better than pepperoni. The best part was no grease . Crispy bacon no grease,? Oh yeah.

I&#39;ve also tried the western pizza which is a bbq pizza. Super good. Can&#39;t beat it. It&#39;s a close close which is better , bacon or bbq. 

The owner is nice and has a good memory. Always nice when you go to an establishment and they take the time to get to know there customers. 

Highly highly recommend"

My delivery order of a thin crust pizza and an order of breaded cauliflower was delivered hot and promptly. However one reason why it was hot is because I suspect that the food was precooked and reheated. At least that is the way it tasted. The cauliflower was virtually tasteless, a total waste. I threw out about three quarters of the order. The pizza was not much better, quite bland tasting and it did not taste freshly prepared from scratch. It was more like a store bought frozen pizza.

The prices are low but this is an example of where you get what you pay for. Maybe cheap people will accept bad food as long as it&#39;s inexpensive. Many others will not. There are numerous alternatives. Skip this place."

The atmosphere is quite nice.  It is spacious so even when they are busy you do not feel cramped.  Can get loud if it is a busier time, but what place like this couldn&#39;t.
Lots of beer available (48 on draft) and tons of liquor, wine and menu specials every day.

Let me start the actual review with the food. I ordered two items Cheese Curds &amp; Steak and wedge salad.
Cheese Curds were some of the best I ever had.  and the 2 sauces that come with it! Damn it makes me want to go back today.
Steak and Wedge salad was outstanding - The steak cooked perfectly to my desires. And the wedge was great! included full strips of Bacon!!!

Now to the most important part, and the part I was concerned with the most going in, the Service.

Some of these reviews were just horrible and I was nervous headed in.  Working in a customer service field i have extremely high standards when it comes to service.

My server&#39;s name was Adam.  He was quite possibly the best server I have ever had.  High energy and excited to be at his job, he was very friendly and had a ton of recommendations.  He is happy to be there and loves the places he works for.  He made sure any concerns I had were taken care of and that I was always happy.  He was just the right amount of attentive. If yo want a great experience, you should ask for Adam he will genuinely care about your experience and make sure have a great one."

Let&#39;s see...here&#39;s just two of my many awful experiences. (Why do I comeback you ask? A lot of my friends like to hang out here. I don&#39;t know why.) 

1) sat on their patio and my friend waited over a half hour for one cocktail. Not exaggerating. They didn&#39;t comp it or apologize either. 

2) had a waitress that was noteably high on her shift. Forgot to get many items we asked her. Took forever to bring check when asked.

The breading on the pickles was good but we did not care for the pickles.  They were a bread and butter type pickle and still had a lot of cucumber taste.  The cheese curds were ok but the cheese seemed a little salty.  The place itself was clean and big with a large bar with lots of tvs.  It looked like they had a party room too.  I would probably give it another chance and try something else from the menu but our first visit  we were not to impressed.

While the food itself really won&#39;t win any awards, the spacious interior, easy parking, friendly service, good prices, and good draft beer selection help bump up the restaurant up a few stars.

When you walk in, the first thing you notice is the massive dining room (with an impressive sized private room in the back) that is well lit with comfortable seating and a slightly upscale decor. The TVs are a bit small and volume a little low for the normal bar, but this does help contribute to a more friendly family atmosphere. There are tons of specials for each day of the week (and special events on top of that), which give many options of both food and beverages that you can consume without spending a ton of money. This can be anything from a $3.75 beer of the month to $2.50 Miller lite to $5.50 wings and fries to $5 burger. Best thing I noticed about these specials is that they really apply to anything you see on the menu -- which takes away a lot of complexity you see in promotions.

The food selection is similar to what you&#39;ll find in other nicer bars in the area with a slightly upscale feel and use of better ingredients. In particular I really enjoyed the beer-braised beef, crispy beer-battered chicken melt (with Merkt&#39;s cheese), and beer-battered icelandic cod. 

With the great selection at great prices, I&#39;ll definitely be back here again soon. Only real criticism I have is that I wish they did a karaoke night and a trivia night :)"

There were advertised samples for $1 but they limit you to 3 per table regardless of how many people at your table.  There were 4 in my party so we&#39;d have to figure out who doesn&#39;t get to sample?! Really weird.  And, when I go to a place with so many awesome beers on the menu, I want a flight, I want to pick the most interesting 4-6 beers and taste away! What&#39;s the point otherwise!?

The food was good, some of it great (amazing brussels sprouts), but if we wanted more, it would never have been offered.  Our server was not mean or rude, but NEVER offerred anything.  I would have even ordered another beer if she ever asked us if we wanted something else.

At the end another employee (possibly a manger?) stopped by to ask how everything was.  The entire table gave the expected lukewarm response, and the guy just walked away.  WHAT?!"

I was hoping they would have beers brewed locally, which unfortunately they don&#39;t, but they do have over 50 beers on tap, which is awesome! They also have a big drink menu book so if you don&#39;t want beer you have many other choices. 

I usually start my night off with a Bloody Mary, but there was no price in the drink book. I decided to order anyways and it came to be $10! For ONE Bloody Mary....yikes...it definitely wasn&#39;t the greatest Bloody Mary I&#39;ve had, very high on the tomato juice,  but the garnish was nice with olive, pickle, cheese, and a salami triangle.

They have advertised that their samples are $1 a piece, but we were quickly informed by our server that there was a limit to 3 samples per table, which meant that one of the four of us at the table wouldn&#39;t even be able to sample one beer prior to making up our mind what we wanted to drink. This doesn&#39;t seem to make sense when you have so many beers in tap. Oh well. We took to then ordering full size glasses of beer, then find out that two of the beers (out of the four of us) were not available. We seemed to have an outdated draft list so our server informed us and we ordered other items. 

We ordered some appetizers and took to enjoying our beers. The funny thing is that after we received our food our server only appeared to take our empty beer glasses, but never took additional beer orders and selectively filled water glasses between the four of us. Eventually someone else wandered past and took out out of date beer list and didn&#39;t return with another until after we got our check.

This would be a great place, if they improved their service. We would have purchased additional beer if they have had better service. Instead, we walked across the street to Emmett&#39;s where we experienced way better service. Sorry, you have lost our business!"

We looked around and noticed that not many people had food on their table - never a good sign.  

We finally were seated out on the patio.  Then, after  10 minutes of watching servers walk in and out counting tables, we figured they were squabbling over who would take our table, so we did them a favor and left.

I&#39;ve been wanting to check out this place before it was built in Palatine at their Highwood location. Perfect timing to be in downtown Palatine and Taphouse Grill being a block away from where we were. 

When we entered we were shocked to see it quite busy for a mid-Sunday afternoon. Loved the TV&#39;s at the bar and also right in front of the booth we sat in. I can totally envision us coming back here for Bears games! They have quite an extensive menu including Deep Fried Bacon?! YUM!! I didn&#39;t order that today, but maybe another time as well as the burger challenge which my husband is totally up for next time he is really hungry and dining here. 

This being our first time dining here led us to ordering a couple burgers and chicken fingers. My husband ordered the Farmhouse Burger with Kobe Beef instead of Angus (up charge of 2.50 for this) and a side of tater tots. His burger tasted awesome!! I sampled his tater tots which tasted great as well. My neighbor was very satisfied with his standard burger and fries. I ordered their Sam Adams Battered Chicken Fingers. The chicken fingers I found to be mediocre and dare I say it was too over fried? It was good along with their sweet mustard, but next time I might try something else.

My husband was the only one to order any booze and had Dragon&#39;s Milk on draft which he throughly enjoyed. They had a very extensive beer list that is constantly changing. 

We&#39;re looking forward to coming back here again for food, drinks, and beers."

Tim and Nate over at Tap House contacted me after my initial review. They took care of my husband and I by providing us with an amazing dinner, with great service by Anne. We are very appreciative for them contacting us to reconcile our last visit. It shows they really care about their customers. We also want to thank Anne for her great service and making sure everything was out in a timely manner and that our evening was enjoyable. Thank you again to Tim and Nate. 

****Initial review****
Let me start off by saying that I normally love this place. The food is always great. The atmosphere is alive, the waitstaff is normally on point. However, yesterday my family had Erin as our server. I don&#39;t know if she was having an off day, but the service was horrible. She never really checked on us. She brought my husband another beer without him ordering it. she did not check with us after we received our meal. We waited about 10 minutes after we were finished to even see her to ask for boxes. Our daughter who ordered a kids meal did not get her dessert. The whole experience put a bad taste in our mouth, and we normally come visit your restaurant every few weeks.  There are many other places in this area that serve the same food as you do, but we chose you."

I had been unimpressed with Tap House the last 2 or so times I came in, but I think I was ordering the wrong thing. I had been ordering oddball stuff, like flatbreads or mac&#39;n&#39;cheese. This is a burger and a beer sort of place. This most recent time, I had sriracha wings. Correct decision! They turned out great, for some absurd pittance like 4,50 for a dinner portion (they&#39;re a daily special). 

The beer menu is great - Emmett&#39;s brews their own beer, but has far less variety. Tap House has ~30-50 beers on the menu. The beers are a little expensive, but ce la vie, it&#39;s Chicagoland. Tons upon tons of variety. 

Oh, also, and this is definitely an eew factor in my book, this place gets crazy, retarded loud on weekends. If you&#39;re prone to headaches or didn&#39;t much like frat parties in college, you may not like this place after 7PMish."

Today I sat by and watched saddened by a couple who does not understand the difference between great customer service and unrealistic expectations. People should know the venue where they are dining and understand the limitations and have fair expectations of both the establishment and its employees. As I watched this couple unfairly treat Kelly (over issues that were unreasonable the price of the food) I only had to ask myself why would you go out if you you know that the world cannot live up to your &#34;your&#34; expectations. Even sadder is the establishment has no choice but to &#34;comp&#34; the meal or deal with this couples tirade on social media.

Now normally lately, I&#39;ve been doing the My Fitness Pal thing and I&#39;m proud to say I&#39;m down 18 lbs. Not quite as good as a couple of my buddies are doing, but still nothing to shake a stick at. Anyway, I decided that coming to the Tap House was absolute reason enough to not count calories (shut up, you don&#39;t know me!).

And so, I went on a food-spedition through Tap House Grill&#39;s menu, sampling the brussels sprouts appetizer, the beer cheese soup, and at the recommendation of my table mates who are regulars; the BLT. 

Everything was delicious. Everything was plentiful. Everything had amazing flavors and was just the perfect amount of ingredients. 

The server was very friendly and kept our drinks filled, and the atmosphere was the perfect compliment for hanging out on a warm summer day. I only wish I wasn&#39;t there with work so we could&#39;ve partaken in some of the amazing drink specials.

We&#39;ve sat inside and out on the patio and have enjoyed our meals.  But the Friday that we recently went, we tried some different dishes and the meals were outstanding.  I had the flatbread with hot Italian sausage.  It was great.  Almost like a meaty pizza.  We also had the ribs and chili fries.  The ribs are the way I like them - tender, but you have to coax them off of the bone.  I find if the ribs are falling off the bone, they&#39;re usually fatty also.  So these ribs were perfect!  I would order them again.  And the chili fries were enough for a large man or several small boys.  We couldn&#39;t finish them.  I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve changed the way they do things or I&#39;ve just been ordering the boring dinners, but this trip was exponentially better than previous visits.Typing this is making me hungry and now I want to go back again!"

Food is decent- some things better than others. We thought it was kinda expensive for bar food and the size portions.

Excellent draft beer choices and a few ok by the glass wines. Easy free parking too.

We have had some pretty mixed experiences here, particularly late at night but they will serve food until 1am and later if they want. CALL first. And don&#39;t let them serve you cold fries, send them back.

However, two of waitresses are horrendous and do not understand the concept of providing good customer service. It&#39;s frustrating because sometime servers feel entitled to tips for simply showing up but when they have nasty attitudes the last thing I want to do is leave them a decent tip.. I had this one waitress multiple times(short/ chubby/ 30s) who is soooo inattentive every single time she has served me!!! I&#39;m not sure how she got this gig but customer service is not her strong point. Then there is another waitress (heavily tattooed/maybe piercings? whatever..) who literally made my entire table feel like we were inconveniencing her. She comes up to the table after us sitting there for 15+ minutes and doesn&#39;t apologize or greet us, she snaps &#34;what do you want to drink?&#34; mixed with heavy sighing/ looks like she hates her life/no smile...sorry sweetheart, you signed up for this job. 

On the flip side, I&#39;ve also had the pleasure of having AWESOME servers here who provide EXCELLENT customer service. I think from now on I will request to not be served by the Debbie-downers who can&#39;t crack a smile even though they are paid for it. yikes."

mostly though, the service is alllllways wretched. without fail. absolutely terrible. it&#39;s especially daft on their collective part because i would probably have 1-2 more beers per stay if the servers actually came around and/or delivered orders in reasonable time... multiplied by the rest of my party (and maybe most of the parties there) and they&#39;re really losing out on good money.  experience ranges from the typical server-disappearing-for-half-an-hour to juggling too many tables to properly check on you to legit not bringing silverware when delivering your meals (and then not coming back for twenty minutes so you finally have to go ask someone else).

the food is repeatedly underwhelming: mediocre presentations of a &#39;master of none&#39; menu concept.  don&#39;t get me wrong, i can get down with some good bar food, this just isn&#39;t good.

There isn&#39;t much to say, except that the food ranges from cheese curds that tasted like they came right out of the freezer to my margherita pizza that was a greasy, flavorless mess.

Others in the party had burgers that were overcooked coupled with cold, stale fries.

Sure, the beer selection is good (and actually the service is too), but the food is not.

It&#39;s also pretty loud in this place. Playing dance music at a level that makes it feel like you&#39;ll transform into a club space on a Saturday night on a Sunday afternoon is not a good thing.

You&#39;ll get better food across the street at Emmett&#39;s and you&#39;ll get better food and a comparable beer selection a couple of blocks west at Durty Nellie&#39;s.

Ordered the BBQ chicken flatbread and chicken was cold on the inside, the waitress then took my food back to &#34;reheat&#34; when I expected a new Flatbread to come out.  So needless to say I had a very upset stomach later that evening.  

Figuring that they had gotten their kinks out I visited again months later and ordered grilled chicken tenders that were good until I hit a piece of chicken that was under cooked and squishy inside.  Obviously they haven&#39;t gotten any better, as I also attempted to sit on the patio when they had 8 people inside and 3 open tables outside and was told I needed to wait and provide my cell to get a text when ready.

My husband and I waited for this place to open for months. We were so excited to try it. We would frequently stop by to check out the progress as they were building it out since we lived walking distance from the Tap House. The location and atmosphere are awesome, but unfortunately as soon as we saw the menu we were concerned as the first sign of lackluster (often frozen) food is an endless menu. No kitchen can be great at making THAT many items. Sure enough, it was disappointing meal after disappointing meal. We went back on numerous occasions because we wanted to like it since it was so convenient, but every time we have gone we have had a terrible experience (waiter goes missing for 30+ minutes, waitress messed up order and really did not care, and the worst and last time I tried it my food was brought out with a long hair laying across my dish - GROSS!!!)

Food is ok. Beer selection is very respectable. Prices a bit higher, but on par.

Service can use some training. The initial stages of a host got us seated quickly with menus, but nobody came around to take orders. There&#39;s at least 7 servers all hanging by the bar and a few that would walk past us. None of them came over. I prefer to refrain giving the eye or the wave, but if we were to catch our train on time and get some beer and food in our tummies, I guess we do what we need to do.

My main reasons for this are the fact that the appetizers (fried pickles and pretzels in my case) were AMAZING. I chose the Chicken Caesar Press and it was pretty good. 
The downside was that my bacon was extremely hard. But that&#39;s a minor thing that could be fixed. I took it out of my sandwich and ate it alone and I have no negative reviews about how it tasted. 
Unfortunately the appetizers are the only thing that really sets this place apart from any other restaurants. Nevertheless, they are indeed something I&#39;d come back for. 
My only other negative is the service. Personally, I&#39;m someone who&#39;s constantly happy and the servers here seem like they are just flat out tired. My constructive criticism for them is hey..be a little more happy about doing your job. Whether you love it or not."

This place just recently opened, and I wanted to see their beer selection. I was excited for a new craft beer place so close to my house.

The place was incredibly busy with the private rooms filled with fantasy football drafts. The beer list was extensive, but I would generally like more detail of the selections. We just split some appetizers for food, and everything we had was great.

We tried the pretzels (mustard was better than the cheese), the Exotic wings (sweet slightly spicy sauce), Tot-chos (chili cheese nachos on tator tots), and truffle fries. My wife had a chicken sandwich. The sandwich she specifically ordered without cheese came with cheese on it. Not a big deal. They remade the sandwich and brought it out. The kitchen must have been backed up because it took a long time for the food to come out.

We each had a few beers, but you had to order in advance because it took a while for our waitress to bring the next beer. 

Overall, there is a lot of potential for this place as the food and beer is good. Prices are a bit high, but what you would expect for craft beers. If they can get the service smoothed out, I will definitely be frequenting this place."

Sunday afternoon -- bears/packers game-- its going to be busy!  Our waitress did have some trouble remembering things and that can get frustrating, believe me, I don&#39;t like having to remind somebody that all I need is a diet coke.  They did seem understaffed though.  Food was good, I enjoyed my sliders and my $5 bloody was REALLY good.  Everybody else seemed super happy with their food as well."

It is a big place on the inside a variety of seating options from tables to booths to the bar. They have a nice beer list organized by category. The menu is extensive with something for everyone. I recommend the boneless wings which are fresh and delicious! Also they have plenty of tv&#39;s for watching the games. I would recommend it if you are looking for a large sports bar with lots of menu options and a nice atmosphere.

Why doesn&#39;t this place have 4+ stars?

Cons: Could offer some more light/healthy items to offset the abundance of yummy cheese and bacon and fried items. And not sure if it is, but it feels like a chain."

Brian steered me in the right direction by describing the beer and helping me to expand my taste in beer. I now go there and try a new beer everytime.

I never realized their menu was so unique and outrageous. I had the eggs plosion sandwich it has Mertks cheddar cheese ,2 eggs, some awesome bacon and I had it with a side of tater tots. This sandwich was easily big enough for two people. It would be great for breakfast but you could eat it any day of the time from a noontime sandwich to tide you over for two people or that late night craving after you&#39;ve had a few beers. If you get this sandwich it is truly a foot long and the bread is very crispy the eggs are perfectly done and it just goes down really good with any beer."

The food is upscale pub food with many different appetizers which we are working our way through them.  The regular fare is great.  We have never had a bad meal here.

The patio is now open and you can sit out near the street and wave to your friends passing by.

It is very large and a great place to hold meetings in their two rooms in the back or in their large side tables.

The service is really good.  This week the server kept coming back to see if we needed anything.  Also, one of the owners stopped by to see if everything was OK.

Our waitress made up for the wait with her awesome personality, she did check on us just enough and I was happy with her. I should have ordered something other than the adobe chicken wrap. I think it was the combination of the veggies with the chicken, and the sauce was quite oily. That being said, I have tried food at another Tap House and remember it being quite awesome. I wouldn&#39;t rule out this place thanks to the extensive menu! The portions are huge, the beer list is fantastic and categorized for those wanting to try new brews."

Three in our party were over 21 but had vertical orientation IDs from Iowa. The vertical orientation is issued when the person is under 21, however they do not expire in Iowa until your 23rd birthday. They even have a box that says &#34;Under 21 until mm/dd/yyyy&#34;. When we tried explaining to the manager that if he looked at the &#34;Under 21 until&#34; box,  he would see that we were in fact of legal serving age. He said that &#34;Taphouse does not serve anyone under 21. When we again tried to show him that we were 22, he then said that vertical orientation IDs are easier to fake, and he believed ours to be fake. He was anything but polite during this whole situation and would interrupt us when trying to explain that we were of legal drinking age with valid government issued identification. We walked a block to Dirty Nellie&#39;s and had no issues getting drinks and food.

Edit: Owner contacted me to resolve the situation three days ago. I provided my phone number so that we could discuss their policy. Have not yet heard back."

The concept seemed good and I liked the idea of having a good place where one could get a wide selection of craft beer. The decor was nice, but I came away feeling a little disappointed. My bf and I were given 1 beer list which was on 2 pieces of bedraggled plain white paper and it was hard to try to share it at a table for two that is 3 feet across. It simply had a list of beers without any description of what they were. There were only 2 ciders on the entire list. Lame. We looked around for our server, who was nowhere to be found.

The prices on the food were more expensive than typical pub food and the portions were small. The only bright side was the Monday special which was 10 wings and fries for $5, which the bf got. However, I was again disappointed because there was no spice whatsoever to the &#34;buffalo&#34; wings, as well as hardly any sauce.  I got a burger which was unevenly cooked and underwhelming-- and $12. This all took about 25 minutes to arrive. 

I probably won&#39;t be back, which is a shame, because I live within walking distance and would be a loyal patron. I love the concept, but the actual place doesn&#39;t meet expectations."

Great beer list and at such a decent price, too.  The first time we went, the service was pretty good and the server we had was really nice and gave us helpful suggestions.   

The second time we went, the service was not great.  She acted like she just could not be bothered with us and she didn&#39;t write our order down, and naturally, she had to come back and ask again.  Okay, I understand that it looks really impressive when you don&#39;t write shit down, but for 10 people?  Come one, we aren&#39;t judging you, please just write down the drink order so you don&#39;t have to come back and ask us again.  She continued to still be inattentive and made a fuss about splitting our check.  

However, we ordered the buffalo cheese curds, calamari and bacon and beer brussels sprouts.  WOW.  The buffalo cheese curds were AMAZING.  No seriously, they were outstanding.  Thank god the food was good because we were over the service.  

I kind of wanted to give this place 3 stars for the service alone, but honestly, the food and beer is great so it&#39;s worth 4 stars.  Check it out.  I think they also have specials every day as well.  And I love me a good special."

We stopped by for a quick pizza and discovered a restaurant striving for more upscale full entree diners but still welcoming us pizza joint folks. The thin pizza had a nice crisp crust even in the center of the sixteen inch pie. Very generous with the tasty sausage and pepper toppings. The salad and veal parmigiana served at the table next to us looked delicious. There is a full bar and a very friendly bartender who might have been the owner. If you are in the neighborhood go try it out!

I had the chicken piccata, the angel hair pasta was al dente, light tart sauce, tender moist chicken. It was perfect.  Salad dressings are homemade, the garlic is fantastic.  My husband devoured his spaghetti and meatballs. We will be back again and again. The waitstaff is pleasant and attentive."

Did take out  The exterior and interior design are fairly dated and uninspired (although in fairness she said they had redecorating planned - new owners and all).  

The clam chowder was above average.  Good chunks of clam, etc.  Not watery at all.  It was the calamari genovese that was weak.  VERY skimpy pieces of calamari buried in a sea of mediocre linguini.  And it didn&#39;t smell or taste fresh at all.  Overwhelming fishy smell, which is never good.

Wife got the gnocchi, which she said was good, not great.  Meh."

Best pizza I&#39;ve had my entire life. My friend from California who lived in Arlington Heights still will insist we go here first (before Portillos) to get a sausage and cheese pizza. This place is infamous in my age cohort (25-30) in the area.  You cannot find better pizza then here. I would like to blame nostalgia, but it is always well received by outsiders when first introduced. It&#39;s doughy nicotine. 
 

Side notes: 

The meatballs are amazing.  I always place a order of meatballs.

My ex used to insist we always order their focaccia (take out), but they serve in the restaurant for free. She also was a fan of the tiramisu -- I don&#39;t particularly care for sweets (I know, don&#39;t judge me), so I cannot speak for how it is, but she was a fan each time we went. 

The first date I ever went on at Fellini was perfect. She insisted on ordering mussels with the white sauce (whatever it&#39;s called) and they were fantastic.  

New management/owners is super enthused and long-going customers. I only spoke with one of the family, but they were pumped when they first opened and were excited to keep the Fellini tradition. I think they mentioned keeping most the staff from the original owners --- not really sure.

Recommendations for ownership:

Keep up the same exact recipe that was passed down on your pizza. Please do not change ANYTHING.  You have a ton of us young adults growing up that respect your product and we will always keep your establishment at heart as the best place to get pizza in Mt. Prospect or Arlington Heights. 

Other thoughts:

I can be biased due to my long-standing customer status, but the pizza is fantastic. It&#39;s like the &#39;soup nazi&#39; moved from New York and decided to make pizza in Illinois. With that being said, I cannot attest to their pastas or other entrees. If I go here, I&#39;m getting pizza. I&#39;m also more of a take-out / delivery person these days.

In regards to the old ownership, as grumpy as you called the old man, he was a nice guy if you got to know him. Their daughter was the nicest hostess that took care of us young kids when we were only 12, 13, 14 coming in after locking our bikes up right outside at the bike rack (late 90s)."

Waitress was almost non existent, and did a pretty poor job. Had one children&#39;s meal in our party and never brought the ice cream which is included in the child&#39;s meal. Had to get drinks from servers passing by because she was never around. I normally love this place for pizza and dinner, but the service made this visit was totally lacking, which is unfortunate because most all the server&#39;s are great, and this wasn&#39;t an off night for this server from my observation. Normally this is a four star or four plus, , we will make sure we request someone different in the future."

I had dinner there last night with my parents and my wife and was impressed with the food and with the new owners who recently bought the place.

We all started with a fried calamari which was nice and crisp and not chewy at all.  It was served with Tobasco and a cocktail sauce which worked for me.

My mom, wife and I split a large thin crust sausage pizza which was done perfectly.  The crust was nice and crispy but not burned and there was a nice amount of sausage on the pizza.  The sauce was good as was the cheese which didn&#39;t overpower the pizza.  Overall, a nice well-rounded pie.

My dad, who frequents Fellini&#39;s quite a bit, had the halibut which he said was absolutely excellent.  It is one of those dishes that my mom tries to prepare at home but somehow never reaches the same level as when it&#39;s made in a restaurant.

We finished off with some dessert, my dad had a cannoli and the rest of us had the Tiramisu.  He was pleased with the cannoli and the Tiramisu was absolutely out of this world.  I like Tiramisu a lot and quite often it is either too dry or it is absolutely soaked to the point where it is mush.  The Tiramisu at Fellini&#39;s was perfect in texture and taste and went perfectly with our after dinner cappuccinos.

The only thing negative I can say about Fellini&#39;s is the decor is a bit dated.  On the bright side I heard from one of the new owners, named Joe, that the decor was about to change soon.  I guess the place changed hands about a month ago and the new owners have a whole restaurant remodel coming soon which should make Fellini&#39;s a place that might start attracting a younger crowd which is a good thing in my book.  Looking forward to seeing what they do!  With a couple of reviews on here complaining about the old management I was pleased to find the new owners very pleasant.

Overall I liked the place a lot and have a feeling we&#39;ll be going back again soon."

They took the decor from the 1970&#39;s to a swanky modern day restaurant.  It looks like the owners channelled Frank Sinatra&#39;s Las Vegas concept.  The food was great- I had the calamari and the mussels for an appetizer, shrimp Fellini for the entree, and the tiramisu for desert.  The tiramisu is worth going here just for that!  I ate my husband&#39;s leftover white pizza the next day- and that was good too!  I highly recommend this restaurant for the food and the decor!"

The atmosphere was really old and outdated. As far as the food goes, my pasta did have a distinct flavor, but it was overshadowed by the excess salt. My salad was good and the bread that was served is spectacular. All in all, Fellini would not be my first choice of Italian food in the area."

I&#39;m not a fan of the pasta but the last time we were there with a bigger group of family we ordered some pizza and that was really good.  The service is good as well.

An Italian delivery place!  Extremely disappointed once I did order. I  ordered the carbonara, and it was disgusting. There was plenty of pancetta, but it was extremely fatty, barely cooked, and all I felt like as I was trying to eat it was that I was getting a mouth full of fat and grease. The dish consisted of poorly cooked pancetta, fried onions, noodles, and grease. I couldn&#39;t finish my dinner it was so disgusting. 

With this experience, I doubt I will ever order from there again."

They&#39;re Italian and love to eat traditional Italian foods; apparently, the last time they were here was in 1987 (what!?) so they thought it would be fun to come here. 

Fellini&#39;s is hidden in a corner of a strip mall -- it&#39;s easy to miss. And the funny thing? Aside from the additions of a couple flat-screen televisions and increased prices, I don&#39;t think this place has changed since 1987! Dim lighting accompanies mirrored walls and outdated decor. The place is trying to come off as slightly upscale, but the rinky-dinky chairs and paper-covered tables confuses the ambience. But the menu -- holy cow, everything was unexpectedly expensive - like Olive Garden! It wasn&#39;t over-the-top but definitely not what I expected from this little place. I wasn&#39;t that hungry, so I ended up ordering angel hair pasta with marinara sauce. (The salad selection was terrible.)

We had some breads and olive oil on the table, which I snacked on. It wasn&#39;t that amazing. Our dinners arrived within a reasonable time; I was surprised at how huge the portions were while others were too small. Yet, I was disappointed. I took a few bites and just wasn&#39;t feeling it. The food was kind of flavorless. Apparently my meal wasn&#39;t the only one -- most of the family didn&#39;t like their meals. Grandma was very unhappy with hers. I ended up taking mine home and trying to force it down as lunch leftovers a few days later. I was pretty upset that we had to throw our money away on sub-par food. 

I think everyone that eats here has been a regular since 1987 (one older woman was falling asleep while dining at her table alone!) or tricked into dining here. If you&#39;re looking for good Italian food, go somewhere else."

Well priced pizza with a great fresh bread basket while you wait. If you are looking for a fancy Italian place, maybe this isn&#39;t your spot. I don&#39;t know much about the other food there, but they have a pretty nice size menu. The service is good and the water glasses always stay full.

My boyfriend &#39;s meat ravioli had watery marinara sauce, and the meat filling had little texture to it.

My husband had chicken &amp; said it was dry but the lemon sauce was good. Salad was very good.

The pasta was overcooked and tasteless.

My wife&#39;s Veal Limone was worse, it tasted like lemon peel, then mixed lemon slices with the pasta which made it inedible since the peel was so bitter.  Never again."

Next, my Dad had a $30 gift certificate that someone bought for him for Christmas and they gave him a hard time about using it.  The owner came out and made a very big deal about it.  It was embarrassing.  The last thing that happened was that they put the tip in the bill which they didn&#39;t do in the past.  My Dad ended up double tipping and not noticing until he got home.

The tomato bread was burnt...Black char on the back, every piece and it was sent to our table anyway. I had Broccoli in an oil and garlic sauce that was water and maybe some garlic. All the pasta dishes were watery. The chianti was rancid...
We had a waitress who thinks acting like a 7 year old is cute...and was not willing to take the plates back or adjust the bill.

The instant greeting and warm reception we received from the staff upon entering was nice and made me feel right at home. The food was a delight and our server was attentive and perky... for a suburban restaurant that is. The decor takes you back to visions of an Italian countryside and although it wasn&#39;t very busy during our visit, the few tables that were seated seemed to be having a wonderful time... all buzzing with chatter and laughter; much like my own!

Been here many times when visiting family in the Chicago area but lately the place has fallen off a bit.  Prices are up, which is ok, but I think food quality is down...not ok.

Waiter staff is usually very nice and accomodating.  The owner wanders around does not engage in conversation much - seems he&#39;d rather watch his new TV in the back corner of the restaurant.

Generally speaking the food is good - great variety/choices but maybe I&#39;ve been there too often as of late.

I think the place needs a good shaking of the rug.

She did not greet us with even a hello but seated us as well....I thanked her when my significant other asked for a booth rather than a table, and she still said nothing....she walked around to tables and talked to other customers, must have been her regulars or people she knew.  She needs a lesson in proper manners. If she wants more than just regulars she needs to also make her &#34;NEW CUSTOMERS&#34; feel welcome . Or have a more pleasant hostess take over.

Ambiance: needs up dating, there is none.  

The pizza needed more sauce but had a nice thin crust. The salad was terrible. Wilted outer large leafs of green leaf lettuce, mixed with iceberg I believe. The creamy garlic dressing was good.

The pasta sauce was just so so.

The cannolis were very good. Nice hard shell and not soggy.

Our waitress was Hispanic and very accommodating. She gets 5 stars.

I didn&#39;t go for about a year, when I was in town, and me and my girlfriend decided we felt like pizza. So I called them up, ordered, and we went it.

A man at the front counter said something barely coherent about the &#34;wrong pizza,&#34; and said take a seat, it would be a few more minutes.

We took a walk around, came back after about 10, and things still weren&#39;t ready. We waited nearly another 10 before it was finally ready. I fully expected to get some kind of discount, or even more than a half-assed apology, but we didn&#39;t get that.

On top of that whole experience, the pizza (thin crust, half cheese/ pepperoni) was not nearly as good as it used to be. Maybe it was because they made it on the fly, I couldn&#39;t say for sure, but there was obviously no way I was going back to this place.

Prospect for something like 3-4 decades after my grandfather passed away.  She was the only family member with anything approaching good taste in food, and whenever we came to visit, the crowning food experience was always pizza from Fellini&#39;s.  Even though I&#39;ve never lived in Chicago, I feel like I grew up with Fellini&#39;s thin crust, and it&#39;s still my gold standard for &#34;The Way Pizza Is Supposed To Taste.&#34;  I&#39;d always make her get me a side order of the mostaccioli - the tomato sauce had the same rich, deep flavor as what they used for the pizza.

Grandma&#39;s condo was kitty-corner from Rosati&#39;s Pizza (who catered a few of our family Thanksgivings in her later years), and she always said, &#34;Rosati&#39;s is good too, but Fellini&#39;s is the best.&#34;  And my God, she was right.  Her favorite combo (and mine) was the sausage and garlic.  When I got older and more adventurous, we&#39;d sometimes get anchovies as a change of pace, while the rest of the family chickened out.  (Truly, Grandma never cared about bad breath.)  But even the plain old cheese pizza at Fellini&#39;s is fantastic - that vibrant sauce, crust that&#39;s crisp on the bottom and silky soft under the cheese, and a blend of herbs baked into the cheese that make the whole thing just sing in your mouth.

Side note:  I live in L.A. now, and according to Jonathan Gold (the first food critic to win a Pulitzer Prize for commentary), the best pizza in the city is at Casa Bianca, a family joint that serves Chicago-style thin crust.  I tried it, and it&#39;s...OK, but...it ain&#39;t Fellini&#39;s.  (It ain&#39;t even Rosati&#39;s either, for that matter.)  Even Chicago&#39;s NW suburbs have AT LEAST two sources of pizza that are better than the best pizza in L.A.  COUNT YOURSELVES LUCKY.

My grandma is gone now, so who knows how many times I&#39;ll make it back here, but thank you Fellini&#39;s for being our extended-family tradition for 30-some-odd years."

We wanted to go to Dondi&#39;s, but when we got there, realized that it was a carry-out/delivery only.  The nice Italian man, speaking broken English, sent us to Fellini&#39;s and it worked out for us.

Let me start by saying the thin crust pizza is excellent.  It&#39;s some of the best I&#39;ve tried.  Anyone can throw a bunch of cheese on a pizza, but Fellinis gets the sauce and the crust right.  The crust is nice and crispy, the way I love it.  

This place is stuck in a 1970&#39;s time capsule and I love it.  It has the red pleather booths and the cheesy light fixtures.  I was waiting for Pauly Walnuts and Tony Soprano to walk through the door at any moment.  

I&#39;ve only been here once, so I can&#39;t give them the coveted 5-star rating yet, but will definitely go back.   You won&#39;t be overwhelmed by the appetizers or salads, but it&#39;s worth going just for the pizza."

The location is not great and you would never really know its there but if you live in the area I would definitely check it out. They bring bread, olive oil and cheese to the table immediately which is nice and the menu is full of Italian dishes (mainly pasta) that were great. I had the carbonara pasta and it was great! My friends had pizza and a couple of other pasta dishes that they also enjoyed. The restaurant does not look like anything special so don&#39;t expect a fancy place or anything like that. It has a TV which can be nice in case there is anything good to watch.  They also have a buy one get one free lunch time pizza special that I will do for sure. Overall I enjoyed the food a lot and the portions were pretty big but the only thing that is holding this place back is the interior and location. It also does not have a great atmosphere but the food is worth the trip."

So we decided to validate his claim.  The place was very crowded that Sat evening and we got the only remaining booth next to a table set for large dining party.  Our waitress highly recommended the thin crust and touted it as the best.  We ordered sausage pepperoni with garlic.  It wasn&#39;t too long before that pie came.  

First impression - the crust has that typical I-talian wannabe texture similar to bread sticks and was thicker than what typical thin would be. It crumbles easily like saltines and does have structure to hold up to each bite. The sauce has a deep mild taste that did not impede on the toppings.  The sausage was ample but left puddles of grease.  Overall, it might be a great pizza for Mt. Prospect but nothing deserving the title as the best the NW burbs has to offer.  Lastly, the pizza was also salty and we had to quench our thirst with multiple refills of pop without realizing that they charge for them.  Between the two of us, we drank $12 of pop.   That is uncommon and puts a damper on the whole experience. 

The place was cramped adorned with yesteryear&#39;s decor.  It was lively, loud and family oriented.  Some credit has got to go to the few cute waitresses, especially that brunette that squeezed her way past our table while serving the other large party.  Any closer and we may have mistook her as the dessert. 

Is this the best pizza? No.  Will we go back?  Maybe to sample other items but definitely not the pizza.  And so the hunt for the best pizza continues."

I go to Fellini&#39;s on an average of once a week. I can&#39;t disagree with anything any of the previous reviewers have said, except that Fellini&#39;s makes the best thin crust pizza in the world, and I&#39;ve had pizza in Italy. 

I have had just about every item on the menu at one time or another. No modern art on a plate here, just ample portions of good, honest Italian cooking. 

And you will not receive better service anywhere. Period. The servers are quick, efficient, friendly, pleasant, and attentive, without being stalkers. And they don&#39;t do that fake stuff to increase tips, like coming down to your eye level, or touching you unnecessarily. You will have ice water, a basket of bread, olive oil and grated cheese on your table within a minute of being seated. Your drink order will be taken within 2 minutes, and so on. And you will never be wondering where your server is when you are ready for the bill. Turnover is low and if you go there a few times on different days of the week you will have seen the entire waitstaff. 

Finally, Fellini&#39;s is unbelievably consistent. We have never had a bad experience, either with service or food. So if you prefer to be bamboozled by fancy frescoes, tapestries, dim lights, lots of dark wood, velvet drapes, a &#34;Dinner in Italy&#34; CD playing in the background, a loud environment and waiters dressed like penguins, go somewhere else. If you prefer great Italian food at a reasonable price and with great service, go to Fellini&#39;s (closed on Mondays). Every neighborhood should have an Italian restaurant like Fellini&#39;s.  And I really do not work for Fellini&#39;s."

OK, in all seriousness, Potbelly really is delish. Unlike many sandwich shops who seem to go weak on the meat and heavy on the lettuce on top of some whatever bread, Potbelly puts the perfect amount of meat with the delicious toppings of your choice. No matter what sandwich I get, the hot peppers and Italian seasoning and oil always seems to make it on there. I really enjoy the Italian and the roast beef sandwiches, though others (such as the pulled pork) are great as well! You have an option of multi-grain, white, or &#34;skinny&#34; bread and either regular or big size. Soups and salads are also available, the broccoli cheddar gets me almost every time.
This location is kept clean and has plenty of seating, indoors and out. It&#39;s located amongst a bunch of stores so that&#39;s why I usually get sucked in (blame the errands). The staff has always been nice! Live music sometimes.
I was going to say that Potbelly costs a little more than Subway, but come to think of it, they&#39;re probably about equal in price but Potbelly blows Subway away in quality--duh! I know it&#39;s just a sandwich shop, but somehow it has won my heart."

The cookie ice cream sandwich at Potbelly&#39;s is one of those things. While I have resisted thus far, I&#39;m not sure how long my will-power will last. 

Potbelly&#39;s is our go-to for work lunches as our corporate office is a few miles away. During a few training these past months, Potbelly&#39;s was a great alternative to the typical pizza and Panera. You can cater for large groups OR have the option to place a specific order. When ordering online, you can customize an order per person so when you get your grub it&#39;s all labeled and ready to go. 

They have a good variety of sandwiches, I&#39;d say there is something for everyone. If a sandwich doesn&#39;t suit you, many of their options can be made into a salad. The Italian is my favorite sammie, and I love that they serve it warm. 

This is the nail in the coffin: their cookies. Oh good LAWD. Their cookies are amazing. More specifically their oatmeal chocolate chip is unparalleled. It&#39;s so bad it&#39;s good. Whenever I take this one as an &#34;after lunch&#34; treat, it literally soaks through my napkin. I know, I know. That&#39;s probably butter and super unhealthy but they&#39;re very hard to say no to. 

Definitely check this place out to shake up your typical sandwich routine!"

I know it is and I know that the chain-i-ness of it is probably what keeps it so consistent and keeps me coming back, but when I&#39;m here, it&#39;s cozy and I&#39;m happy. 

I am rarely in the area for lunch, so this is a quick dinner spot for me. Recently, I have fallen for their &#34;flats&#34; which are lower in calories and quite good. I usually load one of those up with their chicken salad. Potbelly has a great chicken salad with quality chicken breast chunks and it is not dripping with mayo. There&#39;s some mayo, but I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s calorie overload when I indulge here. 

I&#39;m also a fan of their soups. I&#39;ve never had a soup here that I didn&#39;t enjoy. Meats and veggies are plentiful and cooked just right. The soup bases are tasty!  Top of the list is the chicken enchilada soup for me which had a nice little kick. 

Often times there is someone playing a little love music in the eating area. It&#39;s never been obnoxious or annoying, so kudos to our local musicians. 

The staff is helpful and know how to capture my interest. They actually got me to switch from their regular bread to the flat and I&#39;m glad that I listened. They know their stuff."

Subway&#39;s oven barely even toasts the bread, just warms it--somewhat similar to Panera&#39;s fake panini presses that are really just griddles designed to imprint grill marks onto the bread. Bloody cheaters.

At Potbelly, the slow conveyor toaster makes the bread crisp and fillings hot. The workers are cheerful and hustle pretty well during peak times. They have a bit of fun trying to predict what sandwich I&#39;ll order since it always revolves. My mainstays are the Wreck, with turkey, ham, salami and roast beef; the Mediterranean with chicken, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, cucumbers and hummus; and the new Toasty Turkey BLT with Nueske&#39;s Applewood-Smoked bacon. I almost always get giardiniera (hot peppers) either on the sandwich or on the side because I LOVE THAT STUFF.

I&#39;m not sure why Potbelly sees less business than Panera (brand recognition?) less indoor seating, maybe?) but the good thing about it is that there are way fewer loudmouths and screaming children."

They must use a cheap processed meat I suppose. I ordered mine with extra hot peppers and the peppers had zero flavor, I asked for easy oil because I wanted the flavor of the pepper but there was no flavor.

The whole crew is always upbeat and friendly and willing to crack a joke or two.  When my parents visit from Europe, this is their favorite place to go.

My favorite sandwich is the Italian with hot peppers with an IBC root beer.  If I&#39;m in the mood, I may even splurge on an Oreo shake."

Especially those hot peppers.  You don&#39;t get those here in Vancouver... not those kind anyway.

My favorite is the Italian which I took this time around for my meal on my plane back to Vancouver. I&#39;m sure I was the envy of the entire flight. :-D They even gave me hot peppers on the side!

I love that the chef cares enough about ingredients to have a seasonal menu. That in itself says so much about the place already. 

The wine list was poor compared to the wonderful menu but the service was friendly and the food was delicious. 

I am not very familiar with Polish cuisine but the dishes were very well balanced and flavorful. 

I recommend trying the goose pierogi. The veal chop was also fabulous. Everything we ordered was wonderful. The duck breast was tender and cooked perfectly. This place truly is a hidden gem! I recommend it 100%!

Its a perfect place for a business lunch: different cuisine than your standard Chinese or Mexican, nicer without breaking the bank and convenient for the area.

I had the hangar steak served with grilled sheep cheese. It was served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My dining companion asked me to suggest a typical Polish dish. I suggested the pork cutlet and it was a great choice. It was served with a generous amount of mushrooms and roasted baby carrots on the side. We also had a couple of beers and of course had to have the mousse for dessert.

So if you&#39;re in the area and hungry, I recommend it for a slightly more elevated food than your typical Polish buffet."

Lotsa meats, lamb, goose, wild boar and yet nothing really heavy or overwhelmingly filling.

We were seated at 6 and they had already sold out of sturgeon so we settled for the rainbow trout which I have pictured here. It was stupendous! Simple, elegantly presented and cooked to perfection to retain the moist non-gamey flavor.

The service was chatty, knowledgeable, humorous at the right moments and attentive to our needs.

We finished with the baked plums which should never be missed.

We cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough! It was the the perfect place for us to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary!"

I was not drinking in your establishment.

I set my drink outside.

You were open at the time was servers and help when I asked for a go menu

The issue that was in question happened earlier while I was dining next-door / took a small walk to see what other restaurants were around. I let the JERK of a man, rant and rant and rant then I said, all I&#39;m here for is a go menu.  

Is that too difficult?  

There is no excuse to be treated like a third class citizen.

You guys are just all trashy all the way around. You&#39;re making it sound like I was a drunk, and drinking in your establishment, ask your other two female servers. The two girls laughed when I said if you can treat a customer this way I can only imagine how you treat your help you bastard and the two girls started laughing! Ask them.

The decor is simple modern without obvious cues to any nationality.  The menu (in English with Polish translation) is expansive and decidedly upscale.  And the food is a mix of old-school Polish with modern twists and bold innovation.

The diminutive restaurant seats maybe 22. On our weekday lunch visit, it was staffed by just one server and two chefs.  While they did not dilly-dally, everything is cooked to order, so it can take a long time for food to appear.  A few in our party waited as long as 45 minutes for their entrees.  There is no bread service, so if you&#39;re really hungry, my advice is to order a starter course.  We found the rich, hearty chicken noodle soup satisfying.  For families with fidgety toddlers, a nice touch is a bookshelf stocked with toys and children&#39;s books.

Our patience was rewarded by the size, presentation, and high quality of the entrees.  The breaded pork chop far surpassed the pork wienerschnitzel we&#39;ve had at most local German eateries.   Priced just $14 at lunch, this comes with your choice of two sides.  Even though potato pancakes are not listed as a side, our server said we could order those.  The kitchen delivered not one but two gargantuan pancakes per portion.  Others in our group enjoyed the French (not Polish?) baguette, roasted lobster (!) &amp; spinach pierogi, and salmon filet.  Dessert?  Whoa!  Next time."

It&#39;s a small clean shop, the food came out slowly so I&#39;d budget a bit of time for coming here. Everyone&#39;s dishes looked amazing. I got the sour soup, broiled cod (seasonal), and the baked plum.

The soup was a little sour for my liking but it came in a big bowl and there was a quail egg. I really liked my cod. It was flavored simply with white pepper and salt but the fish was very fresh and I liked the wild rice medley beneath it. The baked plum took a while to make but it was a very refreshing dessert. Not too heavy, tart, and you can definitely taste the red wine flavor. Will definitely come back!"

Whether you are looking for amazing and different Polish dishes or just an incredible meal I encourage you to try Qulinarnia.

Don&#39;t mistake it&#39;s less than grandeur exterior as evidence that Qulinaria is not a top-notch restaurant...didn&#39;t your mama ever teach you not to judge a book by its cover?  

I&#39;d made a second attempt to eat here after having mistakenly not made reservations the first time.  With that being said, I knew to make reservations this time around, especially since I was going on a Saturday night.  It seems that Qulinaria is always busy, though part of that seems to be due to the fact that it is quite small inside with about 10-12 tables in total, if even.  The small size of Qulinaria makes for an intimate setting, perfect for date night or small celebrations like the one we had for my birthday.

Speaking of which, my birthday dinner could not have been better.  I&#39;d originally planned on eating elsewhere for my birthday, but because of reasons I&#39;m sure you care absolutely nothing about we settled on Qulinaria, a restaurant my fiancé and I had bookmarked for quite a while.  Qulinaria should be on all of your bookmarks too - it, does in fact, deserve the ravings it receives and should actually receive more praise for the food, the presentation, the friendliness of the staff and the venue.  

The food was beautifully presented, but changed real quickly when my whole party dug into our food about as quickly as it was placed on our table.  Now, if you&#39;re sitting there wondering what to get let me tell you that everything, literally everything, was hands-down five star quality.  If traditional Polish food sounds good to you then go with the goulash and potato pancakes; if you&#39;re a little quacky  then go for the duck (which comes with an awesome baked pear); if all you want is goddamn fish then get the salmon and if you like pork anytime, anywhere, anyway then get the pork tenderloine.  Believe me, all of the entrees were too good to be true, as we&#39;re the appetizers and soup.  

Oh, and that fried apple pie???  Just stop.  Without a doubt some of the best dessert known to mankind.  It was filled with what actually seemed to be chunky apple sauce - it was pretty much the bomb dot com.  The other desserts looked good too, but the fried apple pie was the creme de la creme.

This restaurant is also a good choice for those who have something to celebrate because the cost of the entire meal won&#39;t be so sky-high that you get the check and the eyes pop out of your head.  It was about $120 for our party of four who each got entrees, some appetizers, a round of drinks and dessert.  It&#39;s very cost efficient and you get a wonderful experience worth every second and every bite."

They have just changed the menu on the day we were here. 4 out of 6 courses we ordered were delicious. Pierogi with cheese and mushroom sauce is my absolutely #1 for appetizer - they should make  main course of it.  Two of us had boar&#39;s steak (i think most expensive dish in the menu $32)- both came almost cold. After they warmed them up they weren&#39;t done as we ordered anymore.

Despite being in a narrow storefront in the middle of a (newer) strip mall.. It&#39;s pretty adorbs. The decor and layout are nice, well-thought-out,  and the service is very attentive. Our waitress was so sweet. :-)

On a Pesceterian deal again... and the salmon did not disappoint. I swapped out the linguine and sauce for vegetables and they were very good... maybe a tad salty... and again not sure broccolini was a Polish staple =)   but... will definitely have to try the sea bass next time.

I tell people I&#39;m Polish (as in, pure-bred, Polish citizen) and 94% of the time the reaction is, &#34;OMG! I love pierogies! Kolachkies! Yum!&#34; No. Stop that. First of all, it&#39;s pierogi. The singular version is simply pierog. And no, I don&#39;t eat them all the time because the only good ones are homemade and making pierogi from scratch is an all day affair. Also, I think I&#39;ve had like three of those pastries during the course of my life.

Last spring I had the idea of opening a full-service, slightly upscale modern Polish restaurant downtown Chicago (not that I had the capital to actually do so). I was told it wouldn&#39;t work. A few months later Qulinarnia opened with stunning reviews. I am now kicking myself.

The space is small, but clean and well designed with a modern and simplistic red/white theme. There&#39;s only about seven four-top tables and a couple of two-tops. Even in the mid-afternoon the hostess had to turn people away who didn&#39;t have reservations. Make a reservation!

Okay. Time for the best part. The food.

We started with the house appetizer, which is a traditional pate, served with bread and - what - a homemade applesauce? I had my hesitations about adding the sweetness to my beloved pasztet, but it was great. My father and I also split the beef tenderloin tartar (pickle, red onion, blue cheese, roasted capers, an an egg yolk on top), which was slightly oversalted but nonetheless amazing and impeccably presented. Every single plate that came out of that kitchen looked like it was arranged by a high-end, Michelin-winning chef.

My father and I both had mushroom soup, my mother had pickle soup. A+ there. For our entrees, I had fish, my father had a beef dish, and my mother ordered the duck. I regret waiting so long to finish this review because my memory is beginning to fail me, but just trust me on this, okay? The food was remarkable.

The apple pie my mother had for dessert was, according to her, the best apple pie she&#39;s ever had, which is saying a lot. I devoured my cheesecake. 

The three of us spent just over $100 (excluding) for a feast of a lunch - four courses AND beer AND after-lunch coffee. Underpriced, but hey, I&#39;m not complaining.

This place is well worth a visit."

Interesting indeed! And delicious, charming, and did I mention delicious?! 

My friend and I both started with the sauerkraut soup with lamb. It was savory and filling and I would definitely order it again. We then ordered short ribs with potato pancakes (me) and the salmon and black risotto for my friend. My meal was nothing short of mouth watering! It was a generous serving and I happily ate it for lunch the next day! My friend&#39;s salmon risotto was also quite good. 

The food is so good here I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it for days! I can&#39;t wait to come back again."

I still don&#39;t know what they mean by modern, but it was fantastic.  I was with one friend on lunch break from work.  
The restaurant is in a strip mall, but once I walked in the door, I was amazed with the quiet, clean and upscale presentation.  There were only a few other customers.  Our server was very polite, and very personable. 
The menu here is perfect.  It has just enough, but not too many menu items.  There were everyday lunch meals and specials.   My friend and I both picked items from the lunch menu.
I had the Potato Pancake.  It came with a side salad of greens and cherry tomato halves.  It had a creamy garlic drizzle of dressing.  My friend had the potato/cheese pierogi topped with bacon and onion. 
Both meals were perfect size meals for a lunch and it was very tasty and priced right.  It&#39;s a little further away than we typically go for work lunch, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll go back again in the future."

The restaurant is located in a small strip mall, a little bit hidden. Not a very large place but it was nice and clean.
 I started out with a Polish beer on the recommendation of our waitress. I liked it. Beer choices are fairly limited, but I was OK with what they offered.
The dinner menu is not very large compared to other places. This place touts a modern Polish cuisine, so don&#39;t expect the usual fare.  For an entrée, I had roast pork tenderloin which I substituted mashed potatoes in place of kasha. Asparagus and beets accompanied the dish.
This pork tenderloin was excellent. A light gravy was on top. The potatoes were also excellent.
The asparagus was actually grilled which gave a little char and a smokiness to it. Cooked perfectly. I do not like veggies that are overcooked (pet peeve). Now, I am not the biggest fan of beets, but the ones here were actually delicious. Earthy and not overcooked. Ate them all.


     Service was very friendly and efficient. I am looking forward to going back.
This place is worth checking out.

Cheers to All"

I cannot say enough positive things about the level of service we received from Agnieszka, the owner. Everything they prepared was delicious. The bite sizes of smoked salmon with mascarpone cheese and chives over cucumber were fresh and presented itself beautifully on a bed of lettuce. We ordered pork roulade stuffed with mushrooms, green beans and bacon served in mushroom sauce and grilled salmon served in creamy thyme sauce. Salmon was cooked to perfection and thyme sauce although creamy was light and refreshing. The pork roulade was moist and juicy. As a side we chose grilled veggies and baby potatoes. Kids loved these.
I would thoroughly recommend Qulinarnia to anyone looking for home made polish food presented with a &#34;twist&#34;. I know we will certainly be returning soon."

Agnieszce and all of the employees that were working there yesterday. The best time I had in a long time. We made a reservation for around 25 people Baptism Party for my little boy. The trick was I&#39;m Polish but my husband is American. I wanted something what everybody will like. And sometimes thats not as easy as someone will think. My family will eat anything from there since is &#39;our food&#39; but other side of the family sometimes are really picky about my kind of food. I told that to the owner and she picked the best menu for all of us. And first time each person celebrating with us couldn&#39;t stop talking about how everything is delicious and perfect. That was amazing!!!!!! They really have the BEST food and not only that but BEST employees too. Especially I&#39;m talking about a guy who was really nice and helpful even with kids. We had a year old baby girl with us and he gave her a toy to play with.......pease I never saw that before. Im little ashamed here but didn&#39;t ask for his name. But anyway thank you so much to you sir for great service. 

What also was amazing. Few people got late and I didnt have to ask anyone for salad soup and anything else for them. They made them sit and took care of them without me saying a word. Thats amazing that we still have a place where we can have a nice dinner with our families or party like me and dont have that feeling that they want us out bcs everything was already served. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN

Came here on Sunday for lunch, 1:30 pm.  Will definitely return to this place (with reservation that is...highly recommended). 

Pros:
-Food taste great + cute presentation on the plate
-Svc is excellent
-Ambiance:  Quaint/cute little venue
-Price:  Reasonable ($$)

Cons: 
-Restaurant is on small side
-Food does take a while (if you&#39;re in a hurry then this place is not meant for you)

Other Tips:  Reservation highly recommended, especially if you have 4/more ppl since they only have few large table that they can put together to accommodate big group.

Food/beverages ordered  =$100+ (reasonable prices)
-5 hours braised goose breast $28 - very good
-Sea bass with black wild rice $27 - very good (didn&#39;t care for the sauce as much)
-Pierogi $13 (combination = 5 potatoes &amp; cheese + 4 lobster &amp; spinach)...the potatoes &amp; cheese is EXCELLENT; lobster &amp; spinach was not as good but pretty decent
-Chocolate mousse $7...I&#39;m not a dessert fan but thought this was really good if you like chocolate (it is as sweet either)
-2 glasses of wine + 1 beer"

I was concerned about the term &#34;Airline&#34;, but don&#39;t worry! The herbs were wonderful - I would order it again.  

Zywiec beer was great too.  Could have had some Polish wines but wine list though short was good and reasonably priced.  

Baked plum dessert was a hit - had a liquor in it that gave it a wonderful flavor.  Apple pie was good but didn&#39;t quite get to the baked plum level."

For lunch, we ordered  the appetizer plate of liver pâté with chunky apple sauce and fresh baked bread...very fresh and tasty.  Our next order was the airline chicken on a bed of risotto and an arugula salad and the pierogi plate.  Both dishes were delicious.  For dessert, I ordered the fried apple pie, topped with vanilla ice cream.  FABULOUS!!
One other thing I was impressed with was the cleanliness of the place.  The dining area was very plain, but inviting. And the bathroom was immaculate, with modern fixtures. The wait-staff was very attentive, always coming by to make sure everything was okay.

Suffice to say, I&#39;m glad I made the reservation.

Our reservation was honored the moment we walked in the door. The table was a bit small and the overall restaurant can feel a bit cramped, but otherwise we were excited to see what exactly there was to try. 

Receiving a menu split between Polish and -- though I didn&#39;t immediately see it, giving me an all too brief moment of panic -- English, we set about deciding what to try. Ordering the grilled highlander cheese was an early highlight no doubt. Coming with two small circles of cheese with bacon and arugula atop with a plated garnish of cranberry sauce proved to be excellent, simply excellent. The cranberry ties the whole dish together and does so swimmingly well.

My wife tried the pickle soup and while I can&#39;t say too much, good or bad, the taste I had offered a bit of promise. Perhaps next time, since I can already promise there will be a next time.

For dinner, my wife opted for the roasted spinach and lobster pierogi&#39;s while I chose the potato and cheese variety -- it being a Polish restaurant after all -- we just couldn&#39;t resist. In no uncertain terms, they were out of this world. The sour cream on the side meshed so perfectly with the soft doughy exteriors containing wonderfully sumptuous potato and cheese mixed together to form a moment of happiness Norman Rockwell would be happy to illustrate. 

My wife devoured hers and almost made a move towards mine, so either would be a safe bet for anyone looking for a first time dish to try. 

My only caveat about the location would be the television inside. I simply feel it doesn&#39;t belong and proved to be a bit of a distraction when taking into account the ambient noise already taking place. No doubt sitting outside is an option, yet with October right around the corner, that option will only diminish further over time.

Nevertheless, the food was great and matched the attentive service we received. My wife can&#39;t wait to go back and, really, neither can I."

With sides of Baby Potatoes and Mushrooms. My sister ordered Old Fashioned Pork with Mashed Potatoes and Baked Beets. Our meal was so tasty and delicious. Not to mention it beautifully plated.

We saw the reviews and wanted to try the place. We walked in and the place was really cute, clean, modern decor with a cozy feel. Not a huge place at all so definitely make reservations. We tried the fried cheese appetizer. It was just ok for me. Nice presentation, tasted ok but I wouldn&#39;t order that again. Next, I had the sour soup. My girlfriend had the mushroom soup. We always share our food so we can taste everything. Both soups were superb!  Definitely some of best soups we ever had. I&#39;m very picky about good soup and this place doesn&#39;t disappoint. Try their soups! Next, we had our entrées. She had the gulosh. It was delicious. Tender meat that was like a pot roast accompanied with potato pancakes. It was a really comfort food dish. The dish has like a mom&#39;s homemade feel. Just a delightful dish. I had the French cut pork chop that came with grilled asparagus, grilled cheese medallions and I don&#39;t remember the name of the side but I believe it was like a barley grain. The star of the dish was the pork chop. It was cooked to perfection. So tender and delicious. I totally recommend trying the pork chop. So good. Finally we had the apple pie dessert. I had no room for dessert  but my girlfriend said it tasted good. I forgot to mention I am sort of a craft beer snob and I usually pick out my restaurants only if they have good beer but this night was an exception. They don&#39;t have any craft beer here. But I ordered a polish beer recommended by our waitress and it was pretty good. And note: There are no cocktails served here. Just wine and like 4 beer options. Overall,  we enjoyed our dinner. We will definitely go back for the yummy food."

We went with a Groupon and it worked well. We started with some pate and a roll, good. Then we had two appetizers - goat a cheese and a stuffed cabbage roll. Both were very tasty. We ordered our entrees: two steaks, sea bass and pierogis. The steak dishes and sea bass were brought to our table but not the pierogis. The pierogis hadn&#39;t been prepared by the kitchen. They would come soon the server promised. When my wife cut into her steak it was almost well done and not the medium she had ordered, mistake number two. Eventually (after I was done with my sea bass), my wife&#39;s steak and the pierogis arrived. Luckily, the company was good even if the food prep was poor and the server was pushing us to turn the table.  The food was good, not great and we&#39;ve been there before and probably will go back again. I don&#39;t know if we would go back if this was our first experience with the restaurant."

We were headed to the Mediterranean restaurant next door, and modern polish cuisine looked more interesting. Not only was the presentation of the food visually amazing, but the food tastes great! The service was very good too. Usually, I have low expectations when going to new restaurants, but this place surpassed all my expectations - probably my favorite restaurant in the area now.

I had French cut pork chop with sauerkraut and fried potato balls (I&#39;ve never had anything like these potato balls before and they were great). Overall this dish was delicious and could definitely be served at a fancy restaurant in downtown - but, the price is very reasonable. My wife had a modern polish schnitzel with vegetables and it was really good too, but I liked my dish more.

We are going back tomorrow, since we saw a number of other interesting dishes on the menu (e.g. Baked pork tenderloin with horseradish mashed potatoes, potato pancakes, salads, deserts, etc.).

I really hope this places keeps up the good work and becomes successful."

Clean, modern atmosphere inside, excellent service, and extremely fresh and delicious food! We came with a large party for the restaurant (8) and they were extremely accommodating.

Our table got the mushroom pastry and grilled cheese appetizers, which everyone loved. Our server also bought us some pate with wheat bread and apple sauce on the house, delicious. I ordered the French cut pork chop with fried potato and cheese balls and onions which I would most definitely recommend. Other favorites were the lobster homemade pierogis, the cod, and the traditional pork chop. For dessert, the apple pie is divine and others at our table really enjoyed the plums!

I tried everything from their 1 year anniversary menu. Mushroom appetizer was delish but very tiny. Tomato soup was ok. Filet mignon came overcooked and it was just terrible  , the fish dish was yummy. Dessert was delicious. I think they need better  waitresses. We had I think Marta ( the blonde one) and she wasn&#39;t paying to much attention to us. I do understand they were busy but still. I spent $ 120 for dinner of 2 so I  would appreciate if  she refilled my water or asked if I  want another glass of wine and coffee with my dessert. It&#39;s  loosing money on their end. And what is the deal with the free appetizer they gave to everyone but us? Just because I paid 12.99 for my tiny mushroom plate I don&#39;t get their appetizer?"

I just visited another top rated polish restaurant in Chicago, and Qulinarnia is on another level.  It is a bit pricey, but the food is really delicious. 

Polish population has been growing in the Northwest suburbs, and I&#39;ve been waiting for a good polish restaurant to open up, and it&#39;s finally here.  I will be visiting often.

I had a soup and then pork with some potatoes.  I&#39;m a big guy and the portions were completely fine with me."

The food was excellent , delicious. They started the 2  of us out with some yummy pate and applesauce but they only give you 2 small pieces of bread to go with it . I would have liked a bit more bread. I had a bowl of creamy tomato soup and salmon with white asparagus , roasted potatoes and shredded carrots and another vegetable that I did not know what it was. Like I said they were all delicious and the portions of everything but the salmon were very good. The only problem was that while the salmon melted in my mouth it was not a big piece. Maybe 4 oz at the most. I would have liked a larger piece and paid a bit more but the totality of the meal was tasty and filling. 

The service was friendly and good. The place is small and was pretty crowded. They asked us if we had reservations when we walked in and when we said no our waitress said no problem and seated us right away. I would recommend making a reservation if possible and definitely with a larger party. Our waitress did a good job but she was busy and I had to almost yell to ask her for more water which she immediately brought. They also are very skimpy on the ice for some reason so if you like things cold you need to ask for more. Again she brought ice immediately when I asked for it. 

I definitely plan to return. I want to try something more traditionally Polish and am hoping that the main course will be bigger than my piece of salmon was. 

This is a small restaurant in a strip mall and if you weren&#39;t looking for I do not think you would know it was there. I get the feeling it&#39;s a family run restaurant. (Not sure of this )   They seem to try hard to please but it seems to be a busy place so it will be interesting to see how they do."

Only one person working for service as hostess and waitress as well as bartender. Started ordering they will not serve u anything on the lunch menu for dinner for some reason of freshness... Extremely irrelevant if you ask me as a reason for not having polish sausage as a dinner option ridiculous. Anyways ordered the airline chicken and chicken noodle soup my lady ordered pork chops and the soup as well. Not kidding when I say we waited for about 25 minutes just to have the soup come to the table after that. Soup was sub par very watered down nicely decorative looking though. Now to the actual review so about an hour or so passed that we came in and ordered food finally arrived very very hungry at this point. Started eating chicken was tiny pretty looking and lots of vegetables half the chicken was delicious other half dry. Vegetables were very bland tasting. Potatoe pancakes were so so... pork chops were alright after adding hot sauce. All and all over priced for the service and quality of the food and waiting. Will not come back if you want good polish food go to any of the great places on Polska area off Milwaukee Ave worth the drive and you&#39;ll at least leave satisfied.

Light, bright (maybe a bit too bright for dinner).  I started with the Cream of Pickle (!) soup - outstanding.

Next was the Lamb Stew.  They didn&#39;t get the right bread delivered so it was in a bowl, served with garlic bread and then plain sourdough to help sop up the stew.  Great smells, great flavors.

Dessert was...WOW!  The Apple Pie was an open pie with berries and whip cream on a flaky crust - yum!

Once we walked in, we were welcomed and sat immediately. The host/server/owner was extremely humble and nice, offering her advice on all menu items. We ordered both the spinach and potato pirogis, which were amazing. We later learned, that the owner&#39;s mother handmade these delicious pillows of happiness.  We were then given a complimentary plate of bread, a pate, and jam, which was a pleasant surprise.

After, we ordered the Pork Chop (yum!), Osso Bocco (huge and delicious!), Duck (delectable), Lamp Chop (amazing), and Salmon (so rich and cooked to perfection). I feel like there was not a bad option on the menu... every dish tasted amazing and had a wonderful presentation. 

We were then offered the warm homemade apple-pie with fresh raspberries on the house, as it was someone at our table&#39;s birthday.

We popped in around 6:30 on a Sunday and were lucky to get seated at the only open table; a larger party was soon turned away since they had no reservation.  Sue opened with the cream of pickle soup and I had the cream of tomato with orange mousse and basil.  Both were great and tasted artfully homemade.  For her entree Sue got sauteed salmon served over buckwheat groats and spinach with a bit of fruit sauce (black currants, I think).  It was really good, and the groats were a very interesting alternative to mashed potatoes or rice.  I went traditional  with the lobster and spinach pierogies, 8 or 9 to the order, served in a butter sauce.  Very good; very filling.

The serving team could not have been more efficient, smiley, and eager to please.  Good people watching place as we saw a bit of an impromptu fashion show going on (glad I wore my better jeans).  Acoustics were a slight problem as we could hear noise from all over the room but had trouble hearing each other clearly (full disclosure: I&#39;m old).  Also, two small flat screen TVs at either end of the long and narrow dining room were a bit of a distraction from the crisp decor.  I expect the future will feature dispensed soft drinks rather than cans at the table.  The Zywiec beer looked great but it was a school night.

The portions are super small. Come on, how much that piece of pig cost you? I&#39;ve never seen so small portions of appetizers, there were 4 of us and we asked the waitress if appetizer size is enough for us and she could not give as a straight answer, she was mumbling something that is around 10 dekagrams! Hello, we are in America. Dekagrams? I know other restaurants have starters in a decent size you could feed yourself as a meal. Do not order tomato &#34;cream&#34; with salmon and cheese, for that price that could at least make the affort and do it from the scratch, not blend the can of tomatoes and pretend it is a homemade soup.  The food looks good on the plate becouse the chief is trying to be an artist, but... this is not french restaurant in upscale neighborhood in downtown so what&#39;s the cost for???

As an American, I liked that it is really modern Polish cuisine. It reflects what Polish people in Poland are eating now, which is mix of traditional dishes with foods popular around the world. I had the filet mignon which was cooked exactly as I requested (very rare) and was excellent quality beef. My husband is Polish and ordered Tartar which he said was wonderful. Then the cutlet schabowy (pork cutlet) and that was also excellent. You will enjoy the atmosphere as much as the food Contemporary with candles and fresh red and white roses on the table. We enjoyed it so much, we returned later the same night with a friend for latte and dessert. The apple cake (szarlotka) was outstanding. You will not be disappointed here. Refreshing to have a great Polish restaurant in a contemporary setting. If I could change one thing, it would be to stay open a little later on Friday and Saturday night.

Came here for dinner and got it to go. Ordered the pork taco dinner. Pork tacos had no cilantro or onion on them. The tacos also had melted cheese on them which didn&#39;t seem usual for an authentic taco either. On the positive side, they were tasty enough to demolish in under 5 mins and I didn&#39;t have to spend much either. Also got a free drink on the house which was nice.

I think next time though, I&#39;d rather spend a few extra bucks on something I think is a little more authentic."

I&#39;ve seen 3 different restaurants open in this same location over the last few years and none of them lasted very long. I&#39;m confident that Paul&#39;s won&#39;t be suffering the same fate. 

It&#39;s a pretty popular lunch choice for people working in the area, so there&#39;s usually at least 4 or 5 people in line every time I go. The food comes out very quick though and I don&#39;t think I ever waited more than 10 minutes. All the employees are very friendly and I never had a problem with the service.

The food is pretty solid, especially for the price point. The tacos were under $2 each and they don&#39;t skimp on the filling. You can either get lettuce and tomato or cilantro and onion toppings on your tacos along with cheese. My go to order is 2 ground beef tacos and 2 chicken tacos. The ground beef is always super flavorful and the chicken is surprisingly moist. They also deliver red and green salsas to the table, which blend perfectly with the taco filling. In my opinion though, the best part of the taco is the tortilla. I don&#39;t know how they do it, but Paul&#39;s managed to put just the right amount of crispiness on their tortillas and it never gets soggy from the filling. 

Overall, Paul&#39;s is the perfect place to grab a quick lunch for not a lot of money, and the food is damn delicious."

***** FOOD. We devoured it. I got the taco dinner with beef and man-oh-man was it yummy. I swapped the lettuce for cilantro which was just what my taste buds needed to sing a requiem for Elysium. M got the tacos too and she&#39;s a taco connoisseur. We agreed that what made these tacos incredible was the meat. The ground beef was good quality and the portion of meat was generous. I&#39;m used to tacos where the lettuce (or cilantro), tomatoes, and cheese overwhelms the meat so Paul&#39;s Burrito Express was a welcome exception. Our buddy Dan got the burrito and he seemed to like it. We enjoyed watching sour cream ooze out onto his face and hands while he conquered the beast!

***** FRIENDLINESS. The employees were friendly to us. They seemed sincere in their friendliness but not over-the-top. The lady gave me an extra Mexican candy when I asked for one. Score!

***** PRICE. My taco dinner, Mexican grape flavored, sweet potato candy, Dan&#39;s burrito, and two Mexican carbonated beverages came to under $20. (M ordered and paid separately).

***** OUTDOOR SEATING. Well, it was just regular tables and umbrellas but it was nice. The view was of a parking lot, the street, and the sidewalk. But it was a beautiful day and we really appreciated that Paul&#39;s Burrito Express had an outdoor dining area.

***** INDOOR SEATING and WAITING AREA. Paul&#39;s Burrito Express is divided into two rooms. The first room has a long counter for ordering and a bench opposite for waiting. It&#39;s really nice that they seem to live up to their name of being &#34;express.&#34; The other room seemed to be a dining area. We didn&#39;t eat inside so I only caught glimpses of it from the first room. It seemed to be pretty typical of an independently owned fast-food joint."

I got the fish tacos since everyone raved about them. They were good. The fish was thin, crispy strips of fish but really there wasn&#39;t much fish flavor at all. I won&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t delicious because it still was (probably the texture and other flavors more than anything). I&#39;d love to try their other tacos next time. 

I also got their steak burrito dinner. BIG burrito filled with steak, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream. I&#39;m probably used to Chipotle rather than authentic Mexican food but I really kind of wanted some rice inside my burrito. There was TONS of steak and the tortilla was cooked perfectly. Downside to the steak was that it was a bit salty. 

The rice tasted authentic but lacked a bit of flavor. Not the best rice I&#39;ve had but it was still good. I&#39;m really not a fan of beans but I decided to give them a try... well I&#39;m still not a fan of beans so that gives you an idea of how I felt about them. 

I would definitely give this place another try to try some other dishes. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any Mexican restaurants around that area so it really is a great spot. It&#39;s right next to the center of Downtown Barrington, you really can&#39;t miss it."

The tacos came out hot from the kitchen and they did not disappoint. The idea of eating tongue scares some people, but it&#39;s quite tasty. Salty and chewy, very delicious. Seasoned perfectly. The chicken was great, a little salty, but very flavorful. You can tell it was marinated for a long time. It was so tender! Lettuce, tomato, and cilantro were very fresh. I was very impressed with my meal and I will return for more."

I believe this restaurant is tied to several other, including ones in Wauconda and Mundelein, but the names are a bit different and this one isn&#39;t listed on the site yet. But the menu listed on the site is the same. I&#39;ve only been here twice so far but have been pleasantly surprised. I ordered tacos on my first trip; tried one each of chicken, beef and chorizo. I have to admit that the chicken was a bit dry and bland (that&#39;s the hurdle with chicken) but both the beef and chorizo were excellent. Rice and beans are classically delicious. And while I prefer my salsas, or at least one of the options, to be REALLY spicy, both are at least flavorful (a green and red). My second trip I tried the queen burrito. It&#39;s very nice to have that option on size. This time I tried the steak, which was very good, albeit somewhat runny. 

As someone who usually has to talk themselves out of getting Mexican food whenever I crave it, it will be much harder now that I can convince myself to be impartial between the two local spots. Taco Tuesday, and burrito Wednesdays it is!

Definitely give this place a try if you&#39;re in for a quick bite. They live up to the speediness of their name."

Oh, and another thing. When was the last time you went to a restaurant and found the prices on the menu marked down: will wonders never cease!

Paul&#39;s is the genuine article with the full range of all the recognizable Mexican dishes from appetizers (Botanas) to deserts. And if your kids won&#39;t eat Mexican there are hot dogs, french fries, grilled cheese, and chicken fingers.

The ambiance is fast food, but one could bring a libation or two to the party even though the staff wasn&#39;t sure what their BYOB policy is. You can apologize later...

I think that Mikes is far and away the best of the chain sub joints, and as good or better than most Italian delis in Chicagoland. Yeah Bari, Grazianos and Alpine are the elite players, but Mikes is more convenient and a stellar substitute. My favorite pickin&#39;s center around the Jersey Shore, Roast Beef and the Super sub, all Mikes way with vinegar and EXTRA OIL!!

 The sub in a tub option is a neat way of eliminating the carbs, and the extra oil makes all the lettuce at the bottom of the tub taste salad-like."

The workers there are efficient and fast. I am amazed at how many orders they can keep straight at one time but they have never screwed up our order.

That being said, it wouldn&#39;t kill them to slow down a tad and focus on the individual customer. It can be hard to know if they are making your sandwich or someone else&#39;s which just leads to confusion.  At times you feel rushed as well. It&#39;s a very get em in and out atmosphere.

The buffalo chicken is ok -- I found myself adding more buffalo to the sandwich.  The tuna is definitely fresh and not too much mayo.  The Jersey Shore favorite is really good, nice and fresh.

If you order a regular sub that&#39;s pretty much all you need for meal -- they are huge!!  If you like onions and all sorts of vinegar goodness, get the sub Mike&#39;s Way, you can&#39;t go wrong.

Their menu is a little confusing as they have all these different sizes of subs and way too many options.

I like to keep it simple most of the time and I stick with the turkey and cheese.  It&#39;s not the cheapest on the block, but it&#39;s definitely fresh and delicious.  The bread is to die for!  And the ingredients don&#39;t feel like they&#39;ve been sitting around all day.

OK, that doesn&#39;t really happen. Your eyes might become big and bright in wonderment when you see what is presented in front of you, however.

An entire loaf of homemade Italian bread that appears to exceed a foot. We didn&#39;t measure it but I&#39;ll be sure to ask someone the next time I&#39;m there. 

It&#39;s well worth the $9.25 - $11.45 price tag. Unless you have an appetitie to match its size, you&#39;ll wish you asked the counter person to cut it in quarters. 

My boyfriend ordered a Giant Chicken Parmesan sandwich tonight. Chicken and  tomato sauce grilled until the provolone and parmesan cheeses are melted then sandwiched between the bread and cut in half. 

Don&#39;t let the size fool you. A mini is 6 inches. A regular is something in between. They have hot and cold subs. You can make any sandwich into a wrap or salad. They have a variety of chips and cookies to choose from. I love Coke products. Jersey Mike&#39;s likes Pepsi.  

A kid&#39;s meal is only $3.99. It includes a kid size sub, drink (hopefully you advocate good parenting by not choosing soda) and a cookie. 

I ordered the mini Tuna Fish for $4.55. When they put it that way, it doesn&#39;t sound very appetizing. The counter person asked if I wanted it Mike&#39;s way. I don&#39;t know what that is. There&#39;s no description on the menu; besides, I like mine just the way it is with lettuce to add crunch.

The restaurant is very clean and well maintained. Mike likes sports so there are 3 TVs to watch a game while you eat. 

Just like his sandwich, the staff keeps getting taller. There were twin girls working together. They stood at least 5&#39;10&#34; and there was a young man who came out to help who was at least 6&#39;5&#34;. They were very nice and full of smiles. Mike likes all things long and lean. Just kidding!"

Though I have yet to return to this establishment, I did speak with the owner and he was very conciliatory about my experience here. Looks like they have put start dates on their cards and marketing info for new Jersey Mike&#39;s stores, so my concerns were heard and will benefit everyone.

I have visited two other Jersey Mike&#39;s stores operated by the same owner and the service and food was excellent. Given that experience and the follow up from the owner, I&#39;ll keep my rating at 3 stars pending a visit at some point - should I be in the area."

I got it on wheat, they also offer white bread. 

The service was good and friendly.  They were packed at lunch and most customers went to Chipotle instead, my friends that stayed waited about 30 minutes to order their food at Mike&#39;s while me and my other friend ordered and ate at Chipotle in the same time.

They suggested the Chipotle Cheesesteak 43, which looked really good as well. 

I like the nice crunchy bread, and the bacon as yummmmyyyyy.  The staff are extremely nice and friendly and helpful with suggestions if you don&#39;t know what you want.   


 Its on the more expensive side since Chipotle next door offers Organic and Naturally raised food for 6.25 for steak.  5.95 for chicken and veggie, aka guac.  I did have a nice card for $1 donation minimum got me a free regular sub til the 6th.  They went around to Schaumburg businesses and schools.  

I&#39;d say that ranging from 5.45-6.75 for regular sandwiches, 4.35-4.85 for mini, and 9.45-10.95 for giant sandwiches makes this place on the more expensive side.    I must say it is better than Jimmy John&#39;s though.  But I still prefer my Chiptole but may throw Jersey&#39;s in the mix if they get the lunch crowd under control after the grand opening rush :)"

To me this franchise has better, fresher tasting sammiches than Subway and Jimmy Johns. 

My fav cold sub is the Super Sub with ham, prosciutto, cappacoulo, and provolone. While the best hot sub to me is the Jersey Mikes Famous Philly...you simply can&#39;t beat steak, grilled onions, and melted cheeeeeese.

This location is sort of hidden since it&#39;s not on the main strip, but its right behind the Jamba Juice in case you are wondering. This place gets extremely busy during the lunch rush but the line moves along fairly quickly. If you are sick of the bland subs at other spots then definitely give Jersey Mikes a try.  

It is way better than Subway and a couple notches better than Jimmy Johns in my humble opinion.

You know how sometimes you may wonder &#34;Hmm, I wonder if the owners of the businesses I Yelp about ACTUALLY listen/read my Yelps and actually do something about it or at least address them? Are my yelps falling on deaf ears(blind eyes?)&#34;

Well, flashback to yesterday where my husband and I were wondering about a dinner option on Sunday and I off-handedly mentioned Jersey Mike&#39;s.....(yes, again!  Please note past update review a few days ago...)  Since I am the type of Yelper that likes to try EVERYTHING about a new store/restaurant out to give it a thorough review for those who actually read the Yelps and know what they are in for...I figure, eh, why not? 

I wanted to try their Albacore Tuna Salad sub and my husband wanted the Italian sub that I had the last time. Soooo...I walk in at about 7:45pm....I see that a employee is working on a catering order of about four large sandwich boxes with at least a dozen or so subs being cut and wrapped into neat little hand-sized sandwiches for party type consumption.

I was wondering if I was going to wait a bit since it looked like they were working dilligently on the order as it looked to be due to be picked-up soon.  It only took less than a few minutes when a smiling helpful employee greeted me(twice!) and asked for my order. :)  I gave him my order and he started to fervishly make my husband and my subs.  

As he was making the subs, he asked me &#34;Ok, this is going to sound kind of weird, but.....do you go on Yelp?&#34; (!!!!)  I said &#34;Yes, I do!&#34; :)  I was actually surprised he acknowledged me because apparently he recognized me from my profile and my Yelps of the shop.  His name was Dan(Hi Dan! *wavewave*) and he was the Assistant Manager on-duty that night.  He was very enthusiastic about Yelp and thanked me for my positive Yelps for Jersey Mike&#39;s.  I also found out that his co-worker, the employee on the catering order was named Ryan. :) 

So, to those Yelpers who mentioned the employees not caring or somesuch(I forget). I say to you, NAY! That is not true in this case. From the three, separate times I&#39;ve been in Jersey Mike&#39;s Subs, at opening, lunchtime, and evening, I&#39;ve always been served promptly. 

Anyway.....as for my subs....the Albacore Tuna Sub was very yummy and not as &#34;oniony&#34; as the OTHER sub shop (*cough* Jimmy Johns *cough*)  I enjoyed it, but I will have to try it again to get a better view of it as I am not sure if it is me or the tuna salad.   Ahem, I&#39;ll just leave it at that. :)  As far as taste, it was great! :)  (sorry for the TMI there!) 

Overall, third time&#39;s a charm! :)  Great, enthusiastic employees...hmm, maybe next time I will check out the bathroom....the hallway looked inviting. :)  They say the cleanliness of the shop&#39;s bathroom is a sign of how much the owners care.  (HInt hint, Dan... ;))

Ok, so, until next time....I think I&#39;ll go the hot sub route yet or maybe one of their wraps....so many choices...O_o"

The menu is pretty broad. Hot and warm subs, wraps, salads and soups. Michael tried the meatball sub - he really liked it. There was a lot of sauce and cheese, so he was a happy guy. Anthony went with a a #56...86 the mushrooms (Big Kahuna Cheese Steak - steak, grilled onions, peppers, chipotle mayo) He called it delicious and ate every bite. I ordered a chicken Parmesan sub, easy sauce with the cheese well done. Unfortunately, I was not very clear and there was way too much sauce and warmed cheese on my sub. Walk in Keegan. He graciously offered to re-make my sub. We were smart this time and just had him put the sauce on the side. It was yummy. 

The whole place was really clean. You can refill your drink as needed (Pepsi products) The lighting was good and they had the Bears preseason game on with volume, so we enjoyed the whole experience. Make sure to get a frequent buyers club card so you can earn free subs!"

The main disappointment was the fact that I could only use my coupon on my actual birthday. I emailed them to see if I could use it on a different day since I was unable to but have yet to hear from them and it is going on about a month now.

The meatball is one of my personal favorites and puts Subway&#39;s meatball to shame.

When I saw this location open up close to home I decided to try it again and was hooked. I discovered that the best way to eat your sub is the way Mike intended by ordering it Mike&#39;s way. I usually like my subs with everything on them but I&#39;m slowly learning that less is more for certain subs. 

The bread to filling ratio is near perfect which means you&#39;re not overwhelmed with an oversized &#34;Busway&#34; pillow of bread. Meat is sliced in front of you while the slicer attempts to entertain you by being obnoxious with his/her co-workers or you. It&#39;s a friendly obnoxious so I let it slide. It sure beats a disgruntled &#34;Busway&#34; owner and his wife skimping on toppings because he is forced to participate in some ridiculously over advertised campaign involving 12 inches for 5 fingers in payment.

For being a chain sub shop, I am impressed and can count on Jersey Mike&#39;s strewn across the U.S. for a consistently good sub."

The sandwiches are pretty hefty and REALLY tasty. Their menu selection isn&#39;t as large as you&#39;d expect for a sandwich chain, but it&#39;s quality food with tons of ingredients piled on and a little different buzz to it from other places like Subway which keeps bringing in the buisness.

I love Italian sandwiches normally, but I&#39;d say it was a little bit of a let down, even though it was still good. Their hot sandwiches are out of this world but beware, if you want jalapenos, request they go light on them. I&#39;m a HUGE fan of jalapenos, but it was some burnin&#39; love in my mouth and I was dying for milk rather than soda. 

This particular location is clean, cozy, and the staff is INCREDIBLY nice and accommodating. The location off the street is convenient and I would come down Golf to get a sandwich here again. Check it out."

My fiancee gets the chicken Caesar wrap literally every time. I have to admit that is pretty good, too. I have had some hot and cold sandwiches. The buffalo chicken wrap was OK, but everything else has been pretty above average across the board. They just started a rewards program, I think. That is pretty cool considering Subway stopped doing that a long time ago.

It&#39;s a bit pricey for a sandwich but no more than Quiznos or anywhere comparable. The staff is always friendly and attentive. It&#39;d be a good place to try if you&#39;ve never been. I will eat there for sure, again."

This location is on the corner of Schaumburg Rd and Barrington Rd, this is not the location in the Streets of Woodfield, a good few miles east. 
I&#39;ll flag this locale and hopefully they can split up the reviews as obviously some folks requested the locations be merged, there are reviews WAY older than this place has been open.

Anyhoo, I stopped by Jersey Mike&#39;s this evening for a quick bite before my Scrabble meetup (Go Scrabble, yay!) as I had driven past the place a few times but was always lured in by the goodness that is Chipotle. But not this time. Walked in and things were quiet, but that&#39;s not always bad. The staff was friendly and engaging and they recommended a cold sub with cappacuolo ham, proscuittini ham and provolone cheese. I got a regular sized and gussied it up &#34;MIke&#39;s Way&#34; adding some light mayo as well. Got a Cherry Pepsi on the side, sat down and dug in.

Damn, they make a good sub! Their bread is obviously made very fresh and having them shave the meat and cheese right in front of me went a long way toward the quality of the food. It had a much better taste than Potbellys or Subway and I walked away feeling satisfied and not at all ripped off, despite the slightly higher price tag of their sandwiches.

I plan on getting a hot sub next time, either a steak or meatball. But man, I have a new favorite local sub shop."

The employees are EXTREMELY friendly and try to &#34;engage&#34; you, and they are also flexible.  For example, I didn&#39;t bring my stamp card one day and they didn&#39;t have any in the store, so the guy made a note on the receipt with an &#34;extra&#34; for the inconvenience of possibly having to find the same guy to get the credit.  They are very fast EVEN though they cut the meat in front of you, and have never been inaccurate.  The only bad things (besides price) are 1) the same guy seems to work nearly every day, and they don&#39;t have many customers, so you will be recognized even by the second visit, and 2) no paper towels in the bathroom.

I like this place because of the atmosphere.  It is sort of &#34;small-town restaurant&#34; like but without the negative things that come with that label.  It has big open windows so the sun (or rain!) shows through, is exceptionally clean and plays mostly-good, 90s music.  That is, you won&#39;t hear any &#34;new alternative&#34; crap, but you will occasionally hear a 70s &#34;soft song&#34; for a break from your favorite songs if you listened to B96 in 1995.  The volume is neither loud nor at that horrible soft level most restaurants use in order to try and give you a headache.  In other words the perfect volume.

The subs are pretty good, they don&#39;t have as many condiment choices as Subway but that does make it easy since they kind-of want you to order fast.  Just be sure to get some kind of oils or sauce, if you do this your sub will taste good.  If you&#39;re semi-rich and don&#39;t want to go to Subway today or want only one sandwich instead of two, definitely go here and eat inside.  Atmosphere-wise it is my favorite place around here.  I am not sure if it would be possible to sit here though.  They do have WiFi from Meatheads, and a decent amount of plugs as well.  Also private clean bathrooms.

P.S. This is good review and I like the place.  I am bad at writing."

Too bad he didn&#39;t have a little patience because the sub I got was GREAT.  I got the chipotle cheese steak and it owned.  I don&#39;t like green peppers and forgot to ask them to omit them.  Figuring it was to much work to pick them off, I tried a bite...DELICIOUS!!  The chipotle mayo was incredible and the steak was tender as heck.  

Since I had that sandwich for free, I decided to get another one...ham, capicola and provolone.  They use actual lunch meat, not that processed crap Subway calls lunch meat.  That sandwich was also top-shelf.  There was nothing not to like about it.

Even the service was great.  The line was out the door when we got there, was longer by the time we got our food and they got everyone in and out quickly.  The service staff was also very friendly and talkative.  

In short, if you like REAL deli-style meat on your sandwich and quick service, this place is for you."

They have both hot and cold sandwiches. And they are all good!

At most places they pre-slice their deli meat and have it sit around for awhile but not at this place. They slice the meat fresh for you when as you order. Can&#39;t beat that!

The service is fast and friendly. Just what you want when you&#39;re in a hurry to grab something on your lunch break.

Friday afternoon @ 12:30 and they were pretty busy, but the line moved quickly.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and the Turkey / Provolone Sub on Wheat.  Of course, I took advantage of the fabulous Yelp Check in Offer of buy one get one free.  Lunch AND dinner for $6.00.  Awesome in my book.  The Turkey sub was done in a flash and everything looked really fresh and tasty.  The Buffalo Chicken Wrap took quite a bit longer but nothing to get upset about.  Took both to go.  

I really wanted to love the Buffalo Chicken Wrap but it was just ok.  A little too much blue cheese for my liking, but over all, it was fine.  The Turkey Sub was fantastic.  Not too salty like what I get at Jimmy John&#39;s.  Very Fresh, and the bread was nice and crusty.  Overall, a great value and I wil certainly be back to try some of their other specialties."

The food was fresh, sandwichy - nothing out of the ordinary there.  the restaurant was well lit with a beach theme and a plasma tv (on mute) on each corner.   
The one &#39;complaint&#39; i have is that it is too quiet in here when it  is not busy.  The  Wooden floors caused even the smallest noise to echo.

We had them today and were not disappointed at all, the service was great, the shop very clean and the overall experience great. I will have to say though, there is a lot less meat and way too much lettuce than I am used to. The bread is still great, which is what made them famous in the first place and the sandwich was very good. I am giving 4 stars because for the price you pay, you should get more meat and cheese. I know that there is a guideline to follow and meat can get expensive, but that&#39;s not how the original  Mike&#39;s did it in the past and unfortunately it&#39;s changed.

I get why people don&#39;t come here anymore. The service is terrible, games are over priced and so is the sub par food.

Walking in, it has the hardware for a good sports bar: a lot of big screen TVs, big bar area, lots of seats, lots of bar seating with great views to the TVs.  So, why isn&#39;t it kind of crowded?  There was a large group that looked like a speed dating gathering (I know it wasn&#39;t one, it just looked and acted that way).  

I will summarize because Yelp limits reviews: Service was poor (the bartender&#39;s girlfriend was there and she was drunk and ordering shots loudly and cursing, while children roamed through the bar) and the bartender, she was not the most attentive...you are there to sell drinks, sell us some beer....and, again, it is not like it was that busy.  However, her girlfriend DID get her shots!  The food; we mostly just ate a lot of appetizers....merely standard bar food (which I have nothing against, but it was not anything special).  

The feeling was they spent all this money on building a a pretty nice looking sports bar and then imported the staff and clientele from a local dive bar (again, I have nothing against local dive bars).  This isn&#39;t a place I would go to just to hang out and watch sports.  Sad.

So, the games are going on and exciting (OK, not the Bears) and the announcement comes: We will be closing at 11, get out.  We had to go and find a different place to watch the end of the games."

The place was very new and fresh. It was recently remodeled and reminded me of a great sports bar. The waitress Jenny was on the spot, very helpful and very friendly. The the menu was New and very creative. My son had slider and wing combo. He was in heaven. I had the wings and ribs combo. Fall off the bone ribs. Price was nice and came with a play card. The beer was cold and my wife&#39;s bloody Mary was very tasty. The games are all new and updated and there was plenty of them. All the newest games were there. The kids had a blast. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn&#39;t been there in a while to try again. Very comfortable environment. We go out often and were very impressed with the recent remodel and the food."

This was my first visit in over 10 years. My last visit was OK but I had no idea they had increased their level of food! OMG! Talk about delicious! We had a few appetizers such as calamari which was good too. But the burger they made me was out of this world! Who would have thought that the food here would be of such high caliber? Not me.

I had The South Philly Burger. A half-pound burger loaded with thinly sliced steak imported
directly from South Philly. Topped with peppers, onion, mushrooms
and melted American cheese on a toasted brioche bun. Served
with over half a pound of seasoned french fries. This burger was one of the best I have ever had. And I have had a lot of burgers and at burger joints. This was juicy, tender, cooked just right and the taste was outstanding!

I can&#39;t wait to go back!"

I came on a Saturday night. Boy, was it crowded! We had to wait an hour to eat. But no big deal! Take your buzzer and play some games until your table is ready. Oh, and don&#39;t forget to stop at the bar to walk around with a cocktail ;) There is also first come, first serve seating in the game area to order food. But on the weekend, good luck.

What I thought was really cool were the new games. Games that are popular on smart phone and tablet devices, my 2.5 year old son loved those!

The reason for my 3 star review; the food. Salty, no flavor. Typical. Also, the prizes. Horrible selection of prizes! I remember even just 5-10 years ago they were much better. For $20 in ticket winnings, we got a bouncy ball, gummy bears and a sticky hand. I guess we just need to be better at arcade games LOL

I&#39;ll be back, though. Been coming here for years. It&#39;s fun."

When we came in we wanted to get a table but were told to wait because of our ages...? I understand it has a bar but the purpose of coming here is not just to get wasted. You&#39;re checking my ID because...why??? This isn&#39;t a night club. 

The over all experience was enjoyable and my 11 year old brother had a blast for his birthday. Despite it being his birthday we were told &#39;we don&#39;t do birthdays&#39; and they added the one slice of cake to the bill. Fine. Rob who was our server was friendly yet he was so loud. He was literally yelling in my ear every time he came to the table. Also, he made us take the plates and cups as he brought them to the table. He did not set them down on the table. We had to server ourselves from his hands. This irked me along with the cake real bad. Had I been the one paying I would&#39;ve left a subpar tip for being yelled at and made to grab my plates and drinks. Some waiter service? Wow this is already a long review...

The food itself was fine no problems with that. Two cheese sticks came to the table with no cheese tho... Kinda disappointing. The burgers were big and my companions enjoyed them. I enjoyed the steak and shrimp alefredo and mom enjoyed the cabo chicken. 

However for $131 no tip nor any alcohol, that&#39;s a bit much even if we got game cards. We didn&#39;t even end up getting any prizes because for 2500 tickets there was nothing good. Oh well. My brother enjoyed his birthday and that&#39;s all that counts. You get what you get. I wouldn&#39;t come back. But over all the games were enjoyable."

The staff was really friendly, service was good, nothing amazing just very standard. There&#39;s a larger dining area and a spot with giant tvs, big bar, although I don&#39;t really think I&#39;d go to just eat.

The arcade is definitely the attraction. There are a lot of games, we were entertained for over 3hrs as adults. There are of course kids but we only saw a couple earlier on, it seemed as it got later they went home. We went on a Sunday.
There are a lot of racing and shooting games. We spent around $80 on game play and like I said that was for 2 adults over 3hrs. They have half priced games on Wednesdays.
The prize room is alright. There are some cool things but there&#39;s no way you&#39;d get them after a single visit. So it&#39;d be cool if they had some better lower level prizes. We got a head massager, a DB pint glass, a glowing usb charger, and a sour punch straws. Cooler stuff but for what u spend. ..

Overall we greatly enjoyed our experience, it was a fun time that can be very affordable"

Now, I&#39;m still mourning the loss of ESPN Zone downtown as game-wise, they had it all over D&amp;B&#39;s. But overall, there were a good variety of games here and more importantly, they weren&#39;t out of order or malfunctioning while being used as I recall on my last couple of visits.

I enjoyed the four way air hockey game, though I wish we had a fourth to cover the other side - the game would have been more fun. Air hockey is a game that I&#39;ve played with my brother&#39;s kids for an eternity - we always look for a game whenever we&#39;re at an arcade or the like. There was a &#34;Simpson&#39;s Soccer Game&#34; that was fun, though it would have been better if it lasted a little longer than 30 seconds - the ball on it was slow to return, so players don&#39;t get too many chances. The &#34;Deal or No Deal&#34; game for tickets was an interesting concept - unfortunately the kids got down to the last two bags with one of them being the max ticket &#34;250 case&#34; - they opted for &#34;No Deal&#34; and the 250 case was NOT theirs - instead they got 12 tix (the deal would have been 132!).

One improvement that would be nice - the tables where people eat at and the surrounding floor get pretty gnarly at times. It would be nice if they had an extra staff person around to help with the cleanup. I do like the 11PM under 21 policy. The last time I was at Gameworks, their &#34;scoot time&#34; was 9PM, which is a little short for teens. Overall, it was a better than anticipated experience."

She accidentally messed up the order for one of my friends but came back and apologized and placed the order for what he actually ordered. But the waiter that brought it out...I mean I know I have a loud laugh..and when he brought the food out, my friend said something to him and whatever the waiter&#39;s response was-I thought it was funny so obviously I laughed.

Though,  I would give them a perfect 5 stars usually but the service was a little sub par today. I was there for lunch with my daughter,  and we had to search for someone to seat us.  Once seated the server did exactly her job but was not overly warm or inviting.   Both stark differences from my previous visits.   I ordered the short rib and Mac sandwich.  It was great and very filling.   My daughter got pretzel dogs.   I understand that pretzels are usually salted,  but these had so much salt on them you could not taste anything else. 

We ventured to the gaming area and had a great time and  collected a large amount of tickets for her.   We went to unload our bounty but the person working that area had vanished.   Nothing there to let us know when or if she was returning.   Once she was there,  her attitude was off putting.  It was as if we were interrupting her day. 

These are very atypical occurrences so I will keep visiting and speaking well of them,  but they do have some imperfect days too."

My main reason for excitement for going to a D&amp;B for the first time was that, unlike a Chuck-E-Cheese, the games wouldn&#39;t be covered in boogers and/or broken and I&#39;d be able to enjoy a few drinks and leisurely enjoy some gaming.

I also ordered their equivalent of a Long Island at the bar, the TNTea, and I was appalled at what I saw. For a $9 drink, I watched the bartender fill MAYBE a centimeter of the bottom of tall tulip glass and THEN add the ice (what the hell). It was that little smidgen of alcohol and then nothing but sweet and sour mix. Disgusting. Thankfully the server at my table took it to the second bar in the Midway where, even they admit, the bartenders were better.

We decided to order food first then do the gaming second. Our boss gave us a budget and we all ended up doing the eat + play with double the game time ($24.99) Since I had to resume work post event, I skipped the booze and went for the Million Dollar slushy. Most of the people at our table did get booze and seemed happy with their cocktails. My slushy was really good, albeit incredibly sweet. We ordered the appetizer combo and it was delicious! The fried shrimp, quesadillas and pretzel dogs were the best part. They came with this ridiculous cheese sauce that I wanted to bathe in.. MMMMMmmmmm. When I come back, this will be on the &#39;must order&#39; list.

For the entree, I went with the philly cheesesteak sandwich. I like that it had a lot of mushrooms on it, but the flavor wasn&#39;t the greatest. It seemed like it was lacking a little something to make it perfect. The fries were flavorful and salty -- just the way I like them. The burgers were fricking huge, so if you&#39;re going for the Eat and Play, I think that&#39;s the way to go.

It was a Tuesday night, so the game room was pretty dead minus a few families. We were able to quickly blow through our game time. and earn some tickets. I did discover to watch for the signs that say &#34;FREE&#34; These games are new and you can play once per game card for free. I became incredibly addicted to one of the free games where you throw the balls at the clowns. I think I blew most of my $20 on that dumb game. I even worked up a bit of a sweat!  I ended the evening with 539 tickets and got a small stuffed Hello Kitty to bring home for the dogs.

If you plan on going to any D&amp;B, make sure to sign up for their emails prior to your visit. You can usually get some kind of coupon for bonus play time."

The games: loads of fun. I wish there were more of certain ones (sports), so we didn&#39;t have to wait for others to be done. Wednesday&#39;s are the best days- half price games! Otherwise, it&#39;s expensive. But all and all I will be back because of the games :)

The food: fine. I&#39;ve had the Caesar salad which was pretty fresh, and Cabo chicken. Which could have used more of that salsa. It&#39;s fine for game food :)

The drinks: last summer I had some awesome tasting shots from a male bartender. Tonight , though- The 3 bartenders were the absolute slowest and unfriendly I&#39;ve ever encountered. My friend waited for a draft beer for ten minutes. Really? It wasn&#39;t even busy. It was a DRAFT. Then when we just wanted to close out, we sat there for 6 minutes before being acknowledged with a &#34;I&#39;ll be right with you.&#34; Then one bartender was cleaning off plates and I finally just said we just needed to close out. If there are people waiting, who starts to clean plates behind the bar? If I wasn&#39;t in a rush to leave I would have spoke to the manager.

It&#39;s no fun when the games take an excessive amount of credits and you don&#39;t get to enjoy at least an hour there. The manager wouldn&#39;t let me bring in a bottle of water which I needed to take my meds with so I went to the bar and waited 15 minutes for a glass of ice water and NO ONE can to wait on me.

The server told my gf  that it would take too long for the manager to come over and take care of it.      She just added more chips to the cards instead of taking off the price.      
(I earlier  in the evening observed the manager being called over for another table he came within 5 minutes. )

I saw him spoke to him and the server saw me speaking to him than offered to take care of it.           In the end it was taken care of but the part that pissed me off was being lied to    And the couple sitting next to us was overcharged also.      They were trying to fix it too.

I definitely don&#39;t go here on a regular basis because I consider it an expensive night out, but it is fun to go here on a special occasion or with friends.  

I recommend going a little later in the night on the weekends because it is usually crowded with kids earlier in the evening.  The game selection is good with a mix of old classic games and new fancy games.  I personally love the classic games like skee ball and the basketball games.  My husband loves the race car games and air hockey! 

There is a bar in the game area and we visited that to get a drink.  I thought the drinks were a little overpriced. 

Every time I go here, I see young kids walking around with a massive cup full of tickets and I wonder how in the heck they get so many.  They either must be way way better at the games than me or there parents are giving them way way too much money.

If they can at least clean up the place we would all consider going back and just not eating, but yuck!"

they need to UPDATE THE VIDEO GAMES !!  PLEASE.  most of the games are old driver and shoot em up from like 2003.  the graphics suck, the machines are pretty beat up and the plot lines are just retarded.  home video systems have come a long way...and your arcade versions are just way too far behind what we can do at home for free.

this place is not cheap....with updated and new games i think it&#39;s worth going there outsside of just special events....the way it is now this place is kind of overpriced.  i hosted a bday party for 10 girls under 12 and spent about 400 bucks.  that was for the shared room, some apps and soda.  then they got limited ticket games and unlimited video games.  time to step it up dave and busters....you&#39;re starting to look your age."

The last time we went most of the games were broken. I&#39;ve always felt that it&#39;s overpriced, but I was most disappointed last time due to the fact that so many of the games weren&#39;t working. The prize selection is nice and always changing; however, the woman working the prize area last time clearly was either not having a good day or did not enjoy her job. The food is alright. I never expected too much but it&#39;s certainly not bad, just nothing to write home about. Overall, it&#39;s a fun place.

I had to flag down a bartender a few times before being able to order a drink. Games are fun but it will take a lot of points to get something worthy at the gift center. I would recommend checking out Emporium arcade bar it the city (logan square) if you like to play games while having a few drinks. Overall, it was a pretty cool place to celebrate with a big party.

I noticed this D&amp;B was huge. I&#39;m from So Cal and all the D&amp;Bs I have been to are located within mall plazas but this location is a whole building in its own parking lot. I didn&#39;t not really explore the entire area so I can&#39;t say for sure how big it is, but it seemed really spacious."

Drinks were pretty decent- I would recommend the adult slushies! Esp the blue raspberry one. 

Service was definitely slacking. We got there too late to sit in whatever football Sunday event raffle area so we were sat by ourselves in the dining area. We seemed to be her only table and she was kinda in her own world and taking her sweet time on things. 

Whatever raffle thing they had seemed to be a lot of fun, we just arrived too late for that.

After three, I still didn&#39;t feel anything so I gave up. The bar also smelled horribly like vomit each time we would get close to it.  

We each spent $35 on a card for games and were pretty surprised that it lasted from about 930-Midnight. We had fun but expected there to be more games. Maybe its just that I haven&#39;t been there in YEARS, but I remember it being so much larger with a huge gift shop. Now, it is just junk. I spent 2000 tickets on gummy bears, I think im set for a very long while.

I was upset and went to the front and spoke to the manager, Ed, who explained that last year they were overwhelmed with the school vacation and too many orders for tacos.

Every time I take 355 towards Naperville, I always see this D&amp;B right off the highway. I finally decided to come here because of a company meeting. This place has a TON of video games. I&#39;m more of a interactive gamer (think basketball, driving games, shooting games) but this place has a LOT of choices to choose from. The prices were kind of expensive, to me at least. What happened to back in the day where stuff just costed a quarter?? Yes, I&#39;m old... and &#34;out of it&#34; I suppose. 

What was cool was that I never had the food at D&amp;B and be far, was blown away by it. Maybe I gave it low expectations because this is a video arcade place, not a restaurant. But man, we got some gooooood mexican food. The spread included chicken fajitas, steak fajitas, guac, tacos. beans, rice, the whole nine yards. The chicken was super moist and soft, the steak was juicy and absolutely delicious. If you plan on going here for your video game fix, definitely consider eating here as well.

BATHROOM REVIEW -- Located near the center of the place the bathrooms were super spacious and had privacy dividers with each urinal. It was also one of those urinals that continue into the floor, so this totally caters to old suburbanites getting sloshed at a D&amp;B. Aiming not required. The stalls were super clean as well. The only gripe is that it had one paper towel dispenser, but multiple sinks. Sit or squat? Sit!"

Although, there&#39;s not that many games. Only about 60 games, but 30 of the games you can get tickets from and the rest are just for fun. Keep in mind that other arcades(Example: Game Works) have more than 100 games. It&#39;s easier to get tickets for prizes at Dave and Busters than Game Works. It&#39;s a bit dirty and there isn&#39;t good food there. They should add pizza which would be nice, but they have weird food. Although, it&#39;s the fun that matters and it is quite nice and fun!"

Going out is a pretty big deal for me right now....

the last time my husband and I came here (before my surgery) my tomato bisque soup was more like cold tomato water. I asked for another and they brought back microwaved tomato water, but I thought &#34;oh well&#34;- everything else was fine so no biggie not like the food is high quality gourmet anyway.

We decided last night to come here to have dinner, drinks, and more than likely see how well I can play some games. Essentially we wanted a well rounded entertainment night to celebrate my progress with recovery. However the front desk was completely vacant and no one was at the hostess stand to seat us. There was one group at a booth and after waiting alone for a while I saw a waiter or possibly bar tender bringing them drinks and talking to them. He looked at us several times with no wave, smile, or any kind of recognition and never sat us or sent someone to do so. With crutches and a large leg brace, we waited (standing) 
And other people came to wait behind us but eventually left.

We decided to leave and go somewhere else but we wanted to complain to someone but of course there wasn&#39;t any one we could find anywhere. The food isn&#39;t that great anyway, we will just go to game works from now on."

I enjoy playing the traditional games, such as ski ball and racing games, and also have fun playing some of the shooters with my friends. 

I will echo the complaint of a few other reviewers and say that small children are here far too late on a fairly regular basis. 

I&#39;ve attended a party here before as well, which had a nice taco buffet that was quite good, and included a card with a certain amount of credits on it.

Overall, I enjoy this location. The staff is friendly, food is good, drinks are delicious, and games are fun. Too pricey for regular visits- but definitely worth checking out if you are in the area looking for something to do."

They have some fun games like air hockey and skee ball.  And I must say, those push coin machines are the DEVIL!  They suck you in making you think you are so close to dropping coins (just for tickets no less), but they don&#39;t drop!!  Very addicting.  Some of the machines do break down regularly, but most of them were working when I was there.  For the ones that spit out tickets, if it&#39;s not crowded, you can flag someone down to get your tickets.  Some of the prizes are pretty good.  I have a D&amp;B zip up hoodie that I really like.

The food here is ok and a tad overpriced, but you don&#39;t really come here for the food.  They do have special deals with games if you eat here (pretty much half off the game prices).   However, since you are here, you might as well make the best of it.  The menu options are broad, including items like pretzel dog, sliders, wings, sweet apple pecan salad, burgers, etc.  

During my latest visit, I had the mac and cheese for $12.  It had chicken and bacon in it and was good, not $12 good, but good.  Banana Foster Pie $7 was ok.  My Berry Berry Berry Tea (has vodka) was pretty strong and served in a pint glass for $7.5.

Note:  The restaurant section can get a little drafty and cool.  The game section in the back and get pretty hot and sweaty.  Dress accordingly, layers are recommended.

Overall it was fine, we did bond, the execution was just weird though. Came in during the day and they turned some pool tables into dining tables. So that was weird considering they have so many other regular tables that they could have just pushed together. I mean it&#39;s probably just because they had the buffet set up there, but still, it was just awkward eating, especially if you were over a hole. The food from what I remember was alright. I liked the mac and cheese. Chicken was alright, and they had a tray of just bbq sauce which I wasn&#39;t sure was for the chicken or not. The deal we got didn&#39;t come with dessert. We didn&#39;t realize that afterward, and then ordered separate desserts, so it took like an extra 15-20 minutes to make all the different desserts.

Anyway, on to the tournament. There were 5 events and we were split into 3 teams and would compete against one another. It was the right concept, the execution just seemed off. They gave everyone a 10 dollar play card which should cover the tournament, but there were so many blips that happened that made everything so efficient. For example, the first game was car racing. So everyone had to swipe their card and change to the expert course all within 30 seconds. If 1 person screws it up, then we have to wait 3-5 minutes for the race to finish and they try again. That happened once or twice. And yea, it should be common sense, but some people are older or foreigners and what not, and I just feel there should be a more efficient way for that. Like they should be able to rig it to have a versus mode or something.

The ski ball machine broke while we were on it, so one team had to use a different ski ball machine that had a different game. The basketball shot was dumb because we used the middle 3 hoops and they had 3 balls a piece, and the last hoop had like 8 balls. Obviously it&#39;s not their fault that they were moved over but still. The trivia one made sense because they ref had a master card and just swiped enough credits onto all the spots so that we didn&#39;t have to worry about it. That made way more sense. Then for game 5 we went back to ski ball.

Anyway, after all that, then we had free play with whatever points was left on our cards. So the people who screwed up the car racing wasted some of their points obviously. The ref somehow calculated something, and the winner got all the tickets that we won throughout the contest. So yea, it was still fun and a great idea, the execution just could be a little better."

The games were okay- my favorite was the one with a bunch of blue circles that light up and you and your opponent try to hit as many lit up ones as possible. I watched 2 couples do it before us and based on the 3 games (those 2 couples and ours), it looks like girls are better at guys at this game for some reason- all 3 of us girls beat the guys by almost double the amount of points. It was interesting! The last part of the game is the best- your whole section lights up and you have like 3 seconds to hit them all. All of us girls pwned that part.

One of our people won jackpot, and the choice for prizes still wasn&#39;t great. Those ticket prices and prizes are insane. It cost 9.9 tickets to push a button. We spent $27 on tickets and came out with a shot glass, lol.

We sat at the bar top. Right out of the gate the bartender was unfriendly. Scratch that, plain rude. Prior to signing the tab, I told my co-worker that I was guaranteeing that the bartender would &#34;accidentally&#34; miscalculate the tip line, or make a &#34;clerical error.&#34; So, I rounded our bill to the dollar as I always do (gave her above 15%, just because that&#39;s the type of guy I am) and kept my fingers crossed that she would prove me right. Our bill was $32.00 with tip. What do you know... I checked my bank statement tonight and she added $.50. By mistake, of course. Perhaps she should be educated that whether it&#39;s $10 or 1 penny, modifying signed charges is a crime. I&#39;ll be calling management on Monday, as well as my bank. There is one thing that irks me more than anything else, and that&#39;s being fleeced. Wrong person, lady.

Came here for a birthday party last Saturday. When I first drove up on it, I thought it was an industrial warehouse. I had no idea D&amp;B&#39;s could get so big. The first half is the bar and restaurant section, while the back half is the arcade. 

Our waitress managed to get us our drinks and food in a prompt fashion, despite a huge crowd that night. We ordered a heap of unhealthy appetizers and entrees, including deep fried potato balls and fried chicken and waffles. 

The arcade was mostly redemption prize games like skee-ball and basketball, but there were a few gems in there, including Namco Bandai&#39;s Dark Escape, which absolutely scared the crap out of me and my buddy. I would come back just to play this one.

Not a bad night out at all."

It&#39;s hard to get a full value out of what you pay for card tokens since most of the machines (including the non-ticketing ones) have a pretty high token cost for each play. This place is good for a quick gameplay getaway but definitely not a good regular spot.

Food is very good, even if outside of this context. I&#39;m a huge fan of the cheesesteak sandwich and my kids ask to come here when they&#39;re in the mood for soup.
Overall, great concept and done well!"

They jacked their prices for prices remember when Xbox was 42k now it&#39;s like almost 80k. They got rid of gold status cards eliminated $10 free gameplay for your bday as now it&#39;s bogo $10. Also they switch games so often granted they keep most of the basic ones like basketball skeeball some racing ones etc but they keep adding these new &#34;hip&#34; games and I truly miss the old games. I remember coming back to solely play this boxing game. But it&#39;s gone. They don&#39;t have mini bowling like gameworks or enchanted castle. Both of the aforementioned places have better prizes in their store however it&#39;s harder to earn tickets in the other places. Weekends it&#39;s full of kids do recommend to go on weekday. Bathrooms were fairly clean. Food was as expected. Decent but wasn&#39;t blown away. Had nachos Philly cheesesteak and some quesadillas. Latter one was bland , but the other two were tasty. Service was average. Wouldn&#39;t honor my coupon on Wednesday because it&#39;s half price games already so star of that. Parking is ample. They have billiards shuffle board and private rooms, but it&#39;s not cheap. I don&#39;t know whether they have darts. Usually some some of deal of food or game special going on daily. Overall I&#39;ve disliked the changes that have taken place and new games are lame. Overall hope that they lower the prices on the prizes in the store. Do like that I can buy appetizers and desserts with my tickets. Will I be back?, I suppose just because of nostalgia from the old days and being dragged by friends  rather than me finding this place enticing."

Summer of 1983, water dripping from my bathing suit onto bare feet, warm concrete of the local pool pavilion, the smell of chlorine in the air, girls in bikinis, bucket-duty, frozen snicker bars, italian ices, baseball practice that night, and Q-Bert.  I used to rock that game.

That&#39;s what this place reminds me of.  Well, not exactly, but that general feeling of &#39;I don&#39;t care what else is going on right now because I am playing this game.&#34;

Yes, I know that games can be dated, and they aren&#39;t as good as the gaming console that my kids have at home, but I am NOT AT HOME with my kids.  I&#39;m hanging out, having a couple of drinks and playing some games with friends.  Plus, some of the old games are still fun!  I&#39;d like to see more racing games, with real-world feel.  And would it hurt to bring back Q-Bert?

Barkeeps are friendly, and usually very busy. The make some pretty interesting drinks here (7 oz Corona Margaritas), but keep the bar stocked if you want something decent neat.

Food here has generally been good, even though it does seem a bit pricey.  Got some fried chicken and shrimp last time, but have had the steaks and salads...all have been good.

Go on a Wednesday when it is half price day (for the games.)  Buy a couple of drinks, some food, and play some games with some buds.

I don&#39;t get the whole &#39;tickets&#39; thing though.  There is no way I&#39;d spend my time playing games to get tickets to change out for trinkets in the gift shop.  If I was going to gamble, I&#39;d go to the casino."

We had an overpriced drink at the bar, played a few games and left. This time, we stopped in for a surprise birthday party. The experience was a bit more memorable. 

The drinks are still overpriced. But this time we ate some food. This was a lot better than I expected. The wings were served hot and tasted pretty good and the pretzel dogs were nummy in my tummy. Seriously, I&#39;d stop in for a quick order of pretzel dogs and I&#39;m not usually much of a hot dog fan. These were quality eats. Everything else was fine, but not crazy good. 

The games are separated from the dining area. This was a plus as we could decide when we wanted to deal with the obnoxious teeny boppers. Plus, the place is closed to those under 21 after 9pm or 10pm. 

Our server was very nice and pretty attentive for our large party. I really had no complaints. 

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t rush back for the costly drinks, but I wouldn&#39;t decline a party invite if it happened to be here."

I enjoyed myself because of good company, and the games, but the dining experience left a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  

First, it&#39;s packed on Saturdays.  I get it.  If I show up at 5:45, I&#39;m going to have to wait.  I&#39;m told 30 minutes.  At the 1 hour mark, I finally decide to check where in the hell my party of 5 is on the list.  We were skipped by 15 parties. They skipped right over us and seated 15 parties ahead of us.  No apology either.  So they tell me that they will be seating us right away, and proceed to seat two more parties ahead of us.  Not a good start.

So we finally sit down, and I order a tall Sam Adams.  The beer comes back pale and flat.  I sent it back, and something slightly better came the second time.  Not sure what happened there.

Then, I ordered calamari for our group.  Two in the group had never had it before, and I&#39;m hyping it up for them to try.  The appetizer comes and it is about 6 pieces of calamari, about 20 pieces of peppers cut to LOOK like calamari, and a bunch of onion straws meant to look like the tentacles of calamari.  HUGE rip-off, and not tasty either.

I ordered the bleu burger and fries.  Fries come with a very long hair in them.  Bleu burger tastes awful.  I had to scrape the bleu cheese off to make the burger taste better.  My son ordered a medium rare NY strip that came done closer to medium well.  Rest of group ate about 1/2 their meals and were less than impressed also. I may come here for the games again, but I think I will eat elsewhere first."

Canadian friend stepped up to the bar ordered a mojito, girl who took the order asked for ID and my friend shows his Canadian license and they denied him service saying that unless he is a U.S. Citizen with US ID they can&#39;t serve him drinks. They said if you wanna go get your Canadian passport then fine we&#39;ll serve you. Obviously no one carries around their passport with them so he showed his credit card, Costco card, Bank of America card but nope they called the manager and denied us service. Me, being from Michigan asked what if I buy the drinks, manager said that&#39;s fine as long as you don&#39;t give it to your friends otherwise I&#39;ll have to kick you out for serving alcohol to &#34;minor&#34; when both my fiends are 26 and they both have valid ID. We played some games there and left, was planning to eat there but after all the bullshit we decided not to eat there. 

Oh btw just a note to D&amp;B service, we went to eat at Cheesecake Factory after and my apparently illegal Canadian friend according to you, ordered a alcohol drink, and guess what? As an intelligent establishment who knows what valid ID looks like, they were more than happy to serve us because they know nobody in their fuckin mind carries around a passport as a damn ID... Grow a brain!

Please put a sign stating that &#34;Canadians are not welcome at our establishment&#34; makes it easier for us to avoid you. Thanks

We arrived at 7:00 and were told it would be a 45 minute wait because we are a party of 8. After waiting almost an hour, we checked with the hostess, who was rude every time we went up there, to see how much longer the wait would be. We were told we were &#34;next on the list&#34; but the wait would be another 30 minutes. After another half an hour, we checked with the hostess once more. She became extra belligerent and told us that she couldn&#39;t give us a further estimate on the wait time and that she can&#39;t force other patrons to abandon their tables in order to provide our group with a seat.

It wasn&#39;t until we had waited an hour and a half and requested to speak with a manager that a space miraculously opened for our group. We then waited thirty minutes for the manager to show up. To be fair, the manager was very polite and offered us free game cards for afterwards, so that was the one saving grace of the evening.

Long story short, don&#39;t plan on eating here if you&#39;re a group of five or more. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any room for greater party sizes in their restaurant area (there were two or three other groups of seven and 10 that had also been waiting for longer than an hour). We understand there being a wait, but waiting twice as long as you&#39;re originally told is obscene. If they had been honest with us from the beginning, we could&#39;ve enjoyed a meal elsewhere and come back for games after.

When we were finally seated (at separate tables since we gave up on being able to sit all together), it took over 10 minutes for a waiter to show up at our tables. We asked him if we could order right away and he said fine, then took our drink orders and left. Other than that he was pleasant.

As far as the hostess station, there was a lack of customer service and it took a toll on what was supposed to be a fun night out.

For the record, we called ahead and were told we weren&#39;t allowed to make reservations. We were assured that, despite being a party of eight on a Saturday night, there would be no issue with finding space for us."

Well, that and drink of course. They have a nice bar up in the front you can sit at, or you could sit at a table and eat dinner. I think I ate there once, but it clearly wasn&#39;t very memorable. 

They also have more casual booth seating in the arcade section, so depending on your mood you can choose where you might like to have a drink. I&#39;ve even seen people wandering around with their drinks while playing games.

We had a bigger area reserved this time.  We had 3 pool tables that were initially covered and seats placed around it so that everyone had a nice seat to enjoy the buffet.  Then later after folks were done eating, the tables converted back to pool tables.

This time around I found service to be a lot more friendly and very helpful. Even the manager came by a few times to ask the host and the guest of honor and other guests how things were going and if there was anything else we needed. 

They had a taco bar for the party guests--it was pretty good.  Nice selection for guests from tortilla chips, flour tortillas, corn crispy tortillas, chicken, ground beef and steak, plus all the toppings including lettuce, tomato, shredded cheese, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. 

The great thing about hosting a party here is that if you want a game card, they offered a pretty sweet deal so you got a lot more games for your bux. 
Walking around the place on a Saturday night, I was really surprised to see how empty it was.  Not exactly empty, but far from crowded. Guess that left lots of room for gamers.  So far from crowded, but the bathroom was still a swamp."

I&#39;m always in the mood for a good sandwich for lunch but for $6.95, the price is higher than I would pay for cold cuts especially when you can get something similar for a $5 foot long sub. The difference is that Jersey Mike&#39;s loads on the meat and doesn&#39;t count the number of slices like Subway. At the same time, Subway has more variety of veggies to choose from."

The ppl working there seemed friendly and welcoming. I played safe and had the meatball sub. The meatballs were not fast food level. It was restaurant style and good quality. So I give them credit for that. The place overall is a bit overpriced I must say. Other then that it was pretty good for a sub place.

I typically come here after a long day of work, especially if I get busy and don&#39;t get a chance to sit down for a full meal.  I really enjoy the Jersey Shore&#39;s Favorite, Mike&#39;s Way of course.  Sometimes I am so hungry that I even order a giant-sized sub for myself.  The sandwiches are always fresh and delicious, and the service is always helpful with smiles.  Not only during the ordering process, but also during the meal, asking if everything is good, and if there is anything that I need.  

Keep up the great work, Jersey Mike&#39;s!  And thanks for never judging me for ordering a giant sub! :-)"

The quality is best and service is better. I have a hard time believing that you can walk out of any Jersey Mike&#39;s with a chip on your shoulder (unless you have a ruffles on the back pad and you are seriously high maintenance). But I can honestly say that the Schaumburg location takes guest service and satisfaction to the next level. These folks GET IT!!! They understand the need for quick and quality. Managers are active and pro-active while the service staff perform to perfection. Do you need to order a sandwich and scarf it in 5 minutes? Done. You need to take the slower process with kids, Family, or co-workers...and get 100% execution? Done. Schaumburg&#39;s answer for the perfect sub sandwich is at Jersey Mike&#39;s.

I love that American kids are working here. I&#39;m sorry if you think I&#39;m a jerk for saying it but there has been a real lack of summer jobs due to recent immigration trends and its good to see the high school kids learning about working here.

At most sub places getting it with everything or &#34;all the way&#34;  includes mayo and pickles and I always forget that at Jersey Mike&#39;s it doesn&#39;t.

My boss made us order subs for a birthday luncheon. I think mine had some kind of boloney and salami and white cheese on it. I&#39;m not sure because the only flavor I could identify was the overwhelming taste of red wine vinaigrette, which had completely soaked the sub roll into mush. (By the way, any deli/sub shop that puts vinaigrette on a sub is not a real sub shop and must be put out of business by all means necessary. Ham wants mustard and salami likes giardiniera and you don&#39;t put cheese on fish.) I hope this chain goes bankrupt and all the stores are turned into public playgrounds.

Actually the way the sandwich was built, prepared, looked and tasted like was right in line w. my expectations.  

Now i&#39;m only basing this on my one time experience and I&#39;m inclined to think i&#39;ll bump this a star or two after further visits but for the most part, I like.  
For now, let&#39;s keep some perspective, it&#39;s not a blow me away sam, it&#39;s above average and A-ok.

They have a Mini, Regular and Large choices on a sub roll as well as wraps and salads.  The mini is probably 6 inches (that&#39;s what *she* said, i&#39;m looking at you MattyL) and I chose the JM Club Sub w chips and drink,  $7+...it came w. turkey, ham, bacon, provolone cheese, and of course &#34;Mike&#39;s Way™&#34;...which is Onions, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Vinegar, Oil and Spices, I chose add on&#39;s of Japs, Banana Peppers, a sort of cherry pepper relish and pickle.  

The meat they use is all carved to order, right at the counter, so you&#39;re getting some of the freshest meat you&#39;ll find in any sub shop or deli counter.  That&#39;s the draw and it&#39;s a draw that will continue to keep this place successful and growing i&#39;m sure."

Starting with the house salad, either the cucumbers were frozen or kept in water to preserve them.... Not a good approach. 

Fried Zucchini where huge, and the b&amp;b plates that we had to eat them off of were not large enough. 

Entrees: pasta with a side of shrimp, daughter ate that and seemed happy. My ball sandwich, rather flavorless and not nearly enough gravy to improve the taste, even when I asked for more. Half slab of ribs, waiter asked if we wanted them cooked medium? Came out way over cooked, nasty tough.

I have been here numerous times and was surprised that I had not left a review prior. I really wanted to give this place a 3.5 stars but since there was not an option a 3 was too little so I opted for 4. 

The Monday 1/2 off special is always a win for me. I can in thinking it was BOGO but that is on Tuesday. Get it, Two for Tuesday? The place was not overly busy but they still felt the need to clump everyone together in the lower left/south of the dining room. Not worries. More the merrier right. I understand they did this to help out the lone waitress but a little elbow room is always appreciated. The service was ok. I felt really bad for the waitress. She literally was running around the whole time. She would take an order/question then leave and come back. Repeatedly. A little bit more training and a little less rushing and she would had been better off. 
Service 3/5 stars. 

Pizza: We got two pizza. A white pizza Carbonzala ( I think ) that comes in a Nova 10&#39;&#39; size. We asked if we could get the pizza in a 14&#34; and were told no. I said can we just add the toppings to a thin crust. The answer was again no. Not sure why. Made no sense. Just give us the toppings that we ask for. To her credit, she was busy and I think new, so poor management issue on this one. The red pizza was pan and tho we didn&#39;t ask for thin I wish she would had asked. Red pizza was onions, mushrooms, green peppers, and pepperoni. It was good. The White pizza was a bit too garlicky and gave a few of us indigestion. Not terrible but no one likes to be burping. 

Overall the pizza was good. For 1/2 off or BOGO its a good deal. I would not pay full price for there pizza. Service in the past has been better so I will give them a pass on the service last night."

We went in for dine in and everything started out great...  we had a friendly greeting, seated quickly, and informed it was 2 for Tuesday (b1g1 on pizza).  We opted to order a small thin and small pan pizza, and then things started turning for the worse.  Service was VERY SLOW, and I&#39;m not talking about the wait for the pizza.  Slow on refills, slow on check, and slow on coming back with the bill after running it through the credit machine.  I did alot of people watching and this seemed to be universal all around.  What was more frustrating was there were 2 or 3 tables that came and ordered after us, and were done and paid for about 30 minutes before us.  The pizza was okay, nothing that I would really crave or seek out again.  Its possible I would order here again, but I would order it for take out due to the poor service.  I would only get the pizza if it was on special like the Buy 1 Get 1 on Tuesday, definitely would NOT be worth it at full price.

If you order take out food, the phone staff (which this places uses &#34;phone girls&#34; as their title - yikes) struggles to place your order, capture your name, and then give you the correct order upon arrival. Wait staff for dine in needs training. We had a group arrive one evening for drinks and they rolled their eyes and informed us the kitchen closed in an hour and 20 minutes. Because a group coming in well before you close for a glass of wine is going to kill your kitchen?

2. Food quality is meh. Better pizza at several local options. It is bland. Pizza nova options are better, if you can get the correct order placed.

3. Bar - wine and beer options okay, not very interesting. Service struggles with orders.

Overall, I would not highly recommend but if you are compelled to try it, order a pizza nova."

I&#39;ve done pickup each time I&#39;ve eaten there.  It seems like many of the bad reviews are service related, but it&#39;s a casual restaurant, I&#39;m not sure what people are expecting.  In terms of food, I&#39;ve had thin crust pizza and tried the Novas as well.  Both are great.  I&#39;m comparing it to the other two pizza places I&#39;ve tried: Garibaldi&#39;s &amp; Wayne&#39;s. Garibaldis is too saucy and doughy for my taste (and no thin crust option!).  Wayne&#39;s is good, but Armand&#39;s definitely stood out as the best to me.  If you don&#39;t like too much dough or sauce, this place might be for you."

I&#39;ve been there twice. The first time I had the mostaccioli arrabiata. It doesn&#39;t seem that spicy at first because it creeps. Don&#39;t be fooled!  I ate much more of the incredibly generous portion than I&#39;d expected because it was tasty without being being heavy, if that makes sense. The second time I had baked mostaccioli. Generous with the cheese. It could have been drained better, though. Of the two, I prefer the arrabiata.

We moved to Arl. Hts. and were thrilled to hear that Armands was opening a restaurant there. We have been frequent visitors and big fans of the thin crust pizza with sausage and green peppers. We have hosted parties there in the party room and have always been satisfied with the food and service. 

One recent snafu: I stopped there on a Wednesday night about a month ago. I volunteer on Wednesdays and often stop at Armands afterwards to get a pizza to bring home. This time, I stopped in at the usual time, 9:10 p.m. and was told I could not order a pizza since they had turned off the ovens. I know they are open until 10:00 p.m. so I was surprised and disappointed. I was going to sit at the bar for a few minutes and have a drink, when I was told that, no, they were closing. I asked why and was told that they had had a slow evening and decided to close. That just seemed weird to me - you just expect a restaurant to honor their posted hours. 

While I was disappointed, it certainly won&#39;t keep us from going back to Armands to enjoy their delicious pizza. If you go, try the Armands salad; it&#39;s great. And Mondays, pizza is half price, a real bargain. Outdoor seating is available too."

My first visit to Armand&#39;s was take out pizza.  My wife and I ordered the deep dish.  All ingredients were fresh, and even though she is not a deep dish fan, it was a huge success.  Overall, excellent pizza.

The second visit was with my wife and her friend.  We got the Armand&#39;s Salad to start with.  It was excellent.  Again fresh.  The pizza was thin crust this time, although it didn&#39;t matter.  It was again delicious with fresh ingredients and a superb crust that was crunchy and doughy at the same time.

The third visit was by myself.  I sat at the bar and ate and watched the game.  As always the food was really good (I ordered the lasagna).  But, the service was slow.  In a fifty minute time period, the lady checked on me twice, and the first time was to take my order.  The manager that is usually there wasn&#39;t working, and he&#39;s generally the guy at the bar.  It&#39;s not really a bar kind of restaurant though, so I guess it can be forgiven.  (You know, where you hang out at the bar and drink some beer or wine and watch the game.)

Fourth visit was delivery.  The food was again spot-on.  We ordered the ceasar salad and the pizza margherita.  Both were excellent.  Not too much dressing as to overpower the salad, and not too much garlic on the pizza to overpower the basil.

Last visit was a pick-up order.  We went the beef sandwich route this time.  All I can say is surprisingly excellent.  

Although the food here is top notch and a solid five stars, the service is a bit lacking.  (Even the delivery guy was kind of off putting.)  But, this place is a must-go-to if you&#39;re in downtown Arlington Heights and craving pizza.  If there was a half star, it would receive four and a half stars."

It was late in the evening around 8:30pm. Our server Justin was good, Professional and attentive. The restaurant is well decorated and has a fresh modern feel to it.
The food is nothing exciting but edible. We sat right in front of the kitchen and that was a big mistake. Being a foodie, I like that this place has an open kitchen but the noise and loudness of the cooks really disturbed me.  My friends and I could not have a conversation. They we laughing out loud, yelling at each other and cursing in Spanish, which we all understood being  Latinos ourselves. I called Justin over and explained that their behavior was disruptive. He graciously apologized and said he would speak to them. They seemed to get louder and started looking at us and laughing. We felt really uncomfortable. So we asked for the check and left, 
A few days later, I called the restaurant and asked to speak to the manager. I think his name is Mike. I wanted to express our disappointment and talk to him about our first time experience. He became defensive, never apologized and asked me to give him tips on how he should handle his employees. What kind of a leader is this?
No wonder his cooks behave the way they do! He clearly has no control and does not hold his employees accountable. After speaking with him I felt worse about my experience. He simply couldn&#39;t care less about my concerns.
I will NEVER go to this place again. I won&#39;t tell you to do the same. Your experience may be different. But a restaurant that doesn&#39;t respect or value me as a customer will never get any of my hard earned money! Too bad ARMAND&#39;s!!!"

It doesn&#39;t take much to make me a happy camper when it comes to service. Although a hot server never hurts.
I do not place the entire blame on our server as she was handicapped with not having a busboy to help her out. Even so, she was quite amusing.

We had a group of 10 and called ahead. We ordered salad and while it looked delicious there were no plates to put it on.  When we asked for plates, she handed my friend a stack of seven to distribute and walked away.

Wait, wait, we also need more plates and utensils! No worry, she&#39;ll be back, right? 10 minutes later...

When we got our utensils, she handed my friend a fistful of knives and the stack of plates and walked away, leaving it for us to pass them down the line. Finished with our salad, the table was a mess.

Thankfully, my friend stopped and cautioned her to not serve our main meal until the table was cleared.

Whew! Disaster averted...

She kept apologizing to us but the comedy continued. I felt sorry for her.

It seemed like forever until we got our food. But finally, it arrived. Time to dig in... we were starving.

She again apologized about the delay. She calmly assured us that she was caught up with her tables and no worries and then walked away.

Wait, wait... we still have no plates, glasses, utensils and the pitchers of Diet Coke needs a refill.

Again, she apologized and handed my friend a stack of plates and a fistful of napkins and utensils and then walked away. 

Little help, little help... can&#39;t you do this??

Oh, well...

My family&#39;s Thanksgiving dinner last year went smoother.

But we wanted a place close to the Metropolis and the girls voted for Italian so we went to Armand&#39;s.  

For 6:00 pm on a Saturday, I was surprised it wasn&#39;t as busy as I was expecting.  We had made a reservation for 5 people earlier in the day and were seated without any problem.  The restaurant A/C system is quite noisy so we had to speak rather loudly to be heard across the table. If it hadn&#39;t been rainy just before we got to the restaurant, we would have asked to sit outside.  (Note:  Silverware was already on the table so they may have solved the problem noted by other reviewers)

We ordered the bruschetta, which was a bit heavy on the garlic for 3 of us, but the other 2 who love garlic said it was delish.  Also ordered the pizza bread as a second appetizer and it was nice and cheesy and pretty substantial.  Two ordered red wine (Malbec &amp; Cab) and we were both satisfied with our choices.  A pinot grigio met with the white wine drinkers approval as well.

The &#34;house&#34; salads, as noted previously, are iceberg lettuce with cucumbers, tomatoes, onion rings.  Not special and doused with a bit too much dressing (Italian oil and vinegar, with a bit too much vinegar). But the Caeser salad is made with Romaine, good crunchy croutons and great dressing.  (My sister and I ordered one to split and they gave us enough for 3 people!)

We also split a pizza: the &#34;Signature&#34; which is thin crust with olive oil, Fontina cheese, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts and no red sauce.  It was definitely enough for 2 people (we had leftovers) and really yummy!  A friend ordered the calamari and pasta, which had lots of tender rings and squid-dy parts in a tasty tomato sauce and another friend had the caprese salad as her entree (she also had leftovers).

For the five of us, the total bill was just over a hundred bucks, which I find very reasonable for a sit down dinner with appetizers, salads, wine and entrees.  Hope this helps other people make a decision about whether or not to eat at Armand&#39;s.  I know I plan to return for more of that terrific pizza."

I ordered the chicken limone, which was grilled, came with a nice lemon sauce and tons of veggies. My husband ordered one of the pizza nova&#39;s- it was awesome. Tons of toppings, good crisp crust. We both got soups, the minestrone was amazing.  They serve great fresh bread and foccia.

The only iced tea they have is black tea, no flavors.   They finally sent out plain bread, and the dust parmesan instead of the real shredded kind.  You can get it at Jewel in bags.  (other places that send out couple pieces of broiled soaked in butter, garlic bread with thick shred parmesan on top can get me to order anything from wine to dessert)    Here I wanted to leave before ordering.   
 
An artichoke  was on the front and we love those, but it  was so nuked overcooked it was completely flattened out and mushy, there was no meaty part on the ends to eat and no heart left at the end.  It was a pile of mushy breadcrumbs.  Later a table next to us hated theirs too,  for same reason.  

My husband&#39;s spaghetti sauce was so so spicy hot with pepper neither of us could eat it.   No flavor balance, just pepper and high acidic taste. 

I  had  Armand &#34;flavored&#34; chicken with artichoke hearts and lemon, capers.   I make this at home  without tomatoes.  First I asked about word  flavored and she came back saying it has peppers on it.  I said I can&#39;t have peppers of any kind  I get really sick .   Then we determined owner said black pepper which is fine.  It came in a bowl looking like stew with tomatos covering all.  A great veggy mix was on one side (frozen but good combo) but it was full of RED PEPPERS after all that.  OK I dug them out, but am now sick because I can&#39;t come near them.    

Chicken had outside shiny hard texture of freezer burn that was difficult to cut with a knife.  There was no garlic or buttery taste because all they did was dump a small bottle of lemon juice into the bowl so it was way way too sour.  There was one small canned artichoke floating in it, not sautéed or anything.   There were a lot of capers but were the huge kind with stems instead of small to enhance flavor.  I felt there were no herbs or anything to give it taste.   

They don&#39;t seem to know or care anything about balance of flavors or what goes together or pinch of sugar to meld the flavors or even taking the time to make real multi ingredient recipes.  Even the salad was only iceberg and tomato.   They could have added herbs and shredded parmesan at least.    

I assume this place simply gets the theater crowd a block away, not regulars."

Treat it as a pizza joint and not a full restaurant and you&#39;ll be very happy. We&#39;ve had the signature pizza which is really good and unique, but beware that it is a bit on the dry side due to it having and olive oil sauce. All of their ingredients are always fresh and their tomato pizza sauce tastes very fresh and delicious. The appetizers are nothing to rave about but we do like the caprice salad. We come only for the pizza and have left happy every time."
armands-pizzeria-arlington-heights,Solitaire L.,WAB93WBYM773toOfTJx-5w,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,1,0,5,14,7OE0Cibjw59GbJfUCBjL_Q,1.0,2011-12-30,"This was my first time there...and my last. Generally, I give a brand new place a second try if the first was rough. This place is more established and they still don&#39;t get it right from slow service to fishy-tasting fried zucchini. Yuck. I&#39;ll go course by course:

Appetizers (we ordered fried calamari, fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks--wow--a that&#39;s a lot, I suppose): To be fair, the fried calamari was pretty good (7 out of 10). The zucchini, as I mentioned, tasted fishy (maybe fried in the same oil as the fish for their Friday nigh fish fry--oh wait, they don&#39;t have a Friday night fish fry...hmmm). Mozzarella sticks seemed to be okay as well, I didn&#39;t try one but they looked good. I also thought it was a little tacky to serve the zucchini with a little cup of catsup for &#34;dipping sauce&#34;--a little more creativity would have been desirable!

Salad: We only had the regular dinner salad, but I noticed that they only use iceberg lettuce, which I thought lacked nice presentation and just seemed...well...cheap! 

Dinner: I had the eggplant parmagiana which, while certainly not the best I&#39;ve ever had (the best was at Regina&#39;s, which no longer exists!), it was decent. My son had marinara clam sauce over pasta, which he also said was good. My daughter had the caprese sandwich which she said was really good. My ex had a shrimp marinara sauce over pasta, which was, in a word, terrible. The shrimp did not seem fresh--tasted smokey/salty/fishy. My other daughter had cheese ravioli which she described as tasting like &#34;nothing.&#34; Also, she said that there was water at the bottom of the plate, as if the pasta had not been fully drained.

Dessert: We ordered a tartuffo with raspberry ice cream for dessert. DINERS BEWARE! This was horrible. They showed a dessert tray with four types of delicious looking cheesecake, but only had one to offer (so take the other three off the tray!). 

Service: Our waitress HAD to be new. She was nice, but inattentive to empty plates, glasses and other service/upsell opportunities. We had a bottle of wine and once empty, she didn&#39;t offer another. We spilled (OK I spilled) some wine on the table and she didn&#39;t offer to help clean it up--just left the wine soaked placemat on the table for the rest of the meal. The servers/busboys were equally inattentive and unhelpful, though not unpleasant. Do you get what I mean? They have the POTENTIAL to give good (even great) service, but they just don&#39;t. I asked if they had fresh parmesan to which the waitress replied yes, so I expected her to bring a hunk of cheese with a grater, but instead she brought the dry, &#34;powdery&#34; type. 

Cost: Exorbitant for the quality (or lack thereof) of food and service. For five people the bill was nearly $170. I felt totally ripped off and, while I love a bargain, I am not averse to paying for great food with great service. If we&#39;d had that, I would have felt better about the whole thing.

One last caution - Wine - I have never ordered a bottle of wine at a restaurant and not had the waitstaff uncork it at the table. Our waitress brought the wine bottle to the table already uncorked, which I think is totally improper. And yes, I could have insisted that she take it back and bring another, sealed bottle, but I didn&#39;t, so I guess you could say this is my fault. We hypothesized that she didn&#39;t know how to use a corkscrew (as I mentioned, she seemed new/inexperienced) and let it pass. 

So all in all, a loser of a dinner, both in food and service quality. Definitely would not recommend!"

Between the owners standing around with scowls on their faces, the poor service and the bad food there isn&#39;t a whole lot good to say.  
* No Italian bread.  They serve you buns at the table with butter.  Not Italian bread with olive oil and parmesan cheese.
* Burned meat balls.  How do you burn meatballs?  And if you did would you serve them to a customer?
* Angry owners.  The owners of the restaurant stand around in disheveled clothes and look pissed off.  They didn&#39;t greet anybody or come to the table as and say hello.  It just made me feel uncomfortable like an unwanted house guest.
* The Italian Denny&#39;s.  The food and atmosphere of the place made me think of Denny&#39;s.  Cheap tasteless food server by unfriendly people in an uncomfortable restaurant

This is where Pronto Roma used to be. I was a regular at PR which somehow managed to be hip and trendy despite being in the burbs. Armand&#39;s destroyed the ambience turning it into one more huge-portion-suburban eatery for people who can&#39;t tell a lasagna from a tortelinni. 

I wanted to carboload for a long run the next day and ordered Spaghetti with Alfredo Sauce. WHO THESE DAYS CUTS THE PASTA BEFORE COOKING IT? The spaghetti came in several sizes, not in strings making it hard to eat. The sauce looked like cheese cement.

My husband&#39;s pizza (Let&#39;s face it -  You gotta try really hard if you want to screw up a 4-cheese pizza) was horrendous. Someone told the pizzaman that for the pizza to be &#34;autenthic italian&#34; it needs to contain 2 lb of garlic. I couldn&#39;t sleep at night with my own breath.

Don&#39;t go there if you want to eat good pizza or pasta. For Pasta, go to Carlos, a great place right behind Armands. For pizza, go to CPK which is not the greatest but certainly better than this."

Finally seated, the waiter takes our order, comes back to clarify our order...twice...is he new? Food arrives, tasty, nothing spectacular, but how badly can manicotti or garlic shrimp be? Dessert, white chocolate tartufo. Waiter explains that it is white chocolate gelatin covered in dark chocolate shell, sounds nice.

I love the modern decor, extremely clean and very inviting.  They paid attention to little details like water carafe on the table, sauces readily available on the table and the wait staff was nice, courteous and helpful.  I&#39;m not sure why people are complaining about the food cart, which is not at all loud and is pretty typical for Asian restaurants to use.  After reading some of the reviews, I was preparing myself for a loud noise and I barely noticed.

The food was really good.  We started with chicken wings which was very tasty, had the right amount of crispiness, perfect touch of salt and good sauce to accompany the wings.  I wanted another order immediately but had to save my appetite for the entree.  I also ordered Vietnamese coffee - usually served already made.  This place goes the extra mile with again, attention to detail.  They gave me one cup with full of ice and another cup where the coffee was dripping down inside the cup so it&#39;s freshly brewed coffee.  On the second cup, there was cream on the bottom.  Once the coffee finishes dripping to the bottom of the cup, you have to swirl around the coffee with the cream to mix it together and then transfer the mixed item to the other cup with the ice.  It was delish!  I love Vietnamese coffee and this did not disappoint.

Onward with the entree, we both had vietnamese noodle soup.  It is very flavorful and taste amazing, but it didn&#39;t seem like a traditional pho that we eat at the Vietnamese restaurant.  Regardless, we really enjoyed the noodle soup and would definitely be back to try other items as well.  I thought the price was very reasonable.  Please give them a try.  It&#39;s hard to find a good Vietnamese restaurant in this area so I&#39;m ecstatic that we have a good one!"

I&#39;d say this is the perfect place to warm up your soul, especially on a cold, windy, or rainy day. Love the interior designs as reviewers have mentioned. Honestly, this place really surprised me. We ordered the springs rolls for appetizers, and for our main dish ordered the sliced beef pho and pho combination. YUM! Feeling hungry? Order that extra noodles for a buck, and essentially you got another new pho bowl. Like what the PHO? You&#39;ll definitely be happy with your food.

As for the food, you will not be happy if you walk in with an expectation that you will get authentic Vietnamese food. For example, they do not serve tripe and meatball for the pho. So if you&#39;re a fan of those things, you&#39;re out of luck. I normally get only the rare meat, brisket, and tendons anyway so I was fine with the choices. I liked the broth, it is less greasy and still has good flavor. 

The spring rolls, although similar, wasn&#39;t what I normally see at other Vietnamese restaurants. There&#39;s more vegetable, which I liked. I did not like the sauce very much though, there was too much peanut butter. I mixed the sauce with sriracha and hoisin.

This place is nicely decorated and the service is fast and friendly. I understand this is a new business so I will be more lenient with my review as they are probably still working out the kinks. 

What we ate:
1. Spring Rolls - Taste and dipping sauces were good. They did have less meat in them than other places.
2. Shrimp &amp; Avocado Rolls - First time trying these, but they were delicious!
3. Bulgogi Bahn Mi - Really disappointed here, the baguette was soft and had no crunch. I honestly did not even finish half and the pate tasted weird.

If you are looking for Vietnamese food that has been modified for the American palette, you might enjoy this place. I cant take a Vietnamese restaurant seriously if they do not offer the standard bahn mi sandwiches: grilled pork, or one using specific deli meats. 

If you are looking for authentic and vibrant flavors to fill your tongue, you should go elsewhere. I&#39;m not sure if AH is ready for real authentic Vietnamese food... but this will be a good introduction for others."

The not good:  Very excited to try the Pho.  There are no good Pho places in the burbs.  We ordered the Seafood &amp; Beef.  Pho came out hot!  All the trimmings beautiful, plentiful and fresh!  I tasted the broth...stop...like a Korean soap opera...stop...come in for a close-up shot to my eyes...I tried to smile but the tears welled up and slowly rolled down my cheeks, diving into the broth below...no expression--just tears.

You wince.  You cry inside.  They carry the country&#39;s hope on their tiny, tired shoulders.  Why?!?  Your lip quivers.  

Please Pho An, please.  Have the decency to arrange for a Vietnamese chef to taste your broth.  The broth is anything but Pho broth.  Why can&#39;t I give it 2 stars, huh?  Because the Pho broth must be respected.  Period.  The end.

My niece and I were heading to the yummy Mexican place around the corner and instead we decided to give this place a try. We both have eaten authentic Vietnamese all our lives. Argyle isn&#39;t just a place to visit, it&#39;s where we go for real food when we don&#39;t want to cook ourselves. We figured if this place makes the cut, there&#39;s going to be $ saved on gas and we gain back 2 hours from the drive. 

We ordered spring rolls and the combination pho. The pho was served almost immediately brought to our table on a wheeled cart (? What&#39;s with the cart?) with the accompaniments. At first sniff of the broth it just didn&#39;t smell right. It sorta smelled like someone&#39;s laundry water with a hint of beef. Not the usual rich beef smell with cinnamon, star anise, and other spices that linger with regular pho from Vietnamese restaurants. 

Well - here goes - I wanted to try it without the accompaniments to get a real fresh taste. Chopsticks in, stir, and look. 

*Noodles - a decent serving
*Rare beef - missing. There was NO red, pink, or even near that color beef found. 
*Beef Slices - 3 small pieces, overcooked and chewy. Tasted weird. Not beefy taste, just a not good taste. 
*Tendon - the yummy melt in your mouth goodness - one teeny tiny piece! Maybe it all melted? If you don&#39;t know what tendon looks like, you would have missed the piece. 
*Beef brisket - there were a small amount of  shreds of gray stuff so I&#39;m going to think that&#39;s it. It filled my spoon &amp; that&#39;s it. 
*Broth - NASTY smelling and OMG!!! Salty salty SALTY! My niece pointed out my bright red ears and cheeks after 3 spoonfuls of the broth. 

That&#39;s all I could take. I called the waiter who was very nice. He was apologetic, offered to add hot water to it to dilute the saltiness, and when I declined he took it away. Came back and said they had a busy lunch service and the broth was probably concentrated from being low. Ummm... This was at 6:00. How did they not pay attention to their broth since lunch at 12-1? Isn&#39;t that the big part of their restaurant? 

Our meal was &#34;comp&#34;  because my niece didn&#39;t want to have a sodium overdose either and didn&#39;t eat hers. 

OH! We never got our spring rolls so I can&#39;t review that. We left and went back to our original plan - table side prepared guacamole.  

Summary: 
If you like salty, fake, funky smelling Vietnamese food - enjoy this place. It has exactly what you want then. 

Why 2 stars and not one? Because the waiter was nice &amp; apologetic. 

I&#39;m still in search of good pho in this area."

That was not the case for me.  It was pretty empty during the lunch hour other than the two Asian ladies chatting in the corner of the restaurant.  Me and my sister each ordered spring roles and pho which took approximately 15 minutes to be served.  When the food arrived, I tasted broth first to find that it tasted incredibly salty.  Usually pho broth is supposed to taste mildly strong and refreshing, this restaurant served me salted water in a bowl.  My sister got a stomach ache and couldn&#39;t even finish the food while I was wondering how the hell this restaurant got rated so high on yelp. 

What I ordered:
Big Pho - 0
Spring roles - 2

The side vegetables were fresh and the noodles and broth joined together to deliver a rich, tasty flavor. Not watered down and not salty, but seasoned just right. The noodles were perfectly cooked and plentiful. HUGE bowl at the price point compared to others and a great value.

The spring roll, better known as a Vietnamese fresh roll or summer roll on other menus, was well balanced with shrimp, rice noodles and thickly sliced bell peppers that added a unique flavor for these standard rolls.  The rice paper was the right thickness with no excessive over wrap.  It is served with a homemade sesame and peanut sauce that I enjoyed precisely because it didn&#39;t have a strong peanut butter taste.  

Everything about the pho seemed right to me.  I&#39;m not a pho expert but the sliced beef comes in the steaming bowl not fully cooked, which is correct.  There weren&#39;t as many fresh herbs as traditionally served but this is normal to keep costs down.  The broth smelled wonderfully of cloves and star anise.  I&#39;m not sure if the broth was as clear as is normally desired by pho experts but I had no complaints and enjoyed the meal.  

Note: I give 4 Yelp stars because this place is worthy to eat at and I know anything except 4 or 5 stars often dissuades customers.  But my own internal rating would give it 3 stars for the food, which means I would eat here over anything that has fewer stars if given the choice.

Got the sliced beef pho and my husband got a bowl of the big bowl pho. The broth was decent and the sliced beef was tender. A great alternative for pho that&#39;s close by if you don&#39;t want to drive far.

Restaurant is Korean owned so many Korean dishes that we will try next time. It&#39;s spacious on the inside and kid friendly. Also love that they leave extra water on the table so you can just pour yourself more. Overall great experience and we will be back!"

Everything else was perfect.  Prices are beyond reasonable so you can really afford to try a  few things on the menu.  We had the edamame and chicken wings to start.  Both of which were great.  I had the bibimbop as an entree which was a super fresh and tasty beef dish.  For desert, we tried one of each @ $3 per.   Both were fantastic, esp the green tea ice cream.  

Get to Pho An Heights!"
pho-an-heights-arlington-heights,Restaurant Vigilant E.,wqWJzo62RE8DmSYqFKmutg,"Inverness, IL",0,1,0,3,27,M9Y1m9vDU9Tbo_-NiaAQlw,4.0,2016-07-06,"Pho An opened in downtown AH a few months back, replacing some Tapas restaurant. The location is good - on Dutton which is essentially smack in the middle of downtown. We went on a Tuesday night as soon as it opened and were the only people there. I got the sense that the place is family run - the service was very friendly and you could tell they wanted to do a good job. I will tell you for two non-alcoholic drinks and appetizer and two entrees it was $25 which I thought was very reasonable.

The interior is pretty minimalist - the waiter brought your standard glasses of whatever, but with a very nice flip top lid bottle full of chilled water - I thought this was a nice touch. 

I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee which came with the glass topping dripper and sweetened condensed milk that you stirred and poured over ice. Very authentic, and it wasn&#39;t loaded with Tasters Choice either...no doubt it was the Vietnamese coffee itself, which I have ordered online before. I was very impressed.

The menu is pretty small. They have half a dozen Pho bowls, half a dozen appetizers, two Banh mi types and a few other odds and ends. We started with the scallion pancake....it was pretty standard - rice flour and scallion fried up and served with sauce. It was adequate for what it was and at $4.00 I wasn&#39;t complaining.

I ordered Vietnamese fried noodles with pork, carrot and mung beans...it was excellent and the portion was quite generous - again, at $9 or $10 bucks, I was happy with the size and such. My friend ordered Korean Seafood Ramen which was about the same price and had squid, shrimp and mussels. It was served in a giant bowl and the steam coming off of it clearly indicated the broth was near boiling.

On the table, you had your standard bottle of siriachi, but also a jar of clearly homemade red chili puree which was excellent.

The prices couldn&#39;t be beat and the food was excellent. Service was likewise good and the interior was spotless and on trend...it was a bit devoid of life (no music, just big empty grey room which reminded me of a chipotle for some reason - only nicer of course).

Downside? Well, I feel like they are nit-picky things and really weren&#39;t important. The place is primarily Vietnamese, but they throw Korean elements into some of their stuff - like the banh mi and such....I don&#39;t know, maybe that works...Vietnam and Korea are like 4,000 miles from each other though - you wouldn&#39;t have a Swedish/Italian fusion restaurant would you? But I will say, the food was excellent, so I am just being a pain here I guess. Rather than delivering food on a tray or by hand, the servers used a giant cart with wheels off of a Roman Chariot (perhaps I exaggerate)...but the donkey cart made a TON of noise when it was hauling its cargo...and when it came out with just the single scallion pancake in a thunderous cacophony, it seemed a bit ridiculous....now, it soon became clear to me though - the cart makes perfect sense when bringing out giant bowls of Pho or Ramen that has been heated inside of a lava tube....it wasn&#39;t annoying at all, just a little odd...

This is a great casual restaurant, the price is right, the food is excellent, the service is good....I&#39;m sold. Not sure as I would go there for a first date or something (as it is quite casual), but it checked off pretty much all the boxes.

I will be back!!!"

I had the brisket pho and it was delicious with all fresh ingredients. The slices of jalapeño were extremely hot, so be careful! A few more pieces of brisket would be nice but you can ask for more for an extra $2 if you wish. Others in my group had the spicy pork sandwich and the seafood with ramen. They were very pleased with their entrees as well. The waiter was a young man, very polite and efficient. He would even bow slightly when providing service which made me feel like I was back in Asia. All the staff were smiling and helpful and the food was exceptional. What more could you want? This restaurant will be a huge success. Give them a try and see for yourself."

I felt like I was in a k-drama while there.  The coffee house music, the beverage station - it was all very cute and appeared very clean.  The service was very friendly, although a little slow getting the check which was not a big deal.  The Korean food (galbi?) we had was very good, the Vietnamese coffee was excellent and I appreciate that they used the traditional strainer and allowed me to mix everything.  The spring rolls were decent, although appeared to be more of a hybrid than a traditional Vietnamese spring roll and peanut sauce.  The chicken wings were decent.  That brings me to the pho... Sigh. I am still lamenting the demise of my beloved Viet House and searching for a replacement and while I will definitely come here again for coffee, atmosphere and Korean food, the pho just didn&#39;t do much for me.  The broth was very anisey, and didn&#39;t have much depth.  The rice noodles were slightly overcooked and the meat (I had pho tai) was not very generous.  That said, it was a decent sized bowl and they brought a beautiful garnish plate out to accompany it.  Were I dying for a bowl of pho and happened to be nearby, I would probably order again, but in terms of finding the place I need for my weekly pho fix, this just wasn&#39;t it.  Will definitely try again, but probably not for pho."

The 2 stars however, is for service based on 2 visits over the last month. During my first visit we were barely waited on once the food arrived and at no point did the server feel the need to check on our empty drinks. I tried to flag her down but she was standing by another server chatting. Keep in mind there was maybe 1 other patron in the place so it shouldn&#39;t have been that difficult to check on us. After I literally shouted, &#34;excuse me&#34;, I got a dirty look and she finally came over. My second visit was last night, a Sunday. We walked in at 7:51pm. They close at 8:30pm so one would think 39 minutes prior to closing is still sufficient time to eat but the server was adamant that they were closing in &#34;30 minutes&#34; and basically tried to get us to leave. My friend being the nice one that she is, told her we were just going to get a few appetizers and said, &#34;is that ok?&#34;  The server replied, &#34;if you think you can eat in 30 minutes&#34;. Seriously??? You don&#39;t try to dissuade customers from dining because you&#39;re worried about closing time. We still decided to eat there but I just can&#39;t get over the rude service. Unless they make some changes and work on actually being kind to customers I won&#39;t be back."

My go to is always the salmon nigiri and crunch roll. The salmon is so fresh  and the slices are really generous. The crunch roll is my absolute favorite roll on the menu. 

The AYCE is great. The chefs don&#39;t overload with the rice and the food comes out pretty quickly. The staff are all friendly and attentive. I&#39;ve never had an issue with service.

+ All you can eat sushi (Make sure you finish everything you ordered or you&#39;ll be charged for sushi you did not consume)

+ Well-sized fish in sushi. We did NOT order the &#34;all you can eat&#34;. My husband noted that there was a good amount of fish-to-rice ratio. (I understand there are complaints about too much rice in the sushi. Maybe if you order AYCE, they overload it with rice but if you order sushi &#34;a la carte&#34;, they give you bigger fish portions and not overload your sushi with rice? Just a theory.)

+ One waitress was friendly enough. She provided our toddler with a crayon and paper. No demands to tip them either. (Again, maybe because we did not order AYCE.)

+ Free parking lot

THE BAD:
- Place was a bit dirty. Noticed that the windows had hand prints all over like it was not washed in a long time. Window sills and entrance area were very dusty, too.

-Dirty bathroom. No, changing tables for customers with kids.

VERDICT:
Service and food were ok but not raring to come back."

I always try to order on one sheet for the whole table to see if they will bring out the boat. It&#39;s always good for pictures.

If they are busy I highly recommend ordering an appetizer or two to hold you until your sushi arrive. So far my favorite rolls are the Spider roll, dynamite roll, Michigan roll and the white tuna sushi.

I thought that since I&#39;m a body builder and it was my cheat day (haven&#39;t eaten all day either) that I could absolutely all out during my visit. I was wrong.

Pros:
- great price ($15.50 lunch/$19 dinner)
- nigiri (not all ayce sushi places offer this surprisingly and if you don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s just plain fish on top of rice)
- wide variety (Dinner has a substantial amount compared to lunch. Wish I tried that)
- taste/quality were overall good. No complaints here

Cons: 
- serving size: honestly this isn&#39;t surprising but it&#39;s still disappointment. They give out too much rice. This is obviously because they want you to be &#34;full&#34; which means over-ordering which means potentially extra charging. I get it, it&#39;s a basic principle of an ayce sushi place but out of the 5 I&#39;ve been to in the Chicago suburbs, only ONE gave the &#34;right&#34; amount of rice which is Hokkai in Glen a Ellyn. Anyway, the rice was way too much especially in the nigiri. I was struggling to finish everything. The 6 piece rolls have an ok amount but here&#39;s a pro-tip: the 5 piece rolls usually mean they are larger servings so be careful not to over order.

- tempura was super soggy 

- service: could have been a little better. Nothing really special on our part that day. It was decent 

Wish we could have tried more appetizers or even roll variety but since we were struggling with our first round because of all of the rice it was tough to do so. 

Just be careful not to over order and since it takes a while to for your order I would order little by little but send almost immediately place another order so you aren&#39;t waiting too long and the food won&#39;t settle which will make you feel really full. Oh, and order a carbonated drink to help your momentum and burps lol. Just my 2 cents. 

Not that it was bad, but the rice amount is a huge turn off and we won&#39;t be going here anytime soon tbh because of the other options. There wasn&#39;t really a wow factor and when you go to ayce sushi joints you expect to order a lot and try as much as you can but we felt limited because of all of that rice."

The nice thing is you get a large selection of rolls and sashimi to choose from, but that&#39;s where it ends.

Almost every single roll had cucumber in which I can only imagine is used to fill you up, making the taste difference from one roll to the next barely noticeable unless it had spicy mayo on it. 

The sashimi was made with such a large amount of rice it was ridiculous. Again, I believe it was purposely made that way to fill you up quickly.

They have a very strict &#34;You Pay for What You Don&#39;t Eat&#34; policy, so maybe they&#39;re trying to make money that way. I got a roll I didn&#39;t even order!

The only reason I gave them two stars is because the sashimi was very fresh and tasty. I just took half the rice off of it.

The sushi here is average to below average at best. 
I immediately took away a star when I saw how much rice they put in each roll, it is ridiculous. My reasoning here is that they want you to get full so you can pay extra for taking out the rolls. Also we ordered 18 rolls, I probably tasted 5 different ones as they all pretty much tasted the exact same. Don&#39;t order the nigiri, it&#39;s just small piece of fish with a huge slab of rice.

Another reason I took a star away is they have a 16% service fee for five people or more which I don&#39;t mind. But what I care about is that they LIED. We came in with 3 people total and they charged us for 5 people and when we asked why, the lady said don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s tip. Now I am all for tipping and I usually tip 15%+, but the fact that they are tipping themselves makes a little annoyed and LIED to do it.

Last star I took away was because of customer service. When I asked why they charged us for 5 people when there was only 3 of us, she tried turning it around on me by saying &#34; oh, you don&#39;t want to tip your waiters?!&#34;  And obviously putting me in awkward situation, I just walked away. 

I would give this place one star if it wasn&#39;t for their appetizers which I appreciate is also part of the AYCE and they are decent.

We came with 3 people and ended up paying 93$. It would have been 82, but we had to pay 11$ for the rolls we didn&#39;t eat. Let me rephrase that, the rolls we &#34;couldn&#39;t&#34; eat because it was just rice."

I went with two friends and we all ordered the ayce. The non sushi appetizers come out first and they are fine, miso soup, a small salad, and some assorted dumplings. 

When our sushi comes out, I immediately notice that there are rolls missing from my order. My other two friends food comes out and there are a couple of rolls missing from their order as well. I flag down the waitress and she explains that they did not think that we could eat everything that we ordered so there are some things missing from our order. One: we should be able to order to our liking and Two: if they were genuinely concerned, they should have consulted us so we could pick the ones that we wanted. They conveniently left out the most expensive rolls.  

I end up asking to have one of my unapproved rolls and my friends decide to the rest of the rolls that they originally decided on. I get my one extra roll, but when my friends get their rolls, they still only brought out 3 rolls instead of the 5 they said that they were going to bring &#34;we are only going to give you 3 more&#34;.

Next, we taste the rolls. They all taste the same and the quality of the fish is terrible and there is so much rice packed around the rolls. But we end up eating our rolls. Our check comes out and, get this, they tacked on the 16% gratuity that is supposed to only be reserved for parties of 6 people or more. Are you kidding me. For the service that they gave they did not deserve that kind of tip. When we ask about this, they say &#34;oh, you don&#39;t want to tip us?&#34;. We end up leaving it and just want to be done with the experience. Afterwards we all feel sick. We should have just left and refused their service after the first incident. 

I would not recommend this sushi place at all. The staff are incredibly unfriendly and they are cutting corners in terms of their service and food preparation. Opt for anything else."

It appears there is a new owner and much of the waitstaff have changed. No more friendly ladies with smiles. 

Last straw was the waitress saying she was doing us a favor by not charging us for the three clumps (about tablespoon each)of rice from my sushi. I admit it, I only ate half the rice under my salmon! Ridiculous and offensive. 

I don&#39;t ever remember being lectured about my rice intake or the lack thereof so 
I have to assume the new owner wants to squeeze every cent.

I was decently far from home so I wasn&#39;t familiar with the sushi restaurants in the area. I decided to go to Sushi Para because they had an all you can eat option.

I went in alone, straight to the counter and told them table for one. I was directed towards the window seats, which gave me the option to sit where I wanted. Immediately I was asked what I would like to drink and was handed the different menus. There are 3 menus: The Standard with everything they sell plus pricing, a Dinner All You Can Eat which is $18.99, and a Lunch All You Can Eat, which is only available before a certain time, so I&#39;m not sure how much that cost. The dinner all you can eat has more selection than the lunch though.

If you&#39;re not familiar with all you can eat sushi places, I&#39;ll explain how they work since most of them are the same. Basically eat what you can order, or you&#39;ll be charged for what you don&#39;t finish. A menu shows all the selections from maki rolls, nigiri, and specialty rolls. Just write down how much you want of each type of sushi and they&#39;ll bring it to you for one price.

Anyway so I was given my drink and I was already prepared to order. I started my Yelp review while I was waiting for my sushi to arrive. But I didn&#39;t even get finished with the second paragraph, it came so quick. It was probably because I was eating alone. Before my eyes were, the Palatine Roll, the Para Roll, the Philadelphia Roll, and two pieces of eel sushi. All of them tasted different in flavor which is a good thing. The fish was very fresh, and the rice was cooked to perfection. I ordered a second round, but I couldn&#39;t tell you what I got because at that point I was just shoving them in my mouth.

When I was done, I asked for my check and I was on my way.

I&#39;m glad more and more people are trying sushi. It&#39;s such a wonderful food and Sushi Para really delivers in service and quality. Next time I&#39;m in the area I&#39;ll be sure to hit up this place again. If you like good sushi, good service, and a good aesthetically pleasing environment, please go eat at Sushi Para, you will not be disappointed."

The food was really delicious .  Very fresh the servers were a big disappointment , perhaps they&#39;re burnt out on all you can eat patrons . But the whole time we were there they were almost robotic. No smiles  and no communication . 

Be aware if you choose to come here you have to clean your plate or you will be charged for not eating your  remaining  sushi 
I am a member of the clean plate club or at least take a doggy bag home.  ( being brought up by my very frugal Japanese parents , dad was raised in depression) they will allow you to bring home any leftover  sushi for a fee. 

So for twenty dollars it&#39;s worth it. I think my eldest son and friends try to bankrupt this place."

Honestly coming from the southeast, I am not used to buffets making me pay for leftover food. That is honestly a lot of pressure, I mean people should know not to be wasteful whether if it&#39;s buffet or dine in.
The worst part about this place is that towards the end I was SICK OF EATING RICE. But I will still be back haha. 
Basically the wait is treacherous, and I showed up here at 8:45PM. Took forever for me to flag someone down so I could ask a question on how the process works. Finally I got my water. Then I marked up the items I want and handed the slip to my waitress, she disappeared for lord knows how long.  Finally she brought out the veggie tempura and shumai I placed an order for. Generous portion, looks like they serve you the full size of an appetizer. Then I waited some more, don&#39;t ever come here by yourself, you will die of boredom waiting. Finally my sushi was ready and it was all worth it. Exceptional presentation, in fact best presentation for a sushi buffet place. The fish was very fresh. The rolls were tasty. 
Once again, the worst part is the heavy rice and you are forced to finish everything. URGH. If it wasn&#39;t for the wait and the pressure, this place would be 5 stars in my book. 
Basically I came here wanting pita pita and for some reason hopped over next door and came out with a food coma."

If you follow those it&#39;s all the way bait and switch. In fact, Sushi Para has a take out menu that is about 50% less than their dine in prices.

Prices aside, this is possibly the worst Sushi experience I have ever had. Even downstate Illinois has this sushi beat. Their rolls were droll, dirty looking and unappetizing. The sushi was SOOOOOO overloaded with rice you couldn&#39;t even pick it up with a chopstick. And their fish was flavorless so that even my favorite cuts were like bland jello.

No. All you can eat is not worth it, unless all you crave is bland rice! I recommend a pass."

Be careful with the amount you order because the rice fills you up quickly and there is a charge for what you don&#39;t finish. Besides the rice amount, it is a great spot.

I drove over 30 min and it was worth it. They have an all you can eat lunch special and dinner special but check out the times as the prices change. The staff was nice but not as attentive as I would have liked them to be. It&#39;s not a very big place so a little music would be nice to not awkwardly over hear people&#39;s conversations.

We just left and I couldn&#39;t wait to get home and write a review. First let&#39;s start off with the bad qualities of the rolls. The rolls are absolutely disgusting. My husband and I decided to do the all you can eat while our daughter decided to pick a roll from the menu. I ordered the miso soup, chicken salad and a couple of the rolls. First of all the chicken was cold and disgusting on the salad it was like they just threw it on there without a care. And the miso soup was the most disgusting miso soup that I&#39;ve ever had and I&#39;ve eaten a lot of sushi. After the first round of rolls my husband was so disgusted and his stomach already hurt but we knew we have to pay the $20 so we decided to just go ahead and continue with it. When you after the first round we would never come back to this restaurant. On the next round we ordered a bunch of different rolls and some of them were okay tasting while others were really gross. The one that was really disgusting was the spicy tuna. 

During the first round of rolls my husband didn&#39;t like any of his rolls and decided to give a piece, a singular piece to our daughter. We saw the waitress, who was watching us eat from across the restaurant, walk over and start to talk to the other servers and then we noticed that all the servers started watching us. She came over and said that we couldn&#39;t share with our daughter because she didn&#39;t get the all you can eat. We said ok and didn&#39;t realize that we couldn&#39;t share a single piece of a roll with her and ordered another round. After this we notice every server was watching us, they actually stationed someone across from us to watch us. Then we noticed they all started whispering and pointing to us. And sent another server over to ask why wasn&#39;t eating my spicy tuna rolls. I told her that I didn&#39;t like them and they were disgusting and she said okay and took them away. That&#39;s when we noticed that all of the servers were watching us and talking about us and pointing and laughing. I should note that we are a multicultural family. I am Black and my husband and daughter are white. When they started pointing and laughing my daughter asked are they laughing at us because I am black. I think the one woman overheard her as she turned around and started walking away and then went into the kitchen. It was then I told my husband to take our daughter and put her in the car. I walked up to the counter and said we were done and we just really wanted to pay our bill and go. That&#39;s when I noticed they had double charged us. They charged us extra for the spicy to know that I didn&#39;t like and wasn&#39;t going to eat and also for the singular piece of a role that my daughter ate they charged us an extra $2.75. Which was insane. When I asked the woman at the front why everyone was staring at us she said &#34;what am I supposed to do just not look at someone like you&#34;. 
It was then I knew exactly what she meant and not only that they were staring at us about the singular piece of a roll that we gave our daughter but because we were an interracial family. Disgusted I just paid whatever the bill was signed my name and left. No I did not leave a tip because our waitress was the leading person staring and laughing at my family. I will be calling my credit card company right now to let them know that that was signed only so I could leave the restaurant and not suffer anymore of the racism that this restaurant was putting towards me and my family. I will be calling the general manager and owner of this restaurant tomorrow. 

Do yourself a big favor do not ever, ever, eat at this disgusting restaurant. Not only is the food gross but the people are gross too."

If you don&#39;t tip all the time they will add a 16% tip on to the receipt which is only for 5 or more people for there serves even if they deserve it or not. Plus I was yelled out by the waitress when i ask them to change that because it was disrespectful to add in your own tip and I decided not to tip for it. So the waitress told me if I don&#39;t tip next time they won&#39;t serve my friends and I again.

 - The quality of the fish is actually very good.  I sat at the sushi bar, and watched impeccable plates come out rapidly, made to order, with good ingredients.  You can have all you want too.  Sounds good right?

- People aren&#39;t exaggerating about the quantity of rice.  It&#39;s massive.  Insane, really.  You&#39;ll fill up twice as fast as you think, because the rice will rapidly expand in your stomach.

I started with nigiri, and was dismayed at the bricks of rice under each piece of high quality fish.  Then I got &#34;smart&#34; - realizing that rolls had multiple non-rice items (fish, shrimp, avocado, cucumber) and had to be a better option.  

I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong.  From my vantage point, I could see the sushi chef grabbing a massive handful of rice to make each roll, then smashing it down onto the wrapper with such force that the rice compressed into a solid mat.  As a result, each roll had twice as much rice as it appeared to.

I can eat - my stomach is a black hole - but I had to fight hard to finish my second plate, so I wouldn&#39;t pay a penalty.  And I didn&#39;t order very much either time.  (in total, a few rolls, and 4 pieces of nigiri)

The most important piece of advice is that this is a budget sushi buffet.  Your expectations shouldn&#39;t be through the roof.  The price is totally reasonable, and the quality is actually pretty good.  They have to make it work somehow, and the way they do it is by making you eat far more rice than you&#39;d like to, which minimizes how much fish you can eat.

If you know that going in, and don&#39;t have unrealistic expectations, you&#39;ll like Sushi Para."

I do agree, sushi para used to be terrible and I refused to go there for many years. BUT when the bf and I went a few weeks ago, boy what a change they&#39;ve made!

The service is great and it&#39;s always reasonable time. The ingredients are always fresh. I have been seeing in other reviews that they put a lot of rice. That&#39;s only somewhat true but only on a roll with one ingredient, for example if
You just got a salmon or eel roll, it would just be that fish on top of a chunk of rice, but it&#39;s not bad. I would recommend this to any sushi lover and to come check it out."

Please read my prior review for all the details. This place is still happening with a long line Sunday night for dinner. Buffet cost 18.99 which is nice. Lots of rice with the maki, but the salmon was so fresh and fatty it was amazing. The only downside was with our main order they would short change the maki order each time.

I have been here about 10 times and there is usually a wait no matter what day of the week. It&#39;s dingy and out dated, but I will continue to frequent this place.

sushi-para-palatine,Mitch R.,xOelWBTwmiLAMqFAEQT3oA,"Palatine, IL",0,1,0,1,757,vVPg4v1QejEOOYgKdDJgyg,2.0,2015-03-02,"Me and my friends have been frequenting Sushi Para for a few years now, and at first it we thought it was a pretty great place. For while now, however, it has been seemingly going downhill. 

The quality of the fish, especially the salmon, has taken a dive. It is obviously a poorly farm raised, very fatty, artificially dyed variety of salmon. Not that I expect top notch salmon for $19 all you can eat, but it is just wholly unappetizing to see salmon this anemic looking. 

The rolls themselves also aren&#39;t anywhere as neatly constructed as they once were. I frequently find them looking haphazardly put together. This wouldn&#39;t be a problem, really,  except the pieces almost always start falling apart upon grasping them with my chopsticks. They&#39;re also much too heavy on the rice. I can understand that they&#39;re trying to keep costs down, but the fish to rice ratio is simply ridiculous even by all you can eat standards.

The servers are also now giving us a harder time than usual. Being charged extra for a couple small pieces left on the plate, bringing the wrong items (i.e. serving plum wine when asked for red wine), and being relatively inattentive to tables they&#39;ve served are problems we&#39;re experiencing. I was charged $8 for a couple pieces of sushi my girlfriend left on her plate, even though she only ordered 3 rolls. My friend just the other night was charged for a mere two pieces left on his plate. What?!?!

Though this place could feasibly regain another star in my eye if they rectified the fish and roll construction quality issues, it is what it is and that&#39;s a budget sushi joint. To the people giving this place 4 or 5 stars: please go to a decent sushi restaurant and try some sushi that isn&#39;t made with bottom of the barrel fish, and stop giving budget sushi 5 star reviews."

My favorites are the Hokkai, Palatine, American Dream, and Rainbow rolls. The nigiri can often be very rice-heavy and isn&#39;t the best sushi rice. The fish, to the best of my knowledge, comes pre-packaged (not always cut) and has been frozen. Quality can be hit-or-miss but is usually decent. 

Service is obviously better at off-peak times. Expect a wait on Friday and Saturday evenings! Dinner price is slightly more than lunch ($16.99 vs. $18.99 I believe)."

My family has been going here 15+ years ever since it first opened.  The fish is very fresh and tasty. The rolls are huge. Love the Mountain Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll and if you like spicy try the Para Roll.  The hand rolls are fabulous too.  This is by far the BEST AYCE sushi place in town. Lots of variety. Although the wait to be seated is long at times it is definitely well worth it. This only confirms how tasty and good the sushi is. I definitely recommend this place!

Tucked into a strip mall, Sushi Para isn&#39;t particularly big, but accommodates patrons well enough for the act of sitting down and ordering a ton of sushi with friendly servers to match. If you have the appetite for it, the all-you-can-eat option for $18.99 is definitely the way to go.

Unfortunately, my wife and I weren&#39;t particularly fans. The sheer amount of rice packed around each roll or under each bit of sashimi was downright gratuitous to the point of blending out any flavor of the sushi itself. At times, feeling like you were eating rice that just happened to have some sushi in it.

The Tamago and Crab sashimi were great along with the Tempura rolls were both good, in addition to the appetizers. Yet, otherwise a majority of the sushi flew well under the radar of comparable offerings from other restaurants in the area. 

For all-you-can-eat prices, it isn&#39;t bad. However, as a caveat, if you leave even so much as a single piece on your plate from a roll, you&#39;ll be charge on your bill for doing so should you opt for the all-you-can-eat option. Understandably, it deters people from over-ordering, but such measures seem ultimately draconian.

 As of now, my wife and I are unsure about a return visit when there&#39;s so many better offerings for cheaper a la carte sushi closer to us."

The good: Pretty good selection for an AYCE menu. Service was decent. Green tea included. All you can eat prices were very modest (although I suppose now I know why). Salmon tasted good. Wasabi had a good amount of heat. 

The bad: Rice was hard and the rolls fell apart. Our order was not quite right but they fixed it. The eel was slightly undercooked and incredibly fishy. Way too much rice in the rolls and especially in the nigiri, but that&#39;s to be expected sushi with AYCE.

The ugly: Watched a server eating something in the corner next the sushi bar several times and not washing her hands before handling plates and whatnot. The sweet egg was half brown and looked a week old. 

Overall: I won&#39;t be back. If you stick to the basics and go in with low expectations, you&#39;ll probably be fine."

The key thing here is to pace yourself! Know how much you can handle, because they will charge you for any extra food left over. I&#39;ve heard of people hiding their rice in the soy sauce container, so make sure to check it before pouring some into your dish.

Keep in mind, for the all you can eat, they don&#39;t want to go out of business, so they pack A LOT of rice on the nigiri. The rolls are decent (not as much rice) but keep in mind that fried stuff like tempura in the rolls can add to making you feel a lot more full.

Overall, I think for the price and for the fact that I&#39;m in the midwest, the quality and taste of the sushi is pretty good. 3 stars in my book!"

I got four rolls, my boyfriend got three, and we eat got a miso soup.  THE ROLLS ARE HUGE!!!  They are completely stuffed.  You will not be disappointed with the size or the taste.  Another plus was how quickly all our rolls were prepared.  The restaurant was half full and we got our food within 15 minutes.

Warning: they say on the menu you will have to pay for any leftover rolls you do not eat.  I think it would be okay if you had a few bites left, but not an entire roll.

Although there are several other sushi buffets in the Chicagoland area, Sushi Para holds the crown as being the best in my book. 

I have been to several other sushi buffets in Chicago where you can only order two rolls at a time or there is a limited selection to choose from or charge up to $30 a person. Sushi Para, on the other hand, has no limitations or stipulations. Take note, if you don&#39;t finish your food, they will charge you extra. Beware, their rolls tend to be larger and contain more rice than usual which makes the meal even more filling. I have been charged extra in the past due to my eyes being larger than my stomach. 

For appetizers, choose from a variety from Japanese fried chicken, yaki tori, fried oysters, and gyoza. From the a la carte items, enjoy unagi, red snapper, tuna, salmon, ebi, and etc. The best part is the number of maki rolls to choose from, there are at least 10 on the menu. All of which are part of the buffet. Did I say that it was only $18.99? Just wanted to make sure that you in case I forgot. 

I like their Palatine location the best but their locations in the city have BYOB. The trade-off is that there will definitely be a wait unless you can go during their off times. Heads up on the odd new age music in the background."

I remember the fish being fresh, average amount of rice, average amount of fish, and no vinegar or very little vinegar in the rice itself.  It was basically good sushi for a good value.  Now, don&#39;t get me wrong...the sushi was never mindblowing or amazing, but it was definitely good.

This time I went, it was probably the worst sushi I&#39;ve ever had.  The fish was definitely thawed from frozen, the nigiri had riceballs the size of my fist, with thin slivers of fish on top, and the rice was excessively vinegar tasting (i.e. to mask the non-fresh fish).  I wish I took photos.  The rice to fish ratio was absurd.  I couldn&#39;t taste anything except the vinegar and rice.  I guess if you really like rice, then this is the place to go.

Overall the sushi was good, the right amount of filling to rice that authentic places use, some buffets give way more rice.  This place also offers some really good specialty rolls like the american, the crunchy, palatine, and boston rolls.  All have fillings like shrimp, fried shrimp, tuna, and a bunch of other stuff.

I really wanted to try the soft shelled crab but it was extra and I figured I&#39;d try the main stream stuff first.  For the price, after tax and tip, we paid 20 bucks a person and was treated to a very nice server that kept refilling our tea and water and asked if we wanted to order more food.  A monday at noon and the place was only 1/3 full but I have heard it normally gets really full on Sunday nights.  I&#39;d definitely come back again because of the bang for your buck, quality wise I have had better but it costs a lot more then.  For the price of 1 really good roll else where (about 12 bucks) add 4 more dollars and you get all you can eat good rolls.  

Also the sashimi comes 1 piece at a time which is nice so you can try a bunch of things without being full up on one thing.  

Also they have chicken nuggets for some reason, it&#39;s called like taka alga or sumfin.

And they have shui mai, dumplings, um yea those were def ordered premade and steamed, they aren&#39;t good by dim sum standards."

Appetizers include edamame, salad, shu mai, chicken yakitori, miso soup, potstickers, etc. 
The only downfall is that if you don&#39;t finish the sushi you order, you have to pay about 50 cents per piece (but you can take it home). The fish is pretty fresh. My favorite roll is the volcano roll...I believe it&#39;s spicy tuna and salmon inside."

She says &#34;you know that our employees need to make money so I added the 16% to your bill&#34; WTF?! She starts raising her voice saying &#34;you should know Americans give tips&#34; what does that mean?! We trusted this place and never thought they would do this. But they&#39;ve been doing this without our knowledge for several months!! THEY FLAT OUT STEAL FROM YOU!! We asked that should&#39;ve communicated with us and asked us if there was anything wrong with the service instead of adding 16% to our bill!! She replied &#34;well I just did didn&#39;t i?&#34; 

NEVER GOING BACK HERE!! If I was able to to give no stars I would&#39;ve!"

I recently ordered take-out, as I often do from there, and it was vile. I ordered several things, 2 of which were a spicy tuna roll and the Sapporo roll, when I went to get my food I saw the tuna rolls causally sitting on the back counter. I thought nothing of it since the rest of the order wasn&#39;t ready so I just figured they had just gotten through making them--I was very wrong. The tuna was hot, as though they hasn&#39;t had it on ice or refrigerated the whole day, hot! I always order no tobiko with my sushi because I personally don&#39;t care for caviar and the rolls were loaded with them! 

I called in hopes of them being willing to at least make my dinner over and the manager I spoke to was very rude and argued with me about it. I offered to bring the food back to show her that there was caviar all over the rolls-inside, outside, everywhere-and she could not care less. She even hung up on me! Horrible customer service.

Sushi rolls were sub-par... And the worst part about the &#39;all you can eat&#39; shady deal is that they fill most of the roll with RICE. 

We finished all the rolls and I left some of the rice. The lady takes it away... And returns a few minutes later with the plate to say, &#34;My manager says we charge you $1 for the extra rice.&#34; And I just say, no problem. Not like that dollar matters to me... But to make things even worse, she proceeds to say, &#34;did you want finish it?&#34; After she had already taken it away?!? That was just gross.

If you are considering to try the Loco Bowl (like a burrito bowl from Chipotle or Qdoba) then read carefully. I added chicken, and there are other meat options like steak and pork; I asked for no cheese and sour cream. That leaves me with the rice, beans, and lettuce. Sour cream and guac are extra, and I picked the guac. I&#39;m on that Gucci Mane diet, just an FYI. 

The good: Large portion, decent price (including the guac), fast

The bad: very bland (even when the chicken was a little salty)

The ugly: I added some seasoning and it was still bland

So for about $10, the I get fast food Mexican in a bowl WITHOUT cheese and sour cream. Therefore, others who order with everything may have a different experience.

I have ordered different items from this place before, and o thought they were aight. I mean it&#39;s fast food right, considering that they have a drive thru."

Plenty of varieties and choices. More than any other Mexican restaurants in the area. They have tons of unique and different options that aren&#39;t offered in many other places. Their white corn tortilla used in the tacos are awesome and I prefer those compared to the yellow corn tortillas which are usually served everywhere else (I have yet to find another place where they have white tortillas). 

The steak is pretty basic, can&#39;t go wrong. The carnita though is spot on and one of the best I&#39;ve had. On the plus side they also have elote which again, I cannot find in many other Mexican restaurants ironically around my area at least.

Prices have gone up a little especially for the individual tacos I believe but the quality and options are great."

The burritos are frickin&#39; huge, I never finish them so depending on how hungry you are I would go with the junior burrito. Also of note is the elotes (Mexican-style corn) which you will want to save room for. 

For me, the dangerous part is that this place is literally across the street from where I live so it&#39;s almost always a go to quick dinner. It&#39;s right by a Taco Bell and I always wonder why anyone would go there instead of this place only a few feet away."

Probably not. He&#39;s most likely going to order something more authentic like chilaquiles, elote, or a lengua taco. You can get all three of those and plenty more at El Burrito Loco in Bloomingdale. 

I ordered the tripa (stomach), cabeza (head), lengua (tongue), al pastor (marinated pork), and chicharron (fried pork fat) tacos to start. Forget steak tacos, true Mexican cuisine is about using all parts of the animal and making it good. Yes, even the stomach of a cow and the meat from its head can be delicious in taco form. I also ordered the chilaquiles con carne which is tortilla chips soaked in a red chile sauce, a chile relleno dinner, elote, and horchata. This was an order that even Rick Bayless would be drooling over since these are some items that he orders on taco runs in Mexico and prepares on his show. All of these items were stellar but the elote was simply stunning - the combination of sweet corn, mayo, cotija cheese, and dried chile powder was a fiesta in my mouth. 

This place is a Mexican food heaven for foodies and it&#39;s a shame that most people will overlook it just because of its appearance or unwillingness to try new things. 

Don&#39;t come here if you only order burritos, nachos, guacamole, or fajitas at a Mexican restaurant.

My selections were the chicken on a hard shell &amp; steak on flour.  I was much more impressed with the chicken taco than the steak. The beans had no flavor but were creamy. The rice was great. 

All in all it was a much better experience. It&#39;s great to have the option to get authentic Mexican fast food but I am not sure it falls in the cheap category. A dinner combo is $8.99. While this is not bad, it&#39;s not cheap. I have been able to order Mexican takeout from area restaurants within the same price range and the to go order comes with chips and salsa. Would I eat here again? Yes.And I would chose El Burrito to Taco Bell all day every day but I am not sure that says much.

I&#39;ve driven by this place so many times, but never gone.  I dunno why it took me so long.  

The place looks like it used to be another fast food place, but I have no idea what.  The booths are uncomfortable.  But, that&#39;s ok, i&#39;m not there to take a nap.  They aren&#39;t unbearably so, but just something to point out.  They do provide chips and salsa for dining in.  They also have a red and green sauce like most Mexican joints.

We got a lot of food.  Elotes, tamales, tacos, fajita quesadilla, cheese enchilada kids meal, taco salad, horchata.  And that was just for me.  Just kidding.  It was a reasonable price and everything was pretty good.  The ground beef could use a little more seasoning I think but other than that, it was pretty tasty.

They give you limes wrapped in foil and these are not your dried out thin slices of lime that you get at some places.  Juicy enough where two was enough for 3 tacos.  But that 3rd one just made it better.

We also had a cheesecake burrito, which is basically a flashfried cheesecake dessert.  It was kinda like a blintz I guess?  It could have used some fruit sauce.

The horchata is on fountain, and not the best horchata ever (That still goes to El Centro RIP) but still good if you like it.  We&#39;ll be back."

Another great item was their Giant Quesadilla that came with lettuce, sour cream, salsa, and sauce.

All that aside, the food is AMAZING. ALL OF IT. like I&#39;ve been here a few times and have yet to be disappointed. Minor downside, while friendly, the service is meh. And don&#39;t expect free salsa. 

Tip: upgrade your burrito to &#34;wet&#34; for 1.50 extra. They smother it with cheese and salsa and give you guac and sour cream"

The food is average to above average for a fast food Mexican establishment. I&#39;ve never had a bad meal at Burrito loco. The only problem I&#39;ve had is their rice water aka horchata. Their horchata taste like the cheap stuff that you buy at wal mart and you add water to it and drink. However, that solutions can be fixed by simply replacing a drink."

No greeting, no smile, just mean staring as we look at their menu. We ordered  but made the mistake of asking for a dish with mole. They don&#39;t have mole`, so don&#39;t even ask or you&#39;ll get a dirty look and a look of confusion. Don&#39;t get the horchata either because it&#39;s a mix that is gross.

Then we went to sit down and realized that the table are bolted to the floor and are made for thin people only. The HARD plastic seats are torturous! My 9 yr old said it is more comfortable at McDonalds. 

Once we realized that the seating was too much to endure (2 minutes after we ordered), we asked for the food packed to go. Eyeliner girl said it&#39;s already done and they can&#39;t make it to go, yet 5 min later still no food. 

OMG the food: overpriced and disgusting. I got the flautas dinner and everything on that plate tasted the same. As if they dumped the whole bottle of Adobo and Sazon on everything. The rice was soo salty and the beans too, the chicken in the flautas was chewy and burnt on both ends, the tortilla was burnt as well. The plastic ware they give just literally bent all out of shape and gave out, so I had to pick up the flautas with my fingers and take a bite. So very disappointing.   Total let-down. I turned around and saw taco bell out the window and for the first time in my life, said to myself wish I was eating there. 

They are crazy if they think they&#39;re going to make it much longer with the people they employ and the lack of any quality in the food they serve. BOO! El burrito loco, seriously BOO! I wanted to enjoy  a meal with my family, but the whole experience was awful. I had to work for 3 hours to make the money I paid for that meal, and it would&#39;ve been better off if I threw that money in the garbage."

There is nothing fancy about this place, but they have a bit of an extensive menu and have many options for their tacos. My favorite is the al pastor. Their tacos are pretty full too. Horchada is pretty good. The rice and beans don&#39;t do too much for me from here, but they don&#39;t taste bad so I nibble on them bit. They have pretty good guacamole here. Not the best i&#39;ve had, but I usually order it and enjoy it. 

I have had their enchiladas before and they were pretty tasty. I didn&#39;t want any cheese with mine when I ordered it and was under the impression I would get a mole or some type of red sauce, but there was no sauce. They have containers of red sauce and salsa verde on the side that you grab for each table, which i&#39;m guessing is what they expected me to use. I went with the salsa verde, which is tasty. When it comes to the burritos, the big ones are very big! Like the size of my head. That can definitely be shared between 2 people. I&#39;ve tried the fajita style burrito and the steak used for it was great and tender! Very tasty. The tacos are usually my go to though!

So I got a burrito. A chicken burrito. And it was all right... the rice was all right, the beans were all right... it was all right overall. None of the ingredients really stood out... and if I recall correctly, it&#39;s almost as expensive as Chipotle and Qdoba, both of which taste better and have more unique flavors.

I admit when pulling up to this establishment I was very leery, it&#39;s an old Wendy&#39;s building so it looks suspicious. But do not be afraid! For delicious food awaits!  The place is clean, the servers are nice and the menu is pretty big. So be sure to read through the menu to get a good idea of what you want. I embarrassingly enough usually order the same things... you know, Burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas and don&#39;t venture outside of my box that much. I&#39;m working on it.

I would go here a few times a week if I could that&#39;s how deep my love affair runs! The burritos are huge (even the &#34;baby &#34;one) and hands down my favorite. I also became an addict of the fountain supply of Horchata here. OMG I mean seriously, how was this not in my life before?
 
This is a great place for a quick bite, or a casual sit down meal. I really don&#39;t think you could go wrong with anything on the menu here. As for the Wendy&#39;s old building, it&#39;s actually kind of cute and it works. I&#39;m a fan of the little window greenhouse-feel section.  It&#39;s nostalgic except with better food.

Sitting on the former spot of Royal Gyros (and before that a Burger King) El Burrito Loco serves authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price.

In visiting El Burrito Loco I wasn&#39;t certain it was open. However, there were a few cars parked in the lot so I decided to pull in and walk inside. There was no sign on top of the building or anything to indicate they were open until you get close enough to the window to see patrons sitting and eating.

 I stopped in and decided to try two taco&#39;s, one steak and one chicken. I was given a choice of tortillas (flour or corn) and within a few minutes my food was ready. My chicken had a nice chewy bite to it and was fairly flavorful. The steak was ground up a bit more than I&#39;m used to but was good as it wasn&#39;t too stringy and tasted good. The taco&#39;s had lettuce and cheese on them. The tortillas were hot and soft. There was also a choice of hot sauces in bottles to try at the counter, though I opted to pass on them for this visit.

They also have several egg dishes available for breakfast. While they don&#39;t open until 8:00 AM. It&#39;s not a bad place to stop for a quick breakfast dish in the morning.

Overall I liked the taco&#39;s and plan to further experiment with the menu here. While not the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had it&#39;s better than average. I&#39;d recommend El Burrito Loco and I&#39;ll be back again. Four stars."

I found myself this past week at this restaurant during AMEX small business weekend where they give you 25 dollars credit to spend at your local businesss. Given that this is a new location, our family decided to give it a try. The menu itself is quite authentic with lengua tacos etc. There are burritos, fajitas, soups, tacos, enchilada, tamale, etc. I ended up taking the carne asada dinner with steak pieces, rice, refried beans, and lettuce with a side of flour tortilla to wrap. The meat itself unfortunately was excessively salty which took away from the nature flavors of the meat. Otherwise by combining it together in a flour tortilla, this made it slightly more palatable. Service was friendly and afterwards our food came quickly. This location use to be a burger king and much of the store layout has not changed. Unfortunately, the restaurant itself was rather cold on this day. 

Pro- extensive mexican food menu, relatively inexpensive (4 people for 35 dollars for lunch)

Con- super salty meat

Hidden deal- Specials located on menu behind the register (didn&#39;t remember what it was but i think it was some taco items)"

There was an El Burrito Loco in DeKalb when i was in college and i always knew it as the best hangover food. But now that I drink things other than cheap beer like water and soda I was able to discover that the food itself is actually affordable and delicious.

This place has a huge menu and this location has a DRIVE THRU!
This is a great place to step outside of the box.
I got a giant quesadilla with chorizo and it came with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo all for $2.99. You literally cannot beat that with a stick.

Also you can get horchata and it&#39;s free refills. I&#39;m excited to frequent this place as it is very close to home!

Update:
Since I wrote my initial review I&#39;ve also eaten the Chilequiles with steak which was out of this world. I also got a Chile Relleno Baby Burrito that was the size of a baby and also amazing.

The giant burrito truly is enormous; I get it wet with chicken, easy on the cheese (they put a LOT). BF loves his enchiladas suizas, and we both fight over the guacamole. Rice could use more seasoning, but beans tend to be oversalted. Hot salsa is needlessly incendiary -- think &#34;Thai-hot&#34; times 10 -- so stick to the mild or verde if you value your digestive tract at all.

Having the expectation that you will be receiving gourmet Mexican food and top notch service is beyond realistic. It is what it is...and, it&#39;s damn good.

I&#39;ve tried most things chicken off the massive menu. Chicken tacos. Chicken enchiladas. Chicken tamales. Chicken quesadillas. Personally, I&#39;m a fan of the tacos. Corn tortillas with seasoned chicken breast, a pinch of cilantro and some onion and tomato. The tortillas and the veggies are always fresh and the meat is tender and moist. Nomz.

Service is typically fast (is it fast food), even in the drive through. The staff is friendly and accommodating. For the vegetarians out there, El Burrito Loco is willing to make any dish veggie for you. And for those of you more open-minded - they have your tongue, tripe, and brains. There&#39;s definitely options for everyone and every type of eater.

Really big portions, Cheese covers everything, EVERYTHING. Honestly, sometimes I&#39;m in the mood for junky mexican food. Sometimes I just want to chill with my homies and bump through a drive thru and scarf down some burritos. It&#39;s cheap and good and honestly for hanover park&#39;s sizable hispanic community, it&#39;s a shame there aren&#39;t more taqueria&#39;s around.

I subtract a star because honestly it&#39;s not the best mexican around but in the area it&#39;s great. Also, this is the only taqueria i&#39;ve ever been to in my life that does NOT give complimentary chips and salsa while you sit and wait for your food. HUGE bummer."

1 Steak Taco, 1 Chicken Taco and 1 Chile Relleno Taco. All were larger than I expected but all 3 were very good. I am happy to have a close go to place for the Taco bug when it hits. My only complaint would be the walk in time. It took just over 15 minutes to get these 3 Taco&#39;s. There were many people waiting for their food which then confused customers which line they need to be in to order food. The amount of people is also a good sign and hopefully they will stay longer than the last place in this location.

The food is standard Italian food - but nothing outstanding.

You get served free bread with olive oil as an appetizer and the menu consists of a few signature dishes and does not give an impression of being overloaded.

Short answer is yes. 4 times I&#39;ve had the burrata plate. It&#39;s not on the menu, but they always have it and it&#39;s great. Burrata, prosciutto, tomatoes, artichokes, olives and roasted red peppers.  Along with bread and olive oil, it is a meal for one. A substantial one at that. It&#39;s also relatively healthy  (for me eating while on the road traveling).  One of these days I&#39;ll get around to ordering off the menu.

The inside is very small and narrow and as someone else mentioned, it is a little loud in there because of the building design.  But the food which I waited a whole 2 weeks for did impress me.  My friend and I ordered grilled calamari (8/10), rigatoni amatriciana (7/10), shrimp risotto (10/10), veal scaloppini (10/10) and the lemoncello cake with an affogato (9/10).  Everything was really good although we were sorely disappointed when we saw our neighbor table being served the delicious burrata appetizer that wasn&#39;t listed on their menu and wasn&#39;t read off to us in the specials.  We would have preferred that ten folds over the grilled calamari which was a little chewy and needed more lemon and salt.  Something I noticed: When the waitress read out the specials, there were seriously 10 plus items that she mentioned.  I would suggest in creating a small &#34;Specials Menu&#34; if there are more than a few specials that aren&#39;t listed on the main menu so the diners can make a more informed decision especially when the dishes and/or ingredients might not be familiar to most people.  

I also noticed that some of the secondi items came with pasta, which is why we ordered the veal scaloppini.  It would have been a very small dinner if you ordered that alone but paired with our two pasta dishes, it was the perfect portion.  The veal was incredibly tender served with two spears of asparagus and some delicious potatoes. The rigatoni was probably the most disappointing item of the night (just bland) but the risotto was really something that I&#39;m already craving to have again.  And the shrimp inside the risotto was just outstanding.

The affogato (espresso and gelato) was better than the lemoncello cake and would suggest that if you&#39;re not caffeine sensitive.  Overall, it&#39;s a great place but I can&#39;t wait to return so I can have a do-over with certain dishes."

Antipasto and fried calamari apps were delicious. I had the spaghetti carbonara (bacon) which was very creamy. The flavor was great, but a little too heavy for my taste.

My friend had the rigatoni with marinara and added shrimp, which was perfect. I will get that next time since I prefer a lighter pasta.

The bread was warm and very soft, yet had a nice crust. They make their own mozerella, so ask for the antipasto app, which may not be on the menu. Minestrone was so so - doesn&#39;t have a strong tomato flavor like I&#39;m used to and prefer.

The gelato for dessert was very good. After spending a few weeks in Italy last year, I&#39;ve become accustomed to great Italian food and this place does not disappoint. I will be back soon, but will enjoy my leftovers first!"

Once we got our table, the service was excellent!  Our server came right over, the busboy brought bread, oil and cheese... 

The food was great!  The only complaint, if I have one, is that while there are plenty of options on the menu, not a whole lot for a picky eater that loves Italian food.  I know, sounds nuts... but if you don&#39;t like fish, don&#39;t eat mushrooms... and are on a budget, this might not be the best place to stop in and dine.  The standard pasta dishes that we&#39;re all used to are not part of the menu, as I expected they&#39;d be.  I was able to find a couple of dishes I would try, but not as many as I had hoped.

I will admit that I&#39;m completely biased and would prefer almost any other cuisine over Italian cuisine simply because the explosion of flavor and awe is lacking with this type of food.  With that being said, I will point out that all of the food that me, my fiancé and my fiancé&#39;s grandmother ate were delightful.  The pizza that Grandma ordered was a thin-crust Margherita pizza that looked like and tasted much more like a plain old cheese pizza than anything else.  My fiancé got the Involtini Romana which they note, there at the restaurant, as a &#34;special&#34; but it seems to be a regular item.  This entrée also seemed to resemble the German dish, Roulade, with the stuffed meat so it didn&#39;t seem too authentically Italian.  My dish was the Risotto Di Crema Scampi which came in a ridiculously huge portion, big enough to split between two people to be honest.  The risotto came in excess while the shrimp were a scarcity, but I have to say that the shrimp combined with the risotto soaked in Vodka sauce was great - it filled me up more than I&#39;d imagined it would, but that&#39;s probably also due to the fact that I had more than my fair share of bread, olive oil and parmesan which was tasty just as it is at every Italian restaurant.  Like every Italian restaurant - they also had tiramisu (one of my favorite desserts, actually) and it was pretty good.  It came in a pretty descent size and it was creamy just as it should be!  

Although my whole party was set on what we wanted to eat, but if we hadn&#39;t it may have been a difficult decision given that there&#39;s the pre-fixed menu and then there&#39;s also about 10 specials that our waiter spewed off.  Although I&#39;m not complaining about the several options available, it seemed like information overload and I thought it odd that there were so many specials - shouldn&#39;t there only be around 3-4 specials at any given time?  That is why it&#39;s called a &#34;special&#34;.  Besides the excess of specials (which was more of an annoyance than anything) there was another odd occurrence when one of the staff members was eating at a table which we were then sat at directly after she ate there, without cleaning off the table.  Believe me when I say that there were plenty of tables that we could have been seated at but instead we were sat at that one - it was just a little bit of a turn-off.  

Overall, I wasn&#39;t blown away by anything at this restaurant which is why I gave it the rating that I did.  You&#39;re not going to get bad food whilst here so you don&#39;t have to worry about not coming here and receiving a poor meal.  On a different note, you may have to worry about the time in which you go - my party came to eat dinner at 4:30 on a Saturday, but around 5 pm it started to quickly fill up, mostly with families and their children.  If you want a restaurant that&#39;s more hip and doesn&#39;t have a bunch of large family gatherings then you may want to wander somewhere else, but if you don&#39;t mind either of those things then you may be set in coming to Via Roma for a night out.  

Last, but not least remember to bring your own wine, vodka or whatever your vice may be because Via Roma is a BYOB!  There is no corking fee here so you needn&#39;t worry about that either."

Besides the food and the casual and cozy atmosphere, the other highlight is BYOB with no corkage fee,  Yep, you heard right!  There is something to be said about bringing in your favorite wine or adult beverage (we saw a table with a soft sided cooler full of beer).  With no additonal cost, it&#39;s even a bigger perk.
Now onto the food.  I opted for linguine and claims in a white wine sauce.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Briny, garlicky with perfectly cooked noodles.  My girlfriend went with wild boar pasta.  While it was served with more of a lighter cream sauce, it still hit home on all levels.  On a chilly fall night, it hit the spot.  My daughter opted for the gnocci. It was solid but I&#39;ve tried other dishes that were a little more delicately prepared.  While not gummy, the gnocchi were a bit dense.
If I lived in the area, this would be a weekly spot for us to visit.  They don&#39;t take reservations so best to arrive early."

I got to the restaurant at 2:45 and to my surprise they closed at 3pm. I should have checked but they let me sit outside on the back patio and order anyways. I got the caprese salad, and the pumpkin ravioli. The freshness of the tomatoes was amazing and the olive oil was very very good quality.  I asked for some balsimic for the salad and bread and it was the nice aged kind. I asked and it was aged 5 years. Which is nice because most places will skimp on that. 

Then I got the ravioli and it was suppose to have a butternut squash and pesto dressing but the taste was overwhelmed with some sort of stock. I would have assumed seafood stock but the waiter checked and they swore it was chicken stock. I could not shake the seafood taste. It was just did not pair well with the ravioli and it was covered in it so made me sad I couldn&#39;t get the full taste. 

I am conflicted with the rating because it started off so strong and amazing and I feel if not for that stock overpowering the taste it would have been a perfect 5 stars. If I am in the area again I will have to give them another shot. But I went with 3 becuase the main entree was not very good but it was fresh if that counts."

If you&#39;ve spent a lot of time in Italy, you know what I mean, if you haven&#39;t you should book a trip now, it will change you...it&#39;s amazing.

Every time I go to an Italian restaurant, I remember all the things I loved in Italy but don&#39;t quite get the same experience I so desperately want... Until I went to Via Roma.  It&#39;s the most authentic Italian experience I&#39;ve had in the states, or anywhere else.  There was an amazing place in Marrakech, but that&#39;s another story.

The food is authentic! I don&#39;t know who&#39;s cooking back there, but judging by the Italian you hear in the kitchen, I assume it&#39;s someone equally as authentic.  Generally I&#39;d recommend anything off of the specials list - I usually do that and I&#39;m always delighted.  The carbonara is amazing and just like a little place in Rome I went to.  The eggplant dishes are my favorite and the veal is always great too.  Via Roma doesn&#39;t have a bar or wine list - but they will open bottles you bring for free.  I don&#39;t really drink wine since getting back from Italy, but it&#39;s nice for friends - and keeps the bill down when out with a big group.  I highly recommend the gelato, it is just like the gelato in Venice, and that is a rare treat.

Rare treat pretty much sums up the whole experience every time I go to Via Roma - give it go!!"

Unfortunately, not the same at all. We were there early so there were only a few people in the restaurant. The first thing I noticed was there were so many servers. Clearly, they were expecting a big night. We were seated near the kitchen door. The food was alright but that is not what I remember most. We were CONSTANTLY interrupted by servers--no less than 6 times. At the end, while we were drinking coffee, they brought us the bill and moved a table up against ours and put a &#34;reserved&#34; sign on it. We weren&#39;t even finished.

The place was absolutely packed so I understand wanting to move people along but honestly...we weren&#39;t even there for a hour, we barely had enough privacy to talk, and we were hustled out like we had a disease.

As we were leaving we were asked again how &#34;everything&#34; was. I stopped and said it was, frankly, terrible. There was honest concern but to bad. Never going back again. There are a lot of places to eat in Chicago and I don&#39;t care to get the bums rush."

This is the first time we&#39;ve been to this restaurant and wow, have we been missing out!    We got there at 5:30 and it was completely filled with laughing, happy, hungry people by 6:00.  Great ambiance, outstanding food, friendly staff.  The food is very authentic Italian with a slightly lighter touch.  I had one of the specials which was handmade gnocchi, red sauce, fresh mozzarella on top.  My friend had pumpkin ravioli topped with a light pesto with pine nuts and freshly chopped butternut squash.  We shared each other&#39;s and both were outstanding - light, very fresh, could not have been better.  Their food is lighter than some of the other Italian restaurants in the area and just hits the spot.  Also, their menu is a little more inventive than some of the local rivals. Had we realized it was a BYOB, we would have brought it with us, as just about everyone in the place had brought their own!

For dessert, we split one of the best tiramisu that I have ever had.  Not overly sweet or rich.  I would highly recommend this place and will be back soon with more friends and our own bottle."

Me and our guests decided to wait until 830 or 845 so we could get right in as we did and received a patio seat at about 9ish last Saturday evening. The BYOB was very enjoyable and waitstaff was quite knowledgeable and explained all of the specialities to perfection. The food was very tasty though we never were able to finish it!
It was a beautiful evening and we were having a leisurely dinner and drinks but unbeknownst to us as the clock struck 10pm the waitstaff turned into robots rushing us, denying us additional ice for our drinks and then started clearing anything glass off the table and asking us to pour our wine into Styrofoam cups and literally making us so uncomfortable that we knew we had to hurry up and finish our meal and drinks and get up and leave. While I know employees want to go home at closing time, we had been there a little over an hour and no one indicated that they closed at 10 and we were very rushed before our meal was even finished and for that I was very upset and will probably not go back!  
More than half of the tables on the patio were full and all of the people were commenting on how rushed they felt, and I feel a restaurant doing that kind of business on a Saturday night should probably extend their hours or at least make their patrons feel comfortable while they are finishing their meals! I am not one to linger when I know the restaurant is closed but I have also not been forced to finish my meal in a hurry and asked to put my wine in a Styrofoam cup because they want to get their dishes done the minute it is closing time either!!!
Very poor customer relations as far as I am concerned :("

All of us had veal, lol, and while it was good, I felt as though my Saltimbocca wasn&#39;t prepared the way I am used to.  I have usually had it where the prosciutto is encrusted into the veal, and this time it was just on top.  It was not bad by any means, I am just used to it the other way.

Don&#39;t bother trying to park on Lee St, turn onto Prairie, and go into the large municipal lot behind the buildings, follow the signs for the Post Office. There&#39;s no time limit, and you can go into the restaurant through the patio.

Wanting to try a new place (that delivers) and craving Chinese, I came across Moonsun&#39;s take out menu mailed to me months ago.  &#34;Sushi, Chinese, Thai&#34;.  Those 3 words didn&#39;t sit well.
I&#39;m a firm believer that restaurants do ONE thing well...and my instinct usually follows this rule.
I took a chance.  Read mostly positive reviews on Chinese items, so I said why not?

My take out menu was pretty attractive too and HUGE.  That should&#39;ve been a red flag right there. 168 Chinese items to choose from.  11 Thai dishes.  An abundance of rolls, sashimi and specialty rolls (40 to be exact).  I didn&#39;t try any sushi and reviews were hit or miss. Reviews on Chinese were apparently a huge MISS too.

They delivered to my area so I placed the order and went with &#34;safe&#34; items..

Chicken or pork eggroll?  Pork.  Chicken or Pork dumplings?  I&#39;ll try chicken, what the hell.
Beef fried rice.  One size only...why only 1 size? Combination lo mein (shrimp, chicken, beef) for a friend. Also 1 size only.  I threw in Crab Rangoon at the last minute.  Total: $40.

Delivery took about an hour as promised.  Servings are large.  Lots of filler, little substance in EVERYTHING.   Nothing tasted like the Chinese food I eat.  This place makes my nearby &#34;last resort&#34; look like a Chinese godsend... 

Where are the Chinese flavors?  Oh wait...everything was lacking flavor.  Rice was bland, eggrolls were lame and so were the dumplings.  Crab Rangoon was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. Filling was sweet and consistency was off.  No crab flavor at all.  No visible crab.
This shouldn&#39;t be called Crab anything. It was gross.  Lo mein was FULL of mostly noodles. Tasted a bite - on par with the fried rice, but much more meat (&amp; tender) than lo mein. Noodles were too thick and no veggies included. 0 and extremely bland. No sauce, nothing. 

Worst Chinese I have ever tasted..Sad but true."

The Yelp ordering system is super easy and remembers my last order! Only thing is if you pay online they never seem to know. 

As for food, it is so delicious!!! I love everything I have gotten so far! The variety made me nervous that they would be a jack of all trades (Asian cuisine wise) and master of none but that is definitely not true."

I was literally the only customer. It was noon on a Monday, but come on they have amazing lunch specials here guys! About 10 minutes later another customer came in for lunch. I was also concerned by the vast menu which had Thai, Chinese and Japanese options. But they executed everything well!

Service was super fast and friendly. The waiter offered me a complimentary soup as soon as I picked my table. I ordered a glass of water and a miso soup. The miso soup was very flavorful and has a ton of ingredients (scallion, tofu and seaweed) unlike the plain broth I have grown accustomed to.

I ordered the Pad Si Ewe lunch special for about $8 which came with a friend egg roll. The food came out fast, fresh and piping hot. The dish was sweeter than I am used to, but I really enjoyed it. It was also a huge portion. I didn&#39;t have food to finish the dish let alone try the egg roll!

As I was leaving, the waiter filled my water bottle. I proceeded to forget my water bottle. The waiter came running out to return it to me which was greatly appreciated. I almost went back here again today since it was such a great experience, but I decided I needed to venture out."

So I called and talked to the owner or so she told me she was after telling me that she wasn&#39;t when I asked her than proceeded to tell me that it was a free country and she could tell me whatever she wanted. After telling me the food wouldn&#39;t be good because she had to cook it herself she would be glad to make it so I decided to wait till the next night. She than told me she was the one that took the order over the phone and that she didn&#39;t want to tell me that last night. How can an owner of a restaurant screw up a customers meal so badly. This is one of the worst dining experiences that I have ever received in my life. Don&#39;t make the same mistake that I have.

I ordered here for the first time since going vegetarian thought it would be a good experience for they have tofu and vegetable options, however everything i ordered came with chicken on it... thats not to be taken lightly for someone who hasnt eaten meat in 3 years, also the tofu was poorly put together life disgusting.

Ordered some coconut chicken and it was so nasty I couldn&#39;t even finish a few bites of it. It was almost like they didn&#39;t know how to cook it. Called to tell them, and the lady goes on to tell me all the employees tried it and they said it was good, so it should have been good to me. Smh, I asked for a refund and was told to bring the food back. But it just went in the garbage cause it made my frig smell and I can do one better..... never go back!

Got to my car and noticed they forgot my soup so I ran back inside. The lady apologized a few times and came back with a large soup instead of the small, I didn&#39;t complain and ask for anything extra, they went above and beyond to try and make the situation better.

The service was terrible with the server never coming by after bringing us our food, so my cup remained empty the entire meal.
The sushi I ordered was lukewarm, as if it had been sitting out all day. The kung pow shrimp I ordered was soggy and not spicy at all. The best part of the meal was probably the rice or the water and that&#39;s pretty sad.

I ordered the sister roll with no eel and the wasabi roll, they were good enough don&#39;t get me wrong but were just sort of bland and mushy. The sushi rice was pretty mushy and there wasn&#39;t much flavor which bummed me out because the rolls sounded so good!

The chinese lunch menu is priced all around $7-9 and comes with soup, fried rice, egg roll, and entree. The japanese lunch menu is a bit more expensive but I highly recommend getting the 3 basic rolls lunch (each roll is about 8 each) and it&#39;s 50 cents for a salad.

Here is my order with notes.

1.  Chicken teriyaki spicy roll - first where is the spice?  did it get lost on the car ride over here?  This was just bland in general no taste..  Wasn&#39;t even sure if there was chicken in it. 

2.  Hot volcano roll - I am not even sure what to think of this one..  Again spice  jump out of the car on ride here was supposed to be very hot and spicy.   The whole roll was just a inedible mess..  was that shredded cheese on top of the roll?

3.  Chicken Dumplings - no flavor,  cold the ginger sauce was gross.  everything just inedible

4.  hot and sour soup - I love my hot and sour  soup - not this one.  i am not really sure  what it tastes like but its not hot and sour soup..

All in all this food was so disgusting my garbage can threw it back up at me..  Will not order from again, I do not recommend..  Was  a $25 mistake ( got $4.97 back because I contacted grubhub)  Find somewhere better like tokyo grill in roselle."

+ Mah Po Tofu - Never had it until tonight. It had a nice dose of heat and a tasty sauce. And it&#39;s tofu!!1! Love.

- Salt + Pepper Squid - nice thick strips cooked well - not tough or rubbery. Too bad the batter was hella thick and, by the time we opened the container, soggy. Condensation? We&#39;ll need to reheat our leftovers in an oiled skillet. So, just ok.

+ Beef Chow Fun: yummmmmm!  I&#39;m not even supposed to be eating meat, but this was a worthy  cheat. Too much sauce was my only complaint.

I love that they wrapped everything in care, especially since one chili sauce leaked. Love the stuff, btw, and they included three containers.

= $40 after a $5 coupon. It&#39;ll last for several meals apiece.

I guess the moral of the story is : Stick to the Chinese rice + noodle dishes. Avoid fried seafood unless you&#39;re maybe dining in (so it doesn&#39;t lose its crisp)."

Chicken egg rolls = bland
King Pao chicken = love it

Sweet &amp; Sour chicken = huge disappointment. Overcooked and dry, and no pineapple, pepper, or onion pieces in the sauce like shown on the menu. That&#39;s false advertising! I don&#39;t want a vat of just sauce. I find it ironic they don&#39;t include any peppers or onions yet both are in their Pad Se Ew which is not how it&#39;s traditionally made.

I wouldn&#39;t go back to this place if my life depended on it.

Let me start by saying that my fiancee and I are not picky eaters; we basically eat everything in sight. We have never sent food back or complained about our food for any reason. Until now. MoonSun&#39;s food was literally unacceptable and completely inedible. We ordered from MoonSun on a Tuesday night, and got it delivered to our apartment. We ordered basic food: chicken fried rice, orange chicken (we asked for it extra crispy), crab rangoon, and a few pieces of sushi. Upon opening the food containers, we were already dissatisfied. The orange chicken was soggy, and looked as if it were old/reheated. The chicken fried rice was mushy and some of the chicken pieces in it seemed raw. The crab rangoon appeared that it was frozen. The sushi was the worst; it had a very foul fishy smell (obviously not fresh), and it looked as if someone had consumed rice and fish then vomited it onto a pile of seaweed. The appearance and smell of the food was so unpleasant, and the taste was even worse! Even my dog wouldn&#39;t eat the &#34;food&#34; they delivered to us. We contacted GrubHub (since we had ordered the food through there) and expressed our dissatisfaction. GrubHub put us on hold, and called the restaurant for us to ask for a refund for the &#34;food&#34; they have delivered us. GrubHub told us that the restaurant requested that we return the food in order to get a refund. I decided to call the restaurant directly, so I could explain exactly what was wrong with the food. The woman at SunMoon was very rude; she did not care to listen to my concerns, kept speaking over me, and kept saying that they could not refund us unless we returned the food. She quickly hung up on me. I called back a second time, stated that I would dig the food out of my garbage can to return upon her request, and I would like a full refund. She then went back on her word, and said that since I had thrown the food away, I could not return it. She also said something about how they pay catering costs, so they cannot refund customers because they would be losing money (which means they don&#39;t even make their own food). 

Any respectful business would have provided a refund to a dissatisfied customer without question, especially since the food went uneaten and we agreed to return it to the restaurant to get a refund. Not only did they refuse to do so, they hung up on a customer TWICE, and went back on their word of refunding if the food was returned. 

If you want expensive Chinese take-out consisting of horrible &#34;food,&#34; extremely rude staff, and the worst service you could ask for, this is the place for you.

I will add that we did contact GrubHub a second time to inform them of the phone calls that we had placed to the restaurant. I explained to GrubHub that the restaurant staff would now not allow us to return the food for a refund, and that they hung up on us twice; GrubHub themselves comped us for the meal."

The last times I&#39;ve gotten sushi here, it seemed to be missing the sauce, it wasn&#39;t rolled as nice as before, and the quality of the fish was not so great. I find that sometimes the fish is ok and sometimes it&#39;s not good, but it&#39;s never better than ok.
I tried the Thai when it was new and was pretty unimpressed.
I haven&#39;t been back here in a couple years and probably won&#39;t. #sorrynotsorry"

The owner of this restaurant is very creepy and was watching as my girlfriend and I were eating the whole time. The server was very awkward as well and couldn&#39;t answer my basic questions about the food and got upset when I inquired about different dishes.

Another time I had takeout to give this place a second chance but they didn&#39;t live up my expectations, they forgot one of my sides.

Food was below average, nothing to write home about. Orange chicken was meh, no orange taste what so ever.

they often mix up the noodles (chow, lo, house noodle)"

Our server was completely indifferent; he had absolutely no personality and was incapable of answering basic questions. 

The actual restaurant is adorable and very clean. The food itself was fine...just okay, maybe a little bland. I&#39;m entirely put off by the service though. It might just be a staffing issue. I could see how the lunch hour could be overwhelming for only two people to take on. Whatever."

I guess I just never really had the urge. My fave place is in Lombard.

Anyways, my friend talked me into going here since she had been here before. We sat down, the waitress was friendly and made us feel comfortable. When we arrived, there was one other table but when we left half the place was full! We came and the business followed ;) lol jk!

My friend and I decided to get a small order of fried rice and split it and she also got herself a soup. Honestly, it was the best fried rice I have ever had. Hands down. Normally, fried rice is pretty dry and you add some sweet &amp; sour or something, but not this one. This rice was moist with a lot of flavor. We got the BBQ pork one, YUM.

Next, I ordered the caterpillar roll and a spicy tuna roll. Both were very good and I would definitely come back here again if I have a craving! 

I was disappointed that their all you can eat sushi was not for Friday nights...doesn&#39;t really make sense to me. Wouldn&#39;t that bring you more business on a Friday night?
Eh, whatever. I will get all you can eat somewhere else. 

So overall, I had a really nice experience. I will probably be coming back....but I will DEFINITELY be coming back for that fried rice!"

Went in around 5:30 on a Sunday night. There were four other occupied tables. Service was very slow. My son&#39;s water glass had a huge chip missing on the rim and a crack down the side. When we pointed this out the server apologized and brought a new glass. She asked what we wanted and I told her we would have some rolls as an appetizer and order dinner. She took the sushi order and we waited close to 20 minutes for that to come out. She dropped it on the table and ran. Taste was good but we have had much better. We didn&#39;t see her again for another 20 minutes. I had to ask to place our dinner order. She said sorry, took the order and went off to the other tables refilling drinks and taking orders. Finally my son&#39;s dinner came out, 5 minutes later my husband&#39;s.  Server stopped by and asked me where mine was?  She ran back to the kitchen and then said it would be just a few minutes, again 15 more went by when a guy came out, no apology and put the food down.  Mongolian beef, taste was fine, beef tender, but by now I was VERY unimpressed.  Server comes by 10 minutes later said sorry again and if we wanted anything. I asked for more water and then she says &#34;Anything else? dessert or water?&#34; did she even hear me?  I had to ask for the bill. In my experience if the server has to apologize 3 different times I would expect some sort of discount. When it finally came, full price after being there an hour and a half. Should have asked for the manager but I believe he is the one that brought my dinner. My husband wanted to stiff her, I said no, so we left a 10% tip. So many other great places, will not return."

Things that were good before, were not even close now. We ordered the sweet &amp; sour chicken and it was pretty much all breading with hardly any chicken on the inside, other chinese dishes were changed &amp; not HALF as good as they used to be. We actully threw things out &amp; just said that&#39;s the last time we&#39;d order there, but still tried ordering several times after &amp; it&#39;s been the same thing, so we just stopped going.

It&#39;s a shame something changed, maybe the cook, who knows...also the owner is very awkward &amp; not customer service oriented whatsoever.

And man! this is place one of the biggest shams out there. Let&#39;s start with their labor law infractions. They have a small but loyal base of customers who tip very well. And under normal circumstances a server could make a decent living wage here. These customers have the perception that they are tipping their waitress who have served them their entire meal. Cause waitresses work for tips right? Not at this place! In order to defraud the IRS and avoid paying taxes they hire people under the table, paying them a straight daily fee (in cash) and take ALL, (yes I said ALL) their tips! They work their servers 11 hr shifts paying them min wage then take ALL their tips. Servers are forced to put all cash tips in a bin which they keep at the end of the day and all credit card tips are kept as well. 

   Why would a server agree to this? Cause they initially lie to you in the interview. I was told that I would be making MORE money because their business was so slow and normally the tips only come out to $50-70 for the whole day. So when they offer 100 for the whole day you think that&#39;s pretty good. Until you start doing the math and seeing how well the customers actually do tip. And calculate the amount of hours you are on your feet. 11 hrs every single day. In the state of IL the law states that a server must be paid the min wage of $8.25 per hr PLUS tips. They only pay the min wage then take all of our tips. 

    And let&#39;s talk about the overtime infringement. America has put labor laws in place so that workers cannot be taken advantage of. The overtime laws that state a person cannot work more than 40 hrs in one week without getting paid time and a half over 40 hrs. Servers there work 60 hr weeks with NO overtime pay. All the customers who are tipping their servers for a job well done have NO CLUE that their money IS NOT going to their waitress. And if they did know I think there would be an uproar about it. Which is why I am writing this review. 

   This restaurant is also defrauding the IRS and US Government. They are trying to get around the laws by paying people under the table in CASH then taking advantage of them by forcing them to work 60 hr weeks then taking their hard earned money! 

    Another thing the regular customers don&#39;t know i that one of their tactics to keep customers coming back is to pretend that they are their best friends. So Jay the owner puts on his fake face and pretends to get involved in everyones life and asks them questions about their kids and family and work trying to make them feel like part of the sushi family so they keep returning and spending more money. But as soon as they walk out the door he forgets who they are and talks shit about the customers behind their backs. Nice guy eh? They are lying to their customers, stealing from their employees and stealing from the US Government. 

  I was let go after refusing to go along with their illegal and unethical business practices. I did not accept that I could not keep my own tips that I was busting my ass for and this pissed them off. I invited a group of 7 people to the restaurant who were my friends. They all wanted to tip ME and not the restaurant cause it was ME who gave them great service and not the restaurant. I let Jay know that my friends wanted me to keep my tip. So what did he say, &#34;OK let me know how much it was and I will deduct it from your pay.&#34; WHAT?! SO I bring business to your restaurant and its MY friends and I still can&#39;t keep the tip?!?! The next morning after this happened I was let go from my position. They fired me because I wanted to keep my tips! This is SO wrong and illegal on so many levels! 

   I hope this review gets seen by the many loyal customers of Moonsun Sushi and they see what kind of place they have been giving their money to. I gave them two stars because their food is actually quite good. But the extremely unethical and illegal business practices over shadow any of the great food they have."

My boyfriend and I order from here at least once a week and we are never disappointed. We dine-in, carry out, and deliver. Either way Moonsun pleases. 

The couple who owns the place is hardworking and friendly. The female owner knows how to prepare sushi. 

I&#39;d recommend starting out with a sashimi or salmon salad. The salmon is ALWAYS delicious. The baked mussels are an amazing sinful experience. You MUST try them. I also love their veggie tempura.

If you&#39;re feeling special sushi rolls I&#39;d recommend the Mexico Roll, Sister Roll, Country Dragon, Volcano Roll, Wasabi Roll. Let&#39;s be honest..I&#39;ve enjoyed all the rolls we&#39;ve tried and it&#39;s been too many to recall.

Their regular sushi rolls are just as delicious too. I highly recommend the bbq pork roll and making any of the rolls spicy is an added bonus.

If you&#39;re looking for delicious, non-greasy, good-proportioned fried rice, this is your place!

By the way, I read other reviews that said that someone got sick after eating here.  Like I said, we eat Moonsun at least once a week and I have NEVER gotten sick.  We often order different items off the menu so I&#39;m wary about other reviews that say that people have gotten sick after eating here.

He wasn&#39;t slow, but he wasn&#39;t attentive either.     I&#39;d call his service mediocre and unentertaining.

  I ordered a few rolls (a dragon roll, California roll, and spider roll).   My buddy ordered the teriyaki salmon lunch special.      The miso soup came out and it was quite delicious.   I&#39;d like to give you a review on the salad, but I despise ginger dressing so I took a pass on it.  My buddy seemed to enjoy his, though.     When my rolls came out, they looked tasty and looks were QUITE ACCURATE.   They were delicious.     Very, very enjoyable.    I&#39;m told the Teriyaki salmon was good too.

   Overall, I&#39;d go again based on the food.    Not always easy to find good sushi, but this was pretty tasty.    The service wasn&#39;t terrible --- it was just............uninterested......which pulls down there rating for me a bit.    

Lurch and Sushinator ----- add a little personality and you got yourselves a pretty nice place."

I think we waited over 20 mins just for water and then the server kept disappearing.  The food was okay, but the service just ruined the evening.  He just didn&#39;t seem like he wanted us to eat there even though there were only 2 tables in the restaurant.

My bf wanted sushi and I don&#39;t touch seafood so this was a nice place to go that had both options.

This was my first visit but it appeared to be newly redecorated with nice wood floors and modern decor throughout. There was only one other party dining in at the time so we were told that we could sit anywhere we&#39;d like. 

I ordered the garlic chicken and a side of veggie fried rice. I asked if I could substitute the steamed rice for fried rice and was told that the dish only comes with steamed rice. My bf got a variety of rolls. 

The turn around time for the food was super quick which was great since we were starving. My dish had an abundant amount of full veggies such as mushrooms and broccoli. I hate when I order Chinese food and there are only slivers of mushrooms...this dish didn&#39;t disappoint. The fried rice was also very tasty and again, had some nice mushroom chunks. I am pretty picky with fried rice but this one definitely made the &#34;I will definitely try again&#34; list. My bf also said that his sushi was delicious and he feels quite fine (some other review mentioned getting ill the next day). 

My only issue was my dish had a ton of oil/grease that was settling on the bottom of the plate. At first it was OK but I&#39;d prefer to not have a pool of grease and oil. Oh, and I also got my dish spicy...holy hell was it spicy! Be prepared if you do get your dish spiced up.

Oh, and bonus...they are open on Mondays!"

First, the awkward Caucasian man who i am assuming is the owner of the place is by far the most awkward person I have ever met. He makes your whole experience very very weird.

Second, the sushi was horrid. After frequenting high quality places like orchid---this place does not even come close. Why so many reviews rave about the great sushi is beyond me. The fish tasted disgusting. We even ordered different types of sushi to be sure.

Third, there are better places nearby that will probably go out of business---yet this place is somehow still in it? Horrible. Ill bring my business elsewhere so good quality sushi restaurants can still make it."

Moonsun is somewhat off the beaten path and hidden in a tucked away strip mall off of Army Trail Road. I don&#39;t come here often, but it makes a great midway meeting place for me and a few of my friends. Anytime I&#39;ve eaten here, I haven&#39;t been disappointed. It&#39;s not going to blow you out of the water, but overall, it&#39;s fairly good.

The customer service has always been friendly. Yes, somewhat awkward as mentioned is some previous reviews, but friendly nonetheless. The food is prepared fairly quickly and I&#39;ve found that the waiter is always attentive. 

As for the food, sometimes I go with sushi and other times I go for sesame chicken or mongolian beef. I like both of them. I also really like that you can order a small or a large portion, depending on how hungry you are, or if you&#39;re sharing dishes. As for the sushi, I&#39;m a non-seafood girl, so I always go for the veggie tempura roll. I&#39;m also a big appetizer girl, so I will usually order either a gomae salad, gyoza, or spring rolls. 

Moonsun Sushi also delivers which is a bonus. However, sometimes when I order for delivery, I&#39;m in their delivery area, while other times they will tell me I&#39;m not. I kind of think that&#39;s crappy, but whatever. If I have the itch for Moonsun, I&#39;ll just drive over and dine it or carryout."

I had rolls - spicy tuna, mackerel, and eel, along with some surf clam.  I figured that it would be a pretty good variety, and I was pleasantly surprised by the mackerel, which was firm without being rubbery, which I&#39;ve encountered more than once.  The rolls were all very good.

My wife had the egg drop soup &amp; chicken fried rice.   The soup was very good, and the rice, in addition to being a 3 meal portion for her, was also delicious.

they must&#39;ve not liked us today. the sushi was way too soggy. the rice was watery, mushy, and sticky. I don&#39;t know if they gave us old sushi or what. I&#39;m not sure if it was fresh or not. The eel roll would have been great if it wasn&#39;t for that damn soggy rice. It killed it for me. I couldn&#39;t even eat it. I ended up spitting it out :(
This place was not poppin&#39; nobody was in at 2:30. I know that normal sushi places close at 2 and reopen for dinner at 5, but I was guessing since this was a chinese restaurant as well that they kept it open all day.
I was so upset that the sushi wasn&#39;t good at all. The shrimp tempura was soft as if it was old as well. I was thinking &#34;that&#39;s what I get for trying to get a deal on sushi&#34;. I sure paid the price of that... When me and my friend came in to eat another couple did as well and then they ended up walking out 5 minutes into being seated.

It is a bit pricey unfortunately, but once in awhile a great treat! 
I have never eaten there yet, but they have a cozy atmosphere that you can eat in or carry out. I usually go in and order out, the staff is very nice offerring water or something to drink while waiting, but they do get the orders ready quickly.

Well they seem to have changed their Crab Rangoon recipe where the crab is now non-existent. Also since prices are high on the cream cheese they stopped serving them for free. I&#39;d have to say I have had better crab rangoon though (theirs comes in around third place). The best I have ever had (and i am a crab rangoon whore) is at Wing Ho at 5356 N Sheridan Rd, Chicago, IL

Their pizza is top notch- everything from thin crust pizza to their baked pasta dishes. Our favorite right now is the pan pizza because it&#39;s basically the best of both worlds between the thin crust and deep dish. Doesn&#39;t overload you with cheese but you get the thicker delicious crust that goes with it.

The crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings were spot on with the right balance. This was one of the best Chicago thin crust pizza I had in quite a long time. I&#39;ve worked in pizzerias, I owned a pizzeria, and I have eaten countless pizzas in my time and this place does it right.

As soon as I saw the deep dish Caramelized &#39;burnt&#39; cheese crust (along with Iraim S.&#39;s check-in) my mouth was salivating in anticipation of this pizza....could it be as good as it looks?  Isn&#39;t that always the burning question...

But it didn&#39;t stop there.  My friends were determined to have thin crust.  So we ordered one of each.  Then another wanted a roast beef sandwich, while a few craved wings.  You can dine in, but it is on the smaller side.  We placed our order to go..

Is it wrong for me to admit that while the deep dish was better than most I&#39;ve tried, I couldn&#39;t help but want more of the thin crust with half sausage, half mushroom, pepper &amp; onion?  I don&#39;t touch onion on pizza, so sausage side it was....I felt like I was cheating on my deep dish, but I couldn&#39;t help it.  The crust was so darn good.  Thinner than Giordano&#39;s, but excellent texture and bite.  I just wanted more.  Sauce was light, with just the right amount of flavor. Nothing was excessive, including the cheese.  It all melded so nicely...

Deep dish wasn&#39;t shabby by any means, it just wasn&#39;t as craveable as the thin.  The caramelized cheese was impressive and different...but a little too burnt for my taste which also made some parts harder on the chew factor.  Dough was pillowy soft and tender without feeling like a brick of glutton in your belly.  I liked that it wasn&#39;t starchy or heavy.
Again, loved the fresh sauce along with the fresh mushrooms and spinach...

I took a bite out of the beef and it was good..tender.  HUGE sandwich and super stuffed inside the softest roll ever.  It just needed some juice, cause it lacked any pizazz which is a disservice to this fine homemade roast beef...surprised they didn&#39;t add juice on the side..give it a go.
Lemon Herb &amp; BBQ wings were good as well. Decent quality, nice flavor and average size.

While I came here for the legendary burnt cheese crust, I&#39;d return for the thin - it was that yummy.  Not that I&#39;d turn away a slice of deep dish, and if your a fan of deep dish, I highly recommend giving this a try. They&#39;ve got some killer pizza here including: double dough, pan, stuffed and the PICASSO (two layers of thin crust with mozz in between, and topped with more cheese)..its like a pizza sandwich!   Specialty pizzas are offered as well as gluten free.

Menu is huge with subs, sandwiches, lots of app&#39;s, salads, dinners and pastas..
Thin crust rocks!"

Another trip to Chicago, and I have found another pizza place I love!!!! I think this is the best pizza I&#39;ve had in Chicago thus far. We ordered a 14&#34; deep dish, which I think 12 would have sufficed....I customized the pizza with fresh garlic, green peppers, onions, pepperoni, sausage, and the caramelized cheese crust. 

The first bite to me was pizza heaven. I was blown away from the bursting flavor of the robust sauce, to the caramelized cheesy crust. Every bite was different. Sometimes you just get the cheesy flavor, and other times, you bite into these flavorful pockets of garlic. 

I have to say I&#39;ll order this pizza again and again!! Thank you, Tortorice, for making my pizza experience a memorable one, and something to add to my go-to restaurant choices!!!! The only slight disappointment, was the fact that they offered all of the pizza toppings except, salami!!! Please get salami for your store!!!

If you haven&#39;t tried Tortorice&#39;s you need to drop everything you&#39;re doing and go and get this pizza, NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!"

It is two layers of thin crust with ooey, gooey cheese stuffed in the middle. Then, more cheese, sauce, toppings, and more cheese! It is truly a delicious creation! 

At tortorice&#39;s, they never skimp on the toppings or cheese! You truly get your money&#39;s worth here! The pizza is baked to perfection and delivered piping hot. Don&#39;t believe me? When the driver hands you the box, it&#39;s a good five pounds of deliciousness! 

The small size will easily feed two people with leftovers the next day! Delivery is always quick and the pie is always piping hot!

The most common complaint on yelp is their timing. I had a pick up order and the fella told me 35 minutes for a stuffed pizza. I showed up about 5 minutes earlier than I needed to, and the kid told me it should be 5 minutes more. Perfect. Unfortunately, 20 minutes later I was still sitting there. 

This pizza was heavy. Such a good sign. I got in the car and drove back to my buddies place and opened up this masterpiece. I haven&#39;t had a good stuffed pizza since Superossa. And this pizza was comparable. Heavy on the cheese, sauce, and toppings. They don&#39;t mess around with the garlic. Fresh chunks. Loved it. Sausage was also on point. Next time I am going to go with a deep dish with the burnt crust. Theses guys seem to be picking up on what people like from the top pizza places. The burnt crust is Burt&#39;s Place thing and that place is the utopia of pizza. I&#39;m hoping Tortorice&#39;s comes close. Based on the stuffed, I am not worried.

Only small complaint. I asked the kid on the phone if we should order a medium for 2 people. He said yea. Their medium is the 3rd smallest size. Needless to say we had leftovers. I think the smallest would have been fine for 2, or the 2nd smallest even.."

But its the Pie that makes this place a winner. Taste is wonderful and you can tell the ingredients aren&#39;t cheap. Even the box has their logo unlike all those cheap pizza joints I&#39;ve been to in the past.

Instead of blaming flour dust in the air and the private conversation excuse of how great you have been for the years of a business prior to your inheritance, maybe just take a moment and realize.... You would have a goldmine for us glutards if you and the staff cared or payed attention.  I gave you an avenue to make it better, instead you gave bland justifications and excuses. We are in Mount Prospect..... We all know, we talk.  Be kind and rewind your thoughts/ emotions.... You buy frozen gluten free crusts.  All you need to do is open a bag of fresh cheese or take your portioned out ingredients from the fridge prior. 




Tortorice&#39;s populates when you search for &#34;Gluten Free.&#34; True celiac&#39;s be afraid, be very afraid.  We live in Mt. P, ordering religiously almost on a weekly basis, for four years.  That is until, the give a damn got busted on their part.  

After moving to Chicago four years ago, I was thrilled to find a local pizza place that delivered and offered a gluten free crust.  Our orders ranged from every variety of every kind of deep dish, tacos, sandwiches, Italian beef, and cheese fries for my fiancé, and for me, a gluten free pizza and a salad.  At some point the concept of cross contamination went out the window.  I got sick... really sick... However, I loved the pizza and ordered again, hoping for the best.  I even asked if it were possible to open a fresh bag of cheese and not use floured hands or utensils to prep the crust that comes frozen on its own aluminum pan.  I UNDERSTAND THERE IS FLOUR EVERYWHERE.  I had had this pizza for three years prior with no problems. The pizza arrived burnt, very burnt, embarrassingly burnt.  I felt like it was revenge for being a &#34;special order.&#34; We had company over for dinner, so I ate the burnt pizza, and got sick again.  I stopped ordering their pizza, and order from dominos or moretti&#39;s if I have the craving, as neither of their pizzas have never made me sick.  

I miss tortorice&#39;s and wish someone there gave a damn. I have even tried to continue to order pizza for our guests and my partner, as it is good pizza.  But get this.... The Last order I placed along with the &#34;floured order,&#34; I asked if I could order an over priced salad without any ham, and perhaps substitute a little more turkey or something instead, along with a steak &#34;sandwich&#34; with no bread of course, for myself. Since I can&#39;t eat their pizza any longer, I thought maybe this was my avenue back into their world...and I was flat out told NO, NO substitutions.  Not even an offer to up charge me for the price difference. So I didn&#39;t order anything.  Sad!  Y&#39;all had a good thing going, and if you were smart you would educate yourselves and your staff and expand your menu to accommodate. You could be the gluten free stand out, out here in Mt. P. . Think about it."

I can&#39;t have dairy, so I tried the BBQ chicken...or at least that&#39;s what it was supposed to be. 

It was a few pieces of bone-in chicken that seemed to be boiled. There was no BBQ sauce, but the chicken was neon PINK. Not undercooked, but hot pink from something. It had no flavor. The skin was slimy. I wish I had taken a picture! I&#39;ve never seen chicken like that before. The people with me were extremely grossed out by it as well. 

The fries were placed inside the styrofoam container with that steamy, slimy chicken, so they had turned all soft and mushy. 

Overall, extremely disappointing. This place needs to stick to pizza only and not even attempt dishes like this if they can&#39;t make them taste at least decent."

It was heavy with cheese with a chunky sweet sauce on top. The crust isn&#39;t too thick and is more flaky and buttery than doughy. Nice ratios of toppings to crust and sauce. It was cooked perfectly. 

I couldn&#39;t eat this deep dish pizza often because of the extreme caloric guilt I&#39;d suffer as a result, but considering that I don&#39;t live in the same state as Tortorice&#39;s, that won&#39;t be a problem."

I can&#39;t describe how unbelievably delicious Tortorice&#39;s Pizza is, was and always will be.  We were in heaven eating the BPITW (Best Pizza in the World).  Hope someday they open a pizza shop in Georgetown TX. so we can once again enjoy their terrific pizza every week.

Last night I was told 30-35 mins, I got there at the 30 minute mark and was told it was 6 mins from being completed. 32 minutes later I walked out with my order.

When you order food and they give you an estimate of when your food will be ready for pick up, double it. Typically a 20 minute wait turns into 45...

Once again, the food wasn&#39;t ready when we got there, waited in line 10 minutes (you can tell everyone in there picking up food is annoyed!), and then waited another 10 minutes for our food to finally be ready. Very frustrating.

Their pizza is consistently very good, but it&#39;s too much of a hassle to deal with the people that work there. Maybe delivery would be a better option? Or just order from Crave down the street..."

Everything I&#39;ve eaten there has been exceptional. I can only recall one time I received an order where it wasn&#39;t exactly what i wanted but it was just a matter of removing tomatoes and it was fine. That said, Their deep dish spinach is probably my favorite pizza. Right next in line would be their Picasso.  When it comes to the rest of the menu, I typically get their Deluxe Turkey Sub , toasted, no tomato. It has never let me down. It&#39;s nothing out of this world or fancy but it&#39;s definitely fresh and never &#34;wtf am I eating right now.&#34; Aside from that, I also get their Chicken fingers which again, no complaints, crispy and tasty. Their fries are always fresh, as are their fried mushrooms and onion rings. All at least an 8 out of 10 for satisfactory eating. Again this isn&#39;t a fancy place, it&#39;s a pizza joint.. no frills. 

Service when you walk in or pick up can be a little Mehhh. They seem to hang out in the back and if they&#39;re in the kitchen there seems to be no way of them knowing there are people in side.. but they come back after a minute or two, other than that which isn&#39;t even a complaint really, everything is fine. Oh and delivery. I&#39;ve never experienced a long wait for delivery. the max i think i&#39;ve ever waited was 1 hour. and that&#39;s if i order a lot of things. Typically my food arrives within 45 minutes. also..don&#39;t order shrimp from a pizza joint! COME ON! LOL"

I ordered their double dough pizza with 3 toppings and the jumbo shrimp appetizer. Neither was good. When a pizza is properly prepared and cooked the upper layer of cheese does not get totally separated from the bottom. That&#39;s what happened here. I was left with slices that were mainly just dough and disconnected cheese. They were skimpy with the toppings.

The shrimp tasted like it was frozen and heated up. If this is what I wanted I would not have ordered from a restaurant. One expects and should receive better. I probably could have done better myself by purchasing  a good brand of frozen shrimp at the grocery store.

The only reason why I don&#39;t give it 1 star is the delivery was prompt and the food was at least warm."

I tried to order online, but for whatever reason it wouldn&#39;t let me choose the pickup option.  I didn&#39;t want it delivered.  So I decided to call them and the girl that picked up was very friendly.  They had it ready in 30 minutes. When I went to pick it up the girl was friendly with the customer in front of me as well as myself. The pizza itself was very delicious! It&#39;s quite cheesy if you like your pizza that way. The 16 inch pizza is a decent size for about $17.00 I picked up one of their menus when I went and I noticed they have desserts as well. I would definitely go back if I was craving pizza."

Deep dish has a buttery crust like Lou&#39;s but they are so inconsistent lately. As for their other food and apps, just stick to pizza. I made the permanent switch to Morettis pizza I think. Pizza is always the same every time. Good and hot. Sorry tortorices you lost me"

My boyfriend and I order from here every few weeks and I haven&#39;t been disappointed yet.The chicken Alfredo is delicious. The grilled chicken has wonderful flavor and the pasta has a perfect amount of sauce, serving is large too. They lay the toppings on thick for the pizza which is awesome. I am not a meat fan so I only get veggie pizza, only bad thing I have to say about it is the onions are a bit strong. The cheese is very flavorful and sauce is sweet and delicious. I have ordered the eggplant parmigiana once and it was too saucy for me so therefore I wasn&#39;t a fan. We also order the jumbo bar-b-q wings which are also very good. 

2 minor complaints...

It&#39;s as if the pizza isn&#39;t left in a hot box after its made and waiting for you to pick it up. The box is never warm when we get to the restaurant and pizza is not hot. Not sure if this is really the case or not. 

2nd complaint is I am assuming the Tiramisu is all store bought or made in a big batch and then stored because when we ordered it, it was frozen which was a big turnoff. 

Other than those 2 complaints this place has really good food."

The current cooks make a thin crust that is extremely tough and brittle and tasteless, and severely undersauced. The pan version is sometimes under baked and very bread doughy. They are not generous with ingredients unless you ask, and then they charge more. Don&#39;t have it delivered; delivery fee too high. Pick up instead . Don&#39;t forget to save your coupons.  If they tell you it&#39;ll be ready in 30 minutes, be prepared to wait --they&#39;re always a little behind .  Overall not the worst pizza ever but not nearly as good as it used to be !"

I moved further away, yet still go back even after trying multiple other pizza places. This is honestly my favorite pizza place to order from, and until that changes, I&#39;ll keep coming back.

Side note, I do pickup now, but I used to do delivery. When I did, they took a bit longer than usual, but nothing terrible (around an hour). Only once did they mess up the order, forgetting my pepsi, but the delivery guy went back and got it for me which was great of him."

This place was open until midnight (most others closed at 11) and they were actually pretty busy for 11:30 on a Monday night. The employee who took our order was super nice, which I appreciated because most ppl would be annoyed by us showing up so close to closing time. We ordered pizza that was to serve 2 people. It was sausage &amp; pepperoni and it was AMAZING!! Our only sad point was that the pizza was too large for us and we couldn&#39;t finish it.

Pizza was great too, the thin crust was light and provided a nice backdrop for the ingredients.

Their slices used to come in styro foam, and part of the fun was you never knew how big your slice would be, especially late on a Friday when the staff (and most of the customers) had had a couple.  Now it comes in a cardboard box which limits the size of the slice.  

Still I cannot say a bad word about this place.  Although Dondi&#39;s is undoubtedly better, &#34;Tor&#34; as its affectionately, called keeps it real.  The staff could not be any friendlier, and the double dough slices, my favorite is sausage and gardenia, are the best in the NW burbs.

It&#39;s been years since I have been to a Potbelly, literally maybe 10 years. No particular reason why, I think there wasn&#39;t one near me so I didn&#39;t go.  Today I remember why I loved going to this place. This is my favorite sandwich shop once again.

Chicken Salad Sandwich - My favorite to date, this is what I used to order all the time. It&#39;s currently white meat (I think it used to be dark).  Great filling with my choice of toppings. I got the multi-grain bread which was fluffy on the inside, not mushy, and on the outside it was crusty but not hard. Perfect combination of textures.  

Frozen Raspberry Lemonade - Think Raspberry Lemonade Sorbet but more solid. It was just the right amount of sweet to tart, think 60% sweet 40% tart. This made my day. I also was reminded that they put those little butter cookies that you feed little kids on the straw. What a throw back! Oh the great memories are flooding in.

Service was so nice, everyone was friendly and accommodating. So glad I went again.

Today at lunch they had some random guy playing a guitar and singing. It was ok, though it kinda made conversation a bit more distracting than I would have liked."

Bad: Being ignored by 90% of the staff during my experience. 

Worse: The person in the middle placing bacon precariously tipped while telling her coworker a sandwich was screwed up, but when asked, confirmed the bread was fine so just send more meat through... 
No, that is not the Potbelly way. You remake the whole sandwich. 

Worst: Watching the brown haired 19 year old girl go from her bare hand in an oven mitt and touching counter tops to just grabbing a glove to dress my sandwich. That&#39;s a health code violation, and gross."

The Big is split into two halves, so you can eat one and save the other for later.... or just eat &#39;em both right away. It&#39;s a little bit smaller than a Subway footlong but much more delicious and better quality.

Their sandwiches keep you FULL. My favorite so far is the Turkey Big on multi-grain thin-cut bread loaded with veggies and, sometimes, cheese. It&#39;ll run you about $6.50 after tax, which I think is completely fair (even a bargain), considering Subway hiked their prices a few months ago, and I don&#39;t think you can get a footlong for less than that anymore.

The drive-thru here is killer -- avoid it at all costs. My friends have taken me through it a couple times, and it was always painstakingly slow and resulted in incorrect orders. It&#39;s completely worth battling through any ounce of laziness you&#39;re feeling to make sure your food is correct. &#34;Hangry&#34; is my least favorite emotion; discovering my food is wrong when I&#39;m about to eat it, most likely miles from Potbelly...

I usually go for the tuna and add avocado, if I&#39;ve already eaten my monthly red meat allowance. It&#39;s a yummy sandwich!  They have the best giardinara (hot peppers). I buy a jar for home. Tip: order your sandwich with the hot peppers on the side. They can be overwhelmingly spicy if you order them right on the sandwich. 

If u want to indulge, get the sugar cookie- it will not disappoint.

My coworkers and I checked it out for lunch yesterday and it seems the word has spread very quickly of it&#39;s opening as it was packed to the brim!

Most of the workers at this location are awesome! I especially liked the super friendly bearded guy who greets patrons and takes their initial orders in line. Some workers were a bit aloof but it was super busy and I get it.

The line got extremely long while we were dining and at one point, I saw a group of 5 guys walk out due to the wait. They must not know about their promise of &#34;8 minutes through the line MAX&#34;. 

Potbelly&#39;s food is always yummy and I love that they have some sandwich options under 350 calories which doesn&#39;t make me feel horrible &amp; gross for eating out. Yesterday I had their mushroom melt skinny for 348 calories which hit the spot. Also love their ham &amp; cheese skinny. Potbelly&#39;s has some of the best friggin shakes and I ended up bringing one back to a coworker. 

I love that Potbelly&#39;s has live music while dining. Nothing gets me quite like a man playing acoustic on his guitar (cue: More Than Words). 

This location needs more tables though! For the amount of people coming through here, there simply are not enough tables and there is space to add some. Plus, all tables are up to 4 people max with just one table that seats 8 people. My lunch crew is 5-8 people on any given day and we had to sit in two separate tables yesterday due to no other seating. Sad.

Probably the best thing about this location is the drive thru! With it being right on my way home from work, I&#39;m sure this will prove to be quite detrimental to me! Hurrah to Potbelly&#39;s opening in Schaumburg!"

My friend and I split a Large A-Wreck with everything on it, along with a huge pickle (only $1) and an Oreo shake.  

The a-wreck:  SO GOOD!  the bread was amazing.  Crunchy, yet soft on the inside.  The contents all really good.  The hot mustard is pretty spicy so if you are a hot sauce noob, maybe skip it.  

The pickle, only $1 and it is seriously huge.  Crisp, &amp; refreshing... makes for a good healthy side option vs chips.

Oreo shake was awesome as well.  Comes with mini oreo cookies on top of the cup lid.

Monday Potbelly offered a sandwich, chips and drink for $5 and the proceeds went to help District 54 schools (Schaumburg). All of Potbelly&#39;s new crew seemed to be there. It was a fantastically smooth opening and everyone was cheerful and helpful. 

I had my usual favorite The Wreck with mayo and Italian season. Significant other 1 had the turkey and swiss and 3 year old ending up eating half my Wreck and the BBQ chips. What was really cool was the guy further in line taking orders with his iPad. I love when technology gets speeds up the dinner rush. This rocked.

Sandwiches were great, service was great and there was even a guy running around handing out cookie samples which the 3 year old loved.

I&#39;d been waiting to write this review, first because I love Potbelly&#39;s...seriously  love them, and second because I have never had a bad experience at any other location and was hoping the Schaumburg location would turn things around before I wrote this.

We&#39;ve been here almost weekly since they opened. I honestly don&#39;t know why.  I am not a glutton for punishment or crappy service or for paying for the wrong food, yet, I continue to visit. Maybe, again, because I keep hoping &#34;this&#34; time, they&#39;ll get it right.

Well, they got it wrong yet again this weekend and I&#39;m a little more than irritated now.

In the last 6 visits here throughout the last 4-6 weeks, they have gotten it wrong 6 times.  Usually it&#39;s because they never get the mushroom melt skinny right - extra mushroom.  It seems pretty simple (I worked food service for over 5 years throughout HS and college, hence my opinion on simple).  Put EXTRA mushrooms on top of the usual portion you dole out.  Yet, I keep paying extra for the SAME amount of regular-portion mushrooms every time.  But sometimes it&#39;s not just the mushroom melt...I&#39;ve also received a completely different sandwich from what I ordered (i.e., my skinny hammie on regular bread was replaced with a TKY skinny on mult-grain...too bad I was on the way to the airport before I could do anything about it).

We emailed them after the 4th time, and received a wonderfully apologetic, handwritten card in the mail, along with 2 vouchers for free sandwiches.  How great is that?  Well, it would be great, if then, the next two times when we used the vouchers, they wouldn&#39;t repeat the same exact mistake which got us the vouchers in the first place.  But, yes, sure enough the next two extra mushroom skinnys did not have extra mushroom, and the last one ordered Saturday, seemed to have not even the normal amount of mushroom.

I should also mention that we always use the drivethrough. Perhaps it&#39;d be a different experience to actually come in and order and watch them make the sandwich, but our orders are usually for lunchtime when we&#39;re in a hurry...which leads me to the next issue -

Why am I always in line for more than 10 minutes in the drivethrough, even when I&#39;m the only one there?  If you have a drivethrough - shouldn&#39;t service be expedited a bit...or at least the expectation be that it&#39;s quicker service?  Or am I missing something?  Should I anticipate at least a 10-15 minute wait even in the drivethrough?

Because last Saturday, when I received the less-than-the-normal-amount of mushroom in my &#39;extra-mushroom-mushroom-melt&#39; order, I was the ONLY person in line, yet I waited with my car idling at the drivethrough counter just waiting and waiting for more than 10 minutes.  Even the drivethrough cashier was irritated.  I heard her ask about my one-sandwich order a few times, and then saw her walk over to check on it herself.  When it was finally ready, she apologized sincerely (having noted I was paying with a &#34;you-screwed-up-my-order-voucher&#34;) and I appreciated her apology for the wait.  I did not appreciate that my order was wrong...again.

Btw - I like to think I&#39;m not only the only one experiencing issues.  The time before this, last week, the car in front of me was also paying with the &#34;you-screwed-up-my-order-voucher&#34;...I saw her hand it over (because we were stuck in the drivethrough for an eternity again...and I was blaming her for the wait wondering what the heck she ordered, but I&#39;m prone to believe it&#39;s the Potbelly&#39;s Schaumburg service now).

Potbelly&#39;s in Schaumburg was like a dream since it&#39;s like a location in our backyard...add to that the drivethrough option and we just couldn&#39;t wait for it to open.  Now it&#39;s more of a bad dream.

Still, can&#39;t give a Potbelly&#39;s a one-star, so I&#39;ll give them 2, and hope that if I do make my way back here, they&#39;ll get it right sometime.  Our kids are in SD54 schools and Potbelly&#39;s Schaumburg helped fundraise for SD54 activities when they first opened.  I was hoping to give them a lot more business because I appreciate them giving back to the community.

But honestly, it&#39;s a tad ridiculous that they just can&#39;t seem to get it right - at least for us.  It&#39;s a chain/franchise restaurant, and one that we frequent (usually in Rolling Meadows or in Chicago-University Village, without issue).  Hope they can turn it around, but I won&#39;t likely be visiting Schaumburg&#39;s again anytime soon."

One of my co-workers came across their &#34;secret&#34; menu on the internet a week or two ago, so I have been dying to try something that isn&#39;t on their regular menu. I am a fan of heat so I went with the Fireball. A meatball sandwich with chili and hot peppers. I also added some onions and tomato. I have to say that the sandwich was really amazing. It was spicy for sure (I will pay for it later on!) but it really was the combo of the meatball and chili - topped with cheddar cheese that made the sandwich so delicious. I would highly recommend this off-item selection for anybody that enjoys the Potbelly&#39;s sandwich, but wants to add a little spice to their otherwise normal lunch."

I came in and there was no one in line, waited literally 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge that I existed and when someone did finally greet me there was no hello hi how are you? Just what can I get you? Someone else then asked me what I wanted on my sandwich and I told her and asked for extra pickle she said ya and then went on to help the drive thru.. Rolling her eyes like she could care less Literally waiting for her for another 5 minutes to finish my order so I could get back to work and another girl came over and finished my sandwich when I got to the counter no one was there to ring me up and the girls were making other sandwiches for people that walked in. A guy then came over and said what did you have? Like this is sooooo annoying to tell them 3 times what I&#39;m having today.. Isn&#39;t this their job to know what is going on? What each customers sandwich is? He then told me the total while looking at his phone.. He could really care less about his job! So rude and didn&#39;t even thank me when I left! Said nothing!?!? And my sandwich didn&#39;t have extra pickle. If these people hate their job so bad why do they work here!? I will be speaking to the manager to about this! Every time I come in same thing happens I&#39;m sick of leaving feeling like they don&#39;t appreciate my business their piss poor attitude rubs of on people.

I have to say that this location is a little aggravating. I work in an office right around the corner and we usually order lunch 2 people at a time because we have to stagger our lunch breaks. I think it stinks that they are located in the middle of a business park and won&#39;t deliver for orders under $25. I guess we&#39;ll stick to Jimmy johns. They would bring me 1 bag of chips if that&#39;s all I ordered. I guess Potbelly&#39;s doesn&#39;t really want to reach for that extra business. I am in control for all the catering for luncheons we do for 20 people at a time once a week off site and if Potbelly&#39;s can&#39;t bring me a sandwich in a pinch then I won&#39;t rely on them for anything else.

They don&#39;t have a couple things on their menu that I like, but are on menu&#39;s at other Potbelly&#39;s.  I will agree with a couple other reviews, this locations seems to be less generous with the meat portions than I have been used too.  I went last night, and the service was slow.  Our sandwiches were cold by the time we got them, as there was no one assigned to the &#34;condiment area&#34; meaning we waited.  And waited.  And waited until someone decided to come help.  Sandwiches were cold, and the cheese that had melted during heating had by then un-melted, so not tasty any longer.  Not sure what they do to the &#34;grilled chicken breast&#34;, but it was inedible to me, so I ended up taking it off.  This was about my fourth visit to this location, and service is generally slower than other Potbelly&#39;s.  As time goes on, more an more tables are wobbly making eating an adventure."

The floor under our table was dirty from previous customers messy eating. Fish roe soup still a great compliment to the sushi.

Got uni shooters this time, kinda disappointing though as the ponzu sauce is WAY too salty that you lose the yummy taste of the uni. Our second round of shooters, we asked for less ponzu and it was better, but still too salty. 

Gotta knock down a star for the shooters and food on the floor at our table."

And this place, my friends, was the worst sushi I&#39;ve ever had :(. I eat sushi/raw fish pretty often and Nikko Sushi was awful. 

We ordered a lump some of nigiri and a couple rolls. The rolls were basic, nothing stood out about them. I typically loveeee nigiri, but I had one bite of the salmon and my appetite dropped. The salmon and rice were oddly warm like it was on someone&#39;s hand for way too long. It did not sit well on my taste buds. I couldn&#39;t even eat the rest of the nigiri I ordered. I asked my boyfriend what he thought, and he agreed. All the nigiri we ordered did not taste fresh and was warm. My boyfriend and I are big foodies/eaters, and it&#39;s rare if we leave leftovers. At Nikko&#39;s, we had so much left over because we were tired of trying to finish the awful nigiri. 

Beware if you come here. I came thinking it was going to be exceptional because of the reviews. This place is definitely far from 4 stars. I gave 2 because they did give free miso soup, salad, and ice cream at the end."

HOWEVER, food is amazing! Service is also just as excellent. And for such great prices, you are guaranteed to be leaving very full and happy. 

We ordered the hwae dup bop (sashimi and mixed rice and vegetables Korean style), and I was very pleasantly surprised at the size, presentation, and taste- all for $13! Absolutely delicious, fresh, healthy, and filling. Before this came out, we also were treated with the complimentary sizzling Korean egg dish. It is very tasty also and a great start to the meal. In addition, we ordered the seaweed salad and Chicago roll, both delicious and excellent choices.

I love how I got a taste of Korean and Japanese in this meal while still getting my veggie fix. I also left a lot more full than I expected a $30 meal would provide for two. The complimentary dessert is also adorable and refreshing!"

The inside was nothing fancy it looked like a authentic sushi restaurant. 

We ordered different types of sushi and also chicken teriyaki. The best part was it came with free appetizer for everyone. I forgot what the appetizer was called but it was really good. Best way to describe the taste was that it tasted like a vegetable egg roll. They also bring you a free salad and free miso soup. The soup was really good as was the salad they had some citrus type of dressing on top which was very refreshing. Also at the end of the meal they brought us some ice cream topped with a slice of watermelon. 

My favorite sushi I tried there was called California Sunset. It had Crab, Cucumber, Avocado topped with Salmon. It was delicious! Another cool thing I&#39;ve never seen anywhere else is that you can have them build your own sushi. Or edit any other sushi they offer. Thought that was pretty cool! Also the chicken teriyaki was good and flavorful.

They have some of the best Gyoza I&#39;ve ever had in a restaurant close to me, the sushi is tiers above Sushi station too. Not to say Sushi Station is awful, but Nikkos is far better. But you get better value for the slightly increased price you pay for sushi. Small bonus: the selection of alcohol is pretty lengthy which is nice to indulge in, but its a bit overpriced for my taste.
 I&#39;ve seen a few comments complain about the slow service and I can agree with them. The service is definitely much slower but its also because they&#39;re busy and slightly understaffed. Given the circumstances they do their job fine."

With Mitsuwa marketplace on the same street I didn&#39;t even notice it! It&#39;s a small Japanese/Korean restaurant that serves sushi, udon noodles, stews, and stir frys. They don&#39;t not serve Korean bbq tho. The sushi menu is extensive. Come hungry it&#39;ll be worth it.

The food is fresh, spicy, and delicious. We had the red dragon roll (yum), miso soup (watered down), side salad (ok), spicy chicken (loved it) came with pickled cucumber and baby mayo broccoli and ddukbokgi with fish cake (really good). To top it off they gave us a free appetizer something fried with tortilla not good but nice gesture.  The staff was courteous and nice. I&#39;ll return next time try something else."

First it is definitely hard to find &#34;collars&#34; of fish. For those don&#39;t know what I am speaking of, the collar is essentially the neck behind the gills.  For years a fishermens secret cut.  Most markets discard them when &#34;dressing&#34; the fish. The fishermen would take them home but their secret was leakdc and the demand has grown.  Think of it like chicken wings here in the USA.  A cheap commoner part that has driven the price up from 0.5 cent wings up to $0.60 cents.  Here their Hamachi Kama (yellow tail collar)  was meaty fatty, moist and delicious.  I picked the bone clean.  Just see the picture. ;-)  

I had sashimi and sushi which was good but the rice was tough (this is causing me to waver between 4 or 5 stars) Fish was quite fresh. The salad was more of a taste as it was very tiny. The dressing was different from most ginger or sesame oil dressing.  It was fresh and clean with a little ginger but a big burst of citrus,  orange I believe and the zest.  It was a nice change. Wishing I had more. I could have eaten three of the salads.  

The service was great.  They finish the meal with small bit of a complementary ice cream sundae and a thin watermelon wedge.  A great palate cleanser.  

I will definitely recommend to others and hope return soon."

Too bad I moved further away. I used to eat here or carry out at least once per week of not more. I think I could probably eat it everyday if I was rich. The fish is fresh and it&#39;s the one sushi place I never have to use soy sauce at all because all of their roles already have amazing sauces in them or drizzled on top.

We waited 15 mins after ordering and eventually had to ask for our water from someone who was not our server. I had just worked 14 hours and was incredibly thirsty. They did fill our drinks twice, but attention to the table was awful. I considered getting up and grabbing this pitcher of water off the sushi bar and brining it back to the table. Our table was regularly walked past several times and we had our glasses at the edge of our table for most of the time. Nobody asking how we&#39;re doing, plates sat empty for 30 minutes, and we had to ask again for water when they finally did take or dishes off the table.

On a lighter note the Nikko tortilla appetizer is delicious and is why I still come to this place pretty much. We also tried the Nikko Fear Factor roll and liked it.

Red dragon (had crab) and Godzilla (eel) tasted very fishy; not usually an issue with good crab or eel. If I return it will be begrudgingly for the tortilla appetizer."

The front on the place has a sign in a Korean.  It can be confusing.

We ordered the beef bulgogi and don-katsu.  Both were really good.  The bulgogi was as good as any place in Southern California.  Grilled marinated beef with scallions, onions, mushrooms and carrots. The entrees were served with rice, a small salad, and the traditional Korean side dishes.

For starters, I had never been greeted by so many folks in a room at once! The staff are incredibly friendly and truly make you feel like you&#39;re welcome in their &#34;home&#34;. For the few times I have visited, I&#39;ve been taken care of right away even when there weren&#39;t any available seating. Personally, I prefer to sit at the bar in front of the sushi chefs - it&#39;s fascinating watching them work with the fish! Though the seating may seem a bit cramped, the restaurant has a certain flair for comfortability. I can say in confidence I feel like I&#39;m at an actual &#34;sushi bar&#34; when at Nikko.

As for the food, I couldn&#39;t ask for much more. I&#39;m a sucker for miso soup, which is always provided before your rolls along with an Asian salad with a ginger topping. They offer more sushi rolls than any other place I&#39;ve been to with classics such as spicy tuna and Philadelphia rolls (my personal favorite) to specialty rolls like the &#34;Carolyne&#34; (creamy crab topped with smoked salmon and mozzarella cheese). If you could create a sushi roll, Nikko most likely already has it in their menu. The prices are just a tad more expensive than most places, but their fish, atmosphere and service is enough to have me remain a returning customer. 
Because Nikko has been labeled as my first ever sushi experience, it has set the bar high in comparison with other Asian bars/restaurants in the surrounding area.

Overall, I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better first-time experience with sushi and Nikko will continue to be my go-to for a nice date night or Friday night dinner plan.

Rumor has it if the staff and/or owners notice you are a regular in the restaurant, they give you a set of real chopsticks with your name on the box to use every time you come in!"

One of the most mediocre sushi places I have ever ordered from. Might have actually enjoyed one of those sushi boxes from Jewel or something more than this. 

Spicy tuna roll was way too spicy to enjoy 
Boston roll had potential but was so bland tasted like nothing
Salmon nigiri was probably the best part of my order - it was decent. 

On top of that they are very stingy with soy sauce. Like I&#39;m gonna need more than 2 packets guys cmon ......

Was our first time here so didn&#39;t know what to expect. We all ordered waters for our drinks. They made the kids day when the waters came with umbrellas in them. We ordered food for just the adults sushi, spicy chicken dish and tempura appetizer. They brought all 6 of us miso soup. Didn&#39;t think the kids would eat but they enjoyed the soup. The salads we got were very good as well. When our main dishes came they brought small plates of chicken Katsu for the kids on the house. I was very impressed with the service. They were very attentive to the kids. That wasn&#39;t all the food was amazing. Loved the spicy chicken, the sushi was great as well. To end the meal and amazing service when they brought the bill they had balloon swords for the boys and a balloon puppy for my niece. They also brought red bean ice cream for the all of us.

They never disappoint!

Did I mention they also have a red bean ice cream at the end of it all! 

Great little spot to go!"

Let&#39;s make a compliment sandwich.

+They have tasty sushi!
+They have a large selection of maki
-Their outdated decor is filthy with dust
-Their floors are dirty and so are the floors where they are making the food
-Their special rolls (the more expensive ones) are on the small side
-Their pricing is a little high for what you get
-They don&#39;t have a soda machine, so when you pay for a drink, they hand you a can of Coke 
 and a glass. That is really not cool when I&#39;m paying $70 for my wife and myself to have dinner.
-/+Seem to really like their customers, letting regulars keep their own chopsticks, but if you really see how it&#39;s done and think about it, it&#39;s kinda weird and possible to get somebody else&#39;s chopsticks.
+Staff seem nice
+Open late

Might be back, if nothing else is open at night."

I was blown away when I went there for the first time. They serve salad and cucumber to start, and then they serve you a miso soup which is always yummy. Then your sushi comes out, which they have a large range of, and every type I&#39;ve had is delicious. You can see them make it in front of you, which is common for sushi restaurants, but adds to the experience. After your sushi they will serve you fruit and then some type of ice cream (usually red bean). What more can you ask for?! You walk in asking for sushi and you walk out having eaten a 5 course meal!

Nikko&#39;s great because of this extra course experience. I would suggest going into the restaurant to eat and not doing take out. It really sets them apart from other sushi places in the area."
nikko-sushi-arlington-heights,Irene Grace P.,301utU4yCpixkcf74Q-zkQ,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,16,282,vzLe56qlfp-iFREqR1Arpg,5.0,2016-06-30,"I started off with the appetizer called the Coconut Shrimp. Unlike other coconut shrimp dishes I&#39;ve had in the past where the shrimp is topped with creamy coconut sauce, this appetizer was dry. The description includes the following: breaded shrimp with coconut. However, I didn&#39;t taste coconut and it was like that of popcorn shrimp. The shrimp was crunchy and other than the taste of fried goodness, I only really tasted the sauces that the shrimp was sprinkled with. Overall, this appetizer wasn&#39;t to-die-for.  
I tried 4 different &#34;special rolls&#34;. The menu at the restaurant included a flavor guide (such as creamy, spicy mayo), which was helpful in choosing the flavor that I was in the mood for. I tried to go for the dragon special rolls because many Yelp reviews included those rolls. 
Of the 3 dragon special rolls that I tried (White Dragon, Red Dragon, and Rainbow Dragon), I enjoyed the Rainbow Dragon the most. This is a roll that should be enjoyed alone and not to be eaten family style. So if I had an Icebreakers-type-of-Rainbow Dragon, I would always choose the &#34;not to share&#34; option because that way you can try all the different toppings on the roll. I appreciated how every bite was unique. I recommend the Rainbow Dragon.
I also tried the Nikko special roll. My first impression of this dish was a thumbs up because it was presented to us in a center of blue fire (the fire didn&#39;t burn the sushi because the sushi was on top of aluminum foil). This roll was marked with each of the colors per the flavor guide and the sushi captured each one. Well done. I also recommend the Nikko special roll.   
The Ton Katsu (Pork) came with a side of rice and a simple salad (lettuce with orange colored sweet sauce) as well as a couple side dishes of kimchee and a cucumber side dish. It was alright.
Lastly, my table was surprised by a complimentary Steamed Egg appetizer. The whisked egg was a unique way to finish off the meal. Nonetheless, complimentary dishes are always welcome.
In summary, I recommend the Rainbow Dragon and Nikko special rolls."

Came over with 3 coworkers with hungry stomachs growling. We shared the Godzilla, cherry blossom, dragon, Cali, sweet potatoe, and spicy tuna rolls. By far the best was the cherry blossom and Godzilla. I love that soup &amp; salad was included and that we received complimentary samples of a taco roll, water melon slices,and red bean ice cream. 

The bill came to $15 a person without tip. The 90s ballad as a background noise was awesome. What a great little sushi spot. Come early before lunch to snag a table as this place is small and fills up quickly!"

The last few times I went were bad enough to let go of the good memories here. The service was consistently bad and the food was mediocre. It felt as though the servers were confused on which tables were theirs. At first, it took forever to even get water and our orders. After we finally ordered, we had like 3 people ask us if we were ready to order. We got some sushi along with a bibimbap and pork kimchi stew. The sushi came out first (It was okay). After we finished, we waited about 15 minutes before asking about our bibimbap and kimchi stew. Another 15 minutes passes and another server asks if we wanted our check. We told her the rest of our food still hasn&#39;t come out yet. After yet another 15 mins, we finally got our food (It was good but nothing crazy). 

A simple apology would have been nice at some point, but apparently that&#39;s not a thing. 

+ I know it&#39;s free and I shouldn&#39;t expect it, but we didn&#39;t even get the ice cream or steamed egg that time!"

I tend to crave things that I can&#39;t have late at night.. sushi is on the top of that list.  And now I can have not just any old sushi at 10pm, but good quality, proper sushi!  My favorite - salmon skin handrolls - are on the menu and they get bonus points just for that.  Some places don&#39;t offer it and I don&#39;t get it - the salmon had skin at one point right?

Prior to last year we&#39;ve always likes this place. Great food, nice service and John at the Sushi Bar was always friendly and checking on the quality of the food and service.  We went last year but all the staff was changed, John was gone. The experience was similar to Alissa&#39;s posting on 4/24/16. Confusion reigns. We ordered Sushi and a Bibimap bowl....Sushi came but we waited and waited but the staff had totally forgotten to put in the Bibimap. Strike one. 

Fast forward to last week. We had the bad experience in our minds but I&#39;m willing to give a place a 2nd shot, figuring it was just a fluke. Such is not the case.  Water, menus took a while to come. Again ordered some sushi and a side of short ribs and tempura udon.  Sushi came....but none of the other food. The excuse this time was that the order had not printed out in the kitchen. The server was apologetic but the commented w/ confusion that this same thing had happened to another table earlier.  He said the execs were in the kitchen trying to figure out the problem, but all along clearly one of the owners sat drinking with another table, clearly clueless that anything was wrong.  The other food did finally come with several apologies again but how about &#34; let us take care of these two dishes&#34; for the inconvenience? Nope nothing of the sort. I&#39;m ok w/ paying $70 for a sushi dinner but not when it&#39;s this bad. Sorry Nikko...strike two...not returning and sorry to have to let everyone else know about it.

Sushi is really good. However as we have been here so many times, we can see when the chef is not in the mood to impress. I wish they were more consistent as you know how excellent this roll can taste and then it comes out missing something, or having just a sprinkle of cheese or is just not cooked with enough sauce. Situations like this ruin the dinner experience and make us look for alternatives. However as we live close we still come back. Just keep it up guys!

I have to mention that I love the late hours that this place has, and the big thing that won me over was the AMAZING customer service! The whole staff greets you as you come in and wishes you a good night as you leave. 
The food was fantastic. They brought free edamame to our table as well as free salad, miso soup, and red bean ice cream for dessert. We ordered the agedashi tofu and steamed gyoza for appetizers as well as plum wine and Sapporo for our beverages. The plum wine actually had a pickled plum in it, which was super cool. 
For our entrees we had sushi. My best friend is a vegetarian, so he got the sweet potato roll and the AAC roll. He also mentioned that he loves spicy food, so they brought him a spicy sauce and spicy mayo to try. I got the Godzilla roll, which was fantastic. All in all, our experience was great.

I came here with my friend the other night, and I was craving some sushi. I came to the right place! My friend ordered the teriyaki chicken, which was very good, but I prefer my rolls! First, we were given a complimentary sample of one of the rolls (it had jalapeno and teriyaki, but I&#39;m not sure what the name was). SO GOOD. I ordered a few rolls, which also came with soup and salad. Their ginger dressing isn&#39;t as good as other places, but it wasn&#39;t bad. 

They have a large variety of rolls, most of them are the &#34;special&#34; rolls. Other places I have gone to have a small list of more simple rolls that are cheaper. They only have a few of those here. However, the rolls are huge and really filling, so they are worth the extra money. Everything was very fresh and very good!

We were served a small scoop of ice cream each after the meal (again complimentary). The service was great the whole time. Everyone is very friendly. They greet you when you walk in or leave, always have the plates cleared, etc. It&#39;s a small joint so it fills up fast. Very cozy, but not uncomfortable. I was impressed!"

The waiters and waitresses paid us no mind as they walked by our tables never bothering to ask us if we would like a refill, refilling our waters, or even bothering to ask.

Some of the food was decent, most of it was honestly mediocre Sushi.

The price was preposterous in regards to the quality, it was highway robbery for the quality of the food.

The worst part was definitely the service. Good service can make a bad restaurant decent. Good food can (in my opinion) not make a bad restaurant good. I&#39;ve never stiffed a bill at a restaurant, but this place deserved it.

Anyway. On to my review. The salads are fresh and the dressing is healthy but tasty. We got the Beauty Combo, which is a combo of three rolls with girls&#39; names. Barbara, cara and something else that I forgot. (I will update this later since I&#39;m doing it from my phone). Let&#39;s call her Laquita for now. Each roll was so delicious and well prepared. We also got the tempura udon, which was nice to have something hot and soupy with our rolls. 

Finally the cherry on top: they bring out balloon animals for any children at your table AND free ice cream and banana slices for dessert. How awesome is it here??!!! Five stars all the way for the food, service and overall great experience. Quality people and quality meals that will bring people back again and again."

Came on a Wednesday night for dinner and although the place was pretty full, the restaurant itself is pretty small and they had 4-5 waiters. The service was extremely bad, the waiters were forgetful and didn&#39;t come around at all without being called. Had to ask for a refill for my iced tea a couple of times for them to remember. 
The most awkward part was that I had to ask for their usual free dessert because they weren&#39;t giving it to us although they were giving it to the tables next to us. I don&#39;t know if it was discrimination but I didn&#39;t like it. 

The food here is great and I love coming here but after tonight&#39;s service by the waiters I&#39;m not sure if I feel the same anymore."

The first few rolls took forever to deliver and were mediocre at best. We had to wave down waiter/waitress to get more hot tea. They lost our appetizer order and so we had to reorder again. The soft shell crab dish came in COLD and was clearly left sitting around for a long time before they served it to us. Complained and was finally served with a fresh hot one. 

Last but not least, I squished a SPIDER that dropped on the table from the ceiling above. 

Yeah. It was that bad."

I was so delighted by the food that I knew I HAD to write a review.  Nikko Sushi is a small little Japanese/Korean/Sushi joint.  It can easily be passed up when driving down Algonquin St,, so keep an eye out!

With that being said, once inside, it has a nice cozy feel.  The food is OUTSTANDING!  My best friend is Korean, so I often times get skeptical trying Korean food from other restaurants in fear that it won&#39;t be as good as her family&#39;s food.  However I would have to give Nikko Sushi&#39;s food two thumbs up.  I had the beef stone rice bowl (highly recommend) and my boyfriend had the chicken teriyaki (he played it safe--however still good). Then we shared a Maiko sushi roll (absolutely delish! It&#39;s a must try).

All in all my experience at Nikko Sushi was a very pleasant one and I will be sure to return in the near future."

I find it difficult to discover really fair priced food that&#39;s also delicious and good quality. Nikko sushi satisfies both. Friendly on our stomachs and wallets! You get so much for your buck. Tonight my boyfriend and I ordered 6 kinds of sushi, but included was soup, salad, and dessert. We got a sample of dumpling on the house! The order before us was huge, the manager on duty sent us free sampling of some specialty fish to apologize for the wait. Honestly, we didn&#39;t mind waiting! The decor and music makes the experience, we were so calm and relaxed while waiting for our food. The staff is very nice and attentive. Our waitress was just right, gave us enough privacy but was there when we ran out of something or to clear dishes right when we were done. We absolutely love this place, and plan to be regulars.

Every order comes with soup, salad, appetizer, and dessert.  It&#39;s a great all around value.

If you&#39;ve read any of my older reviews you may know that I regard hamachi kama(broiled yellowtail collar) very highly as far as sushi/izakaya restaurant apps go.  If you have not read any of my older reviews, I LOVE HAMACHI KAMA.  So...

I saw it here on the menu and had to get it.  It was perfect.  It was bigger than the plate it came on.  It was bigger than any piece of hamachi kama I&#39;ve ever seen personally.  And it&#39;s only $7.  The best part about it was that there were two distinct halves to the collar, the buttery softer half of the fish collar and the crispier more firm half.  This makes it the perfect collar for me and my wife since she likes the crispy half, and I prefer the butterier half.  That is so totally a word.  

Having hamachi kama here makes me extremely happy.  The reason being, I am usually searching for it in the city, and Arlington Heights is mucho closer and preferable to driving to Chicago for a piece of fish.  Not that I haven&#39;t or won&#39;t do that but it&#39;s nice to know it&#39;s a short-er drive away.  

I also love that Nikko closes at midnight.  A late night suburban sushi place with hamachi kama?  Man, that&#39;s like finding an intelligent woman who looks great in heels, likes fantasy football, loves watching sports most importantly hockey,football and combat sports, knows how to drive a manual car, and smells good.  Oh wait, I did that already :p

The other great thing about Nikko is that with anything you order, be it a single measly sushi roll or the giant plate of BBQ short ribs, you will receive some complimentary goodies; miso soup, a teeny taster salad, a couple pieces of a fried roll,(I just can&#39;t remember which one it is), ice cream and banchan, usually broccoli crab salad, kim chi(you might have to ask specifically for it) and some lightly pickled cukes.  If you&#39;re even more lucky, they will give you the egg bake, a deliciously light albeit very hot(temperature hot) cast iron dish full of eggy goodness along with some Korean red chili pepper and green onions.  When it comes to the table, it looks like one of those science fair volcanos made of vinegar and baking soda, sorta...But tastes much better.  Just give it a little time to cool down before you dig in.  Or at least blow on it some. 

We&#39;ve been here more than a couple of times and so far my favorite things are the Hamachi kama., the grilled saba(mackerel), the BBQ beef plate, those cucumbers, the egg bake, the Jab Chae(noodles) and the Steve roll. 

The space isn&#39;t very large, but we&#39;ve never had to wait longer than 15 minutes or so for seating.  The staff are very friendly, all welcoming customers as they walk in.  The service can sometimes be spotty depending on who is taking care of you, but for the most part, most of the servers are very attentive and will try to keep the waters topped and the dishes cleared as you devour you way through the menu.  

So come on down to Nikko and don&#39;t burn your tongue on the egg bake!"

I wanted to touch on another part of their menu. Their Korean food is divine. While I&#39;m not Korean, we do eat at Korean restaurants almost every/every other week, and this is my favorite. Hands down. 

The food is excellent, kimchi stew for me and codfish stew for my husband. We have had the stone bowl, chop chae, spicy beef stew and sushi. All delicious. 

the service is also unbelievably wonderful. The staff and owners are very warm, and very accommodating. And having been given our own chopsticks a few months was pretty cool, I have to say! :-)"

As soon as you walk in the door everyone yells welcome to you-- same with when you leave goodbyes and thank yous coming from everywhere.  The sushi here is amazing, nikko special combo is so much food and amazing sampler! 

They start you out with miso soup-- I am a huge fan of this soup and it is amazing here! During dinner or before the chef will send over some freebies to try out -- always a nice touch.  One time they sent fried tofu.. Something I would never think to order off the menu and I ended up really enjoying it!  You also get a salad.. Small but hey it&#39;s just an add on!  At the end they send over some fruit with ice cream! Yum!!

One time when we went with some friends the server brought over specific chop sticks for them to use that were saved in a huge wall with many other chop sticks-- all in their own personal boxes... What???? Our friends said you get a pair after coming in so often &amp; the staff gets to know you.  Who knows if that&#39;s the truth but I would believe it based on the culture of the restaurant.

I was thinking that at the end of the night my bill would be heft but as it turns out, this place was pretty affordable and they had excellent customer service. 

They really know how to treat their customers here. Since we went on a Friday night, they were a bit busy. We didn&#39;t think we had to wait very long for our food (normal time compared to other restaurants) but the waitress kept coming over updating us every 5-10 minutes and apologizing for the food being late. I think in total it probably took about 20 minutes and we didn&#39;t mind that at all.  

Price-wise, we thought oh this place had about the same pricing as most other Sushi restaurants (in the lower and mid-teens for rolls) but what makes them different is they will give you a lot of tiny comp tastings such as miso soup and a pinch of ginger salad for everyone and during the course of dinner, we had two tastings of spring roll and a couple pieces of another maki roll from the chef.  Then when dinner was over, they gave each of us a scoop of red bean icecream with a cherry on top, and a few slices of pineapple which was perfect because we were too full to order deserts but would still enjoy the nice treat. If I counted it all, each of us had 6 tiny complimentary samplings. It may not seem like much but I think little things like that goes a long way, especially when you didn&#39;t expect it.  

Food-wise, each of the rolls that I&#39;ve tried were quite good, not overly stuffed with rice, well flavored and yummy. One of the person at our table had a combo sushi platter for about $15 and it came out with enough rolls for the 3 of us to share. Portion-wise, they aren&#39;t too bad. I would definitely come back here again!


Update: Just found my receipt so here&#39;s the breakdown: 

Korean Stone bowl $10.95
Salmon Roll $3.95
White Tuna Roll $3.95
Spicy Crunch Roll $5.95 
Kamikaze Roll $9.95 ( this was very good!)
Miso soup, salad, mini desert and pineapple for TWO: FREE
2 House complimentary tastings

I was quickly seated right at the bar, which I love because you can watch them make the sushi right in front of you. I was brought a free bowl of miso soup and plate of ginger salad. My combo lunch order - a spicy tuna roll and a crunch roll - were both made quickly, looked and tasted great. The waitress also brought me a free sample appetizer that was a two little pieces of tempura fish. A few seconds after I finished off my rolls she was back to take away my plates and bring a dessert platter that had a small bowl of raspberry ice cream with whipped cream and a cherry as well as banana pieces with chocolate sauce and whipped cream - also free!

We waited forever for our menus when we sat at the &#34;bar&#34; but it didn&#39;t matter because we got a small complimentary edemame bowl,  miso soup and itsy bitsy salad. I want the dressing of the salad. I should have asked what it was. 
Anyway we ordered the nikko roll, the black dragon, seared tuna, caterpillar and Barbara. I planned on ordering more but the waitress said that we would be fine. She was right. The food took a while to come but it was exquisite. So fresh, so we&#39;ll presented, so delicious. I was pretty impressed. The chef even brought us a complementary veggie roll which was to die for.

I was planning to get some Chinese food with my boyfriend on Christmas Eve, but then he proposed to me, and we felt like taking it up a notch and get some sushi. We were both in a beautiful mood and nothing could have ruined it for us at that moment, but as I was slowly coming back to reality, I remembered that we had a wonderful dining experience here and they are usually open late.

We got to Nikko around 8:30ish and there were almost no cars in the parking lot, which worked out even better for us. We were greeted by incredibly friendly faces and the service just kept getting better and better throughout the night. We started off with a medium sized Sake bottle (that&#39;s what it was called) and it gave us 4-5 shots each, so by the end of the dinner, I was flying on a great buzz. We also ordered 5 rolls - White Dragon, Spicy Rose (Spicy octopus topped w/spicy tuna, eel sauce), Spicy Tuna, Spicy Scallop, and Philadelphia. There were all absolutely excellent and so fresh, just as I remembered it. 

On top of what we ordered, they also gave us FOUR items on the HOUSE!!! We both got miso soups, salads (possibly the House salad?) with delicious mangy dressing, another appetizer - possibly the Nikko Tortilla, but not 100% on that, and a dessert - 2 ice creams with bananas in chocolate. 

To top off the already magical night, our waiter brought us two pairs of headphones as Christmas gifts from the boss!!!! Completely unreal... 

I don&#39;t know why I haven&#39;t been back more often, but I can say that I truly love this place for its service, food, and the absolute coziness of the restaurant. It&#39;s a must if you are in the area!!!"

the rolls. They are ginormous and filling and super fresh. Since I can&#39;t have my pick of nigiri or sashimi, I&#39;ll settle for a roll that has crab meat in it. Done and done. Smear some avocado on top, and I&#39;m a happy lady.

What I love about this restaurant are the original touches. If you are a regular at this restaurant, you can purchase your own set of chopsticks and store them in their chopstick file cabinet by the front door. 


They also offer complimentary miso soup after ordering. Nothing makes you feel more at home than your own eaterware and soup"

Complementary with every order:
- Miso Soup
- Ginger Salad
- Amuse Bouche Sushi Roll (one per person)
- Bean Ice Cream (SO freakin&#39; good!)
- Watermelon slice w/ dessert

That alone, had me straight lovin&#39; Nikko, but wait- there&#39;s more. I managed to scrape up a few pennies and actually get some stuff here that wasn&#39;t free, and actually, it was all pretty damn affordable. Myself and two guys ate here for $45+ tip+ super friendly service even though we unknowingly came in a 40 minutes before they close for the afternoon, only to re-open later that night. 

They do a deal of a lunch special, which one of my dining partners chose to do (Boston Roll- Tuna, avocado, cucumber &amp; masago), the other did some vegetarian rolls (radish and shiitake) and I went with the 911 roll (Spicy tuna, jalapeno topped w/spicy crunch) and hoped it would be spicy as a mutha. It came out on fire. Like, my eyebrows singed a little and I had to wait 5 minutes for the flames to go out. It was awesome and my photo doesn&#39;t do it justice. The roll was filling and had a great char flavor but you could still taste the fresh, raw tuna. It was a beautiful thing, albeit, not the spicy, hot that I was expecting. Next time (and there WILL be a next time), I&#39;m getting the Fear Factor Roll (Spicy tuna, jalapeno, chopped real wasabi crunch topped wasabi tobiko with hot sauce) and hoping for some serious heat on my taste buds. 

Anyone want to join me for the next visit? I&#39;m thinking sometime in the next 2-weeks is a must. 

Also, I like that a lot of their rolls (and they have a HUGE selection) are named after regulars, so there&#39;s a good chance there&#39;ll be a roll named after you if you&#39;re name is Mark, Emily, Rose, Billy, Justyna, Cara, Franco, Steve, Katie, Rory, Eddy, Carolyne, Barbara, Diana, Jimbo, Kari, Kristie, Sasha, etc. It&#39;s pretty fun. What&#39;s a girl gotta do to get a roll named after her!? Erm, actually- nevermind. I&#39;ve spent a great deal of time trying to keep my name from being associated with fish... I might want to keep it that way."

minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Gordon G.,-1eyZGJDZRBKXCqIykNaxg,"Algonquin, IL",0,1,0,40,142,HyIIMJnggg9q8ZHc8L3Atg,5.0,2016-11-16,"I was just about to move to New York City in order to be close to the crème de la crème of Dim Sum cuisine.  My bags were packed, Diego and Juan were loading up the moving truck, and my cousin, Vincent, had his sofa all ready in his 300 sq. ft. Manhattan basement apartment for me to crash on while I searched for a place to reside in NYC for under $8,000 a month.

But then I saw a friend&#39;s review of Minghin Cuisine on Yelp, with the words 点心 &#34;dim sum&#34; highlighted, and more importantly, the city name &#34;Rolling Meadows&#34; staring me in the face.  Could this be true?  An impressive Chinese restaurant with phenomenal Dim Sum located just a short drive down Algonquin Road opened up without my knowledge? How could this be? 

Immediately, I postponed my move, in order to investigate this new discovery of the NW suburbs.  

On a Sunday afternoon, my better half and I went to Minghin to give it a try.  Now since I was in the process of relocating to Manhattan to be closer to Elizabeth Street in Chinatown, which houses such fabulous Dim Sum establishments as Oriental Garden, and Jing Fong, amongst others, Minghin would have to surpass all expectations I had built up in my head.  Before even entering, they already had two strikes against them.  1.  No cart service.  2. I would not be able to pick up &#34;Croach&#34; handbags or &#34;Rolecks&#34; watches for 12 dollars on the sidewalk outside of Minghin Cuisine.  But that&#39;s okay... flavorsome  food can certainly make up for the lack of atmosphere.

We waited 8 seconds (must&#39;ve been for good luck) before being seated at a table between the front of the restaurant and the centralized bar.  Boy those chairs are comfortable!  Given a tablet and a Dim Sum paper menu, I quickly started filling out the paper menu while the better half ordered some soup and a roast pork main dish via the tablet.  

Sadly, they were &#34;out&#34; of the roast pork dish, which seemed quite odd to me. 

About 3 minutes later, a parade of individually sized bamboo steamers showed up onto our table, housing har gow, shu mai, sticky pork filled buns, fried pork and vegetable buns, shrimp crepes, egg tarts (more on that later), potstickers, as well as a bowl of hot n sour soup.

The soup was steaming hot and strong!  Nice and spicy just the way I like it.  The really only negative with the rest of the food was that it lacked the same steaming hotness that you would normally find from steaming bamboo bowls on carts.  It didn&#39;t matter too much to me, but to some, it may.

Back to the egg tarts. This is traditionally a dish that seems to only be served to ones who have actual physical or verbal cues of Asian descent.  I have ordered egg custard every single time I dine for Dim Sum, and 90% of the time, I do not receive any.  Even while neighboring tables with Asian patrons of the restaurant are enjoying MULTIPLE orders of egg tarts!  I have seen other white folks be denied the coveted tarts as well, so it&#39;s not just me. It&#39;s all round-eye white people. However, this time was different.  My white pasty face certainly does not show any signs of me originating from Asia.  Yet, this time, at Minghin Cuisine, I was served the prized-dish.  And it was delicious!  

All of the food was spectacular, leaving me in a food coma, unable to drive home until I had hit the drive-thru of a coffee house and ordered a double.  Folks,  Minghin Cuisine could become my favorite Dim Sum restaurant of all time.   I have since cancelled my plans to relocate to The Big Apple, and will stick around the NW suburbs for awhile.  As long as Minghin Cuisine continues to serve me egg custards, I see no advantage to traveling to a major Chinatown for authentic cuisine.  

PS- We were seated at a table with Chopsticks as the only utensils.  This time, forks and extra napkins were automatically brought to our table after we ordered our food.  We had not asked for forks, but yet we received them (and I cried a little).  You know you have truly arrived as a respected connoisseur of Dim Sum (or Chinese food in general) when forks, knives, or a menu in English never makes it to your table.  I hope that will happen to me at Minghin Cuisine by New Year&#39;s Day."

The restaurant is nicely laid out with many tables and brightly lit. They sat the two of us at a table big enough for 5 or 6. I think it was because they didn&#39;t want us to wait for a smaller table that wasn&#39;t available at the time. That was nice because I was starving.

The rice noodle with beef was really delicious with a lot of beef stuffed inside. The shrimp dumplings tasted really fresh and light. I thought the fried taro puffs were pretty bland but it helped dipping it in the oyster and hot sauce. We tried something new which were veggies wrapped in tofu and deep fried. The veggies were really fresh but the outside was quite oily and a bit tough to bite through. I probably wouldn&#39;t order that again but it was nice to try one time. 

We ordered 5 dim sum dishes and it came out to about $30 total which I think is pretty reasonable but bordering on the expensive side. I guess it&#39;s worth it if you don&#39;t want to drive into the city and also want better service with clean plates/silverware than what you would get at the Chinatown location."

It is fun to share with your family and friends.  Ordering on the tablets seems easy and efficient for younger generations - but you may have to help out your grandparents.  I do wish there was either something to wash the tablet with (like an alcohol wipe) or something to wash my hands with after ordering without going to the bathroom.
Buns, dumplings, noodles, veggies, fish - everything we had was simply good.

If you are coming for Sunday brunch - be prepared to wait (and maybe a long time)."

The place is dirty when the place opened up 2 months ago. Why is it so dirty ????? 

Beware ordering when they throw you a iPad and expecting to know what your doing. No explanation no service. Why have a server when everything is order by iPad. Which they don&#39;t tell you. If you have a question good luck.

Fortunately, they take reservations of groups of 6 or more, as the large place was totally packed and with maybe 20 people waiting at the reception area at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Virtually all of the diners looked to be Chinese, which surprised me a little in that there was not a little more diversity at this suburban location.  I would say our dining experience was more like 4.5 stars though.  The food was all top notch except maybe the cage-free chicken dish which was a bit on scrawny side, and the average tasting pea tips in broth.  The ratings drawback is due to the space being so loud when it&#39;s packed - it&#39;s like dining in a loud bar, and one could not have a conversation without some extra effort. Anyway, our dinner entrees for tonight were:

- Minghin cage-free half-chicken (scrawny as mentioned)
- clams Hong Kong style (a nice spice level from the jalapenos and red peppers)
- salt and pepper soft shell crab (great dish and value at $15.95)
- beef brisket with eggplant (a tasty and somewhat unique offering, and great with white rice)
- Nagaimo yam gingko shrimp
- pea tips in broth (a little on bitter side, and so-so)
- jumbo sesame balls (served hot, and delicious and addictive)

Overall, still high on my list of Chinese dinner places, but I might try to avoid peak traffic periods.

ps - they had one TV by the bar showing the depressing (for Cubs nation) WS Game 4 going-ons, and other TV&#39;s in the dining area were static with Chinese TV station menus, so they don&#39;t cater to a sports minded audience anyway."

Minghin has mitigated the mystery underneath each metal lid by making it super easy to order dim sum. 

Minghin is one of the top restaurants in Chinatown and they just opened their fourth location in Rolling Meadows. They&#39;ve invested quite a bit of money on the interior because the place is pretty swanky. From the old days, dim sum consisted of carts full of metal tin containers. Unless you knew the name of the dish in Chinese, you were often stuck with asking the wait staff to lift each lid. You also weren&#39;t sure how long the food had been left on the carts. The great thing about Minghin is that you can order dim sum from the convenience of a menu or a tablet with photos and the food isn&#39;t lukewarm .  

Indicators of good dim sum are the quality of ingredients used, variety of options, and the temperature of the food. Minghin delivers in each category. Still not sure what to order? Get a variety of items that are steamed, braised, pan or deep fried, and a mixture of savory and sweet dishes. Dim sum is offered all day and it&#39;s 20% off Monday through Friday from 2:30-5pm."

I would recommend a reservation. I read on another Yelp review that they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. I&#39;m not sure about that so you many want to confirm. The service was good. The food was fresh and good. It&#39;s pretty consistent with the quality of the Naperville and Chinatown locations. I like the fact that they have all day dim sum however you can tell its reheated in the evening as it&#39;s not as fresh as during lunch time.

After OCB rolled out, there has been a steady stream of subpar buffets and other random restaurants trying to set up shop here. But Minghin has good service, great food, is fancy and fun inside and on top of it all, has the Minghin name we&#39;ve all come to love from Chinatown right in Arlington Heights! Woohoo!

My coworkers and I went during lunch to try their daily dim sum. Yea huh, you read that right! Daily dim sum in the &#39;burbs! Don&#39;t expect the carts rolling around that you can grab your goodies straight from. Instead they have a photo menu on which you check which dim sum items you want. Everything we ordered was bigger than expected, decently priced and came out quite fast.
+Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce - some pieces had little meat on them and I was gnawing on bones. Overall though, a good dish, tasty sauce, but I&#39;d probably skip it my next go around.
+Pan Fried Vegetable Roll - meh. Skip this. Nothing amazing.
+BBQ Pork Crepe - The meat was good though not plentiful. I liked the crepe a lot but there was soooo much of it folded over. I just had huge bites of dough at times. Don&#39;t get me wrong it was sticky &amp; wonderful dough ---- but I need some meat with my sticky icky.
+Egg Tarts! My loves. I love these little custard pastries and they were just as good here as I&#39;ve had anywhere else and served warm.

They were out of pork belly the day I went! Oh so sad. Aside from the dim sum, we split an Orange Beef entree dish that was so delicious. Seriously it was so tasty I couldn&#39;t stop taking just &#39;one last piece&#39;. We wished for a bit more crispiness to bring it to perfection, but I gotta say it was pretty close to a perfect ten dish even without that.

I&#39;ll be back a million more times to try a million more dishes I&#39;m sure. It&#39;s going to be hard not ordering that Orange Beef though....Man is it tasty!"

Waited 30 minutes for a table (it was packed on a Sunday night,) and the seating area was plentiful. There are menus up at the front, so we were productive in that time and had our order ready by the time we sat down.

There&#39;s a tablet with an expanded menu (non-dim sum) at each table, but it was a little too complicated for us, so we stuck to dim sum. Bubble tea is also offered, but I don&#39;t recall it on the menu. 

The food came out quick and in reasonable intervals. It was just as good if not better than the Chinatown location without the grimy feel of most restaurants in that area. Service was also pretty quick. Usually hot tea is automatically served, but we had to ask for it, and it never came. 

Food was hot and fresh, but some of my friends commented some items lacked flavor. I just use Sriracha to take care of that, so seasoning was a non-issue for me. 

I&#39;d just keep in mind to order a variety of textures. We ordered crepes, and it came with the &#34;beef with soy sauce noodles,&#34; which were rice noodles, and everything at the point was a bit too gelatinous for me. All-in-all, I&#39;d return to get my dim sum fix whilst in the area again. For regular Chinese, I&#39;d go to Chef Ping down the street."
minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,"Buffalo Grove, IL",1,1,1,389,74,FzFw3zV5qUyFo2XAOmg2Yw,5.0,2016-09-25,"Foodies around the Palatine -Rolling Meadows - Arlington Heights - Schaumburg area have been waiting patiently for this famous local Michelin Recommend (Big Gourmand) restaurant to open. In the northwest suburbs, if you&#39;re lucky enough to find dim sum, it&#39;s generally very pricey and only mediocre in quality. Even if you head further down to Westmont or Schaumburg, the quality of dim sum you&#39;ll get is nothing to write home about.

So, does the new Ming Hin live up to the expectations and have the same great quality as the other branches? The answer is a resounding &#34;YES!&#34;. Like the other Ming Hin locations, there are some signature things you&#39;ll definitely notice. The restaurants are very spacious with upscale decor, plenty of servers, well lit, and plenty of parking -- with decorations that are sure to impress your friends. 

But, most importantly -- how is the food? The food comes out piping hot and beautifully presented. There are plenty of dim sum options (more than any other local Chinese restaurant by a mile) with plenty of protein and vegetable variations (don&#39;t forget about their delicious bao and desserts as well!). If you have not eaten much dim sum before -- there are some points to note. First, the portion sizes are a bit smaller and priced as such -- like Chinese tapas. Second, you will find much less sauces than you&#39;d expect from Chinese food. The flavor relies on the freshness and natural quality of the ingredients and avoiding the use of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and oils shows the confidence they have in their ingredient quality. Although the size of the dishes are smaller, using high quality ingredients allows them to pack a ton of flavor into each bite. Third, the dishes will in general be a bit less sweet and salty, while demonstrating a higher level of cooking technique. This is preferred in finer dining -- where fresh spices and herbs provide the majority of the flavor instead. Fourth - Bring friends. Dishes are meant to be shared and you&#39;ll want to try a bit of everything.

Like other Ming Hin restaurants - make sure you try the shrimp crepe, beef crepe, siu mai, beef balls, ** fresh bao **, and bbq pork turnover. The food is pretty consistently between good and excellent for any dish you order so be adventurous and prepare to be delighted."

They have a huge presence in Chinatown and now their plan is to branch out to the burbs. Their doors opened in a remodeled building that used to be a Chinese buffet. There&#39;s plenty of room (unlike its original location) and pretty Chinese decor. 

It feels like Chinatown too. I had no idea there were so many in Arlington Heights. Or are they just flocking here for the first few months. 

My hope is that they do not follow the Chinese buffet trend of putting their best foot forward only to go back into their ways a few months later that detracts customers and will flop in a matter of a year. 

Food is food. It&#39;s noisy. Feels too sophisticated. Suburban families will not get it. Chinese tv on will be confusing for those not used to the Chinatown scene. 

I don&#39;t know how I feel about this place. 

I suppose if you want Chinese food this is nice. But maybe I&#39;m just old fashioned. I don&#39;t want Chinatown in the suburbs. I&#39;ll just take a walk to the Panda Express I see through the window."

1. BBQ pork puffs were crispy, warm enough and delicious!
2. Fried dumplings were crispy with soft mochi wrap. However, they were very greasy and didn&#39;t have enough filling.
3. Turnip cakes were flavorful! I wish they would pan fry those a bit more so they don&#39;t fall apart that easily.
4. Pan fried buns were okay. Not the best I have ever had, but certainly edible. The bun itself was light and soft, I wish they could be more juicy inside and with saltier filling.
5. Stir fried sticky rice was the worst dish we got at this meal. They were very bland and parts of the rice were still pale. Will never get this again!
6. Roast pork was okay. The skin was kinda hard but I absolutely loved how fat and tender the meat was!!
7. Roast duck was okay. I like the sauce but the duck skin was not crispy at all. The meat was good though.

The interior was very nice and the service was pleasant too! The food came very quickly and they took away our empty plates very fast. They came to check if we had enough tea so often that we didn&#39;t even have to ask for more hot tea while we were there!

The restaurant is well decorated and spacious. The wait sucked, but it seems like they get people in and out quickly even though it&#39;s busy.

The food is exactly the same as well. We ordered a little of everything on the dim sum menu. Everything came out fresh and hot. It was all so good that we ordered a second round for a couple things! It was sad that they ran out of the curry cuttlefish or Macau style pork though. We wanted to try those. My absolute favorite dim sum items are the taro puffs and custard tart and black bean pork ribs and tripe.. and this place makes them perfect. So good!!

I love how their food is not overly salty. Everything tastes simple and nice.

The service was a bit lacking... they tended to overlook our table and help tables with more guests. A couple times we had to call the server over because we either ran out of stuff or we wanted to order more. I also didn&#39;t like that one of the guys took my plate before I was done eating. None of the servers look happy... I guess that&#39;s common in asian restaurants and I guess they are very busy, but it doesn&#39;t make for a pleasant dining experience when all the servers look pissed off. 

I still gave 5 stars because I love the food here and I&#39;m so glad they FINALLY opened. We don&#39;t have to drive to Chinatown or Naperville to get dim sum anymore."

The Manager brought me a knife and fork without my having to ask last time. Delivered stealth mode with a friendly wink.  I dig that dude.  Today, they remembered me and the fork and knife were there for my husband and I as soon as we sat down. I like that they remembered us.  Sure, we are nice and tip well but still...it&#39;s nice to have our needs anticipated and to be remembered.  We haven&#39;t had room for dessert yet but I vow to next time.  

Last but not least...we got there early today (4 pm) and found out that they offer a 20% discount from 2:30 pm to 5 pm.  The discount was on DimSum, entrees AND our beer!!!!!!

I went here with my family on a Saturday night. I recommend getting a reservation however small or large your group is because it&#39;s such a popular spot. 

Our wait time for our food wasn&#39;t that long. Dim sum we enjoyed: short rib with honey sauce, shrimp dumpling, the crepes, and bbq pork bun. Dim sum we wouldn&#39;t order again: siu mai, and stuffed sticky rice in lotus leaf. We also ordered from the dinner menu and wasn&#39;t disappointed with the amount of each dish they gave us. However, they ran out of roast pork belly by 7pm, which looked really good on the menu! 
For sweets, some ordered mango freezes and those were delicious. It was served in a cup with small, clear tapioca. Others ordered taro, mango, honeydew, and avocado smoothies with tapioca, which were not all that great. They were all too sweet and too icy."

I am excited beyond words that they opened a location even closer to me.  Expect me to be there once a week now...not even kidding. This is in a strip mall but that doesn&#39;t take away from the ambiance of the place.  It is more of a luxurious/upscale type of dim sum restaurant and the décor feels classier than your usual Chinese restaurants.  This is a chain and I&#39;ve only been to the Chinatown location until now but the food is just as delicious.  You can order dim sum anytime of the day which is amazing!  I recommend coming here for their dim sum or pan fried noodles with beef.  You can&#39;t go wrong with anything you order here but some of my dim sum favorites are the siu mai, shrimp dumplings, pan fried turnip cake, beef crepe, and the pan fried green chive cake.  Also, this location is fancy when it comes to takeout orders you place there; they give you a tablet where you place your order by selecting the items you want and adding them to your virtual shopping cart.

I did not know they were opening a location nearby! My family loves the location downtown, but rarely go due to the relatively long drive on a busy morning. I am very happy to see them growing and opening more locations though!

The interior was clean and very upscale in appearance. I was able to snag a table late afternoon, but was in a hurry. They were able to get the food out quickly without loss in quality.

I ordered a relatively light amount. The pork and shrimp (siu mai) was really good! As was the Custard Bun and Sticky Rice. The shrimp spring rolls were good, but slightly overdone. Possibly due to my request for speedy service? Either way, this locations definitely delivers in overall taste. The servers were awesome as well. 

Prices seem consistent between the two. I can&#39;t remember the exact amounts at the China Town location. Overall, great place and a welcomed addition!"

We made a reservation online which I got an email confirmation for and if I hadn&#39;t called to confirm, we would&#39;ve never known that they canceled it, without informing us. The lady who picked up the phone said, &#34;you made a reservation at 5:14 and it&#39;s now 5:46 and I just checked the email, I&#39;m sorry. We cannot take reservations less than two hours.&#34; I said, well then why was it available online for me to make a reservation?!?! She kept apologizing and asked me how she can make it better and I told her she can make it better by keeping my reservation. She then replies and says, I can&#39;t do that. What was the point of asking me?! The manager kept saying, &#34;I&#39;ll talk to my computer guy.&#34; Pointless and ineffective.

Anyway, we had to scramble to find a place that would take a group of 13, what an inconvenience. A good business would have taken our reservation and made it work."

We ordered way too much food... I&#39;ll just list down my favorite dim sum items

1) BBQ pork turnover
2) Ha Gow (shrimp dumpling)
3) Puffy egg tarts
4) Pot stickers
5) Deep fried shrimp roll
6) Malay cake
7) deep fried pork dumpling

I&#39;m spoiled when it comes to dim sum because I&#39;m orginally from Hong Kong so I can&#39;t help but compare. But for the Chicagoland area, it is by far the best place out here... it is authentic and delicious but of course not quite the same as back in the homeland. Minghin deserves 5 stars for  the Chicagoland area but I&#39;d give it 4 if it was located back in Hong Kong... which is still an excellent rating.

Anyway, an added bonus is that the place is beautifully decorated and for first time dim sumers the menu is extremely easy to navigate. There are paper menus and all you have to do it write down the amount you want next to the item and there are pictures of each of the items."

When the big day arrived, my company and I tried out some dim sum and ordered our respective dinner entrees. All of it was terrible. To start with, we were unimpressed with the chive/shrimp dumplings- the dough was barely holding together, a mass of goop (there&#39;s no other way to describe it) lumped around filling that smelled awful. It didn&#39;t even smell like seafood; I don&#39;t even know how to describe it. They brought our vegetable crepes next. Perhaps it was the least offensive dish, since it tasted like absolutely nothing, failing to even absorb the flavor of the sauce it came with. 

Still, I had hope. Everything rode on my main meal, the beef with broccoli... and my hope crashed and burned. I knew from the moment I bit into it that the stuff was very fatty, low quality, and too soft from too much tenderizer. I refused to touch another piece and had to satisfy myself with all the broccoli it came with just to satisfy my appetite. I also shared a bit of my companion&#39;s chow mein... and returned to my broccoli when that too turned out to be bad. It didn&#39;t taste different than any chow mein you can get from a sketchy second rate Chinese restaurant, and this place was recognized by Zagat and Michelin? Apparently, some people don&#39;t know taste."

You are also handed a tablet where you can pull up their full menu. Definitely would come back and try their dinner dishes.

The restaurant is very spacious, bright, clean &amp; comfortable. The first two times we came for dim sum, and we came between 10am &amp; 10:30am during the weekends with no wait, but there was long wait after 11am.  Dim sum were made to order, fresh, steamy &amp; delicious.  Between the two visits, we have ordered more than half of the dim sum on the menu.  They are all good except for the roasted pork (燒腩仔）which is too fat, it was 肥燒肉 not the true 燒腩仔！lunch potion stir fry flat rice noodles with beef (干炒牛河）and Yang Chow fried rice (楊州炒飯）were both good.  Service was good &amp; attentive too.  I&#39;m glad that we finally have a decent dim sum place in the suburbs!

However, our dinner experience was quite different.  We ordered General Tso chicken, Kung pao beef, mixed seafood on a nest, stir fry mixed vegetable with garlic, fried rice and a few dim sum (cause they serve dim sum all day).  The dinner dishes were ok, not as good as their dim sum.  The mixed seafood was a little bland, the deep fried nest was not crispy, kung pao beef was not spicy at all and the stir fry vegetables has no garlic flavor.  Service was not good, the waitress might be inexperienced.  It took her a long time to serve us tea (she might have forgotten), she also screwed up on our wine order (gave us different kind of wine), we have to ask twice before we got fork &amp; knife, etc.

Having said all that, we are thrilled that there is a new dim sum place to go closer to home and we will definitely go back and hope Minghin can keep up with the quality!"

The food was very good, and not as salty as some of the places I&#39;m used to patronizing in the city.  Dim sum starts at $3.50 per dish, vs $3 downtown, but the dumplings are all large and full of meat and veggies, so you&#39;re definitely getting your money&#39;s worth.  It&#39;s easy to order too much and have to take it home.  However, too much food is a much better problem to have than not enough food.

The only reason I&#39;m giving this place 4 stars is that there&#39;s a lot of empty space in the dining areas.  Since you actually order from a menu and they bring the food to you, rather than pushing carts like traditionally occurs downtown, they could probably find a way to fit more tables in the dining room to help cut down on the hour long wait.  I know part of that was the demand at 12:00 on a Sunday, but I heard about 15 groups called ahead of mine where they left the restaurant rather than wait.  They could cut down on reneging with more tables, since they don&#39;t need to make room for carts to maneuver.

All in all, expect good food, plenty of it, and expect to wait for a table between 11am and 2pm on a weekend."

Although it may be one of the 2 go-to places for dim sum, diners need to be aware that their lotus rice is much smaller than other places and their egg tarts are overwhelmingly soaked with meat fat. I can taste the fat. An alternative good dim sum place is on Miner Street in Arlington Heights. Their double cooked pork is a waste of money and they do use a lot of filler vegetables and eggplants in their chicken eggplant dish, They still have some ways to go."

The interior design is very elegant, they put alot of effort into making it a classy dining experience. I like how it&#39;s bright and spacious, very pleasant ambiance, which is usually lacking in the Asian dining experience.
 Now for the food...classic dim sum dishes with depth, like the sixth taste bud, the umami. All of the food was served HOT and was brought out as it was made. The hot and sour large order was JUMBO. Very generous portions of all dishes and service was attentive. It was great to just walk in today and get a table, I have a feeling that in the future, the line will be out the door.

One being their quick, fast service. Today, I must say, was quite the opposite experience. They had one lady taking orders, prepping food, AND checking customers out. There was one guy on the grill, and then a manager, who was running around like a chicken with no head, trying to fulfill a catering order. Not to mention, she had her young daughter (6-8yrs old) with her, who was helping her gather napkins and other utensils as they sprinted out the door. If you see my picture, you can clearly see the ridiculous line, almost to the entrance.

I get it, people call off for specific reasons, but if you have a catering order(s), please make sure you&#39;re properly staffed to accommodate your customers, especially during the lunch rush hour.

Hats off to the girl for keeping her composure despite the line, and angry customers. She kept the smile on her face, and did her best to take care of each and every one of us.

LOL, just kidding! I still love ya, Chipotle. But, HELLO Qdoba!!!!!! You have two new fans for sure!

My hubby and I have been wanting to try Qdoba for ever I have heard from a lot of people that Qdoba is awesome and that we have to try it, so we finally made our way over tonight. We had to exchange my iPad case at the AT&amp;T store next door so this was the perfect place to grab a bite. 

First of all, the place is very clean. I was pleasantly surprised and you all know how important cleanliness is to me! The tables were clean, the glass door and counter we&#39;re spotless.

The staff was so kind explaining how everything works because we had never been and let me tell you that when I saw they offered a &#34;combo meal&#34; of sorts that you can actually pick and choose what you want to eat, made me very happy! More importantly, Qdoba, you have that magical Coke machine which makes my hubby out-of-this-world-excited!!

It would appear to me that Qdoba is NOT Chipotle. I repeat, it&#39;s NOT CHIPOTLE! Even I have been comparing the two incorrectly. They don&#39;t overly season their proteins which is not a problem because I like that they allow you to select a sauce and decide how you want your meal to taste. You have 3 options: Warm 3-cheese Queso, Ancho Chili BBQ Sauce and Ranchera  Sauce. I encourage you to try one of these 3 options! Ask them for a sample. They will gladly oblige. 

There are 5 salsas to try. Mix it up, people, they have lots to choose from. (I know I ended a sentence in a preposition. My Freshman English teacher, would fail me.)

Main items include Burritos, Taco Salads, Tacos, Craft 2 (that&#39;s the build your own meal I was talking about earlier, Nachos, Quesadillas and so much more! 

My husband got a burrito with the shredded beef with BBQ sauce and LOVED it. I got the Craft 2 with Mexican Gumbo and 2 tacos. It was very good. It&#39;s totally fast casual but very fresh. I love all the options they have. The variety of veggies and salsas is excellent. I liked the idea that you can completely customized your meal from start to finish. Even having the Coke Freestyle machine goes with the theme of being able to customize things to your specifications. Love it!

We&#39;ll definitely be back. This is a great spot and being that we&#39;re in this area often, I&#39;m guessing this will be our Qdoba of choice. See you soon, Beth, Becky and Adam! Thanks again for the great first time experience at Qdoba!

After the recent controversy over Chipotle&#39;s health violations, I was still craving that burrito.  I decided to give Qdoba a try after having tried it back home (Western Illinois).  To my surprise, they were giving everyone one free Knock-Out taco to try!  While it was not the best taco I have ever had, it was a great taco for being $0!

I ordered two large drinks, one steak burrito and chips with spicy queso.  All of this was about $17 - not terrible for saving some for the next day&#39;s lunch as well.  The queso was perfect, warm, and exactly what I wanted.  I know that it says &#34;spicy&#34; but I ended up adding a little more hot sauce to mine to give it the extra kick.  The steak was fresh and warm, which I found very appealing since sometimes in the &#39;line-restaurants&#39; the meat looks like it&#39;s been sitting on that room temp bar for a while... This burrito was wonderful and I enjoyed it that evening and the day after!  I&#39;m definitely going to make the switch over to Qdoba for the long run."

Their best item:  The regular Queso Sauce (not the diablo one) is super tasty. It goes in their soups, three cheese nachos, and you can ask for it on the side, usually at no charge.   Negative? Not sure if everything is organic. Their website is silent on this.  You&#39;ll have to google that. Chipotle is all nonGMO and organic."

I&#39;m a die hard Chipotle fanatic, but Qdoba is a good alternative mainly because of the mexican gumbo that Chipotle doesn&#39;t have.

I went to a Chipotle here and it completely sucked.  I was devastated.  I couldn&#39;t believe how much different it tasted than back home.  Being so distraught and craving my burrito fix, I saw a bunch of Qdoba&#39;s and decided what could I lose?

This Qdoba is better than that one near my place in NY.  Everything tasted the same, except the steak was extremely soft, not chewy.  I had the mexican gumbo and it was perfect.  The staff was nice and courteous.

Judging by the reviews of how bland and nasty the food is here, not sure if I caught this place on a good day, or if I&#39;m seriously missing out on some hidden gem around here.  This place is just fine...."

You can appreciate the food if you DON&#39;T compare it to Chipotle. 

Cilantro rice is flavorless. Unless you like globs of plain rice, of course. 

White flour tortilla was fine. They offer wheat too. You know you&#39;re in DullsVille when those big bites of rice globs with tortilla bore your taste buds into sadness. 

Lots of meat options, none of them worth mentioning. 
Guacamole is decent. Lots of hot sauce options. (And I think Bbq sauce too) 

There&#39;s also some sort of queso cheese sauce they keep pushing, but I don&#39;t think the human heart should be put through all that. 

I would eat it again, but only if the line anywhere else was too long."

My husband (who loves a deal almost as much as I do) was my &#34;buy one&#34; (or maybe it was the other way around...) on our fabulous weekday lunch date.

Normally I opt for hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants because a) I love supporting local entrepreneurs b) while surely Americanized, these smaller eateries fill their tortillas with love &amp; I can taste the difference c) real Mexican food joints usually have some kick-butt salsa &amp; I loves me some good spicy food! Qdoba isn&#39;t exactly authentic Mexican food, but like I said, I was willing to give it a shot.

We both got chicken BBQ burritos, which came stuffed with rice, beans, our choice of salsa &amp; extras (sour cream, guac, grilled veggies, cheese and/or lettuce).  With 2 drinks &amp; the coupon, our total came out to be just over $12, which is not too shabby for lunch for two.

The food is decent.  It&#39;s on par, taste wise, with other gringo burrito joints (Chipotle, Baja Fresh, etc) &amp; the prices are pretty good too.  What I do think gives Qdoba a bit of an edge, however, is that they offer a variety of sauces (in addition to salsas) as well as other menu items like quesadillas, tacos &amp; salads.  While I know that you can request these things from other places, like Chipotle, sometimes I like a no-brainer menu that spells it out for you.  And yes, there is the Coke Freestyle machine, but I&#39;m more of a plain club soda with a squeeze of lime type of gal (which I was able to get), so all the bells &amp; whistles didn&#39;t really do much for me.

For standard, Americanized Mexican food that&#39;s served hot &amp; customizable, Qdoba ain&#39;t bad.  In fact, I just might give it another try, with or without a coupon."

I was offered 3 complimentary cupons to come back and try it out again, which was really nice. Hate to say it, but I don&#39;t really feel any different about my experience.

The food to me is just mediocre - the tortillas are sticky, the rice is sticky as well, and the meat just isn&#39;t seasoned very well. Plus it was expensive - over $1 to add guac and something like $8 for a burrito. My bill was almost $10...for just a burrito. Maybe at a sit-down restaurant with a waiter, but at a fast food joint?? How about no. And it is always so loud in there - I can barely hear the employees talking to me.

They do have a TV (kind of random), and a cool Coca Cola soda machine, but those are the only perks. Again, I think Chipotle is leaps and bounds better than this place."

First of all, I&#39;ll say that the customer service is actually extremely good. I came with a friend &amp; we had told them that it was our first time so we didn&#39;t know what to order. The guy behind the counter was quick to give several suggestions on what most people order, and even let us sample a few things. Not only that, but after we got our food and sat down to eat, he came over about 15-20 minutes in and asked if everything was alright and that he&#39;d hoped he made good suggestions (he did!).

We got the nachos with queso, and each got a steak burrito.

The queso MADE MY LIFE! It was warm, thick, and really just turned around the entire meal. It was good with the nachos, and even better with the burrito. You can get the queso IN your burrito! All of the ingredients of the burrito were freshly made, nothing that was sitting out for half a day, and you could really tell the difference.

I can go on about the rest of the flavors, but I truly am obsessed with the star of the show, which is the queso. The queso alone will bring me bad to Qdoba."

Because of its discreet location in Woodfield Green, it is much easier to get your burrito fix here and get out. 

This is my fourth time going to this Qdoba. The first was over 6 years ago, and the next three visits were within the last three months. Most recently, I&#39;ve been a fan of their chicken nachos. 

On my last visit, I got my nachos to go. As the worker was preparing my food, a manager came over and looked at what she was doing. The worker must&#39;ve been new/inexperienced, as she didn&#39;t put the queso on the bottom but on top of the beans and chicken.

It was no big deal to me, but the manager felt the need to point out the error to the girl. It was an awkward and uncomfortable moment. When I said it was no big deal, the manager said it would be if &#34;Corporate&#34; came in and saw it. Well, I&#39;m all for quality control and I understand the need for training and properly managing your employees, but you shouldn&#39;t harshly correct your employees in front of the customer.

The difference between the two is that Chipotle spends millions of dollars on advertisements and customizing their napkins and containers to have their name on it. They also spend millions to tell is their chicken is organic cage free and guacamole made fresh daily.

Qdoba on the other hand doesn&#39;t spend loads of money on that crap while still maintaining the same quality ingredients as chipotle. Instead they use a portion of their money and give back to the community and as well to its customers by offering lots of discounts as well as their loyalty card, all while having more options than its competitor.

When it comes to this location, it is simply the best. The staff is incredible especially Mr. Ruiz who runs the place. The focus on cleanliness and fresh ingredients is impeccable. The friendliness towards its customers is great.

I&#39;m assuming things have changed since the earlier reviews. I&#39;ve always had a positive experience with Qdoba. Their chicken and steak have tasted more grilled and fresh than Chipotle and I suck it up for the extra it seems to cost as well.

Giving something different a try - I went with a naked chicken burrito w/o rice added veggies and some mango salsa. For the extra cost I felt there could have been more veggies added but they tasted really good.

This restaurant is a direct competitor and about the same price range as Chipotle. Here&#39;s the problem -- neither the quality nor the flavor of Qdoba&#39;s food can stand up to Chipotle&#39;s. Qdoba&#39;s dishes tend to be much more bland and are not in the least bit memorable.

While Qdoba serves chicken, beef, steak or vegetarian options for most of the standard dishes, they lack the touch of spices and the barbacoa (barbecued pork) that could possibly give this restaurant a little more personality. The freshness also is a step down, with lettuce that often seems a little on the wilted side.  

In the final analysis, while this restaurant chain is a big step above Taco Bell, it cannot match Chipotle. Qdoba will likely only appeal to those who are looking for really &#34;Americanized&#34; Mexican food."

Having said that everything we ate here was delicious from the bread to the entrees. The steak and seafood were excellent. We ate good here!

I was disappointed they didn&#39;t really do anything for birthdays though. I called in and made a special reservation and nothing was really done to acknowledge it. Next birthday we will go to a better place like The Capital Grille, which beats Shula&#39;s when it comes to service and special occasions! When you pay this much I have higher expectations. Having said that, you have to give Shula&#39;s credit for a high quality meal."

I had the local catch which was grouper. My customer had the 8 oz filet. Food was excellent. Everything is ala carte.

As part of the Westin Northwest Chicago, the staff and chefs take great pride in providing a great dining experience. You start off by having a football and tee brought to your table. The football has the list of prime steaks offered. Then the server will bring over a table of the specials and steaks. They claim some are &#34;better than prime&#34;; all supposedly aged and chosen based on the proper cut and marbling. 

You won&#39;t leave hungry."

Trek on out to the burbs and try this Shula&#39;s - same stuff, and free parking since it is in the Westin.  We chose this one because we could drop the kids off at my mom&#39;s and this was about 15 minutes away from her house.  At noon, we were able to make a 6:00 reservation and the place was really empty even when we left at 7:30.  This also meant that service was great!  

I had the French onion soup to start and the husband got a wedge salad.  I decided to get the mixed grill for my entrée and he went with the usual (filet and baked potato).  My mixed grill was two file medallions and a crab cake and 2 jumbo BBQ shrimp (wrapped in bacon).  My complaint is probably not a legit complaint to most people - the crab cake was too much meat.  I guess I was looking for more of a crispy kind of feel, like you get with a mix of breadcrumbs and celery in the mix.  This had to be about 75% meat, which is great value, but just not my thing.  I regretted not opting for the scallops and left about 50% of the cake on the plate.  The meat was good, as were the shrimp.

Skipped dessert as it was the usual stuff for a steakhouse (carrot cake, lava cake, key lime, crème brulee) 

5 beverages and a coffee later and we were at about $225 all in- so there is no price discount for being out in the burbs - Stella&#39;s are $7 each!"

She also informed us that the sides we large enough to share and she was right my friend and I shared a baked potato which was the size of small football. So you could order different sides and share. Believe me you will not leave hungry.
 We were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary and everyone got cake, but she couldn&#39;t because of her diabetes, but Chante made sure she found something that she could have so she would not be left out.

The manager arrived and explained the kitchen staff were backed up with orders ?
So we went to the open bar to order a hamburger, and were told we could order food but no drinks ???? along came the manager and said we could order food but no drinks ??? another gentleman with same problem talked to the manager and got the same answer ?? went outside for a smoke and met some other unhappy would be diners ,who were ordering a pizza delivery,so we went to our room (tel did not work) used cell to order a pizza, we had a bottle of wine in our room :)so all in all not a great experience, will not stay at the Westin again or go anyway near a Shula&#39;s restaurant, after reading other posts here  i see I am not alone with my adverse post."

Unfortunately Shula&#39;s at the Westin is borderline 3 stars, and it&#39;s the umpteenth time I wish I could pull a half star out of Yelp and make it a 2.5.  The problem with Shula&#39;s is that the cost is right up there with Morton&#39;s, Ruth Chris, and Capital Grille, but they don&#39;t deliver anything close to those experiences.  

Third time eating here in 3 years, late night solo dinner in late January.  It seems they&#39;re afraid, or untrained, on how to be world-class at this Shula&#39;s (vs. Indy location which is GREAT).  Service: bad, as in 10 minutes to see a server, 20 to get a cocktail, 35-40 to place my order.  Had to LITERALLY tell my server I needed to &#34;get this show on the road&#34;.  Really?  For a 100 dollar dinner, and a restaurant close to empty, that wait staff should SMOTHER me with Ruth Chris&#39; or Morton&#39;s crispness, but I received the opposite. 

Ordered the porterhouse, 24 oz., medium rare; my server stood by upon its delivery to table and said &#34;I&#39;ll wait til you cut it and see that it&#39;s done to your liking&#34;.  She stood by with good cause....  My medium rare was medium to well-done, through and through.  Graciously delivered a replacement porterhouse 15 minutes later and it was perfectly cooked.  Potatoes au gratin (Boursin), creamed spinach were tasty.  I&#39;ve had their French onion soup before, and it&#39;s world class.  Ditto for their huge tomato and mozzarella chop salad. 

Another Yelper also mentioned the entire Shula&#39;s presentation, and I have to agree.  I just don&#39;t think they really &#34;get it&#34; when one spends a c-note for dinner, that everything NEEDS to be top-notch and first class.  Presentation of food and the staff&#39;s overall service was weak.

Don Shula would have heads rolling at his namesake restaurant if he popped in for a dinner and drinks.  I&#39;m going to try it again in 3 weeks, update t/c.

My Manhattan was excellent!  And the bartender personally came over and poured it into my martini glass.  Now, why can&#39;t the rest of the wait staff be that responsive??"

It was $20 for all you can eat and we each only had maybe less than a plate so it was quite expensive in proportion,  but if you&#39;re pretty hungry it&#39;s a much better deal. The scalloped potatoes with eggs, cheese, mushrooms and peppers was the highlight though a little under seasoned."

We went there for our anniversary. My wife ordered the filet trio which she said was fine. I ordered the 22 ounce cowboy ribeye. It was very disappointing. Unfortunately I ate the steak instead of sending it back. It was tough and dry. The server asked if we enjoyed the meal? I told him the steak was not tender and hard to cut and chew. He said he would bring another. I had finished it and told him I could not eat another. I asked what grade it was and he said it was &#34;better then prime&#34;. He said it was tough because I ordered it rare. I have grilled steaks at home which are choice and are much more tender. This was not a &#34;Prime&#34; steak. By the tenderness I would say it wasn&#39;t even choice. They did comp the wine which was $28 but should have comped the steak which was $49.

We checked a couple local spots we&#39;d normal eat at and both had significant wait times to be seated.  I decided to use the Opentable app to see if we could get in anywhere quicker.  I had never heard of Shula&#39;s prior to this, but according to Opentable there was no wait.  So I made reservations.  On the way we picked up a 3rd person and shot over there. 

The hostess was very friendly and nice, and she sat us immediately.The fact our party had grown by 1 was not an issue at all.  The place was surprisingly empty for 7 PM on a Saturday night and had people at maybe 5-6 tables.  The atmosphere was upscale and very intimate considering it was attached to a suburban hotel.

My initial feeling about Shula&#39;s was the wait staff is somewhat disorganized.  After we were seated, it took a while for anyone to come by to get us water or take our drink orders.  I only noticed this because it was as empty as it was.  Eventually our waiter came by and offered to show us the steak cart.  We weren&#39;t aware of it, but everything is ala carte.  So you needed to specifically order any sides.  Our waiter didn&#39;t explain this while we were ordering, and walked away after he took our steak order.  We were slightly confused why he didn&#39;t tell us about any sides that came with our meals.  We called him back and asked about them, and that&#39; when he explained we had to order them.

After our waiter took our order, he handed us off to our server.  Our server was a very nice woman and had a good sense of humor.  Which certainly went along way with us enjoying our time there.

Between the 3 of us, we got the crab cake appetizers, 8 ounce Filet mignon, a 12 ounce Ribeye, and Scallops for dinner, with a side of Au Gratin potatoes.  One of our party had 2 glasses of wine, while the other 2 had ice tea. 

The meal was just ok, and was really just an average steak in my opinion.  Nothing to special, but nothing horrible either.  The crab cakes and Au Gratin potatoes were so-so as well... Nothing horrible, but nothing to write home about.  None of these issue caused me to find them inedible, and wasn&#39;t anything I felt the need mention to our waiter.  I just made a mental note of it and ate my meal.   My other two friends seemed ok with their meals, but neither were bragging about them either.

The real surprise came when we got the bill.  Which came to $250 between the 3 of us.  Over $300 including tip.  After I got the bill I was extremely aware of how average our meal was.   I didn&#39;t do any research about Shula&#39;s when I made my reservation, and had just placed it because of the convenience. If I had searched yelp about them prior to making reservations I might have opted we go to a different restaurant.   The price they charged is on par with Gibson&#39;s or Ruth Chris&#39;s... and to be honest we had nowhere near the experience we would have had at one of those restaurants.  

I&#39;d give Shula&#39;s 3 stars for an average meal, but deduct a star for the price."

Went here for my man&#39;s work holiday dinner last night. The apps were off the chain. The BBQ bacon wrapped shrimp was so delicious and soft and perfectly seasoned so you can taste each and every ingredient. The crab cakes were also tasty as were the beef skewers. So tender and melt in your mouth. The sides that come a la carte with the entrees are very shareable and large portioned. I ordered a double baked potato. This was the largest and most cheesiest potato I ever did see. I love cheesy potatoes!! For my entree I ordered the 15oz bone in filet. It was cooked to perfection and again melted in my mouth. I also was able to grab a bite of my bf&#39;s lobster tail. It was amazing! I&#39;m not a lobster lover and usually I need to drench it in butter but this time I needed no sauce for it. It was so so delicious!! For dessert we had the mini cream brûlée sampler. They were banana chocolate and grand mariner. Each was super tasty and perfectly crisped and caramelized on top.

Our food was really good.  I don&#39;t know if I would say it was BETTER than most other high end steak houses, but it really was good.  I had the prime rib, which was an excellent cut of meat.  My wife had grilled salmon with an asian sauce that was really outstanding.

I had their onion soup...I&#39;d get that again..sweet onion taste, not salty, with melted cheese on top yum.  

I had their grilled salmon (didn&#39;t have a taste for steak for lunch) for lunch.  It was pretty good but they lack the amount of vegetables when I asked to double the veggies and remove the starchy carb side.

The service was ok, it wasn&#39;t busy at all and for our party of 6 our wait staff was half taking our drink orders.  

The meals were slow coming to us, I mean we weren&#39;t in a rush but man a 2 hour lunch just to eat was a bit too long and it wasn&#39;t at all busy, did I mentioned that it wasn&#39;t busy?

This restaurant is in a hotel so you&#39;re sharing parking space with people who are spending the night in the hotel.  It&#39;s a place you shouldn&#39;t wear shorts and a tshirt...nice casual outfit please.

The hostess and staff were friendly saying hello and good bye, they know that you&#39;ll be spending money here so they better!.

The space looked like they have 2 separate rooms.  It looked like you were in a high class man cave hence all football memorabilia, big leather chairs, and even football leather covered menus.

I&#39;ve been here before for dinner several years ago.  As I remembered it was pretty dark not dim, dark to a point that the waiter used a flashlight to show me how medium rare my steak was.  No it was bloody so I had to ask him to reheat it.  I don&#39;t mind paying for a good steak, but this place was meh...  I&#39;d rather go to Ruth Chris&#39;s and spend that kind of money there.  I would only come here if someone else is picking up the bill."

The best way to summarize the meal: it may have been an acceptable experience for an Outback Steakhouse, but not at Shula&#39;s.  

For starters, the hotel is dreary.  It&#39;s isolated in an office park area, and has no energy at all.  That carries over to the restaurant, which is off the main lobby. 

Our group of 6 was seated inside the bar area, which was confusing to say the least.  You don&#39;t spend $500 on dinner to sit in the bar.  

Service was mixed.  A couple drink orders gotten wrong... a couple times they had to recheck/reconfirm orders.  Not horrible, but it was noticed.  

The food was the letdown.  Totally underwhelming.  I know steak, and my $44 ribeye, ordered medium rare, was more of a medium well.  The mac &amp; cheese was pretty good.  A few drinks from the bar were great.. a couple others were terrible.  

Bottom line- the overall experience, from ambience, to service, to food, was not what I would expect from a Shula&#39;s and from the prices they charge."

The calamari &#34;fries&#34; were some of the best I have had. Tender, thick strips. Granted, I like the tentacles and this had none, but the meaty thick strips were great. The marinara sauce had an odd spice like maybe anise. I got the filet mignon and it was done perfectly medium rare. Also tender with great flavor. The dipping butter wasn&#39;t needed. Salt wasn&#39;t needed. It was just good meat. The side was really for two or three people and we weren&#39;t warned of that. I had the crab and mac cheese and it was stupendously creamy. Just took a lot of leftovers.
Server thought he was funnier than he was. Unnecessarily flirty and just odd. He would also walk away without waiting for a full response from us.

Very expensive. My meal alone, with two drinks, was $100. So great food, yes, but it was a splurge."

Usually the same things are present: high prices, fancy sounding foods, ok taste.  They have great ingredients here but you can tell they could really benefit from increasing the skill involved in preparation.

I ordered the 24 oz prime rib.  Perfectly seasoned but just slightly overcooked.  You can tell that the meat had great marbalization but had a little more attention gone into presentation, the au jus could have been put on the side to increase the flavor.

Went there for brunch buffet around 8:30 am this morning and the hostess/receptionist misquoted the price of $50 vs $15.  I asked twice but miscommunication was the theme.  Didn&#39;t bother telling me that kids under 5 yo were free.  So I elected the menu.  The waitress gave me the bill and then when I found out the brunch was $15, no apology, rolled eyes, and basically a &#34;I hate my job&#34; demeanor.  The food was not bad, but not really what I wanted.  Lost my appetite from the lack of a welcome, smile, or effort to accomodate at all."

We came on a Sunday night for my husband&#39;s birthday.  The place was dead as a doornail.  There was only one other couple at a table when we walked in.  When we were seated at our table, they put a football on the table which had the steak menu on it.  Frankly, I hated having that football on the table.  Just give it to me in a menu.

On special they had fried calamari for an appetizer.  We ordered that.  The calamari was cooked perfectly.  Tender and crispy.  I ordered the tomato &amp; gorgonzola salad as a side, and loved it.  No skimping on the cheese here, and the vinaigrette tasted homemade and fresh.  For our steaks I ordered the NY strip, and my husband ordered the cowboy steak.  Both were cooked exactly like we ordered them.  

The service was friendly and attentive.  Things did move slowly, but one cannot rush good food.  

I would come back.  The food was good, but frankly, I would like to see a few more people in the restaurant."

So took the dive to have seafood and not steak...in the Midwest!  Never shying from a risk sometimes has it&#39;s rewards as it did in this case.  Went for the seafood trio appetizer with a side of steak fries and couldn&#39;t be happier.  Nice fresh (?) lobster, lump crab and shrimp served with a trio of sauces fit the bill perfectly.  Offsetting the cold fish with hot fries was brilliant, if I do say so myself.  Adding a Lemon Drop cocktail ( perfectly prepared) made this a delightful meal!"

The place was as dead as a doornail and the paragraph below will explain why. 

The french onion and clam chowder were barely warm, microwaved of course. My boyfriend was in the mood for a burger so he ordered one - unfortunately Shulas Steak house wasn&#39;t sure what medium was because it was so well done he didn&#39;t want to finish it. I ordered the french dip sandwich and upon starting to eat it I realized that it didn&#39;t taste right.. apparently the chef wasn&#39;t sure what a french dip sandwich was and served me a steak pannini of some sort, and it was awful! The only good thing about the entire experience was the fresh bread they served. So I would recommend this place for bread and that&#39;s about it. Oh, one more important thing - swatting away the fruit flies is an obvious sign of a restaurant which has gone down hill.. NEVER coming back here again."

It was on the late side close to 10 -  and the bar tender said the kitchen could deliver my medium rare 12oz fillet quickly.  
More than an hour later a seriously overdone toughened piece of gray beef arrived. I rarely send food back but this wasn&#39;t edible. 
The next attempt did come quickly mostly bc it wasn&#39;t really cooked at all. Actually still felt a bit frozen in the middle.  At this point I ate a bit around the edges and called it a night. 
Would never return. Not only were both steaks poorly prepared but the service was slow."

The restaurant wasn&#39;t packed on a weeknight and we had a wonderfully attentive staff with lots of good humor and none-too-obtrusive service.

Not sure if we&#39;d be back again, we thought we&#39;d give every category on the menu a shot, from the spirits &amp; wine list to the soup (French Onion, which they kindly split for us) to 1 huge RICH side of Crab mac n cheese to steaks (of course) and both desserts (a molten chocolate cake and the chocolate souffle, one of which was complimentary due to our special celebration). 

Shula&#39;s seems to be an extension of the famed Miami Dolphins&#39; coach den, if I were to imagine what his home museum would look like, from engravings of his famous quotes on and off the field, to the pictures of his team and celebrity friends. While the signed football menu was a thematic touch, it was a bit cheesy. Furthermore, there was no listing of prices for our steak entrees on the football, in the menu or from the server&#39;s descriptions, and we felt it would be unclassy to ask about it, so we kept mum, and assume that if one knew to pick a place like this to dine at, one is expected to be able to foot the price tag. Oh well.

The steaks were well prepared -- we had the bone-in ribeye and tenderloin. Definitely tops in our list of steak places. Simply seasoned, the cuts were allowed to shine in their own juices.

If one were a chocoholic, one would take much delight in the sinfully rich molten lava. However, that was a tad much for me. But the preparation was well thought out with accompaniments of ice cream, fresh cream and sweet cream sauce. Surprisingly, the souffle held up really well two days later.

At the end of our meal, the staff gave us a card signed by members of the staff and a free appetizer card. How sweet."

I guess I&#39;ll be honest and say a part of me regrets going because i feel it set the bar too high for future steakhouses and restaurants in general, for that matter. We loved EVERYTHING about it. I dont think we stopped smiling the entire time we were there. I live in Florida and was visiting Chicago. One of my business partners told me I absolutely HAD to eat at Shula&#39;s. Its a little bit of a drive from downtown Chicago, but this guy knows his steaks, so I made it a point to go there. 

I wish I saved it for the end of my trip because we were disappointed with every other placed we dined and the catch phrase became &#34;its good... but it aint Shula&#39;s&#34;. The service was perfect, like they could read our minds. They were there to refill drinks and clear tables, but never bothered us while we had our mouths full of the heavenly food we were enjoying thoroughly (I hate being interrupted when eating or in conversation, so they get big points for that). 

We ate there several times in the course of a week, each time was amazing. Our favorite appetizers were the crab cakes and the JUMBO tempura shrimp... we&#39;d never seen shrimp that big and never tasted any so good... the size was closer to small lobsters than shrimp. I had a burger for lunch while my girlfriend enjoyed a chicken dish... both amazing. The salads were fresh and crisp. 

The entrees... wow... ok... we had dinner there a couple times and each got different meals each time and shared. one word... PORTERHOUSE... its 24oz of heaven... my mouth is literally watering right now as I reminisce. I vow to return and take on the 48oz. We also enjoyed the fillets and the prime rib. I&#39;m not a huge fan of crab, but the crab cakes and filet oscar were amazing and my girlfriend had to fend off my attempts to steal more bites after she gave me a taste. even the sides are amazing! twice baked potato and truffle fries... enough said! 

Definitely leave your diet at the door, this is a place to truly enjoy the food, the ambiance, and the service. to top it all off, not once but TWICE we were greeted by Chief Mark. I have NEVER seen a chief great tables, and he spoke with us twice. The first time he humbly accepted our praises of the meal we were eating and then gave us some tips for getting around Chicago and where to go and answered some of my questions about the restaurant a Coach Shula. The second time he actually recognized us and even remembered our names! That was honestly the highlight of the trip, we felt like celebrities. 

It really felt like we were HIS guests and he cared and took pride in the work he and his team did and the amazing food they produced. I could go on and on, but the bottom line is this is a restaurant you MUST experience. I&#39;m looking for an excuse to go back to Chicago just to go there again.When I discuss our trip, the first thing I talk about is Shula&#39;s. To Chief Mark and his team at Shula&#39;s, we thank you for an amazing dining experience and the suggestions you made that really helped us both enjoy Chicago unlike we&#39;d ever anticipated. I&#39;ve NEVER written a review for a restaurant before, but our experience left me with no choice but to sing your praises."

To start off, the dining experience was excellent. I liked that they showed us each cut of meat, and had us cut our steaks to be sure they were cooked correctly.

But for such a fancy restaurant, it&#39;s a little strange that they put a football on a tee on my plate to show me their specials. Also a little weird: my wife and I had to share one menu. 

For the price of the entrees, you would expect exceptional taste (at least I would). This is what I was left most disappointed in. the steak was good, but it wasn&#39;t great. In that atmosphere, I expect great. 
It was also a little disappointing that all of their sides were a la carte. The steaks didn&#39;t even come with a small side salad.

I would leave the option to go back, but only for a special occasion. Even then, I would evaluate my other options."

With similar steak places. Ribeye a bit undercooked but very tasty.

(Hint - I think they are busiest (and maybe at their best) during the weekdays as this is adjacent to the lobby of the Westin Northwest, catering to business travellers.)  Steaks have always been cooked spot-on, with large sides that have been scrumptious also.  I miss the high-back chairs that they used to have at every table, but I think there are still some tables with them.  Staff has always been friendly.  They used to do a breakfast buffet that was pretty good also, but I haven&#39;t done that for a while (get up early...who wants to do that??)  I am not a big fan of football in general, but if you are, there is plenty of memorabilia around (duh, the name is Schulas!)  Anyways, if you are in town for a business mtg at the Westin and you want to take someone out and drop some coin without having to travel anywhere (and honestly, within the surrounding 10 miles, there are a few other steak places, but i wouldn&#39;t rate them a 5 either) it is definitely worth stopping at Schula&#39;s.

Valet service failed big time. Sure, it was the coldest day of the winter..., but we had to walk for good few minutes before we get to the entrance...and back after we had good meal.

We were not disappointed.

The football menu on the table is well, cheesy, but whatever..Shula was a great coach and I can see why they do it to be unique...  whatever..(after reading some other Yelp reviews this seemed to be an issue..get past it...it doesn&#39;t stay there throughout dinner anyway, and you get more info from the cart presentation anyway)

1.  Service was great, hostess and wait staff combined, excellent... 5 stars
2.  Ambience was cool too. Lots of old football pics and &#34;Shula&#34; quotes to go around.. very classic steakhouse feel.. 4:5 stars
3.  Steak.  That&#39;s what we were here for anyway..  in a word, AWESOME.. VERY MUCH ON PAR WITH MORTONS / CAPITAL GRILL &amp; GIBSONS.. personally, I prefer it over Ruth Chris&#39; butter-soaked steaks..  5 stars easy...
4. Appetizers &amp; sides..  Okay, not awesome but not great either..  &#34;meh&#34; is what I&#39;d describe them as.. Lobster Mashed potatoes SOUNDS great, but then some brown gravy is tossed on top of it and you wind up missing the Lobster taste you were hoping for...  Vegetables are vegetables, IMHO.  Nothing memorable here.  3 stars...
5.  Dessert.  Two words... CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE...  Very nice.  Very HUGE.  Seriously enough for two people... (One suggestion to anyone from Shula&#39;s reading this... Serve a warm chocolate sauce along with the souffle.)  It would make this already fantastic dessert even more awesome...  4 stars... 

So all in all, 4 stars is pretty reasonable for Shula&#39;s.   It&#39;s definitely not a &#34;place to be seen&#34; if you&#39;re into that, but if you want a good meal, good service in a relaxing atmosphere, look no further than Shula&#39;s..."

The place was dead on a Saturday night. This wasn&#39;t a huge concern to me, but if you&#39;re looking for a hopping place with some background noise, you will not find it here. There was a total of four other parties that were seated. Moving on, I did not care for the table setup. First, they put a football on the table that lists different cuts of steak on it. This is a waste because the football doesn&#39;t even list the prices of the steak on it. Second, each person has a full setup arranged in front of him or her with a master plate, a bread plate, a wine glass, a water glass, two forks, a bread knife, a steak knife, and a butter knife. If this wasn&#39;t enough crap as it was, there is a candle in the corner to take up even more space and by the time you receive you menus, you feel very overwhelmed due to the lack of room that is available. Personally, I suggest that they ditch the football, ditch the master plate (it had no purpose), ditch the wine glasses unless wine is ordered, and ditch the drinking glasses until a drink is ordered. At least, my girlfriend and I got a good laugh out of being smothered by everything.

Service: 

We made a reservation and asked for a booth. We got a booth in a nice quiet corner, I could not have asked for more from the host. However, we were only given one dinner menu and a wine menu. I believe that it is standard at their restaurant to only offer one dinner menu at each table and that it was not a mental error on the host&#39;s part. However, I found it very aggravating and pressure-some to have to share a menu. I wanted to cross-examine the menu with my girlfriend and did not want to feel rushed into making my selection as she stood by with her selection already in mind. I immediately requested another menu and had that football punted back to its glass display case. Our server was fine. Not someone that stuck out as being worth requesting again in the future but not an inattentive dim wit either. Just average, nothing special. However, I did like the presentation that was offered by the server in terms of showcasing each cut of meat so one knew what he or she is diving into. 

Food: 

We ordered a tomato mozzarella chop salad as a starter. YUCK! We wish we knew what we were getting into before we ordered that. It was nothing more than a mere five slices of tomato topped with purple onion, a glob of mozzarella, and a sprinkle of basil. I had never ordered this dish before at a restaurant, so I was unfamiliar with the fact that it really was not your typical type of salad. Don&#39;t get this item unless you know what your getting into. I ordered the 24oz Porterhouse and she order the 12oz Filet Mignon. As a side, I got the Crab Macaroni and Cheese. She ordered the Double Baked Potato. For the record, one side would have been plenty for two people, they were large. The steaks were perfect, some of the best we ever had. When they were brought to the table, the server asked that we cut into them to see if they were prepared to our liking. They were cooked exactly the way we requested them. After her first bite, my girlfriend confirmed that her Shula steak trumped others that she&#39;s had a Wildfire, another restaurant we visit frequently. I have to admit, my Porterhouse was pretty exceptional too. It was simply seasoned and extremely tender. As far as the sides were concerned, I could have done without the crab macaroni. I did not care for it, because it was made with a white cheddar onion cheese sauce and the crab tasted like imitation meat out of the package. My girlfriend did not care for her double baked potato, because there were too many green onions introduced into this dish before it was baked a second time. On a final note, the dessert was fantastic. The Creme Brulee was out of this world. It was served in an extra large dish, double the size of any portion I have ever gotten from another restaurant. YUM! 

Price: 

$3 Ice Tea 
$9 Tomato Mozzarella Chop Salad 
$42 Filet Mignon 
$44 Porterhouse 
$12 Crab Macaroni and Cheese 
$9 Double Bake Potato 
$8 Creme Brulee 

Our total for the evening was $162 w/20% tip. We definitely could have done without the Tomato Mozzarella Chop Salad, the Crab Macaroni and Cheese, and the Double Bake Potato. Knocking off these unnecessary items would have brought our total down to $125. 

Final Verdict: 

This place had the opportunity to get a 4, but it fell short due to a couple of reasons. It lost one star because we did not care for the salad or side dishes. It lost another star because the menu was lacking. It did not give prices on the steaks. It did not give any descriptions on appetizers or entrees. This would have saved us from buying the chop salad and would have allowed us to see what ingredients were in the sides before ordering them. We will definitely go here again, but stick with just steaks and dessert or ask for a more descriptive menu before venturing into trying anymore of their appetizers and sides."

I won&#39;t wax on about the cheesy football, one menu for the table - my fellow yelpers had prepped me to avoid those things. However the lobster bisque was thick and had a tiny arbitrary bit of lobster, lamb was a nice cut, but it was tough. The spinach wasn&#39;t creamy, but was rendered ok by so much garlic and cheese.

I found my steak a bit over-cooked and surely under-seasoned. I should have sent it back for the over-cooking, but we had friends with us, so I didn&#39;t do that. Tom&#39;s side dish -- crab/macaroni/cheese - was missing, and because we were all sharing sides, he didn&#39;t notice they&#39;d accidentally delivered garlic mashed until we were about through.

It has the obligatory &#34;upscale steak house&#34; decor, with some football memorabilia thrown in. Nice but nothing visually exciting, new, or in any way dynamic. Not that it matters, you go here to get a good steak.....which you may or may not get. It seems that they have issues with over doing the steak. These are good cuts of meat and they&#39;ve got someone back there who need to work on their timing or technique. So be forewarned if you are very particular about how your steak is cooked.

It&#39;s worth a try but you&#39;re better off just going to Wildfire, they always cook it right there."

Overall, it is a nice, upscale steak house.  I felt that the football menu was a bit over-the-top, especially since it contains no additional information that the regular menu doesn&#39;t include.  Also, be forewarned that prices for the steaks are not printed anywhere.  Neither the football menu nor the regular menu have prices.  We did ask at the end of the presentation.  I sort of feel that this is a put-on, and I am a bit annoyed by this tactic.  My steak was mostly good, but had some amount of gristle which I normally wouldn&#39;t expect at these prices.  Everyone else seemed satisfied with their steaks, though, so it might have been an aberration."

Have no plans to return.

However, feel like some time in the past month or so ownership or recipes have changed. The brisket, garlic mash and Mac and cheese were all similar, but kind of fell short to how it was previously. Visually, nothing I got looked like what I had enjoyed before and the real kicker for me had to be the change in hot sauce, a jalapeño hot sauce for bbq? 

Probably going to have to discover another place for my bbq cravings.."

My boyfriend and I drove over pretty late at night, about a half an hour before they closed (yeah I know we were being that annoying couple). They already had all their chairs up like they were going to close, we dined in anyway. They were kind and helpful.

The inside was cute and properly decorated for the theme, with chalk boards and wooden tables. The only thing I thought was a little funny, is how it got pretty smokey inside. The employee proceeded to open the front door all the way (and it was just freezing outside). I didn&#39;t say anything for a little, but then had my boyfriend politely ask if they could shut it. I mean we were sitting pretty much right in front of the door. Other than that they were pretty accommodating.

Funny thing is I actually ordered the wrong thing. I tend to do this with barbeque. I&#39;ll order rib tips, when I actually mean to order burnt ends (which are my favorite). To be fair though,they weren&#39;t on the menu in the restaurant, just on the take home menu. My rib tips came with 2 sides. I chose cornbread and fries. All of it was presented nicely on a big tray, and it was honestly just more than I could have ate at once. They had a few different sauces you can choose to dress your things with, I chose the sweet and it had a very good flavor. The rib tips had a decent amount of meat on them and the fries and cornbread were good as well. I&#39;m not sure if they do this for every meal, but they give us a few little pieces of jalapeño corn bread as well. I guess to sample (Twas good). My boyfriend ordered a burger and said that was good as well. 

Definitely a place to come back to, and try new entrees and sides. Next time we&#39;ll come earlier too!"

With that being said they NEED to fix two things, their poor choice in bread for sandwiches-they need a new source as the one they provide is cheap and makes me not want a sand which. The other problem is their 8.00 fake chicken tenders that are three little stocks the size of your middle finger- the worst part is that you know it comes straight out of a freezer bag.

We got the 3-meat combo dinner to share which also comes with jalapeno hushpuppies &amp; 2 sides.  The 3 meats were tried were the jerk chicken, pulled pork &amp; the beef brisket.  All of them were quite good but the jerk chicken &amp; pulled pork were the standouts.  They give you a little cup of sauce per meat (1/4 C?) so if you like it really saucy I&#39;d ask for more.  The 3 sauces were also very good - we tried the sweet bbq sauce (tasted like a rootbeer bbq sauce), the smoky bbq sauce &amp; the white sauce (Garlicky goodness on that jerk chicken &amp; brisket! Wow!).

For our sides we got the jalapeno slaw (AMAZING!) and the burnt ends baked beans - also good.

We ordered an extra side of the hushpuppies since the meal just comes w/2 and we love us some hushpuppies!  I&#39;m sad to report those were the only disappointment of the meal - they were the blandest hushpuppies we&#39;d ever had, though dipping them in that white sauce perked &#39;em up.

There&#39;s a reason the prices of the 2 &amp; 3 meat combos are steep - they give you a TON of meat.  We got 6 servings out of it (so 3 meals for the Hubs &amp; I) with the meat alone.  The sides of slaw &amp; beans only lasted for the first meal for us both - we gobbled those up.  Even for someone with a big appetite I could see the 3-meat combo meal being 2 dinners for them.

We will definitely enjoy Elgin BBQ Pit some more in the future!"

Ask for combination of both slaw as sides. We tried both slaw pineapple and jalapeno together and it was amazing!!"

I went there today with a few co-workers after seeing on my drive the day before. I have had little to no luck finding a good BBQ place in the Chicago suburbs, so imagine my surprise when there was one only 10 minutes away from my office!

Anyway, from the moment I walked in I was sold! This place is ripe with authenticity, and believe me, I know my BBQ. I wish I had tried more things so I could give a more accurate review! My meal was the brisket (a usual crowd favorite) with collard greens and mac &amp; cheese. The mac was just okay, nothing special, although the greens were amazing! It could be because I haven&#39;t had any good old-fashioned southern greens in a while, but they were really delicious today. Just the right amount of salt, which is rare in restaurant cooking. 

On that same note, the brisket was to die for! So good! I usually have to ask for the ends at BBQ places, but they just gave it to me this time, so crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. A definite must try.

The staff was friendly and the service was relatively speedy for such a large group and the fare. The seating is minimal though, so be polite if you&#39;re going with a big group and go after the lunch rush. 

I will definitely be back, and hopefully they impress me enough next time to raise my review to a 5!"

Stopped off with a friend for dinner. He a rack of dry rubbed ribs and me a mix of burnt ends and rib tips. Mounds of food with excellent flavor complemented with sauce on the side. The proprietor prefers dry rub   but likes to get to know his customer&#39;s likes and will offer to amend the order with wet barbeque.

The sides are both inventive and flavorful.. the coleslaw is to die for. Each side seems to bring out the flavor of the main coarse.

This is one of those places that sticks with you and you say &#34;hey I&#39;m in the area and got to drop bye!&#34; Seating is minimal, so it lends itself to carry-out more than dine in.

Stop in...it&#39;s rare that you find someone who takes the time to be both this devoted and 
creative to culinary pursuits.... you wont be disappointed

I would like to see an Entree combo available at a slight up charge where you get a half portion and a half portion.

The Mac and cheese had an odd flavor to it I can&#39;t describe. I&#39;m not sure if it was because it had been sitting for a while or what.

Overall I was pleased, but not wowed, by our experience. The delivery was very speedy, and the driver was quite pleasant. We ordered the Pick 3 combo to share- and they called and stated they were out of the ribs which made me sad. The meat and sauces were all good, and the sides were decent but very small- not really sharing size. We will likely try again in the future because it was okay."

But trust me... you will smell it!! They have very limited parking. That could explain why there is not much business coming in and out. 

Upon pulling up and getting out of the car I knew I was going to atlest have some decent food. I walked in and noticed that they didn&#39;t have much seating didn&#39;t matter to me. I ordered the combo dinner and my wife orded the rib tip dinner. My daughter got the kids chicken fingers. 

My plate(or should I say tray???): brisket and pulled pork. The brisket was on point. Tender fall of the fork with a nice burnt crust. went well with all 3 of the sauces the had to offer. The smoke flavor tastes like hickory and mesquete. Maybe some applewood or cherry. But it was great. I give it 9/10. The pulled pork: great flavor.. full of taste. The texture was just right. You didn&#39;t get that squeek while biting. (Tells you that the meat is dry) portions for both were great. I like the pulled pork with the sweet sauce they had. 

My wife&#39;s tray-o-rib tips: lets admit we all steal food from our spousea and kids... so I get to reveiw it all! The rib tips we&#39;re great i give them an 8/10. I liked them best with the &#34;mild&#34; sauce they had. 

My daughter&#39;s chicken was good as well. Had a smokey flavor for being fried. The fries that came with were great. 

Sides: pineapple-jalapeno slaw... was amazing... just the right amount of heat and flavor. The mac n cheese was great.  And the corn... well it was corn. 
We were given free banana pudding for desert on account of fathers day. It was the best I&#39;ve had.

I loved this place, my wife did, and my daughter did. The service is great. The owner is a family man. Great guy. Great place Great food. I will be back!"

The pastrami was very delicious and tender, however I found the portions to be small for the price charged. $9.49 for a small sandwich and small portion of fries?  Yea, I expect that at sit down restaurants... but they (generally speaking) give bigger portions.  Also not quite enough thousand island on the sandwich.  The wings were good and the sauce was decent but not great.  The fries were good but nothing special.  $9.99 for a pound of wings, netted us about 9 drummettes... not unheard of but didn&#39;t make me want to order it again.

Baked beans were awesome, huge chunks of pork in my serving. The jalapeño cole slaw was very fresh, crisp and not much liquid at all. My wife had the pulled pork, they must have given her a pound of pork. Massive serving. 

I told the people behind the counter it was the best BBQ I&#39;ve had. Been to Carolinas, Alabama, Texas and am a frequent flyer at the rib fests in Chicago each year. Hands down the sauce and the brisket at this place killed it. The dry rub on the ribs is outstanding, you won&#39;t need sauce on them.

 I eyeballed the smoker while I waited. The cook opened it up a couple times to spray water on the contents. I could see beer can chicken, ribs and a few other slabs inside. 
 Ten minutes later I was eating and found it to be pretty tasty. I chose the traditional sauce which was decent, a little bland but sweet and appropriate to the meat. Baked beans were flavorful. Cornbread was good... Not the sweet kind. I washed it down with sweet tea.
 I will come back to try the chicken and the brisket which I saw on another diners plate and thought looked fantastic."

I had to settle for rib tips and brisket as my wife and son were hungry and didn&#39;t want to go somewhere else. It was tasty however, NO RIBS.

The first meal I got (Brisket &amp; Rib combo) was so good and when I heated the leftovers up in the oven the next day (350 degrees &amp; just let it cook until I could smell it) did NOT, i repeat DID NOT dry that brisket out (or the ribs for that matter). I&#39;ll be honest, that brisket was even better the next day ~ how can that even be possible. Alright let&#39;s get back to today&#39;s trip. 

Got the combo again (and the niece got the pulled pork sandwich, again) but this time got the second hardest thing to bbq correctly ~ the half chicken. Started with the driest part known to man, the breast. Not gonna lie, wasn&#39;t as good as that brisket but then i am not a fan of bbq chicken to begin with. HOWEVER...that chicken is not only NOT DRY but really doesn&#39;t need to be sauced at all. Same goes for what is outstanding pulled pork. Got the Alabama White to try it (look up the origins of this sauce ~ neat history there) and the mild bbq sauce to try that as well. Both were tasty but honestly, the chicken and the pulled pork are absolutely delicious without them. And the skin from that chicken, oh man! Words fail me. Got another helping of the slaw (because it&#39;s f-ing awesome) and got the fries which were great! So my second experience was as pleasantly surprising as my first. 

Recommendation (in order of awesomeness): 1. Brisket 2. Pulled Pork 3. BBQ Chicken 4. Baby Back Ribs.

It was my first time here and, seeing a full menu, I asked a staff member to serve me up her favorite. Experience says this gives smaller places a chance to lead off with their best.

Her choice: Pulled pork sandwich with Pineapple slaw. Daring on her part, but a pretty solid choice :-)

The pork is juicy, perfectly flavored, and works well with the mild sauce. And that slaw deserves to be voted &#34;side of the decade.&#34; Seriously. At Elgin BBQ Pit, slaw is served on top of the pork as part of the sandwich, resulting in some incredible flavor.

I&#39;ll definitely be back."

Interior had a good vibe and cool decorations, had its own unique feel and awesome wood faced folding chairs at the table that I&#39;m sure my girlfriend will have me building in the spring. 

On to the food, tried pulled pork with the hot mango habanero bbq sauce and the pineapple slaw on top. Was gonna go for the brisket but the slaw on top of the pulled pork sandwhich sold me on that. Pork was tender and the pineapple slaw was very good. The sauce was great and had a great blend of sweet and spice tasted similar to Jamaican jerk sauce. Tried some of my gf&#39;s jalapeño  slaw and it was fantastic. Lastly tried some of the Alabama white bbq sauce. First time I had heard of this was here have had bbq in Texas, Memphis and of course Chicago many times but have never come across this till today. Used it as a dip for my fries and it was a surprisingly great flavor was a little skeptical at first but I will definatly be trying it with the brisket in the future.

Had the brisket sandwich with jalapeño slaw. The brisket portion was ample, flavorful, and cooked properly.  The spiciness and crisp composition of the slaw where excellent on the sandwich and on the side.  Tried several of the sauces with the Habanero mango (hot) being my clear favorite.  Price was reasonable and food quality good.

Tried the jalapeño corn fritters.  They could definitely use more jalapeño, and were a bit dry.  Perhaps incorporating some whole corn kernels in the batter would help with texture and moisture.  And it might be worth a dusting of powdered sugar. 

The floors and booths are a bit worse for wear.  The stools have a nice old, rough appearance.  The facility was fairly clean in a good order.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Better for take out than dine in.

He told me about some 20% off coupon for &#34;liking&#34; them on Facebook, so I told them I&#39;ll go ahead and do that for the next time I order.  We left on a good note and couldn&#39;t wait to go home to try the food.  I&#39;m not sure if it was because we got there later in the evening, but everything so was dry.  Not only was everything dry, but part of our order was wrong.  We had a hard time eating the food, but it cost us quite a pretty penny so we ended up eating as much as we could force ourselves to eat.  I really love BBQ and there aren&#39;t many places in the Elgin area to find it, so I just hoped this was a fluke.  I went onto their Facebook page and &#34;liked&#34; them so I could get a 20% off coupon and give them another try, hopefully earlier in the day where things might be a bit more fresh.

I&#39;m sorry to say that I was dissappointed, because any time I had driven past their location the smell of smoking meat always made my mouth water. The man over the phone was very courteous and when he repeated my order he had everything correct, and so I waited patiently expecting to generously tip the delivery guy who would offer me respite from hunger in the office. Now I know for a fact that Spaulding road is not ridiculously far from where they&#39;ve settled in on Dundee ave but I ended up waiting almost two hours for my order to arrive. I understand that my office is rather difficult to find, but from the time comparison given me when I called to inquire about the status of my order it should&#39;ve arrived much more quickly than it did when a very surly delivery man walked through the door. 
Still I tipped him as was appropriate and hungrily opened the bag to get at the goodies. I had ordered the pulled pork and a coworker had gotten a half slab of ribs. We were both a bit taken aback when our food was as cold as if it&#39;d been sitting for a good hour and my order was completely devoid of any kind of sauce. Literally just a mound of dry meat. In general it was dry and not very flavorful. My coworker&#39;s ribs were better despite being cold, but we both agree the only very good part of our meals was the potato salad and while the idea of jalepeno cole slaw intrigued me it was poorly executed with soggy cabbage swimming in a pool of flavorless liquid. I would not eat here again."

I haven&#39;t had barbecue like this in years and it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had in awhile. I typically get the pull pork sandwich or burnt ends and I&#39;m always satisfied by those though I do plan on expanding to try more of the menu. The fries are the best fries I&#39;ve ever had. The staff is incredibly friendly and very welcoming. Every time I go there I&#39;m satisfied by the environment and how great the food is.

First of all, the place was empty. I have never been to a good BBQ joint where I didn&#39;t have to stand in line.  I ordered my food and the guy said it will take 20 minutes. That is fine for good BBQ. I heard a microwave door slam. Oh no! The BBQ chicken was good, but the pulled pork was old and rubbery. The coleslaw was made with cucumbers and was barely dressed. The garlic mashed potatoes I did not try, but my wife said it was disgusting. 

I might give this place another try later on, as everybody has bad times. Right now, it is a one star!"

Had the pulled pork sandwich. It was good and juicy. Also enjoyed the BBQ sauce - hot and sweet. I&#39;ll definitely try it again. I grew up in Elgin and remember pork from a place called Morris BBQ.

Small , small portions. not what I had expected. 3 pieces of brisket, 1 inch wide, 5 inches long, 1/2 inch thick. Brisket very dry, to the point of have to drink water with the brisket to get it down. Wanted to try a mixture of equal parts of the jalapeno and pineapple salsa. Do not think they were mixed, in fact would question if they delivered what I asked for. Beans mediocre at best. Again portions for the cost, tiny, tiny. Served in standard condiment cups. Love BBQ, I mean love BBQ, but do not make me pay for what you throw away. It is a hole in the wall restaurant, which is difficult to get to, charging high end prices for small portions."

Boy were we disappointed. First off, the cashier was not friendly at all. The other gentleman up front was.  We ordered our food and then sat down to wait. Which we did, for 25 minutes!  Then when our food came out mine order came with the wrong meat.  Sent it back to wait another 5 minutes.  My husband had the pork which was just ok. The fries he had were more seasoned then the meat. My brisket came out hot, thankfully. It too was just ok. It was juicy but didn&#39;t have much flavor.  The mild bbq sauce was very bland. I&#39;ve had better bottled sauces.  The mashed potatoes were real not instant which was a surprise. The beans were horrible. Bland and mushy.

It&#39;s a relatively small location (about 8 tables for dine-in) at the end of a small shopping center.  While the address is Dundee Ave, it&#39;s really off of Morton Ave.  Since Dundee is a one-way street there, you might have to make a loop around, depending on which direction you&#39;re coming from, but it&#39;s definitely worth the effort.  There&#39;s four or five parking spaces in front of the location but there are several more behind the building, accessible from Cooper Ave.

The food is genuine slow-cooked BBQ.  I tried both the pulled-pork and the brisket and was pleased with both.  One of my family-members had the ribs, which they said were well-prepared and of good size.  There&#39;s also a nice assortment of side-items.

The service (I believe family owned/operated) was very good.  There were happy to describe the food and make recommendations.  They also did a good job of checking in to make sure everything was to our liking."

 The potatoes tasted good, nicely balanced garlic flavor. The texture was like glue - do you wip your mashed potatoes until they get gluey? No you don&#39;t. Do these folks know how to make mashed potatoes? No they don&#39;t. 
The ribs had a thick dusty layer of rub, plenty of chili. Pretty dry meat. Dry meat, heavy rub, nice balance? No. 
Jalapeño slaw was the best dish. Tasty, and fresh. In context though, cooling slaw works with spicy meat. Do spicy slaw and spicy meat go well together? No they don&#39;t. 
Pulled pork was also dry. An all too common flaw. Too bad. 
The chicken was tender and moist, but oddly under flavored. La casa del pollo asada on the east side kicks the ass of this bird, and they are roasting, not smoking. 
So overall, these folks have a lot to learn. Big disappointment."

Again, the brisket was OUTSTANDING.  Juicy, nice smoke ring, flavorful.  The ribs, which I had not tried before, were good, not great.  A little dry and not much meat on them, but then a lot of ribs are like that.  The cornbread is really good, as is the jalapeno coleslaw...the fries seemed a little old.

Inside, no smoke at all from the smoker. Good containment. I&#39;d eaten here under previous management before, but wanted to try the skills of the new owners. Brisket, ribs, and a hot link were consumed. The hot link is like a smoked kielbasa with hot pepper flakes in it; the ribs and the brisket were great without any sauce on them. In my mind, they were cooked perfectly: nice rub, lightly smoked, not falling off the bone, light tug on the teeth, brisket resisted a bit when you pulled the slice apart. Got the mac &amp; cheese. This was not as good as the previous owner&#39;s, which had a jalapeño kick to it, but, still darn good. Highly recommended."

I had a pulled pork sandwich with the mild sauce and would easily get it again. The slaw sounds strange but it was fabulous so don&#39;t hesitate to get it on the sandwich like they suggest. I also got a sweet tea with red honey which was excellent and they even allow refills! Be sure and check their website for weekly deals too before you go.

I&#39;ve ordered from this place a few times now.  Usually for pizza with friends.  Pizza was always delivered within an hour and a half and fairly warm still.  Probably 3 stars at most for these orders.  Tonights order made me lower it to 1 star.  A few friends and I ordered some quesidillas, cheeseburger, shrimp appetizer, popcorn shrimp, fries, salad, &amp; potato skins.  Overall, most were bad.  Fries cold and soggy.  There were 5 potato skins; 3 tasted ok, the other 2 tasted weird and hard (probably old).  Shrimp appetizer also cold and old tasting.

Now, I myself ordered popcorn shrimp  (I haven&#39;t had popcorn shrimp for years and it sounded tasty) and potato skins (I already described these).  Well no cocktail sauce was included with my popcorn shrimp or my friends appetizer shrimp.  Well ok, I gave a $7 tip on a $34 meal; I called back hoping for good service. 

Well, I called and said 2 of our dishes ordered didn&#39;t come with their side sauce.  I was offered a $3 discount on my next order... I said that wasn&#39;t good enough.  Then they offered $5 off next order (less than half the price of our inedible shrimp dishes).  I said, &#34;I&#39;d rather pay $5 for cocktail sauce right now because 2 of our meals are inedible without it&#34;.  Guy / manager on phone said, &#34;ok, we&#39;ll get your sauces sent out&#34; (free of course, I said I&#39;d pay $5 sarcastically; like we can&#39;t eat this without it).

So now it&#39;s been an hour since they said they would get the sauces to us.  Mind you this place is about 5minutes from my house.  Now our shimp are cold and tough and the sauce still isn&#39;t here!   They should have been quick and really should have sent the sauce with 2 freshly cooked shrimp dishes.  

Ok the sauce finally came.  Sadly our shrimp are cold and nasty.  Microwaved them and now they are like rubber (30 seconds in microwave).  Waste of around $12 on 2 shrimp dishes we can&#39;t eat; plus low quality food for the rest of our order.

Won&#39;t be ordering from this place ever again and I suggest you don&#39;t either!"

And then when I went into the other half of the restaurant where the buffet was and saw how the checkered tablecloths just continued the cute look of the place, I figured I just had to snap some pictures and review it.  

I had the lunch buffet when I went and we sat in the bar.  We could have sat anywhere because most of the place was empty. The food was fine. I wouldn&#39;t seek out this place for its cuisine, but it is a pleasant place to go and fill your stomach with okay tasting food.  This place reminds me a lot of Stadium Sports Club &amp; Pizza on Algonquin near 53.  I&#39;ve been to the Stadium several times for their mediocre lunch buffet and could never understand how they stayed open. Then I stopped in once after work and the place was PACKED with drinkers coming to watch a game.  I imagine Rosati&#39;s is the same.

The only two times I have been to this place is because of my ridiculous in-laws who insist that this is the place they miss the most after moving to North Carolina. SERIOUSLY!!?? Yuck is all I can say. The lunch buffet is a steal of a deal for the 5 or 6.99---if you like old food on a dirty nasty buffet line. Dark wood paneling, dirty old carpet like 100 years old and a salad-bar that looks like the home for a zillion bacteria. I am not in the business of bashing restaurants but come on. Clutter what seems like everywhere. You don&#39;t have to renovate but at least clean properly for goodness sake. Even if the food was outstanding and yes the fresh pizza being added to the buffet was classic Rosatis and good pizza, the surroundings no waitstaff in sight and clutter just made it unbearable for me personally.

We had been craving the wonderful Rosatis sweet/tangy sauce one night and decided to order pizza.  Found a great coupon, Large Cheese for $10 and we added two toppings.  We were told 30 minutes, so we watched an episode of Friends, drove over there, and our pizza was not ready yet.  We weren&#39;t upset cause then we figured we would have a piping hot delicious pizza.  What did we get? A lukewarm cardboard crust with the most bland pizza sauce known to man.  It literally tasted like canned tomatoes, it was terrible.  The only way I could enjoy the pizza was to either smother it in a hot sauce or dip it in ranch. That way, it had some flavor.

Is this different from the other franchises?  You can&#39;t order off Rosatis.com, you have to go to the separate site and their pizza tasted nothing like a great Rosatis pizza.

I went through with the order anyway because we had people coming over and needed to feed them, but after thinking it over I knew I didn&#39;t want it. It&#39;s probably not a good idea to order from somewhere when you think you might get spit in your pizza. When I called to cancel the order, I was put on hold for five minutes and finally spoke to someone who ended the conversation with &#34;K thanks bye&#34; and hanging up on me. With the way I was spoken to during my original transaction, I&#39;m not surprised, but I am thankful we chose a different chain for our pizza needs. We will never deal with this location again."

There was no one to greet us so we grabbed the one open table which we had to clear ourselves. We all ordered the buffet. The waitresses seemed very busy so the refills, table clearing, and getting the check was slow. 
The food was not great. The salad bar was gross. The mushrooms were hard and there were flies on the desserts. There were a couple things labeled wrong and there really wasn&#39;t much pizza to choose from. They didn&#39;t have labels so I had no idea what I was getting. 
I was hoping to find a new pizza buffet place but this place did not make the cut."

For a 12&#34; costing $14.37 this pizza sucked BIG TIME.  Next time I&#39;m going to make my own.  I could give the folks at the Rosati&#39;s on Wise Road a lesson on good pizza.  Just globing a huge bunch of canned tomato paste on the crust is not good pizza.  They also skimped on the cheese as well.  

Heck if they&#39;re going to use a commercialized pizza sauce, they would have done better with a light amount of Prego Italian Traditional Sauce AND NOT HUNT&#39;S TOMATO PASTE! :(    A real Italian tomato pizza sauce is one of the easiest things to master and can make or break a pizza.

The pizza has always been good with the Rosati&#39;s chain. Good consistent quality. I have been enjoying their pizza, from various locations, for more than a decade!

 I tried the buffet for the first time, because I had a coupon. It was about eight dollars without a drink. The pizza was the best item. The lasagna and ribs were ok, but a little salty. The stuffed pepper and meatballs were fine. Much of the food suffered a bit from sitting around and over-heating, because it was a slow day (not their fault, no points off).

Service was excellent. Server&#39;s name was Katie. She took away the plates promptly and checked-up on me often. She even asked if the TV station was ok.

I would try the buffet again. Not bad for the price."

Being the lazy couple that we are, we decided to order from Rosati&#39;s since it is literally in our backyard.

I ordered the eggplant parm w/ spaghetti. It was less than delicious. The eggplant was heavily breaded to where I couldn&#39;t tell if I was even eating eggplant. Instead of the thick half inch slice of breaded eggplant, Rosati&#39;s gives you 6-7 paper thin slices of breaded eggplant. The spaghetti was nicely cooked, but the marinara sauce could&#39;ve used some help from Prego.

The fiance had the chicken parm w/ mostacolli and could only eat half of his order. That is saying a lot of a chicken parm fanatic.

We also ordered a side salad, the ingredients were fresh and serving was large for $1.75. However, the 2 ketchup sized packets of Italian dressing was a joke. I was looking forward to real house dressing.

Stick with their pizzas."

AYCE pizza buffet eh, I have seen better. This is a step up from Cici pizza which I have never been too, but the Monday special for 6.95 was too hard to pass up. The store is located in a strip mall and has sort of a bar feel to the place. The food itself was slightly below average and for the price you are probably better off ordering a whole pizza. The soups was chicken noodle with large chunks of dough and the minestrone was a bit on the salty side. The thin crust pizza was good and what you expect with rosati pizza. As long as there is a lot of customers the pizzas get cycled through quickly. Do not under any circumstance try the thick crust deep dish appearing pizza. It is not deep dish as much as a gigantic hunk of crust with a thin layering of tomato sauce and cheese. The salad bar was sparse and had ice berg lettuce with a few toppings. Also in this area was the dessert which was a combination of small slices of cake, puding, and rice crispy treat. This does not appear to be replenish during our dining experience. All and all you get what you paid for. I wish pizza hut would still have there pizza buffet. 

Pros- AYCE pizza, cheap on Mondays, friendly wait staff (there was only one waitress for the whole dining room)

Cons- Below average food

Hidden deals-
Monday AYCE buffet 6.95 (drinks not included)"

I had originally ordered from Sir Nicks (sister company), but they didn&#39;t have the gyro I was craving ((insert sad face)).  So I followed up here.

I ordered:
Gyros
Curly Fries
Minestrone Soup
Potato Skins

The minestrone soup had a great base, but the noodles pretty much dissolved in your mouth.  They were really overcooked and mushy, so it really detracted from the tastiness of the soup.

The potato skins were SO dry and overcooked.  I ate a half of one of them and threw the rest away.  It was sad.  The gyros were good, but the sauce was SO SO watery.  It was the same consistency as my soup as weird as that is.  The curly fries were good, though!

The delivery time was right around an hour, like they said it would be.  $10 delivery minimum, just a heads up!

I would probably order from them one more time, but I am going to give it a while.  There are better places to patronize first!"

So I just decided to cancel my order. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on with this place but about a month ago my mother ordered a lasagna which is normally pretty awesome and tasty with a super sized portion but when my mother received it it looked like they just slopped it all together and it was almost nothing but sauce with what looked to be one floating noodle.

I&#39;m in my late 40&#39;s and I grew up around this area and I honestly don&#39;t think the anything has changed.  With that, I have to say that the chicken quesadillas are the best bargain on the planet for $2.95.  They use what I believe to be the largest flour tortilla available and fill it nicely with REAL chicken and GOOD melty cheese and that&#39;s all. Normally, that wouldn&#39;t cut it for me but it&#39;s SIMPLY delish!!  It comes with a rather plain but spicy tomato salsa, and again, a perfect compliment to it&#39;s rich, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, counterpart.  Did I mention it&#39;s only $2.95??  Can&#39;t beat it!!"

Toscani&#39;s met and exceeded my expectations.  I&#39;m glad I chose them.  

We ended up actually having lunch there on a Saturday at about 12:30pm.  Most of the time we were the only diners in the restaurant.

In my other reviews I&#39;ve said that if a restaurant starts us out with warm, fresh bread, my rating immediately goes to 5 stars and then will go down from there, if need be.  The soft, warm bread in the basket was wonderful.  Here&#39;s how the rest of the food fared for us:

Chicken rice soup - delicious

garlic bread with melted cheese - delicious.  Very mild taste garlic taste

Shrimp Kalamata - Grilled shrimp saute´ed in garlic, onions &amp; olive oil, with tomatoes &amp; kalamata olives. This is listed under Appetizers but I chose it as my entree.  I loved it.  I used the garlic bread to sop up the juice from the tomatoes. The shrimp had a great, grilled taste.

Rigatoni Vodka - delicious.  My husband ranked it as the 2nd best he has ever had.  Portillo&#39;s holds the #1 spot for him but this rigatoni Vodka was a close second place.  

Angus beef burger - delicious. My son said it was cooked perfect to his &#39;very well done&#39; request, yet it was also juicy and tasty.

Our server was very nice and very professional.  And lastly, the restroom was clean.

It was a perfect birthday dinner."

We have now dined at Toscani a total of six times now and have not been disappointed.  I&#39;ll describe our most recent meal where we took advantage of the December e-mail special.  If you sign-up for their e-mail list, you will receive one e-mail a month describing a special.  This month&#39;s special was either a chicken or veal dish, or the crusted barramundi, a limited selection of wines by the bottle, and a tiramisu dessert for two.  The price is $39.95.

I started with a very well made Manhattan cocktail and we split a half dozen baked clams.  As I have previously mentioned, the baked clams are delicious and are a nice size.  Next came the house salad with their excellent homemade garlic dressing.  Coupled with Toscani&#39;s homemade, warm bread, I&#39;m tempted to ask them to just give me a bowl of salad greens and make a meal out of it.

We both ordered the crusted barramundi and shared a bottle of Sangiovese.  This was our first time ordering fish at Toscani and it was very good.  It came on a bed of rice with mixed vegetables.  The barramundi was covered in a delicious almond crust and topped with a light drizzle of lemon butter cream sauce that was a nice accompaniment to the fish.  In typical Toscani fashion, the portions were large and we ended up home.
We barely could finish the tiramisu but managed to polish it off.  I also enjoyed a Limoncello with the tiramisu.   

Finally, our server Monika was terrific!  She is very attentive and cheerful and another reason we like Toscani so much. The amazing part of the dinner is when we received the bill.  Our total for all of the above was less than $56.  I double-checked the bill to make sure that Monika had not missed charging us for something but, in fact, it was all there.  Taking advantage of the monthly special made it very easy on the pocketbook.

I&#39;ve said it in my original review, and still after six visits, Toscani continues to offer very good Italian food, reasonably priced drinks and excellent service.  It remains an excellent value."

My wife and I had high hopes for Toscani seeing as how other reviews were positive. Maybe it&#39;s just our perspective...we have travelled extensively throughout Italy and when we read the words &#34;authentic&#34; we really hope that&#39;s what it&#39;ll be. The pizza is more American than Italian. The pasta was ok. The gnocchi was also ok. The best part of the meal was the bread basket. The bread was fresh and hot. 

Dinner for two will cost around $50 before tip. For an ok meal...sorry...it just wasn&#39;t worth it. 

It was also odd that their credit card connection was not working, and since I don&#39;t carry much cash, they had to write down my name, cc number, and exp date and said they would charge me later. I&#39;ve had issues in the past with identity fraud so I have to hope that my info is destroyed after the charge goes through. 

The second star was for the sweet server. She really was a gem of a person, and I wish her all the best in life, because unless she starts working at a better restaurant we will never see her again for as long as we live."

I told her we had a bit of a time constraint and she told us not to worry she would have us out of there in less than an hour, which she did!

My friend was running a bit late to dinner so I had plenty of time to enjoy the bread (crusty bread and focaccia) with oil, cheese and pepper.  The bread was awesome... I may or may not have eaten all the focaccia before my friend showed us.  The busboy noticed and immediately asked me if I wanted more :)  He kept my water glass full throughout the meal as well.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had homemade pasta here, so I knew I had to try something from that section.  I had the tortellini with prosciutto, peas, and a cream sauce (I had them omit the mushrooms).  I was very satisfied with the dish.  It came with a side salad which was good, but I wish they dried the lettuce more because it made it watery."

Some of their dishes are very good and some not so good.  Seafood is very fresh.  Vodka sauce is the best Ive ever had.  Don&#39;t like their marinara sauce.  Portions are very small.   If they served larger portions and worked on a few recipes it would be a hit.  I still go back.  I have a couple things I really like there.

I was online looking for a reasonably priced Italian restaurant with homemade pasta and found Toscani on Yelp. Our first visit was 6 days ago (we couldn&#39;t even wait a week to go back!) and I had the Veal Florentina, recommended by our server, and it was AMAZING. The veal was so tender and portion size gave me lunch the next day. My daughter had the homemade spinach gnocchi in vodka sauce. (she asked for that in place of the pesto sauce). These fluffy little pillows literally melted in your mouth. And the vodka sauce, definitely one of the best I have ever had. On our second visit, yesterday, we both had the gnocchi in vodka sauce. 

The bread basket lived up to all expecations based on the reviews. It was so fresh and warm. My daughter especially loved the focaccia bread in the basket. The first time I had the cream of chicken and rice soup.....so very good! The flavors were all there and it wasn&#39;t as thick as most places make it, which is another reason I liked it so much. 

Okay, now here is the ringer that sealed the deal on trying Tuscani. In the reviews I read they do bananas foster tableside. One of my absolute favorite desserts. I asked to see the dessert menu before out food came out so I knew how much room to save. Surprised to see it was not on the menu, yet I could see the cart used to make it. I asked our server and she said they don&#39;t always have it every night, but she checked, and they did. Fortunately it&#39;s in a  mall with a grocery store that sells bananas! We split one both times and it was a perfect amount. I will probably get this every time I go there. 

Definitely give it a try! The service is terrific, food outstanding, and prices very reasonable. I&#39;m not one to normally take the time to write reviews, but I wasn&#39;t going to let this little gem of a place go unrecognized."

The wait staff is friendly and the meals are delectable. The portions are big enough to serve two so the staff is more than prepared to pack your leftovers to go. The seafood dishes are to die for with a great variety on their specials, and the different sauces you can pick from for your pasta dishes are even better. They can customize the spice level to suit your taste for any dish. If your looking for a great yummy Italian place with great prices, this is it!!

Don&#39;t forget to finish off your meal with a frothy cuppuccino and carrot cake. Or if your in the mood for something unique and scrumptious, try the salted caramel cake. They are both super moist, rich, and a great end to a delicious meal!!"

We got there at about 10ish and were the only ones in there. The waitresses were very quick to take our and order and served fresh foccaica to the table-- which is the BEST I&#39;ve ever had and I&#39;m a bread lover and even make it myself. 

We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer and it was delicious-- big round rings, lightly fried, with a nice non-greasy crunch. 

My husband had two jack and cokes which had more jack than coke-- the way we like it. I had a generous pour of wine which was also good. 

For dinner, my husband had the salmon (13 ish bucks)  with rice and beautifully presented veggies. I had the chicken cacciatore (10 bucks)  with tomatoes, peppers, and onions. It was also good, nothing to scream over, but good. Everything seemed very fresh and the presentation was very appealing. 

For dessert, we tried the cannoli dip which was just ok. It wasn&#39;t as creamy as I&#39;m used to. We also took a tiramisu home which was really good. It could use some alcohol which is the way I&#39;ve had it before, but it was creamy, flavorful, and obviously homemade. 

Time four our bill came to the table at it was only $69.00!!!!!!!!!!!!! We&#39;re used to eating at good places and paying at least $100-$150 for a dinner for two. This was a very pleasant surprise for us. 

Overall, we had a great experience. Inside was beautifully decorated, the service was on point, and the food (for the price) was very good. 

We&#39;ll be back to see if there are excellent items on the menu."

It looks like a 5 star restaurant and is beautiful! The hand paintings on the wall are gorgeous and the music was just so relaxing! 

From the minute we sat down we were poured water and brought fresh bread (which was delicious!) 

I&#39;m not much of an Italian food person and very picky so I just got a chicken sandwich which was served on homemade bread but my husband got a starter salad and then for a main course he got the Manicotti dish and he loved it! The servings/portions were very ample and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, my husband tried one of the wines for a large glass it was $7 and he said it was a very tasty. 


Our waitress was lovely and attentive and we got to watch the manager serve a dessert to another table which he made right in front of them on a portable stove top. 

For both of our meals and drinks the bill was under $40, very reasonably priced. 

The whole experience was great and I would definitely recommend it, hopefully going to bring my sister-in-law and her boyfriend here soon!

The pizza is really thin and crispy. It was really good. The linguine and mussels in garlic and oil sauce was great. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce had big chunks of garlic in it.  I would recommend this restaurant for a casual meal!

Let me start by saying the food was fantastic. From the bread on the table to our main dishes. We had a group of 8 ladies. We get together every so often for dinner and a night out. By the time our whole group arrived it was probably about 7:15. We ordered our meals and the drink orders were taken. We received either soups or salad&#39;s. The wait staff was hovering around our table. As soon as you put down your spoon or fork they were ready to take your plate away even if we weren&#39;t finished. Our main dishes arrived and the same thing happened. We went on a Tuesday night and used the  15% off coupon be very clear on all the rules that go with it. The eight of us and maybe 4 other people were in the restaurant that night. We were rushed out of the restaurant by 8:30 even though they say there open till 10 pm. We weren&#39;t even offered coffee. I guess the staff had better things to do. I won&#39;t recommend this place to anyone. Food was good but the service really sucks.

I was there twice. First time I had what was labeled as the Veal Genovese. Which is 100% mislabeled. Not sure if the people that made this menu are Italian or not but they made Veal Scallopini. Even the menu has the ingredients and its NOT Genovese. Its 100% Scallopini. One would think they know the difference. Management if youre reading this, please google both and look at Wikipedia on what they both consist of. The veal was a little tough and the sauce reminded me of something you put on pancakes. It was sweet. There was no zing from the lemon nor capers. Going to chef school that is not how Scallopini is supposed to taste (regarding the sauce). It should have been slightly salty from the capers, bright from the lemon &amp; artichokes and rich from the butter. No hints of maple syrup which is what I got. And of course veal Genovese has a totally different onion-based sauce and looks totally different too. 

The second time the service was also friendly and efficient. They have excellent bread. The salads are small. The salad dressings taste of being bought, not made on sight.  This time I had the lasagna. I didnt like it. The amount of salt made it almost inedible. I couldnt taste the tomatoes, the ricotta cheese nor the meat. It was very tangy and salty. Thats all I was tasting. Damn shame because it looked good. Im still drinking glasses of water from my meal as I type this. Thats from eating half of the big piece they gave me. The portions are large. Sadly I tossed the other half of the lasagna in the trash. I hate wasting food but I just couldnt eat anymore, again, because of the salt. 

Im not sure Ill be back but if I am I will be trying a sandwich or a pizza instead. The ambiance is nice. Not great but the painted walls with photos of the Italian countryside is very nice. The flooring tiles dont seem to fit in. The Italian music they play is a fantastic selection.  I like how you can see the chef making pizzas in a section designated specifically for pizza making.

I had a coupon in the mail which I used and the prices are incredible. I&#39;m glad also see that they have a new Italian restaurant in wood dale, they don&#39;t have much of those around there. Great wine around there too! From outside you might think it&#39;s an origin army restaurant, never judge a book by it&#39;s core though! They&#39;re the best. My waitress was really polite, always smiling and happy to serve us. Professional, polite and hard workers, did a good job as I saw it. I ordered an Italian dressing salad to begin with. Then I had the rigatoni vodka! Got my mouth watery. They also made me a cappuccino at the end. I&#39;d recommend one of these. I&#39;ll be looking forward to having a carry out order soon :)"

Looks barebones on the outside but nice once you get in.  I ordered the grilled shrimp appetizer and special of the day blackened mahi mahi. My friend order the veal with spinach in a brown sauce.  The food was good!  Service was great but there were only a couple of people there at 8 on a Friday night.  They served fresh bead with olive oil and had nice music playing.

The food is excellent &amp; the service is conscientious &amp; friendly. The reason for the low score is the atmosphere. The acoustics are loud and when the restaurant is filled with children under 10 who are running around out of control knocking things over throughout the entire restaurant it&#39;s hard to say I will be coming back. Speaking to the manager about getting hit in the head by running children through the entire meal did no good. They chose to allow this rather than run a restaurant, sad."

I ordered chicken milanaise and my husband had lasagna.  Both very good.  However, chicken had onions and tomatoes in a balsamic on top which were ice cold ( I&#39;m sure it was intentional).  I would have preferred that warm.  Just a little too much contrast for me.  We had a total of 3 alcoholic drinks.  Our bill with a coupon was only $32.  The food was good, but the price was better.

Together it was about $6.50 and I used my Ikea loyalty card to get a free hot tea to drink.  

The veggie ball plate was pure comfort food. The veggie balls came with a ladle of tomato lentil sauce on top.  It was served with a side of mushy veggies (not too pleasant until I dipped them in the lentil sauce).  This is something I would be able to appreciate on a cold winter&#39;s day or after a taxing activity.

The dessert was a nice lightweight piece of gluten-free almond cake.  It had a lovely taste and texture, very different than a typical American-styled cake."

I followed the instruction, &#34;line up under the picture of what you would like to order.&#34;  I wanted to order the salmon dinner, yet there was always someone in front of me popping out of nowhere.  I thought most of them were wanting the chicken dinner, and the &#34;chicken picture&#34; was hung at a different counter above.  

After a few minutes of struggle, I successfully fetched my salmon dinner.  I then grabbed one of the pink princess cakes and the ceramic coffee mug.  By the way, if you have the IKEA orange member card, you can get a free coffee or hot tea (re-fills are available).  That&#39;s a $0.75 saving.

We sometimes go out of our way to eat here.

My profile photo is from the annual crayfish party.

I don&#39;t know if I should be proud or embarrassed (I&#39;m not embarrassed), to admit that I&#39;ve eaten most of this menu.

The last time here, I had the lox plate with veggies and it is my new crave. The salmon was so flavorful and the portion was generous. It was under $6, so a total steal!

The kids usually get the chicken fingers or meatballs, both flavorful and filling. The desserts are delicious as well, my favorite being the tårta blåbär, or the blueberry tart, when it&#39;s available (it is sold frozen in the maket!).

Once in a while, there&#39;s a deal where if you spend $100 in IKEA goods, you&#39;re entire meal check will be deducted from your bill. Check the website for eligible weekends. We&#39;ve taken advantage of this and even treated family for lunch!

It could be a little of both; nonetheless, I enjoyed dinner here, though the meatballs were not as satisfying as they once were.

We tried both the original meatballs and the chicken meatballs. We thought the original were better. The veggies were what you&#39;d probably imagine, but the salmon was much better than I expected.

Their desserts are crazy good. I absolutely loved the Cheesecake, though I wish they&#39;d still had more of the marzipan that day. My Husband was a fan of the Chocolate Cake, but it came off as incredibly bitter after the lingonberry sauce and fruit juice. After the other sugary substances wore off, it tasted really sweet.

2 adults with 3 entrées, sides, desserts and drinks spent under $30. That&#39;s hard to beat these days, and you&#39;ll need sustenance after an epic IKEA trip."

Only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because it can be a bit overwhelming and crowded. But that my own issue and not a negative on the store. I&#39;d probably find it easier to navigate if it weren&#39;t so crowded.

Customer service is awesome! Really helpful &amp; easy.
FYI - delivery charges are about 3-4x more expensive if ordering online than if you go into the store.

Shockingly, their restaurant has vegan options! Besides the vegetarian meatballs (not sure if vegan but I love that they&#39;re offering this option), they now offer a veggie wrap that IS vegan. AND they do not do their potatoes in the same fryer as the chicken fingers or other meat items. So I was a happy girl.

We purchased a sofa from here as a simple studio sofa till we bought a house. But after we bought our house, we purchased sofas at higher end stores. We still kept the ektorp ikea sofa in the guest room. 10yrs later, we&#39;re  getting rid of our higher end stir sofas and still keeping the ikea one. It&#39;s the most comfy sofa we have after all this time.

Tons of accessories. It&#39;s so much that it can be overwhelming. But I could easily spend an entire day walking. 

My only suggestion - offer almond milk in the cafe as an alternative to half and half. I would have REALLY loved a coffee while walking around."

Rating the &#34;customer service&#34;, or lack there of, I would rate them 1 star. I&#39;ve been to this Ikea 4 times within the last two weeks. Every single visit it&#39;s the same thing. Every employee I&#39;ve come into contact with is miserable. Absolutely miserable. From being snide to rude to condescending to defensive, it&#39;s utterly depressing going to this store. Everyone looks like they hate working there. Any hope to get a smile or acknowledgement as a customer patronizing the store-don&#39;t gold your breath. From the manager in the cabinetry department to the return section girl and the furniture pick up department guys...all of them are awful. The only good experience I had with Ikea was when I got my stuff delivered. Then again, I think they contract out their delivery service. In my opinion, this type of consistent behavior from employees start from the top. So my assumption would be that management absolutely is miserable as well.

Everything in here is so cheap but they only advantage that this place has is wine and beer.  Nothing like a little beer to help me with my furniture choice.

The restaurant is located on the 3rd floor and has every kind of comfort food you could want.  Roast Chicken, Ribs, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and lets not forget the Swedish meatballs too.  I have eaten here two times and both times it was good.  

The first time we ate hear it was for free.  If we bought over a $100 in merchandise we could eat as much as we wanted to for free.  This actually got us into the Restaurant because I do not think I would have ever eaten here.  We loaded our trays full of food and drink...honestly it was too much food for us to carry and then when we checked out the guy was like $24.  I looked at him and thought he was crazy...maybe he missed a few of our items but no everything here is so cheap.

I did enjoy the Swedish meatballs...it just feels like comfort plus I would not know how to make these myself.  Check there calender for the free days with $100 purchase.  There are 6 weekends that they usually host this deal.

Recently I had a hungry little child with me as I was shopping and decided to grab her a kids meal and was so surprised to get a chicken finger meal with fries and milk for only $2.49.  The two chicken fingers were so big that my little one gave me half of one because she could not finish it.  I did not get any food but did get a Sam Adams for like $3.  This was the cheapest Daddy/Daughter Lunch ever...in fact I was thinking about getting a second beer.

The food is served cafeteria style.  The employees are very helpful but it seems to be a little disorganized on the customer side.  The employees will get and serve you anything you ask for but I usually have no idea what I am ordering.  I wish that the menu was a little more helpful on telling me what sides come with an entree or if I could just get the meat without the side and what the price would be.  This is about the only confusion I have when trying to get my food.  The deserts are easy to grab because they live on an island in the middle.

They also have weekly specials here too:  Monday Morning is free breakfast, Monday Lunch/Dinner is 99 cents, Tuesday kids eat free, Wednesday is a $6.99 rib dinner and Thursday is a $1.99 chicken dinner.  If I lived next door to the IKEA restaurant, I know where I would be eating breakfast every Monday.  These are some amazing deals.  In fact, the breakfast is only 99 cents on the other days...so I might eat here everyday until I got sick of eggs, bacon and potatoes.

This review is for the location on the 3rd floor.  There is also a small cafe on the 1st floor where you check-out.  I have not eaten down here.  I did notice some great deals on hot dogs and soft serve yogurt.   So next time you are shopping do not let a hungry stomach influence a bad shopping choice...take a break and order some food to settle your stomach so you make a rational choice."

It&#39;s good food at an amazing deal and offers a great break after trekking through three stories of furniture and home goods.

Their meatball meal deal is just $3.99 and the portion is huge, comes with Swedish Meatballs, mashed potatoes, lingonberries and a bowl of soup. The portion was so big that two of us shared the 15 meatballs &amp; sides for dinner. Yes you read that right...Dinner for 2 for $4!!! Does it get any better than that? My friend was so impressed he vowed we are going to go just for dinner more often (haha we&#39;ll see about that). 

Downstairs on the checkout floor, you can get 2 hot dogs for $1 or 2 hot dogs, chips and a drink for $2! The hot dogs aren&#39;t as big or as tasty as the great deal down the street at Costco but it&#39;s still a good deal. Frozen yogurt is just $1 downstairs and a good sized cone! I think they only have vanilla though, wah wah.

Sign up for Ikea&#39;s new Family program and you get a free yogurt PLUS free coffee every time you go to Ikea at the Restaurant! Score!"

Also, if you sign up for one of their free IKEA Family Cards (from any of the kiosks throughout the place) then you get a free cup of coffee each time you stop by, which, is awesome.

If you ever find yourself in the area before 11, make sure you peruse the breakfast options. It&#39;s cheap, delicious and filling. I added on a dollar to my meal, and the french toast sticks were definitely worth it. (For only $1.99!)

The meatballs had a strangely smooth texture. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing. I liked the salmon just because I like salmon. The panini wasn&#39;t very good. I mean I don&#39;t know what you can expect eating at Ikea. It&#39;s cafeteria style.

Sure, there&#39;s nothing wrong with seeing your value and wanting to make the most of it, but let&#39;s all be realistic here- not every day can crepes and creme brulee. Some days are gonna be microwaved day-old coffee and some days are 99 cent breakfast and lingonberry drink from Ikea Cafe and ya know what? I rather like those days and I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it. 

The deal is pretty good here. If you sign up for the totally free Ikea family card (like a Jewel or Dominicks reward card) you get free coffee and tea in the 3rd floor cafe and if you come to Ikea knowing you&#39;re going to spend over $100, you might as well grab your family and haul ass to the cafeteria line where they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner because when you check out with your Ikea goods, they&#39;ll deduct your entire meal receipt from your goods receipt. The food really isn&#39;t bad. It&#39;s Market Day. Seriously, I&#39;ll bet Ikea foods and Market day foods come from the same magical frozen and dry goods food factory... or at least the french toast sticks do. I&#39;ll warn you that if you&#39;re going for broke at the cafe because you want to get your money&#39;s worth knowing you&#39;ll be dropping a Benji on affordable, mid-quality, assembly-required goods- Good luck. My party of two ate our hearts out and total came to $5.22. I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s so cheap. It&#39;s gotta be like 85% sawdust at that price, but I swear to god, it tastes just as good as something that&#39;s only 15% sawdust.

My advice is to fill up on the pre-packaged goods at the cafe. Some of the stuff they sell at the lower level food is available in third floor cafe- the bottle beverages that look like juice or soda but you just don&#39;t know because Ikea gives the oh-so descriptive title of &#39;drink&#39; and the Ikea brand chocolate bars as well as the rolls of cookies are all up for grabs to add to your soon-to-be-free meal. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s kosher to leave the restaurant and cafe area with food you purchased in there and fully intend on bootlegging home, but just bring a big purse and it should be all good. 

One last notable is that you get to eat off some of Ikea&#39;s finest wares, so if you wanted to know what their coffee mug or silverware felt like in active, you can test drive it all here."

The dining process is a bit strange to the newcomer, but it&#39;s essentially a cafeteria style process. You park your cart outside of the dining area, grab a cart and put some trays on it, look at the overhead signs, and line up under the sign which indicates which meal you want. Surrounding you are additional options like bottles of milk, sparkling pear/apple juice, Naked juice, and much more. (For adults, beer and wine!) It&#39;s kept very clean and there are a lot of options/combos to choose from. When you get all the food you want, step into one of the cashier lines, grab some IKEA utensils and silverware, pay, and find a table to dine at. Don&#39;t forget to grab dessert! All the food is arranged neatly and tastes pretty good for such low prices. If you like it, the same foods/ingredients are sold on the first floor grocery area, including the meatballs, sauces, lingonberry jams, drinks, desserts, and even salmon! It&#39;s nice that IKEA lets you test their silverware and food items so you know what you&#39;re buying. The grocery area also has a little cafe that offers 50 cent hot dogs, froyo, and cinnamon rolls. When you&#39;re done eating, you clean up after yourself, and proceed to continue shopping all in the same building! Surprisingly, the self clean up works on the honor system and people are really good about it because the dining area is quite clean.

I&#39;d give IKEA&#39;s restaurant five stars, but the lines can become hectic and confusing with crowds, and there isn&#39;t any order to it. This can get a bit annoying at times, which until fixed, perhaps with the addition of line making posts, deducts a star.

Cool note: IKEA has holiday celebrations like the Midsummer Smorgasbord, which is an all you can eat buffet event and it has games and raffles for children. Something fun to attend if you have time!"

I mean EVERYONE talks about them and a lot  of people have tried them. But, I do have a love hate relationship with them. 

Love, because aside from the fact they just taste so damn good, I really like the gravy and berry sauce (ooh yeah) served with them. I wouldn&#39;t suggest heading for the meatballs 15 minutes to close, because they can be a bit tired and overcooked. The mashed potatoes tasted different...better...this time around. Perhaps I was starving, but I could actually see potato skins in there.

Hate, because a regular order can be shared, and I usually end up eating only a few after my son gets to them. But there&#39;s always the chicken!

If you haven&#39;t discovered the french fries and chicken yet, the fries are honestly some of my favorite. They are crispy and flavorful. Up there on my top french fry favorite list (which I should start btw). 

Family of four for $15 or less. Full-size (regular) order of chicken and fries plus one meatball plate,  two milks, and typically my husband gets veggies. Of course we share everything at our table, including the fountain drink (free refills!).

It&#39;s not a fancy restaurant, but it&#39;s sure a great place to eat cheap and not feel like you got ripped off. 

If you don&#39;t have the patience to wait or the upstairs cafe is closed, the main floor pantry and cafe has killer deals on hot dogs and pizza for the kiddos.The catch is that you&#39;ll most likely have to stand to eat them. Literally only four or five tables. Some don&#39;t even have chairs.

Don&#39;t miss out on the chocolate bars here. Just don&#39;t!"

I saw a Swedish Meatball special advertised and had to try it. 

Well, they were definitely as advertised - tasted a little like the ones I loved at a Danish restaurant I worked at in HS. And reasonable priced as well - part of a combo special that was offered. 

What I didn&#39;t like was that getting the food took forever as they were out of some things (such as the kind of soup I really wanted). Then I went up to get my soft drink - guess what - no ice in the machine.

I&#39;ll be back at some point - hopefully on a better day when I can get everything I want without the cafe running out of it!"

I tried the Swedish meatballs. It was good but after 15 minutes I didnt feel so great. I felt dizzy and had a headache. I think there was too much MSG in it. I was soooo thirsty after eating it.

I guess IKEA was on the brain after receiving the new catalog in the mail the other day.

My bf got the Swedish meatball dinner and I got the buffalo chicken wrap. I should have gotten the meatballs as well because the wrap was super dry and not really good. Mine came with chips and a drink and his came with a salad and drink. The meatballs were good but you could tell that they were just frozen and heated up. It was closer to closing time and so a lot of the condiments were empty. Drinks are unlimited but they are served in a glass so you can&#39;t just take it with you and walk around the store. Oh, and no straws which kinda skeeved me out.

I have eaten at this location twice with my mom, who suffers from celiac disease and is intensely allergic to wheat -- both times, she has been very happy with her meal. The employees are very helpful when it comes to offering information about each dish, and there are binders available with allergy guidelines and ingredients for everything being served in the cafe. From salad dressings to salmon to side dishes, my mom was able to make informed choices and get a nice gluten free meal (I myself do not need to eat gluten free and so feasted on Swedish meatballs). This kind of experience is very unusual since most restaurants -- especially those smack in the middle of a shopping environment -- are unable to accommodate such an extreme allergy.

I went to the location in addison which is smaller than the one near my house but it offered the same classic decor. Never disappointed. Always a great place to people watch and chow down on some cheese fries. 

This location is in a great place and there are not too many burger joints around here. It is newer but as I state before much smaller eat in area that what I am use to.

Cold Fries. How? If they have been sitting for &#39;x&#39; amount of time, they should be thrown out. I don&#39;t know that time as I am not in the food service business. But if the fries aren&#39;t hot, don&#39;t give them to your customers. People love your fries, I love your fries. But when you make me goto a designated waiting lane and wait for 5 minutes, I expect my fries to be hot. Scratch that, I always expect my fries to be hot. 

When I have to wait though, it&#39;s even more of a disappointment to pick up that first lukewarm fry out of the bag.

My favorite dish there is the grilled vegetable salad, now with what appears to be whole grain bread, but the rumors of portillo&#39;s being a greasy joint hold true for some part and therefore my food wasn&#39;t as delectable. Nevertheless, when I went back and checked out the salads I found that I could have the asian wonton salad sans chicken, so there can be variety!

Health nuts take caution at portillo&#39;s, but i think this place still deserves a thumbs-up and a good rep."

That said, this location is a little weird -- you have to cross the drive-through lane to get to the door, it&#39;s not quite as big or well-decorated as some of the others, that kind of thing.

I had my first-ever Portillo&#39;s cheeseburger (normally I get hot dogs) and let me tell you.... it was really greasy. Delicious, but greasy. I could practically feel my arteries tightening. Lettuce and tomato are not enough to save you from a nutritional disaster.

Everything is super-tasty though, and this one&#39;s close to home. Ahh, Portillo&#39;s, how I heart you."

Sometimes they&#39;ll have cars wrapped around the building, but they have people out there taking orders and the drive thru line just moves so fast!  They truly have fast food down to a science.  Even when it&#39;s super busy, I&#39;ve never had a mix-up with my order.  It&#39;s always perfect, hot, and delicious!  Great place to take out-of-towners for Chicago beef and hot dogs.  Fries are always perfectly cooked, but their onion rings are even better.  Do yourself a favor and try them.  Their new fruit smoothies are as good as their shakes, especially the banana flavor.  

True, you&#39;ll pay a little more at Portillos than if you went to a small hot dog stand, but their food is consistently good and sometimes that&#39;s worth it.  It&#39;s dangerous to live 5 minutes from here."

Extra dipped with hot giadinera peppers, it&#39;s one of my most favorite guilty pleasures whenever I visit Chicago.  It&#39;s one of the best italian beef sandwiches in Chicago and definitely the most iconic.  The cheeseburgers and fries are pretty good too, but I rarely get them because it always seems a shame not to order an italian beef.

In the years I&#39;ve been living away from Chicago, Portillo&#39;s has started to serve salads.  Not sure when they started that, but it seems kinda weird to me.

A saw a board with a &#34;feature&#34; meal: two hot dogs, fries and a drink. I asked how much that meal cost. The clerk told me $8. I told him that wasn&#39;t much of a bargain. He told me it wasn&#39;t a discounted special, it was just a suggested combination. WTF?

In my humble opinion, the Chicago dog is by far the best way to serve a dog.  I&#39;ve been to all the best places in Chicago, hence why they only received 4 stars.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, their dogs are good, but not great.  They are very consistent, and only received one or two buns that are too soggy.  Two messed up dogs out of- hundreds maybe?  Those are odds that I can definitely live with.  A review based purely on their dogs by comparing them to the rest, I give them 3.5 stars.  I&#39;ve had better that were cheaper.   
The beef is another story.  Maybe it&#39;s because I never sought out destinations based on their beefs, but Portillo&#39;s beef is my favorite.  I also believe they make their own giardiniera, which is also great.  
Looking at the whole package, Portillo&#39;s gets a firm 4 stars.  Their service, at most locations, is prompt and friendly, even when they are at their busiest.  I routinely see managers checking the food temps, and actually being managers.  The restaurants and service doesn&#39;t have that local small business feel (due to having so many locations), however, they still are prompt and offer quality food.  This is a tough task, especially running 31 restaurants in Illinois, 1 in Indiana, and 2 in California.  I&#39;ve been to most of the Portillo&#39;s in Illinois, and found this to ring true for all the restaurants.  
Bottom line, this is a great place to frequent if you looking for a quick bite to eat, and don&#39;t want your run-of-the-mill fast food.  I will still travel to the city to frequent my favorite dog joints, but when I have a hankering for a dog, but don&#39;t want to travel to the city, Portillo&#39;s in my go-to place."

Not a huge fan of their italian beef and their hot dogs are average.

My wife loves their char-broiled chicken sandwich, but every time I try a bite I can&#39;t help think that it&#39;s a bit dry and flavourless.

So, it&#39;s always the burgers for me, and it will keep me going back.

I ordered two hotdogs with a small fry. The car infront of me must of had a large order because it took 10 minutes to get to the pick-up window. When I pulled up the guy said &#34; You ordered a small sprite,&#34; He couldnt find my order so he said pull up and park. I did and waited another 5 minutes and he came out and apologized that he gave my order to the car before me. He asked what my order was and went back inside. I waited another 10 minutes and he came up out with the food and said &#34; There is an up side to this, you got scoading hot fries,&#34; He gave me the order and walked away. It was an honest misteak but from a customer recovery stand point they handled it horrible. Portillo&#39;s has good food but it is over priced. For them to mess up and not do anything to make up for it is unacceptable. In business a customer who has a bad experience will tell approx. 20 people about it.

It was like eating a burger-fied bruschetta on ciabatta bread. I had the cajun fries which were good, but there were other sides available to choose from like mac and cheese, different slaws, and such. Needless to say, we were in a happy place.

Brunch is a Sunday must! Great selection of breakfast and lunch items off their menu and for only $15 a person kids under 6 are free! Bar none, check it out for Mother&#39;s Day and Fathers Day!! HUGE spread on those very special occasions. 

Monday half price burgers...need I say more? Only bummer is the specialty burgers are not 1/2 off so anything Kobe or bison. Most definitely still worth it if you want a D-lish bacon chee or black/bleu oooo or the Saltimbocca !YuM!

My dad and I both got the steak sandwich: a butterflied half of a filet with red pepper aioli on ciabatta roll, done perfectly and offset nicely with grilled onions. My mom got a burger with a lovely pretzel roll, and my grandmother had the potato-crusted fish sandwich along with the daily special of the seafood bisque, both of which she enjoyed. 

I had initially ordered the side of the mushroom risotto; they have a daily risotto, and as I love to make risotto and and am something of a connoisseur I try to get it whenever I see it on a menu, which isn&#39;t too often. Sadly, this was a horrible representation of the dish. It didn&#39;t even appear to be made with actual short grain rice, but was gummy and had no flavor (didn&#39;t seem to have any salt, and the mushrooms were tiny slices that looked canned). It was honestly a travesty of a dish and I asked the waitress what side she suggested instead; she said she had had the mac and cheese for lunch, so I went with that, which was much better: springy coils in a thin cheese sauce, piping hot. 

Despite this bobble I would still be willing to return and try other things; EPH has lots of choices on their menu. Our waitress was very helpful and nice. We sat in the front room, the only table for most of the time, and the kitchen might care to know that their noise carries out there, including some questionable moaning at one point...a little weird.

Their beer list is quite extensive, including 4 different Three Floyd&#39;s. When they told me they had Zombie Dust, that was all I needed to hear. The waiter poured it from the bottle into a glass at the table, and I appreciated the service. He could ahve been a little mroe active in keeping our water glasses filled though. For food, I just had the Cajun shrimp appetizer, which had a pretty strong lime and garlic flavor. Ten shrimp came to the order, which was a nice sized portion. 

Despite living 15 minutes away, I rarely venture into downtown Elgin. But when I do go back, I would probably go back and I imagine I&#39;d have to try one of their burgers."

Pros: FRIENDLY staff, big screens, bunch buffet, plenty of seating, large selection of beers. 

Cons: juice by itself is $3.50...not closer to where I live. :)

Since becoming a mom, I like to add whether an establishment is breastfeeding friendly. This place is!

I will definitely make the hour trip to eat here again."

Previously, I had not tried to go anywhere decent for dinner, but I made the exception this time. I found the public house based on prior reviews and decided to give it a go. I arrived on trivia night, which would normally have been awful, however, the woman hosting was not half bad! I sat at the bar, which is in between the formal dining area and the cafeteria-style area in the back. I was able to watch a couple of basketball games and enjoy a couple of very nice local microbrews. I knew I wanted a burger, but wasn&#39;t sure of which one, so I asked the bartender to pick for me. I got a BBQ burger with fries and an amazing jalapeño slaw that came on the side as well. The burger was good, not great, but the fries were cooked perfectly and the jalapeño slaw was amazing.

My husband and I both got the fish fry. You get a basket of five tilapia filets in a tasty and light seasoned batter. The fish is excellent, use your lemons and enjoy the tartar too, it&#39;s very good. You also receive a handful of steak fries which are also good, but warning EPH uses House Recipe ketchup...not my favorite. The basket also comes with very flavorful black beans (an odd addition, but tasty), an interesting cole slaw made of more than just cabbage and carrots and finally, the pièce de résistance: the hush puppies. I love hush puppies, I may have even gone through the LJS&#39;s drive thru for a side order of their dry hush puppies just to scratch an itch, and let me tell you, these hush puppies rock. They are perfectly crunchy in the outside and just underdone and moist on the inside. Love love love. The platter is $11.95, a solid price for all this food. So why four stars? Well the kids menu is a bit over priced at $6.50. Two chicken fingers and 10 fries total w/a milk makes $6.50 a bit steep. We also got chips and salsa, we were really hungry when we sat down and went for a quick app, they were good, but again, for $6, a bit overpriced. 
I&#39;ll definitely go back to EPH. Greg, the owner, definitely knows his recipes, the food here and at Grumpy Goat is great...its just the price point on a few items is a bit high, but I guess sometimes you have to pay for quality."

The ones your parents had in the basement for when ALL of the family came for Christmas dinner. The ones that never saw the full light of day because it was embarrassing to have them. Those chairs.

Anyway. Besides that, everything was great. Our waiter was friendly and attentive and had suggestions on drinks.

I had a chicken sandwich with fries and they were delicious. I basically annihilated the whole sandwich and fries probably in 5 minutes.

Service - 5/5 Loved our server. I forgot her name, but we were immediately greeted by a hostess and sat down. The ambiance of the restaurant is pub/casual - very laid back and chill.   Kind of lacking to be honest, but the food makes up for it. Our server was chip and very attentive to detail despite how busy it was. Our food was hot, fresh, and fast! 

Food - We started off with the cheese curds ($7). There wasn&#39;t a generous amount, but these came out piping hot. The coating on the curds was crispy and crunchy... mmmm. There was a good string on the cheese when you bit into them. Probably wouldn&#39;t order it again, but it was good to try. The chipotle ranch sauce they had going on was crack.

EPH Bison Burger ($17) was seriously so great. It came out perfectly medium rare, and it was still juicy inside. The duck bacon was a great added touch (crispy), and the arugula cut out all the fattiness/oil. It felt lean but packed full of flavor. The mac &#39;n cheese was good (it was a side) but didn&#39;t care much for it.

EPH Kobe Burger ($17) was great. The burger was juicy and flavorful. The only down side was the asian slaw had large chunks of onion which got really overwhelming. Otherwise, it was a delicious burger! The cajun sweet potato fries were good!

Definitely on the pricier side if you want to try these options, but the best burgers you&#39;ll eat in the suburbs!"

The staff is very friendly. We were seated right away, and got great service the whole night. We had an order of the cheese curds (really good!), and each ordered a burger. I was surprised at how big the menu was, and how many burgers they have! They even have bison, which is a pretty rare find. My burger was a little more done than I thought it should be, but still tasty. The fries came out piping hot, and they have homemade dippings sauces. I was a fan of the chipotle ranch.

On our most recent visit, my gf and I sat upstairs in these cozy leather lounge chairs along the row of windows looking down at Chicago street on a Saturday evening. We ordered the soft pretzels with EPH cheese sauce and honey mustard. We also shared the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side salad. The pretzels were good but they were clearly just the Superpretzels you can buy at any grocery store in the frozen food isle. I didn&#39;t mind much, since I only used them as a vessel to transport that gooey homemade cheese sauce straight to my dome!! The sandwich was great and the salad was fresh.

Elgin Public House Review
Bleu Horse Burger
I am delighted to say I was surprised  at the Elgin Public House, a massive bar in downtown Elgin, IL.  They&#39;ve been open eight years, and have an incredibly deep menu for hand prepped items.  They have a big selection of burger choices, including two Wagyu, two veggie options, a turkey, and bison.  The beef burgers come in a lot of pre-determined configurations, or you can start from scratch, pick your protein, bun and toppings.  All burgers are served with a choice of a side from a very long list of options.

Mrs BurgerDogBoy went straight for the &#34;The Bleu Horse,&#34; a burger crusted with blue cheese and horseradish, onion straws, and she added pickles and a tomato slice to the brioche bun. She chose Cajun fries as her side. I didn&#39;t try one, but she reported they had a little more heat than she expected.

I went with something way off the usual path for me, their &#34;Saltimbocca Burger,&#34;  topped with prosciutto, fresh Mozzarella and bruschetta.  It was served on a ciabatta roll slathered with red pepper aioli.  I went with their regular fries, which they call &#34;pub fries,&#34;  and they are somewhere between a shoestring and a steak fry in size and texture.

We both ordered our burgers medium rare, and they came......medium rare!  The hand-formed patties had a nice little char on them and a smash treatment.  Tough to get a smashed burger medium rare, kudos to chef.

Anyway, I was blown away by my burger.  These elements come together so perfectly I am at a loss to describe it.  The mozz and bruschetta were chilled, and the aioli brought it all together.  Hot protein, chilled vegetable, great bread durable enough for a heavily topped burger, and a little spice with the aioli.  Magnificent.

Add over the top service from Molly to the experience.  Two burgers, two soft drinks, $24.95.

If there&#39;s a &#39;next time,&#39;  I&#39;d give the Wagyu with garlic  Boursin a shot.  I&#39;ve no doubt it would be superb."

Half the time they are out of multiple beer selections on their been menu, which is disappointing. I understand you run out of things, no ones perfect, but it&#39;s happened more than once and I wish they&#39;d tell us right off the bat. 

The food&#39;s good, depending on what you get. I love their potato crusted cod sandwich with pub fries. I&#39;ve also tried a few other sandwiches along with the ribs, but nothing stuck with me. I do swear by their portabella mushroom strip appetizer, which is nothing like I&#39;ve ever had. They&#39;re crispy and flavorful, along with the zesty ranch dipping sauce that compliments them immensely. 

The service is also haphazardly. One instance we&#39;ll have an excellent, attentive waiter, the next time, not so much. One night we went in there, it got extremely busy, and the waitress lost her head. We were seated at an odd placed table, right next to another table, where shortly after, a party of five or six were seated. We might as well had all been sitting together considering the waitress could not even squeeze back there to check on us. Our order got screwed up, and she said it was so busy that we would have to wait another twenty minutes for the new sandwich to come out. We didn&#39;t even get the option to take it off the bill. Our waitress then avoided us at all costs for those twenty minutes, while we sat their twiddling our thumbs, with empty beers, and nothing to snack on.

I would say, give this place a shot, and definitely try the portabella app. On the weekends, they open the upstairs portion of the restaurant, which is for adults only. It&#39;s cozy and a bit quieter, though it is difficult to move around because the tables are so close. If you like a tasty, hearty stout beer, try the Dragon&#39;s Milk!"

Am I missing something because I think all the food tastes the same. My family and I have been there several times. We like their Monday burger deal.

But much to our surprise on Fridays and Saturdays they play Dinner Jazz upstairs.  Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not a snooty snob, but after a crapy day/week unwinding with a few dirty martinis (which Ryan our bartiender/waiter made spot on) with a wonderful  meal, good company and listening to music to calm you down instead of Ozzy Osborne&#39;s Crazy Train to wind you up is hitting the mark tonight."

I suggest starting with the beer battered portabella strips. They are thick and amazing all year round. The EPH Mac and cheese will make you fall off your chair, call your mamma and tell her you love her it&#39;s that good. Bonus- on Tuesdays they have build your own Mac and cheese with toppings like green chili and suck bacon. 
The beer selection beats anything in the area. Like IPAs? They have them in spades. Rare beers, ales, Belgians... Everything.

We enjoyed ourselves so much the first time we went back again.  It&#39;s a really fun &amp; laid back event.  It&#39;s on a smaller scale attendee wise but offers more than enough brewers to do some good sampling.  Because of the smaller size you are actually able to talk to the brewers &amp; reps &amp; learn about the beer you are drinking.  They have the sampling both in &amp; outdoors (tent covered). The cool thing is that after you&#39;ve been sampling &amp; get hungry you can grab a table or booth inside, order some food, look over your booklet of beers &amp; and keep sampling.  

The food is well above average pub fare as it is well thought out and very tasty.  I was really impressed that they offered 2 vegetarian burger options.  I had the black bean burger with sweet potato fries which I liked a lot.  We also got the fried pickles.  We actually got two orders because they were so good.  My husband enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich (on a pretzel roll per rec of waiter) with Mac n cheese for his side.  The service was excellent.  It was nice that our waiter was super friendly, gave us some solid food recommendations  &amp; discussed the beers with us.  Beyond the beer fest EPH offers a nice variety of craft beers.  Our waiter mentioned that they have monthly special events such as beer dinner pairings.  
 
We will definitely be back next year for the beer fest &amp; possibly for some of their other events if we are a able to make the drive.  I would def recommend EPH to my friends.  Also, check Groupon before you go.  We got a good deal on the beer fest through Groupon &amp; I have also seen some other deals for $ to spend on food/drinks."

Sometimes I break down and make a cardboard box of the stuff and we all know that &#34;it&#34; has to be ate immediately AND right out of the pan....but tonight I visited EPH for the first time and guess what, on Tuesdays it&#39;s make your own Mac &#39;n Cheese!

There is a lot on the regular menu at EPH. There are a lot of beers at EPH! And, even the Mac &#39;n Cheese menu is two-sided. It all seemed a bit overwhelming at first but stationing in a seat at the bar the reading began.

I like to make Mac &#39;n Cheese and this was good but missed out on it being &#34;baked,&#34; (maybe missed that on the two-sided menu.) The value/portion/taste needs a tweak, it seemed a very large portion of food, or you just plan ahead and share or know your going to have leftovers. 

I&#39;m hesitant to give this a 4-star for a bowl of Mac &#39;n Cheese but there is a lot to choose from here, it is a really neat building and being a first visit maybe it might be a good place to try again. 

Full menu and lots of beers to choose from, heard they even were on Chicago&#39;s Best, but... Take a look at the pictures...original T&amp;G wood floor in the kitchen, the old building was the best of my visit."

I&#39;ve never had anything that was bad, but a lot of their menu is uninspired. In fact, let&#39;s discuss the real issue, the menu. This is the kind of place that has a ridiculously long menu - I think they have at least 12 different burgers. Let&#39;s be honest, great restaurants have short menus because it allows them to focus.

EPH owners, if you read this, take that into consideration. You don&#39;t need 12 burgers - you need 2 or 3 that are clever then let me order whatever I want. Bam, half a page dropped from the menu like that. Be honest, you don&#39;t need a bacon cheeseburger with BBQ sauce on the menu - everyone already knows that combo is delicious and will order it if they want it.

Also, for a place that seems so interested in craft beer, they really need more taps. I think they have 5. Double that number and I&#39;ll be in several nights a week.

And that&#39;s my entire point - EPH is on the boundary of being a GREAT restaurant in Elgin. If only they made a few minor adjustments to presentation. And that&#39;s why I am so harsh on them, they do so much right, they are just missing that last 20%..."

Had the cajun sweet potato fries as a side - they were so salty, I could barely eat them. My dining companions had the regular fries as their sides and they said their fries were overly salty, too. Service was very good. I agree with another reviewer who said ambiance in this place is lacking. And the booth we sat in was so uncomfortable (we sank so far down that we felt like little kids at a too-tall table!) that my butt actually hurt and I couldn&#39;t wait to get up and leave. So c&#39;mon Public House - spring some of your profits for some new seating and decor.

The one gross, unsanitary thing I have to point out is that we noticed when our server was at the bar, she reached into the huge olive jar with her bare hands, scooped out some olives, and put them in drinks. Gross!!! Use tongs or else wear gloves!"

While exploring our neighboring towns, we decided to check out some spots in Elgin. My sister and I were yapping on the phone trying to plan our day out when one of us (I can&#39;t remember who!) found Elgin Public House. After scrolling through the pictures and checking out some reviews, we decided to give them a try. 

Off to Elgin with my husband and son to meet the sis and bro-in-law and we find a free parking garage immediately across the street. This was perfect!  As we approached, we commented on how the street view really doesn&#39;t do this place any justice. Nothing would have made me stop if I didn&#39;t know this bar/restaurant was here. 

Once inside, we end up having the nicest server and sit in her area toward the back of the restaurant. Kinda behind the bar area. This was fine for us as there were plenty of TVs and lots of football to be watched. Our guys were happy.

There&#39;s nothing fancy about this place, but the service was great and the food was fresh and tasty. I stepped outside my comfort zone with a meatloaf sandwich and chicken chili. Oh yeah!  I&#39;d order both again. The meatloaf was a little light on the actual sandwich but it tasted really good. Around the rest of the table was more chicken chili, regular chili, a chicken sandwich with pineapple, a chicken pesto sandwich, a burger and an avocado turkey wrap. Everything was good. There were absolutely no complaints about the food. We were practically planning our next visit in between bites!  I think we better get on that soon..."

My friend brought me to this place a few months ago. I had what is essentially a bruschetta burger and she had a chili cheese burger. Place was so good i brought my old man there for the breakfast buffet the next week. We go about once every 2 weeks now.

The menu is huge with tons of options. Seriously don&#39;t call in and asked to be read the menu (who the heck does that anyways) because there is just too much good stuff to list off. I highly recommend the fried pickles. Seriously this place has a friggin menu just for mac n cheese. 

I just went yesterday actually, and had a great experience because the staff actually gives a sh*t about the customers. We started with the beer battered portabella mushrooms, I HATE MUSHROOMS. But these things were delicious, I might have to change my perspective on mushrooms now haha. 

I had the EPH kobe burger. Which actually wasn&#39;t what I ordered, but I still ate the damn thing. WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS DELICIOUS. I couldn&#39;t even complain about getting the wrong meal!

Seriously, go here and eat. Be polite and you&#39;ll receive a great experience."

Just a few weeks back, we explored Des Plaines and yesterday we took a self-made tour of Elgin!

We originally were planning to go bowling in Carpentersville at Liberty Lanes, so we search our trusty Yelp app and found Elgin Public House in downtown Elgin. 100+ reviews and 4 stars...well if you use Yelp at all, you know that 4 stars with that many reviews really says something!

So as I was on the phone with my sister yesterday morning and talking about all the pics of the food at this place, I said to her &#34;I&#39;m not sure if you wanna go here for lunch, but this is where we are eating!&#34; 

We met my sister, brother-in-law and awesome nephew here just a little after 12 noon. 

Steve and I walked in to find a small dining room with just a few people inside and I thought we might not be in the right place so I got a little nervous but I told the gentleman that greeted us that we were meeting some people and he gestured to another area towards the back of this dining area and sure enough this place just goes on and on...found our party in the back of the restaurant behind the bar area and we joined them. 

We looked around and observed they even have an upstairs. Not sure what its used for but I can imagine maybe more seating or larger parties?

Our adorable server, Jami, greeted us warmly and brought us some drinks. She was a ace from start to finish with only on exception. We had a lot of questions for her, being that we have never been here before, and she graciously answered all questions.  She really knew the menu from front to back and made some suggestions and even gave her honest opinion about the things we asked her. 

We ordered our food and a few of us wanted chili so we opted for the up charge of $2.25 to get the chili as a side in place of fries or onion strings, etc. 

I selected the pesto chicken sandwich on a pretzel roll. I switched out the Swiss for FRESH MOZZARELLA for a nominal up charge and it was amazing. This sandwich is not something I would normally order but it sounded so good and I&#39;m SO happy that&#39;s what I ordered. I also got the chicken chili as my side. It had a bit of a kick and that was very nice. My hubby got the KC burger which had bacon, cheddar and BBQ sauce on it. BIL got a turkey, avocado pita with Cajun fries which I did sample and they were excellent. Nephew got the Hawaiian chicken sandwich which he really liked and my sis went for the meatloaf sandwich. Which is also not something she would order but she seemed quite happy with her meal except that the meatloaf was a lot smaller than the bread it was served on so there was a lot of empty space. 

Everyone overall enjoyed their food. My one tiny complaint regarding the food was there really wasn&#39;t enough cheese on my chili. I should have asked for just a bit more, so my bad. 

Now, my other issue...as excellent as our server was, she didn&#39;t check back on us until two of the five people at our table were completely done eating. We had several empty cups on the table and I found myself rationing my beverage.

They offer a Sunday brunch for like $14 pp, which I def wanna come back and try sometime soon!

This is absolutely going to become a new stop for us. Sandwiches were all about $10 or less so you won&#39;t go broke dining here. The facility itself is quite an old building, so it had character. Located in the heart of downtown with free parking directly across the street, how could you not at least stop by for a bite if you&#39;re in the area!?"

The fried pickles were tasty but a little high in price. The horseradish/thousand island that came with them was rich, tangy, and quite fantastic. They provide this sauce with all their fries. 

I chose the daily fish fry special which came with blue moon beer battered tilapia sticks, pub fries, a black bean mix, and a small cup of coleslaw. The price to taste ratio on this was excellent and the portion size was generous. 

I completed the meal with one of the $1 desserts. I got the &#34;undone cannoli&#34; which had some fresh strawberries, a bit of cannoli pastry, chocolate chip filling, and whip cream. It was several bites and a great way to end the meal.

I stopped in minutes before the kitchen was to be closed and they let me order anything i wanted on the menu.  I ordered the Wagyu burger and cheese curds. The burger was very good but the cheese curds were almost mozzarella stick quality.  They were basically all breading and the cheese would just fallout, the sauce that accompanied the curd was amazing, it&#39;s a shame they don&#39;t make a good cheese curd though..  Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to try any of their beers on tap.  I hope to stop in next time I&#39;m the area."

I&#39;m fairly picky about my steak and didn&#39;t want to pay what the steak joints around here want to charge for what I can create (maybe better) at home for $12-16. I&#39;d be really ticked if I spent $50 and they screwed it up. Can&#39;t justify that....
  So, I took a chance on this place. Server was kind, helpful &amp; attentive throughout the meal. I started with the goat cheese &amp; marinara appetizer. It was pretty good - packed up 1/2 of it and just reheated it. Still good. (Chose it specifically for it&#39;s microwave reheating capability.)
  Ordered the filet wrapped in prosciutto med-rare. They cooked it PERFECTLY! The prosciutto got a little rubbery, so didn&#39;t really care for that (It was a nice try, but maybe just stick to bacon, folks). The mashed potatoes were clearly made in-house and the sautéed veggies were a great fresh variety. 
  Nicely done. Quality much better than most &#34;pubs&#34;."

The place is much bigger than what it appears from the outside.  The food should really get 4 stars here. My son and I started off with the cheese curds, which were really good, not greasy at all like the ones he and I had a couple weeks ago at BWW.  We both decided on burgers. He had a bacon n egger, I had a KC burger. Both were cooked to perfection.  It was my son&#39;s first time having steak fries which we enjoyed.  The only downside was the service. We were seated for about 10 minutes before our waitress came to us. Once she did she was friendly enough and brought out our food to us quickly. Once we were done we had to wait for a bit to get our check. Granted it was lunch time and there were some people there. All in all I can recommend this place and will surely be back in the near future to try some of their other interesting sandwiches and offerings."

Marci, the bartender upstairs, was friendly, very knowledgeable on beers and gave great recommendations. At 11pm at night, they only serve sandwiches and appetizers and thank goodness as the 2 burgers we got were amazing (the KC had white cheddar and thick cut bacon and the B&amp;B had blue cheese and bacon with the perfect balance of cheese and meat). The fries were a little soggy but are thick-cut so they usually aren&#39;t crunchy anyway. Prices were extremely reasonable and especially for the portions - cheap by our standards as we live in downtown Chicago and it definitely would have been over triple if we were downtown for the same quality/size. By the time we left after midnight, everyone was playing throwback songs to 80s and 90s which was a ton of fun. if we are ever in the area, we will be back for sure!!"

The place looked a little small from the outside, but the hostess took us back and we found the restaurant is actually much bigger than expected. The atmosphere is fun. A large bar with an exceptional selection of beers (unfortunately we were unable to sample as we were on our lunch break) and plenty of TVs. Our waitress came over as soon as we were seated to take our drink order. She was extremely friendly very helpful as we made our selections. 

I decided to go with the grilled cheese with bacon and it was nothing special. My coworkers both got Reubens with a side of chili. They also thought that their sandwiches were alright. The waitress raved about the chili, but they found it to be not as spicy as advertised and average in flavor. 

Overall, the ambience and service of the restaurant were great, but the food was nothing out of the ordinary. I&#39;d be interested to go back again and try something else and maybe after work so we can check out the beer selection!"

Time of my visit: around lunch time

This was my first visit at this establishment.  It&#39;s not very big for sit ins lunches/dinners, but that&#39;s okay, most of places like that are intended to be that.  I came to the counter and the female owner took my order, she was extremely nice and upon me mentioning that it was my first time, she made a few recommendations.

I settled on half slab of ribs.  The wait was not long and the owner kept refilling my water promptly.  The ribs and fries came out fresh and hot!  The fries were well seasoned and surprisingly good (I usually don&#39;t care for the fries, fries are fries and my expectations are always low).

Now to the ribs, the ribs were awesome!  Top 2 in my book!  The right amount of bbq, the firmness of the ribs (not too firm to where it&#39;s hard to bite in or chew on, just a right amount of firmness).  I would say they were pretty delicious!

I should not have gotten a desert.  Overall a solid A!"

The last time my family was there we ordered a lot of food. We were moving this day and hadn&#39;t eaten so we treated ourselves. We started with an order of the fried ravioli. They were freshly made and served with the homemade marinara sauce. The inside was still gooey, while the outside had a good crunch. We were served warm bread with an olive oil and basil dipping sauce.

We then ordered a Caesar salad to split. it looked like too much dressing, but ended up being amazing and full of flavor. Their dressing is homemade and you can taste he difference.

My sister ordered a small deep dish pepperoni pizza. The crust is by far the best part. Lots of cheese throughout the pizza. My dad ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were amazing with a rich flavor. My mom ordered the eggplant parmesan, the same thing she always gets. She loved her dish. I ordered the angel pasta with vodka sauce and a side of Italian sausage. My food was probably the worst and yet still amazing and full of flavor.

We each left with a to-go container and enough food for two meals each. Overall this restaurant is amazing and the workers truly want you to have a good family experience."

I had full slab of ribs with fries and &#34;coleslaw&#34;

The fries were pretty mushy and soft, definatly made from frozen, no salt added, very plain

The coleslaw, if i can even call it that was like a genric one you get from any grocey store not very flavorful. What was worse is that the portion size was about 2 fork fulls litterally. It came in a sauce container that you would use for like a side of ketchup or relish.

Lastly the ribs which is the only thing saving this place from a 1 star. It was juicy and fall off the bone, but lacked the flavor on the meat. They depended more on the sauce, it was very lightly added on and there was a container of it on the side too. The sauce was pretty good but was more vinagar than i would like to taste. ( i am not a big fan of vinagar is all)

Overall not a place i would go back to eat at, also this meal was $22"

It honestly looks OK inside, service was decent and I&#39;ve got a cheese pizza on a thin crust to go Got home and I want to taste it right away,  I thought that somehow I&#39;ve lost my taste buds from the time I&#39;ve gone out and came back so I&#39;ve tried something else, seems to be fine, back to pizza, it&#39;s plain, absolutely flavorless, I check out the crust, it&#39;s not what I&#39;ve envisioned when placing an order for thin one, it&#39;s thicker then sauce and cheese on the pizza. I really was hoping for more, what I&#39;ve got was some flavorless cheese on top of the most bland sauce I&#39;ve seen come out of a kitchen proclaiming to be Italian, all of that smeared on crust I find acceptable for panini and not pizza, not a fan at all."

My husband got the Muscles in the Arrabiata Sauce as an appetizer and just loved them. He also loved his spaghetti and meatballs that night and  for a few days after, the portions were huge so there were definitely left overs.  I had the Chicken Marsala which was delicious one of the best I have had. Although I was very sad because I left the remainder of my meal in the hotel refrigerator and forgot to bring it home, what a disappointment :( 

The service was wonderful as well, I had quite a few bags so they helped me to my car.  The only reason I cannot give them 5 stars is because I got back to the hotel after smelling the delicious food ready to eat it and there was no cutlery in the bag.  We had a hard time scavenging for some utensils and it was just torture smelling the food and not being able to eat it when we were starving :)"

The option we were given was that they&#39;re closing in 15 minutes.... are we able to finish our meal in 15 minutes? I don&#39;t think so.
Went there after our son&#39;s 8th grade graduation 5/25/16. We were confident we could get a late dinner there since this happened 2 years ago after our daughter&#39;s graduation.  I could be mistaken, maybe their hours of operation were different 2 years ago and for this I apologize.
That night we went after our son&#39;s graduation, we saw about 3 tables occupied and the occupants were not even eating anymore, they&#39;re just talking. So disappointed and when I wrote an email through their website, http://www.asianfusionchicagoil.com/ but no response.

There was about a 20-30 minute wait to be seated outside on the patio, which was totally fine with us, and so we sat at the bar inside and had a couple of drinks and an order of crab rangoon while we waited. This was all very good, and the service was even better, being very friendly and attentive. 

We were seated outside before too long, and among us, we placed an order of vegetable fried rice, pad thai, philly roll, and rainbow roll. Let me just tell you that my friends who ordered the fried rice and pad thai will have leftovers for at least a week! So much food! The fried rice tasted as it should, but the pad thai wasn&#39;t as tasty as we&#39;ve had at other places, and that&#39;s usually a staple dish with Asian fusion restaurants. The maki dishes were as expected, but nothing to write home about either unfortunately. 

The main gripe was their form of live entertainment. While this might not be an everyday thing for the restaurant and others might have enjoyed it, the man on guitar overstayed his welcome by playing for HOURS. At least take a break, man! He wasn&#39;t awful, but when going to an Asian-themed restaurant, I wasn&#39;t looking to listen to obscure acoustic oldies. That really killed the atmosphere for us.

Overall, the service was great, the food was okay, and the atmosphere was okay. Inside was very neat and visually appealing. It was just that guy! We drove be an hour or two later after we had left, and he was still playing! Props to him for having such endurance! Would I go again despite this man? I&#39;d probably try out other Asian restaurants before I&#39;d come back for a second round."

Usually when I come here I get the pork pot stickers and the chicken dumplings. I would suggest these as appetizers and not meals. They are both delicious! 

Most of my friends get the seven flavor chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken but I didn&#39;t like the meat quality, it was kind of rubbery to me. But I rarely like the meat quality at most Chinese places so it may be my personal preference. 

I think they need to expand the menu. I&#39;m disappointed that they don&#39;t have any lettuce wraps.  If you don&#39;t like sushi there is not many low carb options which is why I think they need to get salad options and lettuce wraps. Those options are also good for people who are not huge Chinese food fans. I don&#39;t believe they have any dessert options either, which is missed sales in my opinion. 

The new manager is very nice and I hope he takes this place to the next level and expands the menu!

I&#39;ve updated my review to 2 stars. The food has been served cold a couple of times and hardly anyone was in the restaurant when we were served."

First - I loved that it was not overly crowded.  Second - the host greeted us immediately and was very nice (he even walked me over to the ladies room when I asked where it was located) yes, I thought that was odd, but nonetheless it was a nice gesture.  Third - our server could not have been friendlier or more attentive.  Great experience so far right?  I&#39;m thinkin &#39;yay I&#39;m a fan&#39;! 

My friend &amp; I were craving sushi, so we only looked at the &#39;small plates&#39; and maki rolls off the menu.  We started with the Tuna Avocado Sumiso and Sichuan dumplings.  The tuna avocado was described as having &#39;large pieces&#39; of big eye tuna.  Not only was the bowl it arrived in small, but the tuna was cut very small as well (picture a dice cut into 4 pieces) with small sliced avocado.  While this dish had a tasty sesame-miso sauce - we just wanted MORE, MORE... it felt like a toddler sized serving???  There was just not enough tuna...

The Sichuan dumplings were delicious.  chicken dumplings (made in house) with a super tasty spicy sauce (chili oil, garlic, scallions)..not as much heat as I would have liked, but I would definitely order this again and one small plate is not enough for two people...  6 dumplings on the small side...um...I&#39;d like more, more please? 

Out comes our rolls: Triple k.c.  &amp; Roselle roll.  Triple k.c. was cucumber wrapped (thick sliced cucumber, not paper thin) smoked &amp; Scottish salmon, crabmeat and a dab of cream cheese sitting in rice wine. This was absolutely delicious.  Not a complicated roll, simple ingredients - but nicely done!!  I&#39;d like to meet the creator of this roll!!!   So refreshing and light!!!  WINNER!  .  Again, I could have had 2 plates of this myself.  Who doesn&#39;t want more cucumber?  I highly recommend trying this...

On the flipside, the Roselle roll was good..  Large roll and much more filling...10 super sized pieces filled with shrimp tempura, asparagus, daikon, avocado, tempura flakes, cream cheese? Lots going on here...I enjoyed both rolls, but LOVED the triple k.c....I will be returning here....Service was very, very good.  While service and some dishes deserve a 4.  Serving size on starters and lack of tuna was a 3.  Overall, 3.5."

**I do see that the long wait for food was not just on our night but seems to be a trend as documented in prior reviews**

**The cocktails were boring.  Maybe I was spoiled by a recent visit to the Violet Hour, but the cocktails here were not flavorful. So if you want a dinner drink, stick to the wines or beer**

**The food was good, thank goodness for that.  But if I were to come back, it would be for take out only.  And that would mean calling it in first.  I don&#39;t think I could go through another long wait like this past visit**

Shared plates and tastes among 6 gals: 

Tuna Poke Roll--I love tuna poke but this was needed more seasoning to evoke the flavors of tuna poke.  Sesame oil that&#39;s the key. 
Triple KC Roll--this was excellent. It&#39;s a huge roll and the ingredients were fresh.  
Nigiri--Super White Tuna and Sake Toro--had to send it back because there was a hair on the plate.  The replacement was very good although not very pretty like Nigiri is supposed to look like. Fish to rice ratio was off. 
Black Peppered Garlic Beef--excellent flavors.  The meat could use a little bit of marinade or tenderizing as it was quite chewy. But the flavors were good. 
Sichuan string beans--this dish was perfect.  Beans were crisp tender and flavorful.

Mochi ice cream and pastry wrapped cheesecake were desserts and both were excellent.  They did comp our desserts because of how long we had to wait for everything.  That was nice.  How about I give them that 3rd star."

The food is good (when they get your order right) which isn&#39;t very often. Service is great. We always order takeout. The order is 96% of the time not right. Order chicken get shrimp, order not spicy get extra spicy. Missing items. All on different occasions.  Not sure what is going on over there. They could have a good thing if they&#39;d just get the orders right, they are always quick to offer a replacement dish or credit on be account. The manager even delivered to our house because the order was wrong... Again."

The food here is excellent. There is a ton of flavor and the ingredients are fa-resh!! It&#39;s also in a great location, smack dab in the middle of downtown Roselle.

For appetizers, the seaweed salad is a refreshing renewal of a classic. There&#39;s a cucumber bedding underneath. The pot stickers are scrumptious.  The wonton is delicate and not too doughy, perfectly paired with the dipping sauce. Crab rangoon is delish- but it&#39;s a reliable app that is always safe to order.

Love that they support the local winery, Lynfred. There&#39;s always new Lynfred wines to order by the glass or bottle. There&#39;s even events that join the two power houses, Asian cuisine and Wine?!? Yes please!

For main course I LOVE the Seven Flavor Chicken. The sushi is great. Can be an appetizer or a main course. We have ordered the Roselle Town Hall... I do not recommend this party tray. Most of the pieces of fish are unusual cuts and we had a hard timing stomaching all of it. Worth paying slightly more and get the exact rolls you want.

Dessert. Usually we have no room for dessert BUT when we must, we must have the mochi balls. They are light, flavorful, and you leave 8 mile feeling like you&#39;ve had a complete dining experience.

What I&#39;m not a fan of is the dining experience. I do like the modern ambiance BUT it&#39;s arranged like a large dining hall. It feels like a cafeteria when it&#39;s empty or filled with people. When it is filled with patrons, its very noisy, chaotic and crowded feeling.

Regardless, we love coming here. It&#39;s close. It has great dishes. Serves fab drinks.... Nothing else to desire. ;)"

I have stopped in here twice now and discovered that I like this place. Have had the sushi (pretty good), Schezwan green beans, (very good) and Shrimp Lo Mein (excellent).
I like my food on the spicy side and they nailed it both times. A large portion of tasty noodles with some veggies along with a whole bunch of shrimp. So fresh tasting! Honestly, I think this was the best Lo Mein I have eaten and I have eaten a lot of this dish.

Atmosphere + service was OK, and so were the prices. I will be returning for sure to get my Lo Mein fix.

They do take out too.

Cheers to all"

I have to say, if sushi is all you&#39;re looking for, this is not the place for you. I&#39;ve had the volcano, the dragon, and the Sakura. None of them were very well rolled and fell apart when picked up, but the worst offense was the amount of sauce covering them. The volcano was fine with some of the honey mustard scraped off, but I found the Sakura to be inedible. 

HOWEVER, the rest of the food here is decent! The Thai basil shrimp is delicious and tastes very fresh. The fried rice and lo mein are good too and definitely above the level of your usual Chinese takeout. Go here for anything but the sushi."

Are next journey was back to 8000 Miles to have an amazing dinner with all the beer and wine you wanted from the brands they were serving.  The limo bus took us to Elgin Community College to see  The comedians from Who&#39;s Line is it Anyways.  Everyone loved the show.  We were taken back to the restaurant still with more beer and wine if wanted.  We had such a great time.  I will be watching their website for more to come.

For the first monthly meeting back in August, I suggested meeting at 8000 Miles. I actually missed that meeting, but the book club loved it (whew!), so they&#39;ve been meeting here every month ever since.

The first time I ate here, I ordered my typical Asian foods: spring rolls for an appetizer and California rolls for the entree. I also tried the edamame. I know, I know, they&#39;re not that exciting, but they hit the spot for me. All were delicious. Not stunning, but nothing to complain about. 

Then I saw the dessert menu and my jaw dropped when I saw &#34;Happiness Mochi.&#34;

YES! No one else at my table knew what it was, so I ordered some to share. We were presented with three flavors of mochi cut into pieces. The delightful display was gobbled up instantly. I loved it. So did everyone else. Another plate of mochi was ordered right afterwards and has been a staple dessert at each book club meeting.

That wasn&#39;t all. A collective &#34;ooooh!&#34; rose from the table when the waitress presented us with fortune cookies. Not only were the fortunes amusing, but the cookies were actually good!!! Not stale and tasteless like most places.

I spent about $20 on myself for an appetizer, a dish, a dessert, and tip. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too bad considering the pleasant interior, the (usually) large dishes, the delicious food, and the speedy service!

For last week&#39;s meeting, I stepped away from my comfortable foods and tried the Oktoberfest roll. I cannot remember exactly what was in -- salmon/sweet potato/butternut squash/veggies of some sort -- but it was absolutely amazing. I was blown away by how hearty this sushi roll was. It was autumn splendor in my mouth. Mmm.

I came with my parents for lunch once too and they were also equally impressed with the food. Our lunch portions were huge and everything tasted wonderful. They enjoyed their fried rices and beef dishes; my vegetable lo mein was scrumptous and enough for three meals! My parents are kind of picky when they eat out so I was quite relieved that they liked it here!

Writing this review is making me hungry. I&#39;m craving some sushi....

I&#39;m looking forward to November&#39;s book club meeting already!

I really hope this place is here to stay. God knows Roselle needs it."

Any place can do the fancier rolls and make them tasty but the basics are where you can see/taste the quality of the rolls and fish).
After having a MAJOR craving for sushi we decided to try somewhere closer to home and landed on 8000 Miles. Having tried TL&#39;s in Bartlett, I knew I could get some delicious specialty rolls and appetizers, but again, I went for the basics to see how they fared. I don&#39;t know if TL&#39;s has also slid on the basics but I wasn&#39;t impressed. I like my rolls to be big (even if it costs more), have nice chunks of fresh fish (that don&#39;t taste fishy), and not be too mashed up or mushy (usually on spicy rolls). These unfortunately WERE tiny and WERE all mashed up and mushy. They were actually kind of spicy (which is another pet peeve of mine...I always have to add a ton of spicy sauce or wasabi) and they were fresh...they were just not to my picky standards. 
I would certainly come here for their delicious appetizers (especially those shrimp bombs!) or Chinese but I&#39;ll definitely be skipping the sushi from now on."

Perfect place to come after sipping on some wine (some = several glasses).   I am not familiar with this suburb, but the area seemed cute and well maintained.

We had a reservation for 5:45 via Open Table, which I love and think all restaurants should be required to used.   We got there early and they sat us with no problem.   The place wasn&#39;t even 1/2 full.   Even when we left a few hours later, it was still only about 1/2 full.   If I lived in the area, this would be a go-to place to eat for me.

Group of 5, and 4 of us were driving, so we layed off the liquor.   I really-really-really wanted to try one of their martinis or the mai-tai, but sadly, did not.   Next time I&#39;ll bring a DD with me.   We started with 3 apps - calamari, crab rangoon, and sichuan dumplings.  All were good, but the sauce on the dumplings was spot-on and spicy.  

3 of the group went with sushi and said everything was good and the fish was fresh.  I think they split 5-6 rolls.   I opted for the hot wok chili chicken, which was supposed to be one of their spiciest dishes.  It was really good.   Now, I love heat and this was a good amount, but I could have handled more.   The portion was huge and there were tons of fresh veggies and chicken and chili peppers.   I would highly recommend this dish to anyone and I would have a hard time not ordering it again, even though there are a few others on the menu I&#39;d like to try.

Dessert was ordered, but I was too full to even try anything.   Everything looked good though.  The place has a good menu - a wide variety - good prices and nice sized portions.

Service was ok, nothing special, not overly friendly.  The space is pretty nice - open, airly, clean lines, modern.

Aside from that, I&#39;ve also never had Asian fusion (I know, I know, late to the party...).  So when another Yelper suggested we go for dinner, I was pretty darn stoked.

We sat outside on the patio - it was a pretty good day for it and the area is that cute downtown vibe!  But, um, then the trains came by.  Do they ALWAYS blare their horns when they approach?  Kind of a mood killer.

So, onto ordering! I know it&#39;s a fusion place, but it seemed there were various cuisines - Thai, Chinese, Japanese - but nothing that was truly &#34;fused&#34; IMO. I expected to see Mexican-Japanese or something.  

We ordered the Crazy Roll as an app.  I was torn between a shrimp/prawn dish, but spotted the Curried Lamb and decided to indulge myself.  Our waitress also suggested it over the shrimp.  My counterpart ordered the Peppered Beef.

Crazy Roll?  Meh.  For some reason when we order maki (rolls) lately, they end up all sauced up.  

I wanted to love the lamb, but it was just spicy - not *flavorful* spicy - and really chock full (50%) of green onions (and I looove green onions, but not THAT much!).  And I like my lamb with a nice sear and juicy, rather than swimming in sauce.  Needless to say I pushed my leftovers onto my +1.

Now HIS Peppered Beef?  LOVE.  It had a nice crisp outside and was full of flavor.  I really had stopped liking/eating beef, but that dish probably could have converted me back to a duurty carnivore.  I kept waiting for him to turn around or to get distracted so I could steal some off of his plate, but no such luck! :/  The only downside was the presentation.  He literally had a broccoli ring on his plate (beef in the center). 

I&#39;m probably going to be Yelp Chastized for this, but I found 8000 Miles underwhelming.  Not sure if it&#39;s just one of those hyped-up places that&#39;s the &#34;thing&#34; right now, or if we just ordered the wrong things/went at the wrong time.

It was very convenient for me to pick up a lil sumpin&#39; sumpin&#39; for lunch yesterday after picking up some vino, so that&#39;s just what I did. After seeing some very trusted fellow Yelpers go to 8000 Miles and giving it rave reviews, I had to do my own personal inspection. Plus I heard it is connected to TL&#39;s Four Season which one of my coworkers raves about all the time. I&#39;m happy to say - it passed my test! 

I called in an order for pickup of their Crispy Honey Sesame Beef and was quoted 20 minutes. This dish intrigued me because I&#39;ve seen crispy honey dishes and seen sesame dishes, but never all together. It&#39;s combining my most favorite Asian fusion flavors all in one dish for my eager consumption, hurrah! I arrived precisely 20 minutes later and was happy to see my dish all packed up and ready to go. Now when I looked at their menu online, I saw nothing of lunch specials so assumed it was cost me $14. I was quoted an $11 total so apparently I got a special lunch price. I can only assume it was a slightly smaller portion to go along with that price.

While inside I took a quick looksie around and it looked like a really nice place to dine in + parking is plentiful right outside. They have a menu board with some specials and I saw they do a Lynfred Winery pairing. I must say even the outside of 8000 Miles looks cute and trendy.

My crispy honey sesame beef was so delicious. It was quite crispy bordering on being a bit too much for me sometimes as I couldn&#39;t tell if it was just overcooked a tad too much (like I couldn&#39;t cut it and had to eat each long piece in one bite) or a nice crisp. The sauce was so friggin good though. It truly was the perfect blend of honey and sweet sesame causing me to devour my lunch! The lunch special came with a side of white rice, thank goodness. I need rice like I need air.

They have so many dishes on their menu that look so good and I&#39;ll be back to try more. They need a happy hour!"

Life got in the way, but tonight the stars aligned and I was off to Main Street in Downtown Roselle. 

The entrance looks inviting as were the hostesses. They were greeting us before we even made it in the door. There were some specials on a menu board over the host stand that we took a moment to read through. 

The dining room was maybe 20% full on this Tuesday evening at 7:30. Water glasses were kept full and extra white rice was no problem to get quickly. 

Our waitress could use some polishing. Bringing an unwrapped drinking straw with her bare hands and placing it in the glass was the thing that stuck out to me the most. Although the gentleman filling water glasses brought a straw wrapped in a paper napkin, so I think that faux pas was specific to the waitress and not the restaurant. 

Our meals were fine. Nothing exciting or enough to send me running back. The basil garlic chicken was requested as white meat only. We were told that it already was, but I really don&#39;t think so. I told my sister that it was to appease her, but I&#39;m pretty sure I was rocking the thigh meat in the bites I tasted. My son&#39;s sushi roll looked lost on the giant plate he received. When it arrived, I immediately suggested that he order more food and he declined. Finally, my crispy black pepper beef was overcooked and tasted like seafood. I didn&#39;t mind the seafood undertone since I enjoy shrimp, but my sister and son noticed it prominently and wouldn&#39;t eat the dish. And the potstickers...I almost forgot. Pan fried to a milky white color!  The waitress suggested fried rather than steamed, but the potstickers spent very little time in the pan based on all appearances and the lukewarm centers. 

The menu was very similar to TL&#39;s with a few twists including an option for family style with six or more guests. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll make my way back to 8000 Miles since TL&#39;s is closer to home, has the service down to a science and the food has me thinking about our next meal there."

The hostesses greeted us promptly and before seating us, my sister noticed a specials board above the hostess stand. She asked the hostess if the specials were printed in the menu somewhere and she informed us they were not so make sure to read the board before being seated!

The restaurant is very comfy/casual but seemed kinda empty for the 7 o&#39;clock hour on a Tuesday. We were not greeted by our server nearly as quickly as the hosts. 

When she finally made her way over, I was pleased to see she greeted us with ice water! I found it weird that she set the ice water on the tables and THEN put the cocktail napkins next to the glasses. I know it was intended for additional beverages but only one of us ordered something besides the water so it didn&#39;t make much sense. I did ask the server for a straw and she brought it to me with her bare hands and put it in my glass of water. I was a little put back because she had just been handling menus and serving trays moments prior so I wasn&#39;t a fan of the bare hands. Later in the meal, my sister asked the busboy for a straw for her beverage and he was wise enough to bring it wrapped in a napkin. Good job, busboy guy! You made me very happy. 

We ordered an app of fried potstickers per our servers recommendation. The potstickers were not quite as fried as they should have been. They were not really browned or even very hot throughout. I was a bit disappointed but seeing as no one checked back on us, we didn&#39;t have the opportunity to give our feedback on the potstickers. I guess they will have to read my review to find out. 

The dish I ordered was the basil garlic chicken. I specifically asked if it was white meat chicken and the server informed me it was. After being served the dish, I&#39;m about 95% certain there was dark meat in the dish. My sister told me she thought it was white meat but I think she may have been fibbing to me much like the server did earlier. 

My nephew got a sushi roll: the volcano roll that sounded good on the menu but was served on a huge plate so it literally looked like a smaller portion than our appetizer we shared. We both encouraged him to order a second roll or even a soup or something but he said it was enough so we left it at that. 

My sister ordered the black pepper chicken and while it looked visually appealing, I had a bite, and it had a distinct seafood-y flavor. Like it had been fried with some fish or something. Gross!!!

Finally, the bill took a while to be taken off the table with our card so that was a bit irritating kinda being &#34;held hostage&#34;. 

Honestly, I would prefer to go to TL&#39;s in Bartlett. At least they include soup or salad with your entree there and it&#39;s consistent."

The experience I had at 8000 Miles was an exceptional one for a place that had just opened 4 days prior. Besides a bit of lag time first getting a server to our table, the service after that was on point most of the items I ordered were easily deserving of 5-stars. 

My dining partner had a few more critiques for 8000M than I did, but I think that stems from our different dining styles. The menu is described as Asian-fusion and our server let us know that the beginning half of the menu leans more towards Chinese while the latter half of the menu is more Japanese. My dining partner went with a dish that leaned toward Chinese flavors, and I went with sushi. 

We started with the veggie spring rolls, which were pretty plain. The menu mentioned a bunch of stuff inside the spring rolls, but to us from looks and taste, it seemed just like shredded cabbage wrapped in a wonton skin and fried. I likely wouldn&#39;t get this again, plus you only get two relatively small spring rolls for $4. I could understand if there was a decent mixture of veggies, but there really wasn&#39;t and this dish just fell kind of flat for me. 

Next up, I had to get a bowl of miso because it&#39;s tradition for me at any place that offers it. The miso was perfect... albeit about a dollar more than it would have been at other area restaurants, I can be okay with that for good this dish was. 

My partner got the Buddha&#39;s Vegetables plate ($9) that&#39;s a mixture of shanghai bok choy, broccoli, carrots, winter bamboo, smoked organic tofu and napa cabbage wok tossed in vegetarian oyster sauce. It looked good, but again, the dish was just lacking a bit of something. The flavor wasn&#39;t spectacular and it would&#39;ve been nice to see the dish come with a soup or salad or something, but it&#39;s a decent vegetarian option, not great. Certainly deserving of 3-stars, but fell short compared to what I&#39;d ordered.

Like I mentioned, my meal consisting of various sushi plates was pretty spectacular. Or at least most of it was. The only exception being the Harvest Roll ($9) with daikon, carrots, cucumber, avocado, Japanese squash, tempura sweet potato, and asparagus, wrapped in soy paper. To me, the Harvest Roll was lacking flavor beyond tempura and I&#39;m really not a fan of that when it comes to sushi.  The Spice Lover&#39;s Roll with Tuna was absolutely phenomenal. Probably one the best roll&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had (coming from spice lover). I&#39;ll absolutely be getting at least one of these on every one of my return visits. Another must: Crispy Rice (house sushi rice is crisped and formed into squares, topped with a mixture of spicy salmon, sliced jalapenos, scallions, tempura spinach and beet crunch) at $8 for 4 pieces. I couldn&#39;t get enough of this item found on the small plates menu. 

8000 Miles would be a a great girl&#39;s night hang, but a little loud to try anything more intimate than that. 

Musts: 
-Crispy Rice (small plates)
-Spice Lover&#39;s Roll w/ Tuna
-Miso Soup

Mehs: 
-Spring Rolls
-Buddha&#39;s Vegetable

Not perfect yet, but has enough stars on the menu to warrant the early declaration of future and frequent return visits from yours truly."

While 8000 Miles still has a bunch of kinks to work out, I couldn&#39;t be happier to have a restaurant like this open up in sleepy Roselle!

As you will learn from reading the last page of the menu, they are co-owned by the owner of TL&#39;s Four Seasons, a similarly schmancy Asian fusion restaurant in Bartlett. Some of the dishes are the same; for example, the spicy beef appetizer which my partner loves.

For drinks, I ordered a house-made ginger ale and the fuji-tini. The ginger drink wasn&#39;t bad, but as a ginger-lover I&#39;ll have to say it pales in comparison to Big Bowl&#39;s -- it was just very sweet and not gingery enough. The fuji-tini was quite tasty. My partner ordered the sake flight which we heartily enjoyed. Our favorite was the dewatsuru &#34;kimoto.&#34; The &#34;silk deluxe&#34; was good too, but the &#34;omachi&#34; was too bland for our taste.

My Buddha&#39;s vegetables dish was great except the smoked tofu part. They initially forgot to include any tofu, and when I got the redo, there were only three slices of cold, unseasoned tofu. All the veggies were delicious and fresh, so I think there was just a weird slip-up here.

The veggie lover&#39;s roll was good, though could&#39;ve been more flavorful. Less cucumber, more pickle/mushroom, perhaps?

Service was very attentive. We were overcharged $1 for the sake flight, however it was fixed immediately when we mentioned it. I&#39;m going with an optimistic rating for now, and I hope they&#39;ll be more on top of things when we come back soon to try again!"

Place looks nice on the inside, but the patio wasn&#39;t maintained at all. Service was OK, bartender was a cool guy. Menu is stupid expensive for the dishes, so that&#39;s good if you really want that &#39;I&#39;m eating my paycheck&#39; sensation. Not really worth it though.

Sure, higher quality food and fancy pants recipes or whatev, but it still didn&#39;t pay for itself. I&#39;ve been in upscale establishments and paid way too much for small plates, so it&#39;s not just that I&#39;m a commoner cheapskate. I&#39;m American! I want to be able to leave a restaurant, thinking more food would stretch my gut, without having to go over $100. Ugh... /endtypicalonlinerant

Being a person with ADD, what better way (than a buffet) to fulfill my mind-changing ways with a blend of awesome cuisine (Japanese and Chinese)? 

So this place is located right next to a train station. If you sit outside, be forewarned that you will hear the train zoom by blaring their horns every time. Sucks that this is the case, but I suppose the location is good for those commuters getting off the train for a bite to eat before going home. I would classify the ambiance and decor of this place to be &#34;modern&#34; and somewhat &#34;trendy&#34;, but don&#39;t feel like you need to dress up for the place. Casual clothers like me are welcomed!

The interesting thing about the menu is that although they claim to be fusion, there really wasn&#39;t any fusion going on; sure, they have Japanese and Chinese cuisine on the menu, but no dishes were fused together. They had sushi and chinese food. I ordered the Peppered Beef, which was absolutely AWESOME! My gal pal Jen P ordered a lamb dish, that was kinda chewy. We also ordered the Crazy Roll, which was nothing that really stood out, but it was OK. 

Overall, wish there was more fusion going on, and the train was a distraction, if you eat out. But the Peppered Beef was delicious and overall the staff was attentive and helpful with their food suggestions.

BATHROOM REVIEW: The bathrooms were super clean. They had Chinese newspaper plastered all over the wall, like wall paper. The wood stalls were very nice. It also had two nice clean urinals. Sit or squat? Sit!!"

Lots of shrimp. Very tasty.  My dish had great taste and a nice amount of beef. The very big problem with beef. I did not have one piece of meat that I didn&#39;t  have to pull out of my mouth because of tendin that was very thin but could not chew. It ran in virtually every piece of meat. the meat in general was very chewy but could not be broken down with my teeth.Very pissed. Did I tell the server. No I didnt. Should I have, darn right.

Not sure but I used to be such a fan. We had lunch today and the waitress wasn&#39;t knowledgeable, her hygiene was questionable, and service was slow and our order was wrong. In her defense she was the only waitress in a room full of people who came out for a lunch special. The Food: ugg my rolls weren&#39;t rolled correctly so they all fell apart at the first touch, my rainbow roll was tiny and just full of cucumbers. The fish on top was so thinly sliced and tiny. My spider roll was TINY and again full of just cucumbers, I would say it was up to par with jewel supermarket sushi. We try to pay our bill to find out the credit card machine was down. So picture a full room of business people who came to grab a quick lunch to come to find out they can&#39;t pay since they don&#39;t have cash so ofcourse will not be returning to work on time.

I like the food but very frustrated when it comes to the service. Tonight I sat down to a dirty bar, dirty plates. Nobody cleaned them the entire 30 minutes I sat there. When I got to the bar there were 4 people there and 2 left shortly after I sat down. I ordered a drink, told them twice no fruit in my drink.... She makes it with fruit....I tried to tell her as she was making it again. I had to ask the couple next to me for their menu. The manager seemed nice, but he never cleared the bar either and sat and talked to the people next to me for 10 minutes. He asked me at one point if I wanted to order but I wasn&#39;t quite ready. And that was the last I heard from anyone. Bartender never asked me once to order, how I was doing, nothing. After sitting there for a half an hour I asked her for my tab. I had to ask a server that walked by for change because the bartender never came back to me.It was not even half full in the whole place. Dirty glasses all over the service area, back bar and bar top. The servers, bartender just all standing around. I have really tried to give this place a chance, even ordered Togo food 2 days prior, but the service needs to be fixed. I was super excited for this restaurant to come here to Roselle.

Much to our disappointment, it didn&#39;t stand out all that much.

The service was fantastic, welcoming and exceptionally friendly, but it was the food that failed to really achieve any sort of distinctiveness during our visit. 

My wife&#39;s Pad Thai was bland, with little taste to the noodles. Admittedly, she said she wasn&#39;t looking to have any spice in the dish, but that shouldn&#39;t render it devoid of anything palatable. Similarly, my sushi failed to offer any flavor above the typical conveyor-belt style offerings.

The shrimp tempura roll only had  5 pieces and each piece was on the thinner side. I would rather go to Mitsuwa for better quality food and more food for my money. We spent about $20 for lunch and had to get more food afterwards because we were still a bit hungry. At Mitsuwa, we can get lunch under 15 bucks and are stuffed afterwards.

Hit the spot! Most asian fusion restaurants have been disappointing for me but at 8000 Miles both Chinese and Japanese dishes were delicious. 

For appetizers we ordered potstickers and crispy rice. The potstickers were good but nothing special compared to some of our other dishes. Crispy rice was yummy! Sort of an inside-out spicy tuna roll. My mom also order their house made ginger ale...YUM! Very fresh, light, and sweet. For entrees we had ginger asparagus shrimp, shanghai fish, and a ben roll. The shrimp dish was definitely our favorite; cooked and seasoned to perfection. The shanghai fish and ben roll were both from the specials menu and were equally satisfying. Shanghai sauce had similar flavors to sweet and sour sauce and was poured over crispy flaky fried fish. Loved the ben roll, the red pepper and cilantro gave it a unique taste. We also had the banana nutella wontons for dessert which were okay, nice with the side of ice cream.

The space itself is beautiful, they also have a huge patio that I&#39;m sure is awesome in the summertime. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because our service was kinda slow, especially since the place was pretty empty.

So I decided to give them a try.

The inside of the restaurants couldn&#39;t be more different.   Bistro Dragon is the more refined location of the two.   8000 Miles interior reminded me of a cross between Starbucks and PotBellys.    But that doesn&#39;t detract from the food one bit.

I decided on carryout and ordered the Sichuan Chicken Dumplings &amp; Ginger Asparagus Shrimp for the main dish.   The appetizer was very small but tasty.   The sauce was nice and tangy and complimented the otherwise normally bland dumpling.   I was impressed with the amount of Shrimp that was in the main dish.   They definitely didn&#39;t skimp there nor did they skimp on the Asparagus or ginger.     About the only thing they did skimp on though was the rice.   The container I received was a smaller container but that was only half way filled.   Next time I order I will have to request extra rice.    I wound up having to cook a little extra rice for the leftovers.

Will definitely be back though and look forward to trying their sushi and other dishes as well."

Lo and behold, a little sleuthing on my part revealed that one of the co-owners of 8000 Miles is the man who opened TL&#39;s. 8000 Miles continues that tradition with similar offerings and a similar design aesthetic. It even opened up shop near the Metra line like TL&#39;s. 

The crispy honey sesame beef is delicious so try it if you ever stop in. We also tried the crispy rice, which was a tasty twist on maki (the crispy rice is served as a square).  However, the portions were really small and not worth the price. The Roselle Roll had a lot going on: shrimp tempura, asparagus, crab meat, and a spicy tuna topping, just to name a few components. It was delicious, but slightly overpriced at $16. 

The place was well decorated and had some interesting interior architecture. Overall, I think this place is on par with TL&#39;s, but the offerings are overpriced for the portion sizes. As for the service, our server was neither rude nor absent, but she did not seem particularly enthused during our meal.

At its best, 8000 Miles opens wide doors into what this genre could be; complex, layered compositions of unique flavors and textures that leave you wanting to drive to O&#39;Hare and take the next flight to Shanghai, with a connecting flight to Tokyo.

Having a cold, I kicked things off with Genmaicha Tea, or green tea steeped in corn and toasted popped rice. Both flavors lingered long in the green tea; I would recommend giving it a try.

For appetizers we had potstickers and calamari, and again I was not let down. The potstickers had the perfect springy texture, and its spices went well with a sweet soy sauce accompaniment. Likewise, the calamari was heavily seasoned (including, I believe, large leaves of parsley in the batter?) but paired with a simple chili sour sauce. In both cases I approved of the match of textures, flavors and complementary (sauce) flavors.

We moved on to the Sesame Chicken and &#34;Salmon on My Mind Roll&#34;. The sesame chicken was the first thing that tasted relatively &#34;ordinary&#34; to me, which was too bad. The roll, on the other hand, continued the theme and nearly made me cry. :-D

Roasted garlic chip on top, crisp fresh red bell pepper, and pan-fried greens. Smoked salmon. Rice with black sesame seeds. Cream cheese sauce, match-sliced cucumber, red pepper sauce, and then--most importantly--roasted garlic sauce. This seems like too much, but it&#39;s not; it is 100% delightful and deserves a place on the menu.

We actually made room for dessert, where we got the Cheesecake Spring Roll. Cheesecake is associated more with Philadelphia than Pan-Asian, but one thing I didn&#39;t know when they set the crisp roll with strawberry and chocolate sauces before us: the cheesecake inside is wonderfully warm. Mmm.

8000 Miles is a risky departure from the standard cheap fare in the suburbs, but one that I hope a lot of people around here buy into. It is a trip worth taking."

Only two other people dining.  7 for our party.  Hostess sat us at table.  Waited 15 minutes then guests in our party suggested we leave as not a single person attended the table.  No water only menus.  Despite the fact that the hostess went to sit next to another 8000  employee.  There was another table of three employees sitting in the dining room.  Total of five employees sitting, one waitress attending to the other table.  I finally went to the hostess and asked if anyone knew we were there?  Dah!  5 employees sitting in an empty dining room.  Later found out that the table of three was the shift manager and two others.  

Ultimately ordered sushi and main courses.  Sushi came out last.  Second time (2 for 2) that has happened.  

Staff seriously needs training and this manager doesn&#39;t understand dining.

Sorry that was my last try for 8000 miles.  We will only go to their sister restaurant ... TL&#39;s Four Seasons in Bartlett..... Perhaps 8000 miles will get it fixed someday!"

I had previously gone for lunch and this was for dinner. My friend and I ordered two appetizers (small plates) and then 3 sushi rolls to share.  Potstickers were great and I highly recommend the Tuna Avacado Sumiso appetizer.  It is delicious.  For sushi rolls we ordered the tuna avacado roll which is exactly what it sounds like.  It was good quality.  We also ordered the Triple KC roll.  This has two different types of salmon and it is wrapped in cucumber.  It was good but really hard to handle with chopsticks.  We also ordered the White Mountain roll, which looked beautiful but wasn&#39;t suited for my tastes.  It had a medley of &#39;white fish&#39; in the middle with crab and crunch on top with a spicy sauce.  I personally thought that this roll was too fishy for me.  The service was very good and the food came out VERY fast, given that it was 6:30pm.  The ambience of the restaurant is quiet and comfortable.  I look forward to going back to try more dishes.  My friend said the orange beef is to die for."

We went on a Thursday night at 6 it was about half full which is expected for a relatively new restaurant. The interior was very well decorated and designed. A lot of open space, high ceilings make for a comfortable setting. The problem is the dining room projects sound so even though it was half empty the place was loud and lively. We ordered: 

Chong Ching Fish Soup: Serves 2, its basically fish filets with some pickled greens in soup with some cellophane noodles. (8.00) Its not bad, definitely spicy enough, I don&#39;t think its anything special though, just fish filets in some broth. 

Bbq Eel Maki: Kind of rough looking, their sushi chef needs more practice. There was barely enough rice to cover the seaweed wrapper. (See picture) (6 bucks)

Spider Roll: Good, the soft shell crab was fried well also the portion was larger (See picture). (11.00) 

Housemade Ginger ale (3.00) not bad but a tad too sweet. Basically tastes like ginger and sugar. 

Overall I&#39;d best describe this place as an &#34;asian&#34; restaurant designed for white people or &#34;Americanized&#34; pallets. The service was kind of slow and our waiter wasn&#39;t too attentive and seemed to have a cold. They also wouldn&#39;t let me bring in my bottle of unsweet iced tea which was kinda like saying &#34;we want YOU to spend money on OUR drinks damnit!&#34;

I&#39;m not totally sure where to categorize this restaurant, its not the best sushi restaurant near here, nor is it the best chinese restaurant but its got elements of both. There are hits and misses and the service and speed needs work. Being brand new I&#39;m willing to overlook a few things but it seems to me this place isn&#39;t really ready for primetime or a full packed friday night yet."

My wife loves the sushi and insists that eating there is better than takeout.  I can see that as it appears to be a trendy but casual setup inside with a nice patio. Maybe I&#39;m just too much of a barbaric meat and potatoes type, but considering the cost, I deem this place &#34;adequate&#34;. Last time I was there picking-up there was some commotion with the wait staff and the host seemed very nervous about something. But my take on the food is nothing remarkable."

My personal favorite is the hot wok chili chicken. All the appetizers are great. We&#39;ve eaten in as well as carried out. The service has ranged from average to outstanding . Go there!
8000-miles-roselle,Andrew J.,HhBaavr8N_1DYclbr3xpvQ,"Roselle, IL",0,1,1,64,3,HypoF-AM22ydt3_oVcS8Xg,5.0,2014-02-22,"Do you dig Asian fusion restaurants? If so, you would be remiss if you didn&#39;t check out 8000 Miles. This place is surprisingly great in a lot of ways and manages to distinguish its self nicely in a sea of other trendy and atmospheric Asian restaurants in the area.

I used to work in that sea of trendy Asian restaurants for a number of years, so I was skeptical about 8000 Miles having anything new to offer. After all, Wok N Fire, Big Bowl, Stir Crazy, and P.F. Chang&#39;s are all within 10 minutes of this location, and all have similar menus. Some items (especially between Wok N Fire and Stir Crazy) are virtually identical since some of the restaurants have common origins. I had a hard time thinking that 8000 miles had anything particularly special that I&#39;d come back for.

Happily, I was wrong.

There are some dishes at 8000 that I haven&#39;t had anywhere else that are certainly worth many return visits. One is the Roselle Roll (Maki roll) which is hands down one of the best Maki Rolls I have ever had. It&#39;s crunchy, spicy, and sweet- and beautiful to look at. Not since Sushi Ya&#39;s Avacado Torch Roll have I been so excited to eat sushi. Holy cats. It is great. 

Another winner is the 7 flavor chicken, a crispy chicken dish served with rice tossed with a sweet and savory sauce. Think a nutty/gingery/lemongrass-y sesame chicken/ honey chicken. 

I&#39;ve also tried a couple appetizers, my favorite of which is the crab rangoon. Crab rangoon is such a staple at Asian restaurants that it might not seem worth recommending as a distinguishing factor. However, if you try this rangoon, you will instantly understand why it is exactly that. I don&#39;t say this lightly: it may be my favorite crab rangoon to date. 

It&#39;s also a great place to have a drink. 8000 Miles has all the standard beers and wines and liquors, but they also bring in a lot of local stuff too. There are monthly beer and wine specials from local microbreweries and (very) local wineries like Lynfred (located less than a block away). The specials really are special. You can get a bottle of wine for about $20, an outstanding offer at any restaurant, and even with some great local bars that only serve microbrews, this place has still got some great beers I have never heard of. Just a tip, talk to the manager, Dee, if you&#39;re looking for a great beer or wine to pair with your food. That guy knows what is up, and he&#39;s super friendly.

To date, I&#39;ve eaten at this restaurant four times. Initially it was because I felt like I needed to try a bit of everything to give a fair review, but I&#39;ve kind of fallen in love with the place. The atmosphere is warm and modern/ casual with rustic touches that give the place some character. Service that I&#39;ve gotten has been friendly and attentive. The servers are also great at making suggestions if you&#39;re not sure what you want. You can tell that they love what they&#39;re serving, and that&#39;s always a good sign at a restaurant. 

This is a great place for a date. I recommend going for a wine tasting at Lynfred, then walk over to 8000 Miles for dinner. As I write this, it&#39;s one of the coldest, snowiest Februaries on record, and the thought of doing that sucks, but imagine how great that would be in the spring or summer, especially when the outdoor seating opens up. 
That&#39;s a night right there. 

Either way, check it out. There&#39;s not a ton of great reasons to visit Roselle, but this is definitely a good one."

I am giving 2 stars mostly because of the very poor service I received.  First off, I had a reservation and checked in with the host.  Then as our reservation time passed we noticed that she was seating customers that were walk ins, AFTER, our reservation.  Not to mention they &#34;walked in&#34; after we had already been waiting.  Finally once we were the only 2 people left in the lobby, the host approached us and said, &#34;oh what was your name again.&#34;  And with no apology to follow, she said your table will be ready in a few minutes.  I guess reservations mean nothing to this restaurant.  

Honestly the food was good, but if you are looking for Chinese food in Roselle, I would recommend Noodles Delight.  The food is better, but the service is top notch.  If you want sushi, try Abashiri, it&#39;s fresher and the service is a lot better. 

I forget my servers name, but she had purple streaks in her hair.  It took (we timed her) 25 minutes to get our drinks, a beer and glass of wine.  After the long delay our drinks, including water, were never refilled and we were never asked if we want a refill.  Apparently she failed to realize that we were eating spicy and salty food so chances are, we would be thirsty.  I also noticed everyone in our section was having the same issue with there drinks.  

The food took a very long time and was paced terribly.  Our first app came out quick, our second took a very long time and was cold when we got it.  Our dinners took 20+ minutes after we finished our appetizers.  When we finally got are dinner, none of specifications we changed on our order were changed.  My fiance has a few food allergies, and she spent most of her dinner picking out the stuff that she asked to be taken out of her order. 

The night turned into us just being frustrated the entire time because of our incompetent server.  

I would be willing to return, but I will be sitting at the bar."

They did have a Tuna and avacado appetizer that was tasty but not worth having to deal with wait staff an managers who hide in the kitchen.
I have known many people in the service industry, they need to communicate to customers if they are having kitchen problems.
I am surprised in this day and age that the management allows this to continue.  This was our 3rd visit and I will not go back."

+update.. The manager reached out and apologized for how he responded to my question. The restaurant was at capacity so I can understand having a hectic day. I appreciated his effort and can now continue attending my husband&#39;s favorite restaurant in Roselle.  The Roselle rolls were delish!!"

We sat at the bar and it gave me a chance to check out the taps and tv&#39;s. Not an extensive beer menu, and standard drinks were available, but this isn&#39;t really a pub, so the focus on a properly paired cocktail in lieu of the latest craft beer is fine. The food was ready in 5 minutes. A nicely cooked chicken breast i teriyaki with sesame seeds, white rice and Broccoli. Since this was a work lunch I had a glass of water, and the total was a little more than $7. I will be coming back to try dinner for sure."

We ended up getting a few maki rolls, pan fried wide noodles, and the chengdu whitefish filet, plus some drinks.  Overall, I was really happy the main dishes weren&#39;t overly salty as other asian places I&#39;ve tried. But seriously, the 5 stars are all for the fish! It was so delicate but there was still a slight crunch to it. The sauce on top was great and best of all it was boneless! I chose brown rice which was a bit dry, so next time I&#39;ll just stick with white.

Also the sake-sangria was amazing! Definitely a great creeper drink, which I loooove!

So I would definitely come back for more fish &amp; to try out some other dishes. Especially since the leftovers taste just as good the next day (that&#39;s a biggie for me haha)

Another plus, my bf had the chocolate banana wontons served with ice cream as his bday treat...While I was whipping out my phone to take a pic, our waiter cleared the mess I made (w/that rice) so it wouldn&#39;t get in the pic...aww!"

We had crab Rangoon and pot stickers for appetizer . For the main course I had the cumin scanted lamb and hot and sour soup, my wife had Mongolian beef and our 8 year old had kids sushi and chicken dumpling soup. All was good.

Pad Thai was much better when spiced with sirachi sauce and chili oil.   The menu showed it as bland and it was.

My daughter and I each ordered a different type of sushi, neither was very good. 
My husband ordered some chicken dish is sauce (cant remember) but said it, too, was sub-standard with such teeny little pieces of chicken and a not so flavorful sauce.  It&#39;s too bad, bc this is so close for us, and we would really LOVE to have a good restaurant nearby."

It&#39;s fusion which sometimes means a new and a tasty combination of foods. Other times, as is the case here, it&#39;s more like it&#39;s not the best of any world. Pad Thai was just OK, it has a background taste I used to experienced a lot when I was in China but never in Thailand. I wish I was better at cooking so I could identify the ingredient and ask for it to never be put in my food again. Crab Rangoon was a bit better than average. Creamy inside with not overly fried outside. I ordered some Maki rolls, what a disappointment. The chef apparently noticed that we Americans like large portions so instead of making the roll longer, they decided to make each piece bigger. So instead of a flavorful bite you end up with a crumbled apart mess, with pieces floating in my shoyu. The chicken fried rice was fine, not amazing but I&#39;ve had much worse. The miso soup was good, a bit above average. The staff was plenty attentive and I walked out at $70 for the items mentioned above plus tea and root beer. There were three of us, one is my 9 year old son."

I&#39;ve visited the restaurant several times with out of state visitors who all had good experiences there.

Pros: Their service is impeccable. One of their waiters overheard my parents saying they wanted more napkins and they brought more by without us asking. Also when my father and I were about to order two of the same half sized meals, the waitress suggested we order the full sized meal for cheaper and they can put it on two separate plates for us, which was very nice of them. Along with that every meal I&#39;ve ever had there was made perfectly. I am especially fond of their eggs benedict dishes.

Cons: Wait times can get very long on weekends due to their popularity. It would be wise to try to get there early (i.e. before 10am) or after peak lunch time if you want to avoid waiting in lines longer than half an hour."

Once we were done the checks arrived and there&#39;s no time to dream and digest, as there&#39;s people waiting for your table. The cashiers were very nice and polite, and fast.

I came here with a few friends on a Sunday around 11am and had to wait about 30 minutes. It wasn&#39;t a bad wait since it was nice outside and they had set up a table providing water, lemonade, and coffee. It&#39;s very thoughtful of them to provide this!

We were seated promptly when a table was free. Our waitress was friendly and checked on us often even though she had many tables to support. She refilled our drinks without us having to ask and even offered to pack our drinks to go which is a great plus! The restaurant itself was also nicely laid out and very clean.

These were the nice things about the restaurant however I didn&#39;t really enjoy the food. I&#39;ve eaten here multiple times before and I&#39;ve never been blown away by any of the food. This latest visit wasn&#39;t any different. I ordered the corned beef hash skillet which was overloaded with potatoes which were cut into large cubes and tasteless. I was trying to ration the small amount of corned beef, peppers, and cheese that was supposed to be part of the skillet as well. It wasn&#39;t a bad meal but nothing exceptional. I would probably come back here only if my friends wanted to go because it is a nice place to go with a group.

So this is great news because now I don&#39;t have to drive all the way to Aurora if I want a burger with the best meat on a bakery fresh bun!

One other great feature of this place, (besides that they changed the entrance so it&#39;s not such a bottle neck of human traffic), is that the service is beyond excellent.  They&#39;ve adopted a team concept so any passing server will attend to you if it appears you need something. We had one server give us coffee, then another take our order and the original server deliver it to the table.  In between we had several other servers asking if we had everything we needed.  No more &#34;Ok, I&#39;ll tell your server to come over to your table.&#34;  It&#39;s a creative and very effective way to keep customers happy.

So not only have they gotten better than before, soon they will also be getting bigger.  I heard the second phase of the remodeling will expand them into the space that is now Fannie May."

It&#39;s nice enough to go with your family, but casual enough to go with your friends after a night out (if you know what I mean). They have very reasonable prices ($10-15) for great food. I highly suggest the Garden Delight Omlette, it&#39;s very yummy! Their service is great, it&#39;s always hoppin. They even serve Intelligentsia coffee in a bottomless mug that is really good, way better than most diner coffees. It&#39;s also a great place to bring kids as they have tons of coloring sheets and a cute kids menu that serves the popular rainbow pancake and GREEN EGGS AND HAM. Yes you read that right. Bring your kids here.

I really recommend Egg Harbor for breakfast/brunch/lunch! Try to make a reservation in advance though or be prepared to wait (especially on Sunday afternoons) because it is a very popular place!"

Almost everything on the menu has been great.  I&#39;m not sure what happened, but the quality has gone downhill lately, Almost around the time they remodeled.  The omelets and skillets are more bland and dry than the past.  I&#39;m not sure why they don&#39;t pre-butter the English muffins anymore.  This place used to be better than the rest, but lately they seem to have joined the rest with poor quality."

Any meal you get here, is going to be great! Definitely try the strawberry orange juice. 

Usually I order two scrambled eggs with sausage links, hash browns and toast. Classic breakfast. Pretty much great anywhere. 

Last time I tried something new and ordered some type of scrambler. Goat cheese and sausage... can&#39;t remember the exact name but this was really delicious as well. Had a side of hash browns... you can ask for shredded if you prefer. Also got a side, English muffin. Yum!!

You&#39;re never going to get accurate wait times and you&#39;re probably going to have to wait a while for a table. 

However, I love their food. Their smart start breakfast is incredible and is my go-to order (flaxseed locally-baked toast, topped with egg, avocado and tomato...served with apples and turkey bacon). Their scramblers and pancake dishes are great as well. Service is decent. It&#39;s nice to support local business so we come here fairly frequently. 

Bonus: if you order coffee or tea drinks, they&#39;ll give you unlimited refills and a cup to go."

No sooner had we sat, one of the servers offered to get us started with some fresh juice, we decided to try the Strawberry-Orange Juice. It was very fresh and delish! Looking back, the only thing that I would have liked was the server to tell us the different sizes of juice available - we were given the large size without even our knowing. The juice was really good, so no harm there :)

I had the Chicken Sausage and Goat Cheese Scrambler while hubby had the Veggie Power Skillet. Both were fantastic!! 

As we were finishing our meal I was taking bites of the remaining Sweet Potatoes from the skillet and there was this one particular piece which had mud ( i think ) or char from the pan - am not sure. BUT goodness it tasted obnoxious!!  

This was disappointing to me because so far we had thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast. When we told our waitress about this she was extremely apologetic and called her manager as well. She too profusely apologized and infact took away 50% of our bill amount!

For a moment when I took a bite of the sweet potato my new found faith in this place was shaken. But I was very impressed in the way in which it was handled and reassured even :) I will come back for sure !"

The hostesses are very friendly, as are the staff members. The menu selection, which, of course, centers around eggs, is also very good. The meals always appear to be nicely cooked and they are quick. The coffee is good and they even allow you to take home a to-go cup. If you prefer hot tea, it comes in a cute, personalized pot.

Parking is right out front, which is nice, and it&#39;s free! But pay attention to the clock, as the time limit is strictly enforced by AH parking police.

In sum, two thumbs up! I&#39;m glad I discovered this place."

You know what you&#39;re getting when you come into an Egg Harbor Cafe, and what you&#39;re getting is quality.

List of random things that I&#39;ve had here throughout my brunch-ish adventures here:

1) Quinoa Cobb Salad - Large portion size, lots of avocado, lots of healthiness going on.  

2) Banana Bread French Toast - The word &#34;banana&#34; makes you think it might be healthy, but don&#39;t be fooled, it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s mighty tasty though.

3) The Protein Wrap - This is the Bermuda Triangle of food - It&#39;s healthy AND it&#39;s delicious.  It&#39;s vegetarian for all you crunchy people; the &#34;meat&#34; of the dish is a black bean quinoa patty.  (Note: As of right now, $1 extra charge due to nationwide egg contamination issue.)

When we were meeting a friend from out of town and searching for a breakfast spot in between where he was staying and our place, Egg Harbor popped up on my search. I immediately chose it.

We arrived around 9am on a Saturday. I was a bit surprised to see the place full, and have a wait time, but no biggie. Our wait time was estimated to be about 5-10 minutes, and we had no problems waiting. We took our buzzer outside and a couple minutes after we sat down, we were buzzed in and seated.

Two of us had skillets and my husband had an egg dish. Everyone liked their dishes. I did think my skillet was a bit tasty, but perhaps that was due to the ham in it. I really enjoyed the homemade preserves from my english muffin as well. Delicious.

We lingered for a bit, probably a little longer than we should have since we could see there was a short wait for a table the entire time we were there, but we were never made to feel rushed, and our waitress often came over to check on us and make sure we had enough coffee in our carafe.

The only downside is the ambience. We went on a Saturday morning and it was incredibly loud in there. Plus a constant movement of patrons and servers all around you.

I have been to the locations in Geneva, Elmhurst and Arlington Heights... and they are all the same.  By &#34;the same&#34;, I mean average in every category a breakfast place can be reviewed in.  

I have never been wowed by my food choices.  It has always been just fine.  The coffee is a little weak, so their orange juice is a better option.  Their egg dishes are boring, so their sweet items are, by comparison, excellent.  The service is lazy.  The decor is a very particular country kitchen explosion, which only appeals to a portion of their customer base.  

I can&#39;t figure it out.  I will keep coming here on Saturdays and Sundays with out-of-town guests, but I will always connect the decision to come to going to my local home town pancake house late on weekend nights as a teenage because it was the only place open-- you just do it.  This is a location for lazy, empty calories that you may have to wait several minutes to ingest because everyone else thinks it is such a great idea."

I had the Ultimate Grilled Cheese crisp bacon strips ripe tomato sliced and melted cheddar and monterey jack cheese grilled on multigrain bread.

When you have a grilled cheese sandwich, there shouldn&#39;t be a slice of tomato on it. . You need thick slices of cheese on a sandwich not kraft skinny singles. And putting it on multigrain bread doesn&#39;t make it healthy, it makes the sandwich crappy....

And French fries, not home fries....

For families with kids, it&#39;s a good place to take them because they can draw with the crayons and paper provided by the restaurant, so that&#39;s something to entertain them with. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever had a poor service experience here either, so that&#39;s another plus. The only minus is this small room they have segregated from the main room- it just feels so closed off from the rest of the place that I would insist not to be seated there since it feels stuffy.

A few weeks earlier I had tried the Corn Beef Benedict at another restaurant &amp; it was delicious.  I decided to order the same meal here because I was expecting it to be even better here.  The Corn Beef Benedict is Eggs Benedict but instead of ham there is corn beef hash.  

I ordered my dish &amp; it arrived in a good amount of time.  The server was very nice the whole time &amp; came around the table to check up on everything.  My meal arrived &amp; after about two bites I realized that the food was pretty cold.  All breakfast food should be very hot when it comes out but Corn Beef Benedict should be very hot when it comes out.  Right away this started the meal off pretty bad.  I asked the server if he could go heat it up &amp; he apologized about the food being cold &amp; took the food into the kitchen.  

My food came back out about 3 minutes later &amp; was hotter.  The waiter apologized again about the food being cold.  The server was very nice through out the entire process.  I began eating my food again &amp; was once again a little bit disappointed that the food did not have the flavor I was hoping it would.  I was expecting my meal to be very good here &amp; it was just A-OK like the rating says.  

Overall I would eat here again because the restaurant was clean &amp; the staff was friendly.  The food was still good but I was expecting better.  I have had some good meals here &amp; will come back here again for breakfast."

They change out a few seasonal items and note which are new on the menu.  Everything is delish!  Fresh juice, flavored coffee&#39;s and coffee to go after your meal are what keeps me coming back.  

Service - always professional, and are realistic with the wait (because if you&#39;re there on a weekend, there&#39; will be a wait, because, yes it&#39;s that good and worth it)   They do have coffee you can enjoy as you wait, which is above and beyond a lot of other places.  

Facility - Perfect.  Large booths.  Small booths.  Tables to accommodate 2, 4 or be pushed together depending on whose waiting.  And a private room.  

I love how this location participates in the holiday Wish Tree providing gifts for 200+ kids.  Just one example (of many!) this location gives back to the community.  For breakfast food, this is THE place!"

Also, we were some of the last people they sat in an area that  soon became a private party  where they are starting to set up and giving you dirty looks. The 10 minute warning wasn&#39;t the best either.  So, this isn&#39;t the place for lingering and having a reunion.
Our actual server was nice. The food was really good. I like that the menu seems to mix a sweet side with a savory dish and vice versa. For example, my frittata came with an english muffin and really great fruit preserves. and it wasn&#39;t a big deal to make a combo of french toast, an egg and sausage.
Paying was an adventure, apparently there were two open registers and we were second in line, but the people behind us oh so nicely stepped over to the open register who I guess didn&#39;t see us waiting to pay.

I love everything about this place!  Chris Best and the staff are wonderful (Taki, Todd, the hostess - everyone).  The staff doesn&#39;t turn over much so they recognize us when we&#39;re in.  The food is fresh and very tasty and the menu goes through some freshing seasonal changes.

I&#39;m more of a lunch guy so I usually order the Chicken wild rice soup, san diego turkey burger, sloppy joe, burger, chicken salad or lobster melt.

My wife goes with one of the specials, the gluten free menu, joe&#39;s healthy scrambler, dynamite veggie white, bruchetta grilled cheese, or several other options.

The iced tea is great, too.

What I like about EH is they do all the &#34;little&#34; things right that I like as a consumer.  They&#39;re great about substitutions, they all &#39;share&#39; the table so you&#39;re not waiting or trying to &#34;flag&#34; down your server, they always bring caraffes so you&#39;re rarely / never out of a soft drink, they always bring extra napkins, always ask if you want &#39;to go&#39; cups, etc.  These things are small but special (and rare).

The place is clean and inviting.  The service is very friendly efficient.

It&#39;s a true cornucopia of items on their diverse menu - skillets, pancakes, eggs, crepes, a plethora of fresh juices, waffles, and a handful of truly special specials (which is actually where I think they shine the most). 

I&#39;ve had adequate crepes here, but this weekend&#39;s sweet potato tot skillet special really was dressed to impress. After waiting roughly 10 minutes for our two-top table, I was well informed of what I was about to shove down my throat - said sweet potato tot skillet special. Just in time for turkey day. Picture an average sized skillet with a maze of sweet potato tots, mozzarella cheese, bits of juicy ham, grilled onions and eggs. Plus, a whole wheat English muffin on the side. Damn right it was tasty. 

If you&#39;re not in the mood for a greasy spoon, Egg Harbor is a solid choice in Arlington Heights***. 

***Extra bonus points for a well-stocked holiday giving tree that benefits the Junior League of Arlington Heights.

Very good omelets, well prepared and fresh. Their blend of cheddar and monterey jack cheese is especially good. They don&#39;t overseason as many restaurants do. Their diced potatoes are generally tasty and an interesting variation on traditional hash browns. They also serve good half-pound burgers

They&#39;re somewhat pricey but I feel the overall quality is worth it. When they&#39;re crowded (as they frequently are) the dining area can get unpleasantly noisy. The service has occasional lapses but it is decent overall. Highly recommended."

Otherwise the food here is quite good, although maybe a little pricey. However, the menu has items you won&#39;t find anywhere else nearby which makes this restaurant definitely worth a visit.

The coffee they serve here is Intelligensia, which I like more than Allegro or Anodyne but probably just a little less than Alterra. It is pretty hard to find this coffee unless you go to downtown coffee houses or buy coffee from Whole Foods. It&#39;s nice to get fresh cream with coffee which results in a much nicer texture than using palm oil based creamers.

The caprese fritatta is nice and light with a very nice combination of tomato, cheese, and raw basil. It&#39;s a great way to eat healthy and surprisingly tasty. The potatoes on the side are delicious with the buttered english muffin. I did not like the lobster meat version as much however, although the asparagus part of it was great. Mostly the hollandaise sauce flavor was not to my liking.

The winter bliss swedish pancakes were great, almost like crepes. The interaction between the bananas (not excessively heated and mushy like most other places), caramel, and candied pecans were great. Very well executed dish.

Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was the door county chicken salad. If eating healthy tastes this good, I wouldn&#39;t mind eating healthy every day. The mix of apples, mandarin oranges, candied pecans, and dried cranberries with an amazing poppyseed dressing just made this dish wonderful. In fact, if I had nothing but lettuce and the dressing I probably would&#39;ve been very happy with the dish already.

If this place was easier to park at and easier to find a seat, I&#39;d probably visit more often since the food here is creative and generally executed well."

I had called ahead of time to see what they estimated the wait would be as they don&#39;t take reservations.  They recommended getting there an hour before we wanted to be seated just in case.  It wasn&#39;t as busy as anticipated and our entire party wasn&#39;t able to get to the restaurant to be seated together.  The manager didn&#39;t make us wait for our entire party to show up to seat us, which was nice and much appreciated.   
The food was great - everyone really enjoyed their meals.  I ordered the mixed scrambler with blueberry pancakes.  My son ordered the San Antonio skillet and thought it was delicious.  My mom who  is in her upper 80&#39;s doesn&#39;t eat as much as she used to.  However, she ordered a scrambler with blueberry pancakes and cleaned her plate.  My sister is a vegetarian and there were a number of options for her as well.    
The service was outstanding.  Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  As mentioned above, two of us were seated about 30 minutes prior to our entire party arriving so we were taking up a table without ordering.  She was very patient and never seemed to rush us.  She was also great about substituting ingredients or side dishes if we wanted to change up our order a bit.  We made sure to leave her a nice tip for her efforts.  
Finally, the pricing was reasonable as well.  It came to about $13 - $14 per person, which was well worth it based on the quality of the food and service.  We&#39;ll definitely get back there again at some point."

Overall a quaint little place. 

Ok our waiter if you can all him that seemed a little off. He looked 12 and he had some ridiculous wannabe Justin Beiber or current british boy band haircut. 

1. He did not know the menu...like if an item on the menu had something listed as the dressing being a vinaigrette he would say it had ranch on it. He kept on contradicting himself.

2. We would ask him something such as can you just put it on the side...it would come on it.  He just didn&#39;t listen. 

The service could use some serious, serious help. 

The food on the other hand was actually pretty good we had a lobster salad melt, omelet, grilled cheese everything was fresh and warm when needed and cold when needed. And everything came out pretty quick...but nothing that would knock your socks off special.

I wish the potatoes were cooked just a little more, but not everyone feels that way so that isn&#39;t necessarily a mark against the establishment. Honestly, the portions for the main part of my order were large enough that I wouldn&#39;t have had room for the potatoes anyway! The second day I had the Bacado Omelette, which was also awesome! I highly recommend both dishes.

The service was wonderful. I had two different servers the two days I went, and both were helpful, attentive, and friendly. Even though it was packed both days, it took no longer than 10 minutes to be seated.

They have a pretty extensive menu - I had the white veggie omlette. It was very good for being so healthy! I didn&#39;t even miss the meat!

I decided to get WILD and try the Gourmet Haverti Pear Omelette, which has bacon, sauteed pears, and haverti cheese, it was amazing to say the least.

I looked on the restaurant website and only saw this location (not sure if the other one &#34;200 Arlington Pl&#34; actually exists).

THE WAIT:  I arrived just after 10am on Saturday and the wait was less than 5 minutes for a table.  There&#39;s a nice waiting area in the front with chairs and decor to check out.

BEVERAGE:  I thought it was pretty cool (and efficient) that you are first greeted at the table by the juice guy!  He&#39;s double fisting an orange juice carafe and a strawberry orange juice carafe.  I got the strawberry orange juice and thought it was all right.  The coffee is good and they leave a small carafe at the table for self refills.

BREAKFAST:
1.  Eggs Benedict - Not bad.  The sauce was different from what I&#39;ve had before (tasted good but it didn&#39;t sing to me) and the eggs were done just right.

2.  Pumpkin Pancakes - There were also big pieces of pecans in the pancakes.  It was good but nothing special.

What constitutes a good breakfast place you ask?! Well their pancakes of course! When I go out to breakfast I rate a place by their pancakes. Whats breakfast without it? Well I love their pancakes. It has that buttery melt in your mouth taste that is just so important when consuming pancakes! The bacon is your general oh so yummy bacon and the same with the sausage. I would have given this place 5 stars...but I have ordered the eggs scrambled and they were tough and dry. So when I do order eggs I just get them over medium.

Your definitely missing out if you haven&#39;t eaten here! It&#39;s an oh so yummy breakfast joint that can&#39;t be passed!"

She was absolutely awful. Her name was Barb and had strawberry blonde hair, older women. She was very rude and didn&#39;t ask what items we wanted with our breakfast selections and before we saw her again she was bringing the food. I told her I wanted pancakes with my skillet and she leans over and with her bare hands grabs the english muffin off my plate and slaps in onto a different plate that was on our table and then leans over and touches my plate again to take the jam. I was completely grossed out and i am sure my face showed it because I wear my feelings on my face. Then she brings the check right after she dropped off our food, which I understand, they want to turn people around qucikly but the check wasn&#39;t even ours and we have to ask another server to help us get the right check (who was very helpful). We never say our server again after she dropped the check and was never asked how anything was. We absolutely love egg harbor but this was so unsanitary and unessessary to do that I wanted to let Egg Harbor know. I would of addressed this the day of but it was so busy like it always is on a weekend. I have never had an bad experience with any server at Egg Harbor so it was very surprising."

We also became regulars while working the overnight shift at O&#39;hare, it was definitely a surreal experience to be having breakfast here when we had been toiling all night whereas the other customers were coming in to get their first cup of java.

No one has hot dogs delivered.  What&#39;s wrong with you!  It&#39;s OK for pot roast sandwiches and chocolate cake, but the dogs you get at Doctor Dog are meant to be eaten where you bought them--inside or sitting in the parking lot or driving around in your car.  

This is a real hot dog joint--an order counter, a couple of tables, a soda machine (with Dr. Pepper!).  You order a hot dog, you&#39;re gettin&#39; fries.  Not frozen fries, real curly cut fries that started out as whole potatoes that morning.  Fries that are slapped next to your dog and the whole shebang wrapped in white sandwich paper and stuffed into a paper bag.  This is the way God intended a hot dog to be served.

How much do I like this place?  When I was asked where I wanted to go for dinner on Mother&#39;s Day, I said Doctor Dogs.  When I was in line, there was another Mother in front of me who had made the same dinner request.  When I got outside there was another Mother on the phone telling her kids she was at Doctor Dogs, where were they? 

I know there&#39;s other good stuff on the menu.  Next time I&#39;m in here, I need to focus and try something different--the pot roast sandwich looks yummy and I&#39;m a sucker for good poppers.  

By the way, Tuesday is $.99 Hot Dog Day!"

A few years ago, I became a vegetarian, found out what was in hot dogs, and stopped eating them. The desire to eat hot dogs comes and goes. I usually don&#39;t give in to the craving.

I had the sudden urge to eat a hot dog tonight. Out of curiosity, I looked up hot dog places and this was the first one that popped up -- very close to us. And the first review on this page at the time? Victoria W&#39;s review in which she starts talking about their veggie dogs!!! WIN! I was so excited about finding hot dogs that I could actually EAT; my husband and I jumped in the car and drove over to pick up some yummy dogs.

Doctor Dog&#39;s is easy to overlook; it&#39;s a tiny place in a tiny strip mall between Dunkin&#39; Donuts and something else. It&#39;s a typical hot dog place with bright colors, several tables, and a wall filled with colored-in coloring pages from children customers. What sets this place apart from other hot dog joints is the incredibly friendly atmosphere. We were greeted with smiles and conversation throughout our entire time there.

Veggie hot dogs are actually not on the menu. The owner&#39;s (I think) daughter is a vegetarian (oh, the irony) and he keeps veggie hot dogs for her and one other customer (is that you, Victoria?). He went in the back to check if they had them and they did -- WHEW! So, for $4, I ordered a veggie hot dog with fries and a drink. My husband got a chili cheese dog meal for $5. The veggie hot dog was AMAZING. Best hot dog I&#39;ve ever had. The fries were pretty good too, although a bit too thin and soggy. After we finished, we sat around for a bit to watch the Blackhawks game on the television and one of the workers offered us more french fries on the house. Our full stomachs politely declined, but it was very nice of him to offer!

We&#39;re definitely come back a few more times this summer. Cute place, very friendly people, good prices, and delicious veggie dogs!! Woo-hoo!!"

Who could have guessed that this little suburban diner would have veggie dogs?! (Note: It&#39;s not a standard menu item, so call ahead to ensure availability) 

It was probably the best dog I&#39;ve had, vegetarian or not. Hot dogs normally have this unique flavor that I can&#39;t stand, and I always felt the need to drown them in ketchup to offset whatever flavor it is with acidic sweetness. Yes I realize this is heresy. Well, it&#39;s not necessary here -- the veg dog had a meatier flavor that paired perfectly with the relish and other toppings.

The also have a veggie burger for $3! The patty also reminded me of chicken; it was like none I&#39;ve ever had. Quite tasty, though I felt the patty could be heartier to better balance the toppings and bun.

We didn&#39;t love the fries -- they were soggy with too much oil. I think they just need to turn up the heat on their fryer, or use cleaner oil or something.

The menu I found online said they had fried PBJs, which sounded scary but also potentially very delicious, but sadly they don&#39;t sell those anymore.

I didn&#39;t actually visit the restaurant, but my brother who picked up our food said they were super friendly. Can&#39;t wait to check them out for myself!"

Came across Doctor Dogs which I was aware of because it was close to my husbands work. Ordered right through Yelp, and it was fast delivery! Ended up spending $28 for 2 hot dogs (with fries) an extra bag of fries, a hamburger, and an order of jalapeno poppers (4) which included tax, delivery,and tip. Nothing ordered was healthy and everything was pretty greasy, but that is what we were kinda going for. 

Pros: Cheap. Great prices, I didn&#39;t expect fries to come with the hot dogs. The chicago style dog was so yummy, just as they should be. And my husbands hamburger was definitely worth the price. Fast Delivery!

Cons: Fries were VERY greasy and soft and all kinda stuck together. Not for the anyone on a diet. But worth it for that occasional splurge."

Such is the case with Doctor Dog&#39;s, a hot dog joint located off of Irving Park Road in Roselle. I must have passed by it  before, but somehow never spotted it. A week or so ago I got a tip as to this place, and soon was on my way to a long overdue Doctors visit.  

Doctor Dog is a small little eatery with a few tables set up on the inside to eat at. There&#39;s a long counter with the food preparation area separated from the dining area, a TV overhead and a handful of signs on the wall. It&#39;s a fairly basic Chicago-style hot dog joint on the inside.

In visiting I decided to try the hot dog with fries. The hot dog I received was a skinless dog on a regular Chicago style poppy seed bun. The bun was soft and had a nice texture, I noticed no signs of dryness There was a thin but somewhat sour pickle slice on the dog. The tomato slice on the dog was thin, a little on the wet and soggy side. It also was not a long enough slice so that you would get tomato in every bite as the tomato was not as long as the dog itself. There was fairly thick sliced onion pieces on this hot dog. The relish was applied a little sparingly, and the mustard was well applied. There was quite a bit of celery salt on this hot dog as well, perhaps a bit too much. There were a few not too hot sport peppers on it as well, these were a nice compliment to the flavor. Overall this was an above average, but not fantastic Chicago style hot dog.

This hot dog also came with fresh cut fries. While I am generally not a big fan of fresh cut fries, these were far better than most places and weren&#39;t as greasy as I typically find. If most places serving fresh cut fries made them this way I wouldn&#39;t have as big of a problem with them as I do. 

Overall Doctor Dog&#39;s is a well above average Chicago style hot dog joint. Both the hot dog and fries were good and I&#39;d recommend stopping by to any hungry folks who happen to be driving down Irving Park road in Roselle. While it wasn&#39;t exactly what the &#34;Doctor&#34; ordered as far as being a flawless Chicago-style hot dog. They didn&#39;t lose this patient either.  I give Doctor Dog&#39;s four stars, good food at a fair price."

I think they have a decent hot dog and I like the flavor their fries have. They are a little thin but they have a good taste. For me it isn&#39;t the hot dogs that keep me coming back though. After trying it a few times I finally found something I LOVED.. Their grilled
Chicken sandwich. I would give that sandwich 5 stars hands down. It has such a great flavor. I always add bacon and cheese (that&#39;s my husbands special) and their bacon is sooo good. It&#39;s not thin and barely there like a lot of places it&#39;s actually thick and has some substance to it. You have to try it! I only give them 4 stars because the fries aren&#39;t great but they are still good. I&#39;m also not in love with their hot dogs and this is a hot dog place after all so 4 stars it is!"

Cold restaurant, cold food. It looks as if the ownership may be on the young side and when I showed up @ 11;15 on Saturday morning, it looked as if they just rolled through a few Advil&#39;s and out of bed after a rough night. I will give it another chance if I am around the area only because (even though it was a cold hot dog) the bacon, chili, cheese dog of guilt and gluttony had some great potential. I don&#39;t see myself ordering the fries again because they were a big clump of greasy underdones but for some odd reason, I will give this place a second try and hope they have warmed the whole experience up just a bit!"

But here&#39;s why they get 5 stars.  There fries are greasy, soft, mashed right in to the hot dog and oh so delicious.  Try the loaded fries, their ranch sauce is the best that I have seen.

And the prices are amazing.  You can get meals for five for the price of a 2 person meal elsewhere.  And they deliver...

Remember that it is a hot dog place, and their hot dogs equal the better hot dogs in the city (not surpass, but equal).  Value + fries = I&#39;m sold.

Check it out if it sounds like your cup of tea."

I&#39;ve been going to America&#39;s Dog every now and then, but the hot dog prices are expensive plus to get a veggie dog, they up charge you!  

After reading a few of the reviews at Doctor Dogs, I decided to give it a try...and was not disappointed.  The dog has great flavor and made the right way with plenty of sport peppers.

I also tried the veggie burger as that was great as well...but the dogs steal the show here.

This place is part of a strip mall plaza and easy to miss, but worth the stop whether you want a veggie or normal hot dog.  Almost forgot, they have a fairly large menu in case you want other burgers, dogs, apps, etc.

Will probably be going there today for lunch..."

I&#39;m a hot dog connoisseur so my opinion is a bit biased and somewhat critical as I expect a hot dog and fries to be done right.  after all it&#39;s a Hot Dog &amp; fries - it&#39;s not that difficult to make it correctly and serve it correctly.  You can tell that the owners of this place are not &#34;seasoned&#34; career hot dog owners, rather they are just people trying to run a small restaurant for the first time (more than likely).  One of my pet peeves is when a hot dog place does not even know that the bun is supposed to be &#34;steamed&#34;.  This place does not steam the buns, or at least - they don&#39;t appear steamed - mine was room temperature and slightly stale and dry.  That&#39; is very bad if your main core of business is hot dogs.  Also the hot dog portion sizes are small.  the smallest hot dog money can buy - like 3 ounces.  good quality, but small.  An average size guy like me (180 lbs) can easily eat 2-3 hot dogs with 1 fries.  If you pay normal price - that&#39;s like $10-12 which is crazy.  One night a week they have 99cent hot dogs which is fair - so I may go there on Tuesdays, but never any other day.  The fries are good, but undercooked.  Not bad though.  I asked for a &#34;large&#34; fries when I went there, and they gave me a good sized brown bag, but only filled it about 2/3 of the way.  Very cheap.  If you pay extra for a large fries - they should fill the bag - not go cheap and only partially fill it.  I wasn&#39;t happy.  I ate the hot dog and large fries in my car in like 4-5 minutes.  I was still hungry.  another time I went there (a couple years ago) I ordered a hot dog and fries and they made the hot dog right away while the fries were still cooking.  Very bad idea.  anybody who knows a hot dog place done right, waits until the fries are done - then makes the hot dog (which takes 10 seconds) and puts them together in the bag.  Instead, they made my hot dog, it sat there in a wrapper for 3-4 minutes while the fries cooked, then they put it all in the bag.  How stupid is that?  as expected my hot dog was cold when I ate it 2 minutes later.  In summary - go there when they have 99 cent hot dogs or get their daily specials (save $1-2), otherwise not worth going."

Typical hole in the wall hot dog joint. Nothin special to look at in the way of ambiance here.

But the food.....

Fries are just right not super clean like McDonald&#39;s fries (but about the same size), they got a little skin on em and they are perfectly cooked just past golden heading toward brown. 

The cheeseburger looked awesome, the guy in front of me ordered it with grilled onions, and they looked marvelous. 

I had a bacon cheese dog. The girl asked &#34;what kinda cheese? we got liquid cheese, American cheese, and cheddar cheese&#34;. I ask you, How many hot dog joints give u a choice of your cheese? But for those heart smart challenged, the liquid cheese is the obvious pick! The dog was not one of them midget hot dogs u can get from time to time, it filled the bun. 

I always share the last bite of my meal with my Viszla, Tess. This time I had to think twice about sharing it. But the real dog won out and she seemed to enjoy the hotdog and fries just as much as I did. 

They were busy, and the guy who took my order forgot to take my money! I told the girl delivering me the hotdog and fries that I still needed to pay, and she said thanks for your honesty. Then she charged me Three Bucks total!!!

I&#39;ll be back, this place is just what the doctor ordered (but not my cardiologist!)"

We live in an area that seems to not have too many delivery options so when we came across GrubHub and found Doctor Dog&#39;s we were very happy to try them both out. We ordered the Crispy Chicken sandwich, Pulled BBQ Pork sandwich on a croissant, BLT sandwich, Vienna Hot Dog, 1/4lb Cheeseburger, Italian Sausage sandwich, Cheese Sticks and home made Rice Krispie Treats. Order arrived within about an hour after placing the order online through GrubHub. Food arrived hot, fresh and very good. One person didn&#39;t like the Italian Sausage sandwich though, said sausage was too mushy in texture and didn&#39;t like the flavor. Preferred Portillo&#39;s Italian Sausage Sandwich instead. Besides that, food all appears to be made by people who take pride in what they server and use fresh quality ingredients as you can tell by the way the food looks and tastes. In this age of fast food slop it together and throw it out a drive through window, Doctor Dog&#39;s is a breathe of fresh air when it comes to ordering and receiving quality fast food. I personally loved the BLT, loaded with hearty bacon, and also loved the home made Rice Krispie Treats. Who would think of selling these as a desert, only Doctor Dog&#39;s, and it&#39;s a perfect treat after a meal from them for sure. If your in the Roselle area and looking for a quality kosher hot dog, cheeseburger or any type of snack and want it delivered, Doctor Dog&#39;s is your place to call.

It makes even less sense, due to the fact that the drive-thru doesn&#39;t separate the tabs, but inside I have to stand in two lines to get food.

After all, everyone within 100 miles of Chicago knows Portillo&#39;s, right?  And everyone just loves it, no?

Since the sale, I&#39;ve been keeping a close eye on any changes (portion sizes, prices, service) to see if there&#39;s a slip, or, hopefully, incremental improvement.

Sad to say, I&#39;m just now seeing a slip.  My wife and I eat at the Schaumburg one every Friday night.  Just our thing.  Here&#39;s a few small things I&#39;ve noticed and don&#39;t care for since the sale:

They make frequent mistakes on the orders.  After carting two trays back to our table, I have to go back for &#34;something&#34; that was missed (often miss the &#39;extra bread&#39; requested, don&#39;t always offer butter for the bread, sometimes have forgotten wife&#39;s dessert, etc).  

Costs have gone up.  Just a few mos ago our meal would cost us $25 (Barnelli&#39;s - pasta, soups, etc).  It finally peaked past $30 and was nearly $35 on our last visit.  

Seems trite, but anyone notice they&#39;ve turned the 50&#39;s music down to near inaudible levels?  (you can hear it blasting outside, but now it can barely be noticed inside).  Wife and I would always have fun guessing the song/artist of the 50&#39;s music over the sound system.  These are the &#34;little things&#34; I mean.

Portillo&#39;s is still a great Chicago institution.  Very solid offering.  But the sale to Berkshire Partners (of Warren Buffet fame) has seen some slippage.  BP, before you start changing things, even small things, remember why people packed this place to begin with."

Hate how long it has taken to get my food. The past two times I was here it took 20+ minutes to get my food. Ridiculous. I used to work at Portillos so I understand that its busy. But that would be unacceptable if that happened at our store! I always get a piece of cake because of the wait, which I dont care for (I know, an unpopular opinion).

For dinner we were trying to decide on seafood or a steak place when my friend told me when they first moved to Illinois he stopped at Portillos/a pasta shop to see what all the buzz was about. And I never remembered ever being that hungry. Ever haha. So I got a Caesar chicken wrap and this plain alfredo pasta. My friend told me while waiting on the food that pasta portions were huge. And were they... Whew! Had leftovers for sure. Did not have pasta for months and it was creamy with that rich fatty sauce! Dusted pepper all over it. And that pita my friend had noticed sucked all the hunger out of me and gave me my first ever foodgasm. Lol. I was just blissfully not starving anymore.. yum! I don&#39;t ever want pasta again from anywhere though. Those carbs are a killer but that was the best pita I ever had. Better than Aladdin&#39;s Eatery good. Might try a fish sandwich if I ever set food in this retro joint again!

I drove up.. Yes.. i was in luck people hadnt noticed that there were 2 lines and everyone was piling into the first line they could see!  I knew i would be in and out.  She walked up .. took my order.  On to the the next &#34;station.&#34;  I paid, the guy had a joke I smile I laughed (thanks I needed that!)

Got almost to the window only to sit.. and sit.. and wait.. and sit.. and burn gas.. and sit.  Dont they usually bring a few orders out if there is a hold up in the front?  Am I spoiled by the processes I have experienced at other Portillo&#39;s? Sigh.  

After 10 minutes (yes I kept checking my clock) finally I got my cake and luke warm 2% milk.  Sigh (if it had been ice cold.. I would have be a bit happier than I was.)

Sure, the vast majority of the food they serve is unhealthy to the point that you might as well be drinking down a can of Pennzoil, but that is part of it&#39;s charm. They do actually have salad and healthier options on the menu, but my guess is that these menu items could not exist and it would not bother 95% of their client base. 

I have been to 2 other locations of this chain, but this one in Schaumburg has always provided the best food and service, which is handy considering it&#39;s also the location closest to me. The interior of this store also has a far different theme, which is a bit odd since most chains stress uniformity. The interior of this location is done up like a 1950&#39;s malt shop. Call Frankie Valli and tell him his apartment has been burglarized. The other two I have visited seem to have a prohibition era/Al Capone thing going on. I think they must have hired the set designer from &#34;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#34; to do their decorating. 

Most of the dogs or sandwiches you could order here are going to be very good and affordably prided. I have yet to have a bad experience, even when the place is slammed busy (which is quite often). They have obviously perfected the art of rapid service here, and just watching the staff bounce around the place like a pinball when it&#39;s busy is entertaining. Even their drive thru service is poetry in motion, and any other fast food owner out there should be taking notes. As a guy that used to work in the service industry during college, I would be willing to bet the local bars and liquor stores do a handsome business from Portillo&#39;s employees each night after they get done dealing with this place. 

As to items you absolutely must try? I would say out of everything the Italian Beef is about the best and most consistent item you can order. It&#39;s served in a fresh french roll with peppers if you so desire and has always been delicious. The meat is tender with a lingering flavor sort of like Au Jus, but not exactly. Instead of listening to me try to describe the flavor you would be better served to just go there and try one. At a little over 5 bucks, it&#39;s a bargain. You can also opt for the Italian beef on a croissant, but if you go this route it turns into a soggy mess. 

The jumbo chili cheese dog is another obligatory order here if you stop in, and even the burgers are fairly decent. As for the chicken sandwiches, if you are hungry for one of these you are honestly better off going with Chic-Fil-A down the street. These and the fries have been my only areas of disappointment at Portillo&#39;s. I have had great fries here exactly once. On all my other visits they have been soggy and DOA. Otherwise I would feel 100% comfortable giving this place 5 star billing."

Let me just start off by saying that I worked at Portillios in high school. Maybe a lot has changed in 8 years.

I ordered a chopped salad, substitute cheddar cheese for blue cheese. They put the cubed cheese in a small container and when I opened it there were FIVE small ass cheese cubes. For $8.50 I expected a little more than that. They put an entire scoop of blue cheese in. Couldn&#39;t they have put the same for the cheddar?"

My taste buds go wild
Italian Beef so tasty
My love knows no bounds

Whenever I visit Chicago, I HAVE to hit Portillo&#39;s. They never disappoint. All the other reviewers have said pretty much what I would have, so here&#39;s my rant:

I wish I had the funds available for the franchise fee to put some of these babies in the Dallas area (I noticed they&#39;ve started building some in California, where I&#39;m originally from). I know of, easily, 10 locations that would rock in sales. Then there&#39;s Houston, San Antonio, Austin...

So Portillo&#39;s Franchise Department, please consider ME when looking to expand. Or at least, land one in Arlington near me. Pretty please?

*Edited to add* Today in talking to my Chicago employees, they asked if I had dessert. Nope. Then they started talking about the Chocolate Cake Shake and how great it was. So after dinner tonight, I dropped by Portillo&#39;s for one. I&#39;m not much of a cake eater, but after today, I am a cake drinker. This is wonderful! I don&#39;t think it surpasses pie yet, but it&#39;s close. Maybe mix pie and the chocolate cake into a shake? Hmmmm....

*Another edit 2/18/15 to update*

I deviated from my normal activity of ordering an Italian Beef and tried a 1/3 lb cheeseburger. Big mistake. 

Upon opening the styrofoam clamshell container, the burger looked nice. I noticed under the patty the cheese wasn&#39;t melted. Upon further inspection, the patty was only warm enough for the cheese to adhere to it, even though the burger had been in the container for a couple of minutes. The patty may have been in the steam table for a bit too long.

The beef patty is one of those &#39;gourmet&#39; homestyle patties similar to those used by Jack in the Box, Hardee&#39;s/Carl&#39;s Jr., etc. Thick and beefy, but not very flavorful. I liked the bun but it needed extra toasting. The kitchen needs to increase the temperature on the bun toaster a bit.

I would give this burger three stars, only because Portillo&#39;s uses an automatic charbroiler. 

Stick to your core competencies - Italian Beef and hot dogs guys!"

Of course you can never go wrong with an Italian Beef Sandwich, extra dipped, but I&#39;m very glad with my selection today.

I&#39;m four starring them because of the super long lines and wait time (not really their fault, Portillos is just that good!)

Most recently the big beef with hot was dry and lacking flavor. A lot has changed since Dick Portillo sold to Warren Buffet. The gardineria is the Marconi brand which is my least favorite.  On a hot dog they now charge 55 cents for sport peppers. That&#39;s a first I&#39;ve seen at any hot dog place. That&#39;s usually part of an everything hotdog. What&#39;s next 25 cents for mustard and 50 cents for tomatoes?  Come on.  Salad dressing cups for a chopped salad are much smaller. A bowl of chili has decreased in size as well.

Why did I wait 20 minutes? Because a couple that was before me was still waiting for their order for the first 15 minutes. But then for the next 5+ minutes, people who&#39;d ordered well after me were getting their meals called up.
I mean, come on. How long does it take to slice a piece of cake, and stick it into a plastic container and paper bag? I didn&#39;t order anything else. There was also a time when about a minute went by and nobody was being called up. You&#39;d think they were baking up another one or something.
Anyway, I finally just crumpled up the receipt, threw it onto the counter, and left.
The girl at the register said that at her other job, they&#39;d celebrated everybody who had April birthdays and that she ate 2 cupcakes in my honor, so I&#39;m good.
I won&#39;t be going back there though. I&#39;ll remove my name from their birthday list next."

But out of all the portillo&#39;s I have eaten at, this one stands out. They chill their condiments really well. So if you order a hot dog, polish sausage, etc. it creates a great mix of hot &amp; cold. My favorite Portillo&#39;s even better than the one in river north."

It&#39;a hot dog shack enterprise that was I guess purchased for a billion US dollar by Warren Buffet&#39;s Berkshire Hathaway. One Billion Dollar! That is certifiable insane!

I used to live pretty much across the street from the original Portillo&#39;s in Villa Park, and this one location in Schaumburg is close to my old office. I was visiting coworkers today and we went to lunch here, just like old time. We used to get lunch from here almost daily and we had a HOT coworker, Peter, who was big, buff, and beautiful and he always wanted a salad with grilled chicken. I guess to keep that steaming hot bod, he had to eat lettuce and chicken daily. He always gave us his bread and we dumass chicks ate the carb and got fat while we drooled over him. Ahh...Miss you, Peter!

My all time favorite burger is theirs. It&#39;s char-broiled with that awesome maillard taste. Yum yum yum. This location also serve all kinds of hand tossed salads and pastas. They&#39;re known for their Chicago dogs, Italian Beef Sandwich, Chopped Salad, and their famous chocolate cake. I am not a huge fan of the chocolate cake as I found the frosting salty, but all my coworkers love the cake and it is probably the most bought cake for any celebrations in the office. My other favorite was their grilled yellowfin tuna caesar salad. This used to be my diet food as it&#39;s so good and healthy sans or with little dressing. 

Another hot man, my second dad Dale loved Portillo&#39;s till the day he died. He was only in his early fifties when he passed and my last recollection of happy times with him before he got so sick was he tried to copy the chopped salad dressing and he did a great job! It was perfectly copied. I had a picture of him, feeling like shit from radiation, but smiling making salad for us with his dressing concoction. Love you, dad.

Their drive through system is magical. They just have a lot of employees out there, taking order, put in the order, and take payment as you wait. Then, they have runners and often you get your food before you even get to the window. Perfect for lunch. It&#39;s always a long line and they even have cops regulating traffic in and out of the restaurant at lunch rush. However, it is still lightning fast.

Four stars instead of five because they have too big of a menu, too crowded at times, and the decor makes me dizzy. I hope Berkshire Hathaway will not affect negative changes within this beloved neighborhood restaurant. We need Portillo&#39;s to stay the same for all eternity."

Ordered the Italian beef with sweet and hot peppers. It was so good I stop back by that night for another and schooner of beer. This is when I learned that it started off in 1963 as a portable hot dog shop. Four years later in 1967 they open their first restaurant Portillo&#39;s Home kitchen. Now they have restaurants all over the country even as far as California it&#39;s a must stop And eat.

Born and raised in Chicago.  The only place on the planet to enjoy a real hot dog.  But today&#39;s trip was for my wife that had never had an italian beef before.

The toast the bread to get it nice and crispy.  Pile on the shaved beef.  Peppers.  Duk the bread slightly.  Awesome.

On thing that does not get enough credit at Portillos are the fried.  Crinkle cut and crispy.  Why not 5 stars?  They are fast and efficient.  A real Chicago hotdog place needs a bit more character.  This location needs a traffic cop everyday at lunch just to get the people in and out.  

Still, nice to be back in town."

What can I say that hasn&#39;t already been said??  Obviously Portillos is pretty serious because they have cops stationed outside the parking lot EVERYDAY directing traffic specifically for them since they get so much business.  HOW INSANE IS THAT??? 

Ok ok, I&#39;ll get to talking about the food and decor and whatnot.  Portillos is a chain restaurant but the quality of the food never disappoints me.  It has a vintage vibe with the decor and red plastic booths, but that just adds to the charm.  Service is always very quick so you can be in and out during your lunch break with probably time to spare.

These are my favorite things to order here:
1) Italian beef with sweet peppers (juicy and tender beef)
2) Combo (Italian beef and Italian sausage..MEAT FEST!) with sweet peppers
3) Chopped salad (trust me, just give it a try! Clearly I&#39;m not a salad type of gal)
4) Breaded Chicken Sandwich

If you&#39;re here for the first time, you MUST try their Italian beef.  Even though many Chicagoans swear by Al&#39;s Beef in the city, I would say the Italian beef here gives Al&#39;s a run for their money.  If you&#39;ve never been to Portillos..man, you&#39;re really missing out!"

I have been to the Chicago area many times but have never eaten here. The first thing that struck me was that the police were directing traffic because lunchtime was so nuts! I though &#34;wow, this place must be sooo good!&#34; 

I ventured inside and it&#39;s like a madhouse. The interior is very much like most Coney Island&#39;s in Michigan. Booths and chairs, with some memorabilia and such. I walk up to the counter and am waiting my turn in line. A lady asks me what I want. Well, nothing like feeling rushed now, eh? I just walked in, I haven&#39;t even seen the menu yet. So I get the Chicago dog, fries and a pop. She scrawls some numbers on a white bag and hands it to me. 

I pay and it costs approximately $7 for my meal. I wait in the other line to get my food and it all comes in that white bag, even though my order was to dine-in. I&#39;m trying to balance my bag and my drink while getting ketchup from the dispenser. It would be so much easier if they had trays and also way less wasteful.

My fries are crispy and salty, but aren&#39;t that special. They are like the Oreida crinkle fries you get in the frozen food section at the grocery store. The hotdog was underneath the fries so with the weight of the fries and the moisture from the veggies, the bun was totally soggy and gross. The hotdog itself was boiled, not grilled. It was topped with tomatoes, a pickle, hot peppers, relish, onions, and mustard. Maybe I should have gotten the beef sandwich but I really don&#39;t see what all the fuss is about."

Yep, I&#39;ve never had one before. I saw a photo of one along with the news story, and it looked so irresistible that I broke my usual cheeseburger and pizza routine and dove into some real meat madness.

Drippy, soggy deliciousness piled high on a french roll. Ummm, does it get any better than this? I was in a hurry and forgot to say yes to the sweet peppers when asked, but I will for sure be adding those to the menu next time...because baby I&#39;m hooked! 

Love the vibe at this place. It&#39;s nice and bright with an authentic cheery diner feel. Weird, and maybe my imagination, but it seems a bit pricier here than at their other locations in Skokie and Vernon. 

Came here on our trip to Ikea. Instead of spending the same amount of money on food their, we are much happier with our decision to support Portillo&#39;s. Besides, the food is just so much better!

I&#39;ve been to this Portillo&#39;s many times.  I have only had one (really) bad experience there.  There was one visit where we waited inside for our To Go order for about 25 minutes before asking the employees what the deal was.  They informed us that the order didn&#39;t go through.  We placed the order again and got the food 5 minutes later.  However once we got back out to our car to find out that they forgot one hot dog and one fry from the order.  The process took us about ONE HOUR to finally get our food and leave (we haven&#39;t been back since)."

Portillos does well. 
Police direct traffic in and out of here during peak hours. 
They have done that for as long as I can remember. 
Everything means everything when you order a Chicago dog. And they are fabulous. 
The cake shakes are a bit runny, but still tasty. 
Fries are crinkly style, and usually piping hot. 
Outdoor seating is a plus in the summer.

So we went. Ordering was easy, you just go up to counter, order, wait for number, get food, sit down. Simple. I orderd the beef-n-cheddar croissant and onion rings. When i opened the package the sandwhich came in it looked like they forgot the cheddar, I saw a cup of cheddar cheese my sister took out of bag and asked if that was the cheddar in the beef-n-cheddar, nope, that was for the cheese fries and sister said it was in the croissant. Pulling the croissant apart there was alittle dab of cheddar.  Well it was bland, both the beef and the croissant. Not remotly impressed. The onion rings were crunchy, but had very little oniony taste. My sister asked if I was amazed how good the food was. The dumbfounded look on my faced confused my sister. She thought I was crazy. Oh, I have to dip the croissant in the au jus,excuse me, gravy. Which wasnt included and had to go back to counter and ask. That was just as bland and made for a soggy croissant. My niece ordered a chili hot dog, she being picky, saw beans and didnt eat it.  Who am I to refuse a lonely chili dog waiting to travel. After biting into it, I can see why. The hot dog was good, the chili not so much. Was more like the canned stuff I buy to make cheap and quick coneys at home. 
Oh and my sister used her bday coupon to get a free piece of cake. Thats the only food she didnt care for. She gave it to her son who got most of it on the floor.

Parking is tough.  I suspect there are a few fist fights over parking spots due to the limited nature.

The service was okay, but nothing to write home about.  I was just another person in the sea of people.

The food was greasy and excessive.  I would prefer to have quality in smaller portions.

Took about 7 minutes from the start of the line to the end of getting my food. They run a tight ship outside, even in the cold. There are 2 lines initially of cars, one or two people take orders, they give you a paper with your order, then you drive up a little and give that paper to another person who calls it in, then drive a little more and you meet the guy who takes your payment. Then at the ene, you dont even have to reach in to get your food through the window, 2 people are there handing out orders in a systematic way. Not bad. All of this is done outside in the drive through lane with 5+ people.

I went Sunday night and the wait wasnt too bad for such a popular restaurant.

As for the food, I come here often so it is what I expected, a hearty polish sausage hotdog with everything on it to be fulfilling. For 3.99 plus tax that is pretty good. 

Definitely a repeat customer and will stop by again."

Maybe if we had gone at a different time then I would throw one more star here...

When you enter the place, it&#39;s huge. Two restaurants in one really. This hot dog joint and another pasta/Italian place. We were led by an older gentleman to a place where the lines unclearly form. We waited in the Portillo&#39;s line and some woman approached us to take our order with her checklist. There were five of us total and she just kept taking little pieces of our orders at once in a weird fashion. I wasn&#39;t surprised when part of my meal was incorrect once I finally got it. I feel it would have been easier to just order ourselves.

The food was incredibly greasy which I guess is a plus if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for. I didn&#39;t really care for it. I&#39;ve had much better burgers and the fries were like any other. Good but not memorable. The people I was with but considering one guy was buying for us all, I don&#39;t think any of us wanted to voice our discontent aloud.

As we left it was another tricky situation. The parking lot is quick packed and at lunch time they often are packed. Good for them, but bad for the customer. It can be sometimes tricky pulling out with all the traffic. Then because of the way this parking lot pairs with others and the fact it&#39;s two restaurants in one, the traffic out is horrendous at lunch time. Local police actually were parked in Golf Rd. directing traffic. Something tells me that the design of the parking at this place really messes with traffic. They should really install a light there or at least make it right-turn only. That would significantly help the congestion around the building. I guess it&#39;s not &#34;always&#34; so it&#39;s not worth it. I don&#39;t really know.

I do know that I wouldn&#39;t go back though. Definitely not."

When I moved away 10+ years ago it was and is something I will always crave so whenever I&#39;m back in town Portillo&#39;s a must for me. My favorite is the Italian Beef croissant, which I know is not the norm but it&#39;s my preference. The way the buttery croissant mixes with the beef juices and the little bit of cheese they throw on there it just doesn&#39;t get any better for me. Add in an order of some cheese fries and a chocolate malt and it&#39;s perfection :) 

The location does get pretty busy it&#39;s been like that for a very long time now, they usually have police directing traffic at peak hours and they do try and take your order before you reach the counter or the drive through window to try and speed up the process but be prepared to wait unless you go at an off time. But it&#39;s definitely worth the wait.

Was a bit confused upon walking in if I should take a seat or where to go.  It&#39;s basically cafeteria style so I walked over.  It was later in the evening on a Sunday so it wasn&#39;t nearly as crowded as what it likely is at regular times.

This location has the pasta bar as well so selection was a bit overwhelming.  I went with the standard hot italian beef sandwich (with hot peppers of course) and a vanilla malt.  After all, I&#39;m on a diet.  

Service was quick and friendly.  Grabbed my food, had a seat and dug in.  Yep, this was a pretty damn good italian beef sandwich.  Great flavor, good spice, good bread.  

Atmosphere is very kitschy with the &#39;50s/&#39;60s theme but a lot of fun.  I would definitely go back to check out other items on the menu."

This place gets so busy that Schaumburg&#39;s finest can be found directing traffic daily on Golf Road. Name one other restaurant that gets that kind of service!

You can&#39;t go wrong with a jumbo hot dog (everything on it) + fries. I almost feel like this place should be the In &#39;n Out of hot dogs. Then again, I know people love their beef and other junk.

Barnelli&#39;s is also quite delicious. They have an interesting selection of salads (never tried, but my friends love &#39;em), and their baked mostaccoli with cheese on top is yum yum yum! They serve it with a slice of warm french bread -- so you can mop up any remaining pasta sauce, of course! -- and it&#39;s a good &#34;safe&#34; choice that can&#39;t be screwed up. On second thought, they actually have messed it up before.. I ended up with a gigantic meatball on top once, but my friend nearly died when he overheard me send it back. (Meatball became his, I got my cheese on top, and the world was happy!)

If you have room for dessert (good luck), the chocolate cake and tiramisu will make your tastebuds sing.

Everything tasted great but I&#39;m not sure what happened to the Portillo&#39;s assembly line. Tried to get a beer from the other counter and had to wait 30 minutes behind a person waiting to get their pick up order. Yeah, it was a terrible service night for Portillo&#39;s.

The first thing the Panera employee asked was how soon do I want my order, I said 5 minutes, as I was about 5 minutes away. The employee told me it would take 15-20 minutes for my order. Really? 15-20 minutes?! The only time I waited that long for a sandwich was when they were really slammed and most of the time I was waiting in a long line. I proceeded with my order. I asked for a chicken salad sandwich. The employee said we don&#39;t have those anymore. I told her I was just in earlier this week and ordered a chicken salad sandwich. She told me I must have been at a different location b/c they haven&#39;t had that sandwich for 2 weeks. I asked if this was the Panera on Schaumburg Road and she said yes. I said it&#39;s the chicken salad with almonds and grapes...? She said no and asked if I wanted to order something else. I said no, I&#39;ll just come in and place my order. 
I get there and on the menu is Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich. I order it. No problem. I told the cashier how I called to order this sandwich and was told they don&#39;t make it anymore. The cashier said I was speaking to her on the phone. She went on to say the Chicken Salad sandwich had been made on a particular bun that they no longer have.  But they still serve the Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich. I said yeah, that&#39;s what I wanted. When I called I forgot to ask for it using the term Napa in the name of the sandwich but I would assume when I said it has grapes and almonds in it, she would be able to figure out what I was talking about but nope. When I told her I had the sandwich in the last week at this location she could have tried to think what I was referring to, maybe by asking if the other sandwich was served on a bun or regular bread but nope. 
It took less then 5 minutes for the chef to make my sandwich. (And not 15-20)
I feel like the lady I spoke to on the phone was either messing with me on purpose, or she was going out of her way to be as difficult or unhelpful as possible. It was very strange. The sandwich was good, though."

Usually cleanliness and service are also at a high standard, but not this location.

First off, we weren&#39;t greeted with a smile and a hello when we came in, even though the pastry/bread employee was staring at us as we walked to the register. It was like she was annoyed that we made the effort to stop by.

We were served by Jenelle, whose name badge read, manager, but whose attitude reflected that of indifference and apathy. She did not offer us a mypanera card, so we forgot to tell her that we had one. When my wife ordered the kids meal with soup, she made a face that seemed to indicated that she was unaware that the soup was an option for the kids meal. That assumption aside, she scoffed when I asked her for a cup for water, stating in a condescending tone, &#34;Those cups are at the beverage station.&#34;

As far as cleanliness... we had to walk past 4 tables to find a clean one. I know it gets busy, but someone was not doing their job. The tables didn&#39;t get cleaned until about 10 minutes after we began eating, and as far as I could tell, it was the other manager on duty, who did the cleaning.

Listen, Panera is a chain, so likely, they don&#39;t care about these reviews. I will still frequent the Algonquin &amp; Deer Park locations, but if I&#39;m back in the Schaumburg area, I will drive east to the Golf and Mecham location to get the better experience."

I came in not having a clue what I wanted (hadn&#39;t been to a Panera in years, and I didn&#39;t feel like my lifelong go-to -- chicken noodle soup in a bread bowl), and the cashier put up with my indecisiveness and 8,000 questions of &#34;how much + how big is the half-size?&#34; etc. until I ordered something.

I got the full-size smoked turkey sandwich. It&#39;s incredibly plain but delicious in all its simplicity. (I put spicy mustard on it at home, then it was really bangin&#39;!) With every bite, I kept thinking about how much better it was than Subway&#39;s; there is no comparison. The bread definitely made this sandwich.

On top of everything, the cashier even gave me extra pickle spears! Now, that&#39;s service ;D

It&#39;s tough to justify the price vs. Subway when you get so much more bang for your buck there, but this would be my &#34;sandwich splurge&#34; of choice."

This was my first time at this Panera and it will most likely be the last time I go there, we placed our order and when it was time to get it, I noticed it was the completely wrong sandwich. I told the girl that the sandwich wasn&#39;t correct as my main concern was walking away with someone else&#39;s order. Instead of asking what I ordered she quickly said &#34;well then whatever plate she grabbed is probably your sandwich&#34; referring to my sister, who is a vegetarian so no she did not grab my turkey sandwich and she absolutely did not order a chicken sandwich. I explained to the girl that it wasn&#39;t possible yet she kept talking about the plate my sister grabbed to the point where I had to walk over to our table grab her plate from her and physically show this girl that hers was a veggie sandwich. At that point another sandwich maker dropped off a plate with what looked like the correct order and the girl said &#34;okay, then thats your plate.&#34; So I grabbed it and as I&#39;m walking to our table I noticed 2 things - 1, there was an apple as a side when I had ordered a baguette and 2, there was a reciept with the name Kathlyn on it, that is not my name. So I turned around and told her the side was incorrect and at the point she said &#34;I can&#39;t take it back because you took the plate, but here I guess&#34; and she slammed a piece of bread on my plate and then muttered &#34;I guess that was my fault too&#34; 

There are so many things wrong with this single inreraction that left me so annoyed and in awe at how rude and ignorant some people can be. As mentioned I work in the service industry too and yeah its tough, but if you don&#39;t like it then GET A DIFFERENT JOB - the store manager here clearly does not promote smiling enough or express how important these little interactions are, they may be little interactions but they are meaningful. This worker did nit take the time to address my issue, which in no part was my fault, I did not yell at her or give her attitude I simply wanted to confirm that my order was not missed and instead of helping she made the situation worse by pissing of both myself and herself. I brought this to the attention of the cashier who took our order and she apologized sincerely and offered a free bakery item for the inconvenience but we declined."

Bagel Pack (~$14.55-price w/ tax &amp; tip): comes with 13 bagels of your choice and 2 cream cheese tubs of your choice.  The bagels are delicious, especially the asiago cheese bagel and the chocolate chip bagel is popular amongst ppl who have a sweet tooth..

Coffee: I love the hazenut coffee here.. it tastes good w/out the cream &amp; sugar...but maybe I only say that because I drink black coffee normally....but either way.. it&#39;s not bitter (like some coffee is).. and it smells and tastes delicious since it&#39;s hazelnut coffee!!

Every time I go there I get the Mediterranean Veggie sandwich. It&#39;s basically tomato, onion, lettuce, some kind of avocado sauce I believe and feta cheese on basil bread if I&#39;m not mistaken. And if I&#39;m ever sick I get the black bean or tomato soup only! But that&#39;t only if I pretty much have no other choice. 

I recently tried the cheese and tomato panini and I felt like regurgitating. I&#39;m sorry to be so graphic but I didn&#39;t read anywhere in the description about any extra sauces in the panini, so I was unpleasantly surprised when I tasted this green/maroonish colored sticky spread. I really wish I knew what it was called. 

The staff is really nice though so that&#39;s a plus, and the store was very clean and well kept, but I feel like the food doesn&#39;t live up to it&#39;s expectations. Did you know? It&#39;s actually owned by McDonald&#39;s."

Since this place was in between the 2 of us this is what we decided on. I go to Panera often so I know the drill. Front counter was helpful even though she got my order wrong.

First of all, the guy behind the counter who appeared to be the manager was incredibly rude to all the customers he interacted with.  He was clearly having a bad day, but that&#39;s no excuse to take it out on the customers, (who BTW were approaching him because their orders were wrong).   

Secondly, the service was terribly slow - second time I&#39;ve been to this location, and both times having been slower than any of my previous panera experiences.  And the restaurant was only mildly busy.

Lastly, and most importantly,  the food was miserable.  I ordered a large Rustic Penne Bolognese.  DO NOT ORDER this - a laughable attempt at trying to create a quality pasta offering.  Not sure how the other two pasta options are, but i&#39;m guessing they&#39;re just a poor.  For roughly the same cost, you can get vastly better pasta at Noodles and Co."

I mean of all food porn on the internet Johnnie&#39;s beef sandwiches have to be among the least photogenic of them. 

But - my sandwich expert pal suggested this place was at the top of his list and worth both a 90 minute drive and two hour bus ride so I swore to myself the next time I was within even an hour of the place I&#39;d make it a point to go. 

So fast forward to now...when after having gone back to the register for a second dipped sandwich I can say for myself that this is an f-ing good sandwich. Like bordering my all time favorite sandwich from Paseo (or now, I&#39;m told Un Bien). 

As many of the reviews advise make sure you get it fork dipped (aka &#34;juicy&#34;) and with peppers (aka &#34;hot&#34;). Don&#39;t try to split it with someone - though they will cut it in two, you&#39;ll just be squabbling over who can eat more bites. 

Cash only, a sandwich this way will set you back $5.54. On the way out of or into ORD, the stop is about a 15 minute detour. Well worth it if you are in a car and it&#39;s between the hours of 11am and midnight and a great &#34;near the airport hangout&#34; if you&#39;re coordinating rides with others flying into this airport. 

Not much else to say except there&#39;s really no way to truly experience this sandwich except eating it yourself. So go do that!"

Italian beef is a really juicy sandwich. The whole thing gets dipped in the juice/gravy the meat has been cooked in. It&#39;s got this nice spiceness to it, but it&#39;s not hot, just really flavorful.

It&#39;s probably worth mentioning that you should never call it a Philly Steak; Chicagoans will freak out! They&#39;re very proud of their food.

In todays world that is such BS! Fine, it makes stealing $$ easier for the biz but come on! There is an ATM that will charge you a $3 service fee so add that on to your meal and you&#39;re paying 33% more than you need to for a beef, fries, &amp; drink. You get one star deducted just for living in the 70&#39;s!!! Next time I will bring nickels to pay for my meal!!!

As for the combo it was pretty good. I like the beef flavor but I think the sausage is where it&#39;s at! It does not feel like the typical sausage you get. The texture is a bit more smooth and it has great flavor. They could but more beef on the sandwich. The fries are the thin frozen kind which I actually like.

If you don&#39;t feel for Japanese or Korean food (lots of these restaurants in this area) and prefer something cheaper and quick, having a brief touch base with Johnnie&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be a bad choice.  

Prepare some green bucks because your tarjetas wouldn&#39;t work at all.  There&#39;s an ATM available but I didn&#39;t pay attention on the amount of surcharge that would deduct from your bank account.  Fortunately hubby and I found a PNC bank diagonally across from Johnnie&#39;s.  

Speedy, economical, and delicious Italian ice were still on-point at this Satellite Johnnie&#39;s.  We went with the normal order: Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers.  While the hot peppers were spicy, crunchy, and pleasantly-complementary to the tender slices of beef, the tough roll caused the ruination of the entire sandwich.  

Perhaps I should have asked for extra au jus in order to avoid biting into the stiff bread.  I didn&#39;t think that was that disastrous until I was half-way through my sandwich.  I was just gonna blame on my poor planning.  I should have portioned the bread and beef equally on every bite so that the au jus coming from the beef could soak into the roll.  Yes, that&#39;s what food science is about!

CASH ONLY so even though the prices are uber cheap, it&#39;ll cost a bit more if you didn&#39;t realize this prior to walking into the restaurant.

The first thing I like about this place is that the menu is dead simple. You pretty much get a choice of an Italian beef, polish sausage, or a hot dog. I didn&#39;t really want to mess around, so I got the beef and fries, with a ever-so-slightly-watered-down Diet Coke.

Fortunately the beef was excellent. Sweet green peppers, and moist, seasoned beef whose recipe I imagine is a secret somewhere. Paired with the fries that I&#39;m almost certain were fried in lard, this is the place to go for a classic beef. All for around $6, too. (And the hot dog was less than $3!)

I was a big fan of the Italian ice as well, which is both very lemony and with the softest texture you&#39;ve ever seen in an Italian ice. Fresh, too, since apparently the watermelon one could have seeds in it (I&#39;ll try that next time.)

Eat in. Out in the patio. Or I suppose the real way is to stand in front of the window facing the parking lot doing the &#34;Chicago Lean&#34;. 

1) Put your massive juicy sandwich on the counter. 
2) Stand in front of it with your chest about a foot from the counter&#39;s edge. 
3) Lean forward until your chest is at a 45 degree angle to the counter. (Gents, tuck your ties...ladies pull back your hair.)
4) Pick up your sandwich with your elbows propped on the counter.
5) Angle the sandwich 45 degrees to the counter with top end towards your mouth. 
6) Eat and enjoy. Let the juicy drippings/toppings hit the floor!

Disclaimer: For best results, keep the sandwich wrapped in the wax paper and unwrap it as you go. It&#39;ll save you greasy mess and a massive amount of napkins.

Well...I didn&#39;t do the &#34;Chicago Lean&#34; today, simply because the weather was superb and we sat in the patio. I was free to drop things and let the little fat birdies feast on it.

Lunch for 2 only set us back a mere $16. I think the meat and toppings are getting a little skimpier than previous visits. Tsk tsk. Nonetheless, still satisfies my craving for a hot Italian beef."

I have gotten this to go and eaten in the restaurant, and both are great experiences even if you get your sandwiched dipped! You have to get an Italian beef, dipped, served with hot and sweet peppers. Get fries on the side and the lemon ice. You will thank me later.

You can see from pictures here that the lemon and watermelon ice are served in a small paper cup, but stuffed almost twice as high as the cup is!! You&#39;ll be wanting more at the end though! It&#39;s the best flavored ice I&#39;ve ever eaten. Ever. I definitely prefer the lemon over the watermelon. The lemon does have lemon rinds within it, but that only adds to the authenticity of the flavor. I want a lemon ice right now!"

You can eat inside or out.  Or I suppose the real way is to stand in front of the window facing the parking lot leaning over the table.

This means you need to get a beef with peppers (sweet or hot) dipped in juice - and have it over the wax paper it comes in - then lean forward and eat with the juice dripping all over the wax.  You have to practice to not make a juicy mess.  

Johnnie&#39;s has amongst the best beef in the area.  The portion size is on the small size, but the quality is top notch.  

The high point is the Italian beef - would be rated 5 if that was all.  The other stuff is good - but not as top notch.  I generally just get a beef sandwich with hot peppers and a large pop.

Chicago takes a lot of pride in their Italian beef - and this is easily accessible right off the Northwest Tollway."

They had a cloth tent in front of the main door, probably to keep the AC and heat inside, which made it harder for my sister to hold the doors both open for me. 

Not the best Italian beef, but pretty cheap. It was kind of salty. We like the Italian beef at Portillo&#39;s and Torre and Luke&#39;s better. They have a limited menu. We did like the watermelon Italian ice. We shared a small that had some seeds, but it was served so it looked like a flower in a cup.

We all have our favorite Italian beef spot. And we all know that Portillo&#39;s is a safe bet. However pound for pound the Italian beef at Johnny&#39;s has more flavor then most other spots. The reason for the four stars is because they have been rather inconsistent in their seasoning. At times their beef may be salty and fries may be overcooked. However when you catch them on the good day you would be surprised that you have lived this long without eating here.

Plus on their fast and friendly staff."

I researched on Yelp before deciding where to try my first beef sandwich and I chose Johnnie&#39;s Beef. There&#39;s an authentic setup here at Johnnie&#39;s and it isn&#39;t commercialized like other places nearby.

I discovered that Johnnie&#39;s only takes cash and with no Chase in the area (that I could find), I decided to use the third-party ATM inside. Parking isn&#39;t bad and you shouldn&#39;t have trouble finding a spot unless there&#39;s a big lunch rush.

Unfortunately, since Johnnie&#39;s Beef is the only place I&#39;ve eaten Italian beef, I&#39;m not able to compare it to other places. However, I can&#39;t deny my meal was absolutely delicious.

There are certainly better places to get Italian beef and hotdogs, but Johnnie&#39;s doesn&#39;t disappoint.  I&#39;ve had much better vienna beef hotdogs from other places (especially with Portillos down the street), but it&#39;s still tasty, cheap, and it comes with fries.

Add an Italian ice and it all comes together as a decent fast food meal.  4/5 for the food.

I only knocked another star off because the service there can be sort of unwelcoming at times.  I often go to Johnnie&#39;s later at night, because it&#39;s one of the few food places open late.

In true Chicago form, Johnnie&#39;s Beef is a hole-in-the-wall, gem-in-the-rough, no-nonsense joint loudly boasting the best Italian beef in the city. Better than Al&#39;s? Well, that&#39;s what they say. Me, I&#39;ve never been a big fan of Italian beef (I&#39;m more of a dainty sushi-eating chick than a beef sammich-in-yo-face, juices drippin&#39; down my arms chick) even when I lived in Chicago back in the day. My papa bear, however, LIVES for this stuff... so when we were in town for the holidays, we decided we should check this place out. And then, when we heard the rumor that Johnnie&#39;s beat Al&#39;s, my dad immediately started rounding us up into the car like cattle.

Like I said, no frills. No expensive prices. No emotional expressions either, apparently - as our gruffy cashier didn&#39;t even bat an eye when we mentioned we came from out of town to try their stuff. Oh well, whatever, 2mins later and we had a smorgasbord of dripping, juicy, spicy, dipped Italian beef sandwiches with fries and Italian ice on our table. The sandwiches were good (mind the jalapenos, for all you spice-fearing), but my dad swore Al&#39;s still reigned supreme. The Italian ice was sooooo refreshing! Forget that it was like, 10 degrees outside. It definitely ain&#39;t Mario&#39;s Lemonade, but if you&#39;re in the &#39;burbs, it&#39;s good enough. GET THE ITALIAN ICE! Watermelon, lemon - they&#39;re both awesome!

Now, what ISN&#39;T awesome is that weird, tacky animal-zoo mural painted on the wall. Why are there cartoon animals painted on the wall? How did they get names? Why are they eating Italian roast beef sandwiches?! #whatislife"

I&#39;d never had the opportunity to stop by but one day after leaving the nearby Mitsuwa Market I spotted it and being right around lunchtime I figured I would stop in and try the hot dog. I went to the counter and placed my order for a hot dog with fries and a drink. While ordering I witnessed the guy working at the counter absolutely screaming at and admonishing another employee who had incorrectly filled my drink. I felt very bad for the employee and immediately my experience was off to a negative start.

Once I had my food I sat a ways from the counter to avoid hearing any other screaming that might further dampen my experience and decided to dig into the hot dog. The hot dog served here came on a regular non-poppy seed bun.There was a pickle spear easily the size of the hot dog itself right on top of the hot dog, some nicely slicked pickle, and hot sport peppers on top. The mustard and relish application were fine, the type of relish used here didn&#39;t really suit the dog too well. There was no noticeable celery salt. After my first bite I had to remove the pickle spear, the pickle is just way too thick and is the dominant flavor here. With the pickle removed the hot dog tasted pretty decent. Had it been cut thinner or used a slice rather than a spear I would have had the pickle flavor in with the hot dog as well.

The hot dog also came with fries, these were thin crispy fries very similar to McDonalds fries. They were not too salty and had a good overall flavor, a fair number of hot dog stands I&#39;ve visited use these same fries and I find them to be an excellent compliment to hot dogs as long as they&#39;re not cooked in a funky tasting oil. These were tasty overall and a nice compliment to the hot dog.

Overall my impression of the food here was pretty positive, the hot dog had its problems but wasn&#39;t bad, and the fries were good. While service was friendly to me, it was a bit of a downer seeing the employee filling the drink orders get screamed at like that. I hope that the screaming I heard at the drink filler isn&#39;t a pattern and was just a rare incident. Overall I&#39;d say Johnny&#39;s Beef is an average place to get a hot dog and will get three stars."

With that, this review is from someone that regularly visited the EP location most of their life. I knew this location had opened but it just didn&#39;t feel right to cheat and visit this place rather than make the trip to the sacrosanct original. But-after driving by for years I stopped in. I saw the &#34;Cash only&#34; note on the door when I walked up and smiled. But I stopped smiling when I came through the doors.  To me, this place was soulless. While managers have changed over the 30+ years in EP, the building and order process is reminiscent of the Seinfeld Soup Nazi episode. EP is so small -stand up eating room only inside and a few tables outside that you need to know how to order and step to the side. (My favorite is Combo, dipped, with hot n sweet, large ice, No Lid). The Arlington Height location was silent as a tomb at 2:30 pm on a Monday afternoon. A women with a huge bucket and mop was washing the floor right in front of the register. I was blind sided by this apparition. Surely all places need to be clean but as I gazed around at the &#34;new&#34; Johnny&#39;s it was all I could do to order a small ice (no lid) and pay my $1.49. Call me biased but as I ate my ice in the car on the way home-it didn&#39;t taste the same. If you are going to Johnny&#39;s for the food I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get something good.

Second, I am all for a clean restaurant to eat at.   That being said, the lady that was doing mopping today was mopping the whole restaurant obsessively.  I could understand the walk way where people could track in mud or snow.  I can understand clearing off tables and wiping them down after people leave.
This lady was mopping  where people were eating.  I mean right where people were eating.  Despite there NOT being a mess from it being winter in those areas and despite it looking pretty clean where she was mopping, she continued to move chairs around customers trying to eat.  What made it even worse is she used what SMELLED like a whole bottle of Pinesol in her mop bucket.  As I tried to eat my fries my upper lip started to burn and my fries tasted like Pinesol. That is how STRONG  the smell was.  
As she got an inch from my feet I told her not to mop. To, &#34;just please wait until we are done eating.&#34;   I&#39;m all for a hard worker but the smell ruined the eating experience.

My boyfriend is Mexican so he&#39;s always making me go to Mexican restaurants. I say making me because I have yet to enjoy a Mexican restaurant in Chicago. After getting food poisoning at Uncle Julio&#39;s, I vowed to never eat Mexican food in Chicago again.

Seriously, I kicked and screamed but finally relented because it was a celebratory event for him.

Service is decent. It took a little long for the waitress to come to our table at first. I had to flash her a death stare to finally get her attention. 

The food was pretty good. The rice and refried beans were delicious and the meat tasted good but was a bit chewy.

Also, I believe some if not all of it is pre cooked. I asked for carne asada and she said the only carne asada they had was the kind you stuff in a taco...meaning it was cut into small pieces already. I didn&#39;t think about it at the time but if they&#39;re cooking from scratch they should&#39;ve been able to give me a whole one.

Either way, it&#39;s not a huge deal because places like Chipotle cook in bulk but I do question how long it was since the batch I ate was made.

Location - within 8 minutes of where I live.
Price - Reasonable, especially on Taco Tuesday, when select tacos are 99 cents.
Hours - Open late, until midnight Sunday through Thursday, and open until 0300am Fridays and Saturdays.

Their tacos are on the smaller side, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. If you&#39;re like me and like to get all different flavors, then this makes sense so you can try all sorts of things without breaking the bank. The combination plate of tacos includes a generous portion of thick and hot beans, and a not completely pureed consistency. You&#39;ll find some whole beans in there, and they&#39;re also topped with cheese. The rice is always flavorful and fresh tasting, not like the bottom of the barrel rice I&#39;ve had at other times in other places. 

Suadero - Flank steak. This almost a beef version of al pastor. Tender pieces of saucy, smoky and occasionally fatty meat with a bit of acidity in it&#39;s flavoring. This is really good if you&#39;re in the mood for...

Al pastor - I eat here kind of often, and the al pastor isn&#39;t always the same. Not sure why, but sometimes it&#39;s saucy, and other time&#39;s it isn&#39;t. The suadero usually is. However the last time I ate here, the al pastor was just cube pieces of fried pork, almost to the point of well done.  Almost a chicharron taco. 

Carnitas - Long strip of meat laid in line with the taco opening.  Which means you have to bite through every fiber in that muscle to get through it. Sometimes I want to shred my carnitas with my hands and rebuild my taco but I don&#39;t want to insult the taco gods so I just leave it alone and eat it. But it is a pretty big hunk of meat to bite through. 

Milanesa - Mmmmmmilanesa. Something about milanesa brings me to another place and time, maybe because it reminds of Ricobene&#39;s breaded steak sandwich? Well, it&#39;s almost like that. The milanesa is very thin, and not very crispy when it comes out, maybe it&#39;s just been my luck. But I still like milanesa. I just imagine the salsa I&#39;m putting on there is marinara and the tortilla is a bun and Elgin is Chinatown. I go to a different place when I&#39;m eating.

Bistec - Tender pieces of grilled steak, cooked well without being overcooked and dry. The meat is moist enough and there isn&#39;t usually very much gristle, which I like. Burned edges of fat help the flavor.

Huevo con chorizo - Eggs and Mexican sausage. It&#39;s like a breakfast taco! If you&#39;re wondering what the meat and eggy configuration is, it&#39;s almost like a tube shaped chorizo omelet that&#39;s been then stuffed into a tortilla. Trust me, this tastes better than I&#39;ve described it! The eggs help to defuse the saltiness of the chorizo. 

Chorizo - Just the sausage. It&#39;s a bit salty, but this is the kind of taco you get when you need to either get over a hangover or avoid an impending one. 

The tortas aren&#39;t the biggest I&#39;ve had, but they&#39;re good with a soft bread, plenty of meat(your choice) topped with cheese, sour cream, beans, lettuce tomato and HUNKS of avocado. I didn&#39;t realize the avocado was in there until I ate a whole half of an avocado in one bite. Just based on the market price of avocados, the torta is a great value food. And I can never finish one in one sitting, so I get to have two tortas for the price of one! 

On the weekend they have menudo, which is tripe soup. If you like tripe, you should try it, you may like it? I wasn&#39;t a fan and I love tripe, but my issue had to deal with the overall oiliness of the soup. It&#39;s very oily and fatty and as a base, not tasty without adding a lot of lime and onion and such. 

Overall though I love everything I eat here. If you&#39;re not sure what you want to try, just come on Taco Tuesday and get one of everything!"

I stopped by the Elgin location of Los Comales last Friday. I&#39;ve lived around here for almost 4 years, and just had never gotten around to trying this place. I&#39;m glad I did.

I had a pretty simple order of 3 tacos. 1 each of the Steak, Steamed Beef, and the Chorizo.  The Steak was very good, and had a nice flavor. I probably won&#39;t do the steamed beef again. Not bad, just not really my thing.  The Chorizo was outstanding.

I ordered all of my Tacos with cilantro and onions, and asked them to add cheese. My only complaint was that they also put avocado on them too, which is not to my liking, I think they did that because you get avocado when you order cheese,  No big deal, I just took the avocado off.

The tacos here are Mexico City style.. small with soft corn tortillas which were very fresh.

Years ago, there was a great Mexican place called Cha-Cha-Cha in E. Dundee that had the best steak tacos.  Cha-Cha-Cha is long gone, but these tacos are very similar, so I will be back."

This place is always loaded with hispanics and I wonder what I am missing. I have only tried tacos, burritos, and enchiladas, but all have fallen very short of expectations.

The interior is clean, the staff is friendly, and it&#39;s generally a pleasant place to sit down and have lunch. Nothing really leaps out as a major turnoff, it&#39;s just that the food seems a bit on the boring side, and perhaps a bit over-americanized (e.g., lettuce and tomato). However, I don&#39;t want to overstate this point; the food is NOT tasteless. It&#39;s just not special.

One particular issue for me is that although the al pastor is good enough, it&#39;s just not very distinctive. It&#39;s tastes something like BBQ chicken wings. Pastor is a special dish that should have a special taste, and theirs is forgettable.

I do return to the place from time to time because it&#39;s quite consistent, and I&#39;m not all that picky. I think that its nearby neighbor, La Flor, is consistently better."

We usually get the 3 or 4 steak taco dinner that comes with rice and beans. The price is unbeatable! The steak is always TENDER! The only issue with their tacos is that they are a bit small; but the taste more than makes up for that. Their service is always fast. We are usually in and out of there in 15 - 20 minutes tops! The staff is very friendly and always smiling. The place is very clean as well! Another great thing is the box of pickled jalapeno, cauliflower, and carrots they have sitting on each table. Those things are soooooooo good! Love this place! Plus they are open late so we always go there when we looking for a midnight snack close to home."

*Food is always served timely, hot, and consistently in great quality - and it&#39;s authentic mexican
*The servers are very friendly and pleasant, and speak Spanish or English
*The restaurant itself is kept up well, is a really big place, has a jukebox, overall great vibe
*There&#39;s always pleanty of parking available outside

But to be completely honest i&#39;ve been their two times and  the food is not to my taste.  I have tried the tortas and tacos.  The two things that i do liked was the rice water also named agua de orchata, and the other thing is how the cooks are visible from the dining room so you can see how they are preparing the food.  Coming back to the tacos, the other problem i see is how spensive they are.  To fill you up, you would need at least 5 or more.  My over all conclusion is that the decor is nice but the food is too expensive for what you get."

Every item I ordered came wrong.

Cheesy beef with hot pepper on the side.
The peppers were in the beef, with cheese on top of it. My friend who ordered it did not want the peppers, ordered them for me so that I could have a bit. But she couldn&#39;t even eat the beef bc the peppers were on it. And it was DRIPPING grease, super gross!

Extra hot buffalo wings. They put the buffalo sauce on the side, why?! I was so mad. I&#39;ve never had a place do that. I did request at the end of checkout to put two sides of hot sauce on the side, but I did NOT mean the buffalo sauce for the wings. Not to mention, the wings were pretty cold. And the bleu cheese tastes pretty crappy. Just get the ranch. Let&#39;s talk about that buffalo sauce though! It was straight Frank&#39;s red hot from the bottle!

Fettuccine Alfredo. It said it came with garlic bread and a meat or marinara sauce. It gave you the option to choose which sauce. I picked the meat sauce. When it arrived, no meat sauce for my garlic bread... 

Cannoli- it was ok. 

At the end, I ate the beef, or half of it since the grease grossed me out. And my friend ate the fettuccine. So sadly it was a fail at trying to satisfy my taste buds with fettuccine."

I can barely make it to midnight nowadays) and pretend you just came from a crazy night out.  

I ordered a medium thin crust pizza with mushroom, sausage, and onions and it was plenty of food for two.  I&#39;m sure a medium is meant to serve more than two people but then again I eat about as much as two people combined.  The only survivors of the night were 3 small pieces and they were devoured for breakfast the next morning..what can I say, it&#39;s the breakfast of champions!  They were generous with their toppings which I appreciated because what&#39;s worse than a thin crust pizza with barely any toppings??  (Answer: Nickelback, sorry I had to go there!).

As I said a few weeks ago, I order out for pizza 2-3 times a year and because my last pizza experience was less than stellar, my craving wasn&#39;t able to be curbed and I needed to call for &#39;za for the second time in less than 30 days. Thankfully, Rosati&#39;s answered my prayers for decent pizza + delivery so I was not only able to fulfill my pie destiny, but also feed myself for the next 4 days for $25.  Toppings were plentiful, the delivery guy really nice and didn&#39;t even blink when I answered the door in a do-rag fashioned from a hand towel and the pizza came loaded with coupons for my next orders.

Back to the pizza, good thin crust. The fiance despises the party cut because he&#39;s a New Yorker....boo hoo you can&#39;t roll your pizza triangle. I do like their Italian sausage it has a lot of flavor and is nicely sized, not granual like some places. Abundant cheese which isn&#39;t too greasy and a nice tangy sauce. 

This is my go to late night pizza. We&#39;ve had their sandwiches which aren&#39;t bad.

I went here to have the dinner buffet because I was feenin&#39; for some pizza pie. I was left utterly frustrated and extremely disappointed. 

My server was awesome and friendly, too bad this restaurant took a severe nosedive in the pizza department. I kept waiting for them to bring out more pizza but all that was there for a good 30 minutes was cheese, and vegetable pizza...are they serious??? The salad bar was majorly lacking in the &#34;salad&#34; department, but there was plenty of dressing for the 3 pieces of lettuce left. Mind you this is not 10 minutes before close...this was at around 6:30pm on a weekday.

I really tried to be patient and give this place a chance, but I just ended up eating what I could and bounced up outta there. I ended up ordering pizza at some other spot that I won&#39;t mention. It rhymes with &#34;Pizza Rut&#34; which is what they should rename this place after that debacle."

Inexpensive - under $20 for 2 of us including the buffet and a drink.  There isn&#39;t much for a buffet, but it is adequate for what it is.  There is a salad bar, two soups and 3 or 4 choices of pizza.  The wait staff was prompt about taking away used plates.

One of the down sides to any buffet, in my opinion, is kids.  When we were done, fortunately, we watched an unsupervised kid pick his nose, eat it and then use that same wet finger to get some of the sugar off of one of the sugar coated dough things that were available at the buffet while the parents were nowhere to be seen.  Ewww!  Maybe I&#39;m being too hard on kids - there are probably adults doing the same thing!

Back to the food though.  The pizzas were ok.  They didn&#39;t seem nearly as good as ones we have had delivered.  The salad bar selections weren&#39;t bad.  Neither of us had the soup so I can&#39;t comment on that.  I would have liked to see some sort of pasta available though, besides the cold macaroni salad at the salad bar.

Overall though, not bad.  We&#39;ll probably go again.  Hopefully there will be no nose picking sugar finger lickers there again!"

I was hungry from having skipped lunch but knew dinner wouldn&#39;t end up being that far away, so I just got two steak tacos with onions and cilantro only.  Nothing fancy.  The man at the register was super friendly and chatted with me while I waited.  Sometimes that can be awkward but he was nice.  He commented on my fresh nails and when I said it was my first time going there, he remarked maybe you&#39;ll be back to get them done again.  and then get tacos again.  and you know what?  He&#39;s probably right!

I took the tacos home, probably about a 15 minute drive? and ate them outside.  They were still warm and delicious.  I can be picky about my steak tacos (again, see most of my reviews) but these were great.  The pieces were the right size, the meat wasn&#39;t fatty.  I will definitely add Rey Taco into my taco rotation, and hopefully next time maybe try some other items.

One thing to note as another reviewer said, it&#39;s basically take out.  I had initially figured I&#39;d eat there but when I walked in realized that&#39;s not possible.  Just an FYI."

The food is fresh and I suggest getting a burrito which is fairly large and you can ask for it extra crispy. Watch out the hot sauce is no joke but extremely worth it for spicy connoisseurs. Pricing is very reasonable!

I thought, &#34;okay cool, ten minutes isn&#39;t so bad.&#34; At 12:10 I asked again where my order was, and the same process repeated, with me being told I&#39;d, &#34;have to wait Untill 12:20.&#34; At this point-- I was ready to walk out and refuse to give him my business. 12:20 rolls around, and what do you know?

I agree with a review below about the bland steak. Again, nothing amazing, nothing awful.
I&#39;d eat it again and then again if I didn&#39;t? No big whoop.

Lunch time this place can get pretty backed up. As you wait in line, watch how many people get burned by the &#39;Cash Only!&#39; policy.
The hot sauce isn&#39;t that hot and very watery. Would be great to have a good thick green sauce.

The tacos and tortas here are much better than the burrito&#39;s."

This is one of my favorite taco joints, so anytime I make it out to the &#39;burbs, I make sure to stop by.

This isn&#39;t a sit down place, it&#39;s basically take-out, with only a tiny counter and a few stools to sit at.  But there is actually a decent park with picnic tables behind the building (it&#39;s in a strip mall) so if it&#39;s a nice day, you can take your bag of taco delights over to the park and dine in the sun.

The steak is really good, so I&#39;d recommend steak tacos or a steak burrito. The steak fajitas tacos are also delicious.  And, the star of the show, the &#34;hot sauce&#34;. It&#39;s a strange color, somewhere between green and orange, and it&#39;s tasty and really hot! I&#39;ve never been able to pry the secret ingredient out of the owner, nor figure out on my own exactly what makes it so special... but that sauce is crazy addictive!!!!  I slather it on my tacos and devour it as tears of joy and pain pour out of my eyes... so...spicy...so...yummy!  Long live the King!"

Rey tacos is my go to place in the suburbs for tacos and burritios. I used to live in elk grove and it was just down the road now I&#39;m up in Palatine and I look for excuses to drive back down to eat here.

This is really a to-go place, very small just like the taco shops that I loved in San Diego, same three guys working there every day. Same smiles every time you walk in the door.  Cash only.

My sister&#39;s company moved right down the street from my office. Between us lies a magical strip mall filled with amazing places like King Taco. I decided to check out her new digs one day and stopped to grab some lunch for us. 

When I walked in, I almost walked out. I&#39;m just being honest here.  It fits the phrase &#34;hole in the wall&#34;. I think there are three or four stools lined up against a counter where you can eat. There is a cash register for this CASH ONLY establishment. There are a few business cards, Avon catalogs and the like laying about. 

And then you get to the good stuff. Three guys. One taking the orders and making the change (do you remember those shiny, flat pieces of metal?). One manning the grill with an expert hand and a knack for getting my lunch just right. And the third for packing it up and handing it to the hungry (probably drooling) patron waiting to go devour their tacos in their car...or sister&#39;s office as the case may be. 

I can&#39;t get away from the tacos al pastor. I have a feeling that unless someone else goes for me that I may never try anything else here. They are delicious!  Double corn tortillas with the beautifully seasoned pork. Yum!  I also really enjoy the salsa that they serve with their chips. I skip the hot sauce that comes with the tacos. I think it&#39;s unnecessary. The flavors are just right and the prices don&#39;t make me cringe. I would call this place a winner!"

The service is friendly, the food is always perfect. Most taco places have those little hard fat deposits in the steak - and I have NEVER had anything like that here. They also serve hard shell tacos, which is not very common (and I have eaten at a LOT of Mexican places in and around Chicago). 
The atmosphere is that of a diner. Small, yet efficient for being a lunch spot. I wish there was one in the city because I absolutely love their food. If you work or live around the area, definitely try it out - you will not be disappointed!"

A taco outfit in California incorporated the name and they got a cease and desist letter saying to change it....so they did, to Rey, which is spanish for king for all you people like me who don&#39;t know spanish. Tony there told me that story specifically.   Anyways, I used to go the King Taco #1 in Schaumburg which was affiliated and run out of business by some fat woman.  Back to Rey Taco in Elk Grove, which used to be called King Taco #2. ... the place has never made me sick nor has it made me any fatter, even when I was eating there 4 or 5 times a week.  It&#39;s good, you just got to ask for &#34;extra meat&#34;  What do you want for six bucks?  I have been pleased with their service for 15 years and they should have me on a discount program for my dedication to going there.  There will be no such thing, I punished them for a couple months by not going there when they raised their prices.  Bottom line, its consistent and the soup is really good.

If you&#39;re looking for a egg-cellent wholesome breakfast with a cozy atmosphere and great service, you&#39;ll find it at Egg Harbor Cafe. 

I grew up in Barrington, so this place has always been known as the go-to brunch spot. They recently moved to a new building, which is absolutely beautiful. I&#39;m so relieved they kept their cozy country kitchen feel. There&#39;s indoor and outdoor seating, and now an awesome full espresso bar for on-the-go or while you wait for your table. 

Keep in mind---They&#39;re usually packed, but the wait goes pretty quickly with their accommodating staff. I really hate when people complain about the wait, because that&#39;s what you should expect during brunch hours on a weekend. Since it&#39;s a new location, a lot of the staff is new and young. There&#39;s a lot of unexperienced waiters and hostess&#39;, so you&#39;ll have to be patient for the newbies. 

Overall, I highly recommend Egg Harbor if you&#39;re grabbing brunch with a friend or family. My favorite dishes are the skillet (especially the skillet combo with banana bread french toast). You honestly cannot go wrong with any dish though, since they go above and beyond with every meal.  Our waiter, Dan G. is awesome, and remembers my order every time I come in--so know you&#39;re in good hands if he&#39;s your server!

Shortly after being seated, I ordered my food then went to the restroom to wash my hands. When I returned to my table, it had been bussed. Mind you, all I had to that point was water, but poof - it was gone. So shortly after, they realized what had happened and I was restocked with H2O again. 

Then I ordered lunch. My usual full order of Santa Fe Chicken Roll Ups and an order of the Chicken Wild Rice Soup. Soon after ordered, my server told me that they had a run on the soup and wanted to know if I wanted to wait. So I opted for that. Next, my roll-up comes out... I looked and knew it couldn&#39;t be right, so I asked if that was really what I ordered. Well, no, it was the &#34;soup and sandwich&#34; combo roll up size - which I specifically said I didn&#39;t want. My server came up and was apologetic - the kitchen had made a mistake (that&#39;s one of the problems with having people other than the server run food out - the server would have noticed the miscue). So I&#39;m given another 1/2 of a roll-up on a second plate. 

So I finish both and no soup yet - that was several minutes later. It was good - quite hot as it had just been made.

We walked into the restaurant and it was busy...which I don&#39;t mind because it lets me know the restaurant must be doing something right.  I walked up to a very polite hostess and I put my name in, they gave me a buzzer, and told me it would be about 20 minutes.  It ended up being a little less than 20 minutes, which is always nice.

Once seated, a gentleman almost immediately came up to our table and starting talking about the menu specials and if we wanted a beverage.  We were thrown off at first because we hadn&#39;t even had 20 seconds to settle in and see what beverages were offered.  Polite gentleman, but I just felt a little rushed.

We looked over the menu for a little longer than normal just because we had never been to an Egg Harbor before and also the menu is quite large and...has a lot of good options in my opinion.  After we figured out what to get it took a long time to order our food.  Another waitress actually came over to our table and took our order.  She was very friendly and patient and gave good advice.

My fiance is a vegetarian and she ordered the Black Bean Burger Wrap which came two sides: diced sweet potatoes (she loved) and a cup of fresh fruit and she stuck with water as her drink.  I ordered the San Antonio Skillet that came with an English muffin and homemade blackberry jam and ordered a 12oz. glass of their freshly squeezed orange juice (a must-have).  My fiance wasn&#39;t thrilled with the black bean wrap as she said it wasn&#39;t seasoned well and the black bean burger itself tasted a little off.  I, on the other hand, really enjoyed the skillet.  The potatoes were cooked to perfection, the veggies were fresh, and the eggs were perfection.

All-in-all we enjoyed our visit, but it is about a 20 minute drive so we probably won&#39;t make it back out there too soon.  The service was just okay and we weren&#39;t wowed by the food.  If you are in the Barrington area I recommend stopping in and giving it a try - just stick to their breakfast and pick out an option that has &#34;their favorites&#34; icon next to it.

First time I ate here was on Valentine&#39;s Day, and I got the special - a cinnamon roll french toast.

Well, I loved my protein wrap which was made as requested.. But at same time I feel sorry for my friend who is Eggeterian and had a morsel of meat..."

I think the move to the Main St location though they lost some of their charm in the decor. (There aren&#39;t as many chickens, colors, etc.) I understand they may have got a few more tables.. But still, the place is always crowded on a weekend. But the wait is worth it.. You won&#39;t leave hungry. :)"

It is in a brand new building &amp; looks very nice from the outside.  When I first pulled into the parking lot it reminded me of a circus because it was packed &amp; there was no parking &amp; no one could drive.  

When I finally made it inside after circling the lot it was packed inside &amp; it was a little chaotic.  Once we were finally seated the experience was much better.  The server was very attentive &amp; kept checking up on our table.  I ordered the biscuits &amp; gravy &amp; my wife ordered the chicken sausage &amp; goat cheese scrambler.  

The biscuits &amp; gravy were very good &amp; one of the better versions of that dish that I have had in the area.  The eggs were a little bit cold but they were still tasty.  My wife&#39;s dish was very tasty as well.  

Overall the restaurant was very nice inside &amp; out &amp; the food was tasty.  The service here was also good &amp; the place was clean.  I would eat here again if I was in the area for breakfast."

It&#39;s just always so crowded that it&#39;s incredibly loud. Especially during the summer or weekends when kids have off school. But now that they have moved into their new location, they have more and better outdoor seating. If the noise will bother you, ask to sit outside! And despite it being crowded, you&#39;ll be seated and served quickly. 

The food makes up for the lack of ambience entirely. Fresh ingredients and they won&#39;t go light on the avocado and bacon like other places. Their eggs are pasture raised too. Great coffee with all sorts of flavors if you&#39;re into that. I personally love their skillets and their gluten free pancakes. 

I have an allergy to gluten and have never had a problem here. Just make sure you let them know and they put your meal on a red plate to make sure everyone else knows as well. 

Best drink: strawberry orange juice fresh squeezed!"

food was great, atmosphere was buzzing, people were getting their food and drinks quickly, they really do an awesome job accommodating children, and the wait staff was phenomenal.

you really can&#39;t got wrong with anything on the menu and the coffee&#39;s are all great, though some of the drinks are a little much for me, I&#39;m an iced coffee guy but settled for their version of a frappachino, maybe? i don&#39;t remember but it was icy and sweet, but obviously i slammed that sucker down.

i can see people coming here over and over again thanks to the great menu and wide array of food choices."

Located in downtown barrington in a historical building, the restaurant is a charming brunch spot that exudes a classic Midwestern house. 
This place gets busy so plan accordingly. One superb perk is free coffee for those waiting for a seat. This is a nice touch and definitely adds to the overall experience. 

As far as food is considered, the portions are generous, prices are competent and the tastes are excellent. The items to try are the Garden Omelette - Standard omelette with fresh vegetables, Swedish Pancakes (These are thinner pancakes topped with lingonberry jam and a decadent butter), whole wheat pancakes which are light, fluffy and buttery. They also serve intelligentsia coffee which is strong, fresh and a perfect complement to the overall menu. 
Will keep coming back :)"

On weekends there tends to be a wait, but it goes pretty quickly and it&#39;s for sure worth it. The new location probably makes the wait less frustrating too, with a larger entry way and more seating in general. I really love that the new space has such a huge patio! However, the new building just doesn&#39;t have the same homey, cozy feeling that their little cottage style house had.

For the food... I&#39;ve never had anything that wasn&#39;t just delicious. My favorites are the chicken sausage and goat cheese scrambler which I always add avacado to, the veggie skillet, and when I&#39;m in the mood for something rich and over the top, the lobster scrammble. They also always feature a flavored coffee and bring a whole carafe of coffee to your table so youre never waiting for a hot refill! Also, be sure to try the seasonal french toast at some point. I can&#39;t even begin to describe to you how amazing it is!!

It&#39;s great if you want to be in and out, but they also never rush you if you want to sit, drink every last drop of coffee and chat (they do drop off the check right away, but I&#39;m never offended by it and they don&#39;t seem to mind if you camp out, when it&#39;s not a super busy weekend breakfast rush.)"

They can get pretty busy &amp; crowded so sometimes you might have to wait for a table.  Service has been just okay for us since we tend to go there at peak times &amp; the servers are working overdrive to keep up so it may not always be so attentive.  The temperature of our food has been hit or miss as well...each time one of our meals is perfect and the other is just luke warm - but at least not cold &amp; definitely still tastes good.  Clearly this isn&#39;t an issue all the time based on others rave reviews so I&#39;ll just chalk it up to our bum luck on the times we&#39;ve visited.

It was very busy at 11am which is not unusual.  The wait was approximately 25 minutes and in line with what they told us it would be.

We have eaten many times at the old location but this was the first at their new place on Main Street.  We were extremely disappointed with the quality of the food.  I ordered a ham and cheese omlet and there were maybe 5 small pieces of ham I could find in the omlet and it was basically an omlet with cheese melted on top.  The breakfast potatoes were cold and the English muffin was hardly toasted.   My wife ordered eggs over easy and they were over cooked and like me her potatoes were also cold.  This is a far cry from the quality of food we have had at the old location.  Needless to say we will not be returning as there are too many other options available in the area."

The service is great; The waiters are very courteous and get everything out to you in a timely manner. Sometimes you can tell they&#39;re a bit frazzled, but considering how busy this place is, I can&#39;t blame them. You can always ask for a to-go cup of your water, tea, etc. and the waiter will gladly get that to you. The food is great, and always brought out warm. Skillets here are amazing. Only problem is that they do not have the usual shredded hash browns, only the diced potato pieces, which I don&#39;t mind but I do not prefer. The new building is beautiful and more spacious as well, but it is still always packed in here. All in all, great place for a nice breakfast!"

If you come to Egg Harbor and there&#39;s a long wait time, you can call ahead to make a &#34;reservation&#34; and they will seat you almost immediately. 

The boyfriend and I pulled up to the parking lot on the verge of starvation. We see the crowds of people standing outside, waiting for a table. He gets the brilliant idea to call from the parking lot and put our name on the wait list so we can wait in the car. Yes, we are that lazy. He tells her that we&#39;re on the way and we&#39;d like to add our name to the wait list. Imagine our surprise when she tells us that, since we called ahead, we can be seated as soon as we arrive at the restaurant. Score! 

We take the 2-second walk from the parking lot to the restaurant and are seated within a few seconds. We even got some dirty looks from other customers who have obviously been waiting much longer than us. Whatevs, I was too hungry to care..

Our waitress was friendly and very helpful when it came to recommendations. She even told us about the secret breakfast burrito she helped to create, which we ordered. I like that they have healthy breakfast options but in all honesty, the food was not that great. Call me crazy but I still prefer Cracker Barrel or even Walker Bros for my breakfast fix."

The atmosphere is so sunny and lively you can&#39;t help but have a great morning going here with friends or family. My only disappointment is that they got rid of eggbeaters. Many people like having the real egg taste without the calories and egg whites are low-calorie but not the full egg taste.

Food:  excellent

Service: excellent:

Ambiance: very nice

Let me tell you about the last time I was here.  I was on a special low-carb diet (I know -- why am I going out for breakfast then? :-)  Anyway, I was on a low-carb diet and told our server to skip the toast.  She countered with: &#34;would you like to substitute some fresh fruit instead?&#34;.  I&#39;d never even thought of asking, I just assumed one did without.  

Not only was the fresh fruit tasty, I thought it was terrific that our server volunteered a great substitute.

Before I forget, Egg Harbor serves Intelligentsia coffee.  You can sit there and drink it all day in their cool hand-made ceramic mugs.  

One more thing, each time I&#39;ve eaten here, our server has asked if we want a cup &#34;to go&#34; as we&#39;re getting ready to leave.  What a treat!"

I got the dynamite veggie omelet, my daughter ordered the confetti french toast, and my friend and my husband got the banana bread french toast.  All of the food came out very quickly, and was hot and fresh.  I could tell that the veggies in my omelet were fresh and they even still had a delicious crunch to them!

Usually I go to the one in Geneva, but I decided to meet my Aunt at this one and I was definitely not disappointed.

My pumpkin pancakes were really great, even though I could not finish them. I refused a box to take them to go, but the waitress persuaded me to take them home (saying that they tasted really great warmed up with ice cream).

The location had cute decor that  gave it a &#34;homey&#34; feel. I didn&#39;t like that when it got crowded, it got very loud.  The service was good and our waitress was friendly and made sure to check on us.

The menu was extensive, but when I try a new place I always check out the eggs benedict trying to find the best.  I was disappointed in that entree choice here. First off, my portion seemed small. The eggs were smaller and overcooked and the english muffin was smaller in part because I didn&#39;t eat the BURNT part.  Needless to say I didn&#39;t really finish it. The hollandaise sauce was good but just couldn&#39;t save the dish. I nawed on all the potatoes and wasn&#39;t full at all.  

Lucky for me, the others were not opposed to tasting and everyone&#39;s choice was by far better.  There was the fruit filled rolled up Swedish pancake that was to die for and the blueberry pancakes were jammed with real fresh bluerries and topped with a good sauce.  Finally, there was a skillet scrambler that was very tasty.  

As such, I must have gotten the bad &#34;egg&#34; in the place and would definitely come back and get any of those other dishes.  This is a small chain in the suburb areas so there are several other locations as well."

Now...the problem I have with this place are those little cubed potatoes that come with your food.... they looked old... I tasted it and guess what? Not only did it taste old, but it was cold and incredibly dry.

I did not touch those potatoes after one bite.

Yu&#39;s is awesome in that it is a legit Chinese restaurant where they pull their own noodles. If you&#39;ve never eaten at a restaurant where the noodles are made fresh by hand, that makes it worth it all by itself. The Yu&#39;s noodles are expertly made and expertly cooked -- with the right toothsome texture, the right thickness and the right amount of bite. You can get them about eight hundred ways, but our two favorites are the Seafood Noodle Platter and the Peking Noodles. My husband loves the seafood platter, which comes with a variety of seafood items, noodles and that white subgum-ish sauce that is super tasty. Me personally, this is not my cup of tea, but I think that&#39;s largely because I&#39;m picky about the types of seafood I like. For me, the Peking Noodles are where it&#39;s at. It&#39;s a big pile of noodles and thinly sliced cucumber strips that comes in a bowl covered in dark brown Peking sauce and with chunks of meat on top. You have to do some work to mix the sauce with the noodles to get them covered. But it is really delicious. Even though you might think it&#39;s spicy, it is not at all, so it&#39;s perfect for spice wusses like me. Service can be a bit spotty because Yu&#39;s is so busy sometimes. But you can always entertain yourself by watching the line of five or six chefs crank out dishes through the giant window that lines the dining room and looks into the kitchen."

I was in the area with a friend and we were looking for a Chinese place to have lunch at. He recommended Yu&#39;s and based on the Yelp reviews it seemed like a good spot. 

I believe it was our waiter who made this a bad experience. We sat down during a non-busy time of day and found that our table was still wet from cleaning, not a good start. Our waiter took our order but didn&#39;t give us any waters. He quickly came back and informed me that my drink order was not available. It was some sort of lemonade cocktail. Didn&#39;t quite understand his reason but how can a restaurant with a full bar be out of a drink at 2pm?

Our food finally came but had to wait 10 minutes before we could flag someone down to give us silverware since our table had none. We never saw the waiter until the check came...

As for the food. I ordered the orange chicken lunch special. Came with hot and sour soup, fried wonton, egg roll, and rice. 

The soup was delicious, the wonton was tasteless, didn&#39;t touch the egg roll, rice was tasteless, and just as many have said - the orange chicken is very bland and fatty. I really do think they use some kind of dark meat. It was tender shaped as well, definitely the strangest orange chicken I&#39;ve ever seen. 

 Many people seem to love this restaurant. It could be possible that the next time and following times that I visit would be amazing. But I doubt that will happen since this past lunch was pretty awful. 

I could have had a much better lunch at Panda Express. Need I say more?"

I&#39;ve been dining here for over 10 years and through different management. The lunch special is unbeatable. Dining is always accompanied by hot tea which I think is either black/oolong. Personal favorite is the kungpao chicken with egg flower soup. Restaurant is clean and spacious and they do live noodle shows. Small bar area with Tv&#39;s. Great friendly staff and they off takeout.

We had a party of 22 and ordered 4 different entrees, but 4 of each kind.

This place has never had the best service but they didn&#39;t handle our large party too badly. Food arrived fast, was tasty and hot.

Yu&#39;s mandarin has a slightly unorthodox style and taste which is why I love it. I feel like there is a South Asian influence to their food. It has a kick to it. They serve massive portions for their entrees for dinner. I highly recommend the Princess Prawn and the Szechuan Fish. The latter is spectacular.

For a restaurant in the middle of Schaumburg which is a bit of a melting pot, there should not be a language gap. Improving the communication of their servers and slightly upgrading the quality of service will take this restaurant to 5 star status. If you&#39;re reading this, Yu, that is my promise."

My parents feel the same way, and we&#39;re all Chinese so that&#39;s saying something. One of the chefs has the same last name as me, so +1 brownie point.

I&#39;ve been to this restaurant so many times and have ordered a variety of dishes, but my favorite ones are:

- Xiao ping pork: It&#39;s a spicy dish and is definitely my favorite here. The bamboo shoots really do make a difference and gives off a nice tang to the dish.
- Mongolian beef: I&#39;ve been to restaurants where the Mongolian beef didn&#39;t taste great or was too salty. Not here! I thoroughly enjoy the perfect balance of sauce in this dish.
- Hot and sour soup: I order this every single time. And it&#39;s piping hot to the point where it burns my mouth every single time. Hot and sour soup is everywhere, but Yu&#39;s Mandarin has the best one in town hands down. It&#39;s cheap too!

Depending on the time you go, it can get very busy. I&#39;ve been here multiple times on Saturdays during lunch hour, and it wasn&#39;t packed. I think part of the reason is due to them not offering the Saturday lunch specials anymore.

You might see a Panda Express nearby, but do yourself a favor and go here instead. It&#39;s definitely worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area!"

So my husband went up to one of the many people just standing around. Got our water.
Friends arrived and ordered egg rolls that everyone raved about very greasy. 
Husband order the Taiwanese beef soup. The beef was very fatty. I ordered the noodle platter. Generous with the shrimp and scallops, very thin slices of pork. Bland. No taste what so ever. Didn&#39;t even take any of it home.

We were seated right away and received our water/tea, but we waited a long time for a server to approach our table. One of the tea cups were dirty. We even had to flag down a server to see if we can place our order. He saw us waive and talked to another server to take them or find someone to take our table, which I thought was very unprofessional. 

Our server came over to our table and took our order. We ordered 2 hot and sour soups, lollipop chicken, beef with flat noodle, and salt and pepper squid. The food was good, but I felt that the beef with flat noodle was very oily. The lollipop chicken was very good and the salt and pepper squid.

I probably would&#39;ve rated higher if the service was to match to their quality of food."

The food got so bad. I think they Americanized the food like crazy and the portions got so small. Everything is either really bland and no flavor or just salty and kinda oily.

Also, the food came out separately and some of us were waiting while other people got their food.

Some of us ordered the lunch specials. The hot and sour soup was good. Prob the best thing I had that day.

I got the beef and scallop dish. I found mine kinda salty and greasy, but still ok. I liked the eggroll. I tried using the mustard on the table and it literally burned my mouth. Such a strong, horrible mustard taste, I thought it was severely burnt eggroll that I was eating, but nope, just mustard.

Other people got the seafood noodle. It was so bad. So boring and no flavor. This used to be one of the best things here but it&#39;s just bad now. Do not order this.

We got the lollipop chicken too and it was all batter and no chicken. Horrible. The pieces of chicken were tiny and there was no meat on it. It was mostly batter, maybe to compensate for the lack of meat! This was another one of the best things on the menu, but not anymore. Do not order this.

This place was so much better when it was more authentic years ago. Now there&#39;s no flavor, the food is greasy, and the portions suck. Not sure when I&#39;ll be back.

She was feeding about 15 adults and ordered green beans, fried rice, and a chicken dish. They told her that she needed 6 trays of food. She didn&#39;t know any better, so she just shelled out the money and thought they were giving her a reasonable quantity and price.

Six TRAYS of food.  SIX.  When she pulled up (she had to load it in the back of her SUV), I was shocked by the sheer ridiculous quantity, and my family EATS.  Once we dug in, the quality was disappointing: the green beans were actually the tastiest thing of the three, and that&#39;s sad, because Yu&#39;s used to be a pretty solid option.

The bill? Slightly under $400! To top it off, we had 4 FULL TRAYS LEFT of food that went pretty much untouched.

Needless to say, this is NOT the Yu&#39;s experience we remember and trusted.  They not only told her she needed WAY more food than was necessary, but the associated cost was outrageous!  I absolutely feel she got swindled by these new owners.

Never, ever again."

I typically only order three dishes: jja jang myun, jjam ppong, and the tang su yuk (also known as sweet and sour pork). 

I came here during a dinner service on Father&#39;s Day, and service was still great. Our server was so friendly and made sure that we had enough water and bowls for our meal. 

The jja jang myun is a great warm noodle dish. It uses a black bean paste with stir fried vegetables and seafood. All of this is topped with fresh, thinly sliced cucumbers. It&#39;s very savory, with a hint of sweet (from the onions). It looks intimidating because of the color, but it&#39;s really not! You can ask for a side of yellow pickled radishes, and it&#39;s the perfect complement to the noodle dish since they are cold, crunchy, and vinegary. The portion size is fairly big.

Whenever I am able to, I will order the jjam ppong, along with my jja jang myun. This dish is a hot and spicy noodle dish, using udon-like noodles. It&#39;s red/orange from all the spices, and filled with seafood and vegetables. If you like spicy, this is the perfect dish for you! 

Now, jjam ppong and jja jang myun go hand in hand. I typically like to order these two (if I am with someone else) and half each portion and split it. It&#39;s a widely popular thing that Koreans do when eating these dishes. The jjam ppong is very soupy and spicy, whereas the jja jang myun is more savory and not at all soupy. Try it, and see how you like these two! The portion size is really big for this one. 

Lastly, the tang su yuk, AKA the sweet and sour pork. You get the option to have beef or pork, but I always go with pork. For some reason, this dish is just tastier with pork. I find the pork to be a lot juicier and tender than when beef is used. The breaded layer stays crispy pretty much through the meal, even if it has been swimming in the sweet and sour sauce! 
I don&#39;t typically like pineapples in the sauce, and the tang su yuk at Yu&#39;s actually doesn&#39;t have pineapples, so it&#39;s a win-win if you&#39;re not overly fond of pineapples in your sauce. However, there are cucumbers, carrots, and onions that add a really great, crunchy texture to the crispy breading around the pork. 

Overall a really great place!"

As if the original menu wasn&#39;t vast enough to begin with.  Now there&#39;s surely something for everyone when you are craving Asian food.  The service wasn&#39;t super friendly or fast, but ok.

Spicy Scallop Roll - $7 - I was hoping for a little more flavor or topping, but this roll was pretty plain.  Not something I would order again.

Godzilla Roll (8 pieces) $14 - Yum!  It&#39;s truly everything I want in a Godzilla roll - crunch, cream cheese, and exploding flavors.

Crabmeat and velvet corn soup for 2 $7 - Good soup, a little on the bland side. It&#39;s got chunks of egg, corn and crab meat in it.

Steamed Whole Flounder $22 - This fish was delicious!  The bones weren&#39;t too difficult to pick off and the sauce was really good.

Salt and Pepper Shrimps $16 - You have the option of getting them with or without heads and I would recommend heads off.  Great flavors, nicely battered, seasoned and fried.

Double fried string beans $11 - It&#39;s a bit pricey for just green beans.  I like my green beans crunchier than these soggy fellows.  The flavor was good, though.

Sauteed Clams with black bean sauce $15 - These clams were ok.  It was a little sandy with lots of broken shells."

It wasn&#39;t until Super-Bowl Sunday when me and a group of 20 or so people decided to eat lunch here.  When arriving at the check-in counter, we were greeted with friendly smiles and were quickly seated due to a reservation we made earlier in the morning.  After a short-time of looking at what we were going to order from the menu, the waiter comes by asking what we are going to order.  

It was at this moment when I realized that things were going to be unpleasant as this was the moment when the waiter couldn&#39;t organize our orders together due to each of us ordering for separate checks.  Though i felt slightly bad for the waiter due to the sheer amount of people he had to take orders from.  

Once that was taken care of, we waited a good 10-20 minutes for all our food to arrive and it was mediocre at best.  The food I ordered was Cham-Pong, korean for Spicy Seafood Noodles, and i felt that i wasted my money here as i could have had cheaper and higher quality version of this at my local Asian Mart.

The biggest problem this establishment has however is the complete lack of service after the food was served.  Not once did the waiter come over to check if we need anything, or bothered to refill our water until we made some gestures for him to come over.  I take service very very seriously as I find tipping very hard to do if there is a lack of service from the waiter other than doing his/her job of serving and taking away the food.  I&#39;m not asking for exceptional service but honestly, if there is some kind of service done during the meal, i would gladly give 15-20% tip.  Sadly this was not the case, and what&#39;s more is that because we had a large group, even with our separate checks, were force fined a &#34;service-charge&#34; when there was a complete lack of service thereafter.  

Another key issue with this visit was the payment.  For the people in my group that paid with their cards, they were fine but the issue lied with the people that were paying for their meals in cash.  Two of my colleagues were not given their change back, forcing us to waste good time sitting around waiting til they got their money back.  This was completely unprofessional, undeserving of any sorts of tip, lack of fundamental principles of Waitering, and a complete waste of money.  

If you want some good Chinese-Korean-Asian food, i suggest making a reservation at Chef Ping as the waiters and food there are at least capable."

Still wanted to leave this review to let you guys know what happen."

The food is undoubtedly great. All meals are fresh and are cooked without MSG. Honestly, I&#39;ve been coming to Yu&#39;s for years and the food is always good. 

The bad thing about Yu&#39;s....so bad that I choose to go elsewhere is the very very poor service.  Everyone receives their food at different times. You may be completely done with your meal before your friend receives their entree.  Sometimes the food is cold when it arrives. You can be sure that you&#39;ll never get a refill on your beverage so order you&#39;d like to drink right from the start. 

The restaurant is always cramped and difficult to navigate. If someone in your group has a disability maybe you should consider take out 

What is most disturbing to me is that opinions seemed to be shared. For the last three times... Four now...,people have been so enraged over the service that they begin to raise their voices.  

It&#39;s really a shame. Such a great place.  But it&#39;s always packed so who cares if a few people like me feel this way?  The people keep coming!"

I&#39;ve been going to Yu&#39;s for years and stuck by its side even when it went through changes in management. This used to be my go-to Chinese restaurant in the area. Last weekend, our family of 7 went there for our Dad&#39;s birthday. We ordered a variety of dishes including jjajang myun (bean paste noodles), Chinese broccoli, beef mapo tofu, beef chow mein, appetizers, sweet and sour soup, etc. ALL 7 OF US WERE SICK FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS. We all had the same symptoms of food poisoning (we did not eat anything after dinner at Yu&#39;s so it could not have been attributed to anything else).

This the BEST part - I spoke to one of the managers, LOUIE, the next day after our visit and informed him that all 7 members of the party had the same symptoms of food poisoning. Initially, he offered $100 credit. I politely declined and requested to at least get a refund of our bill since I was feeling skeptical about going back there and eating again. He asked that I call back with information from my original receipt and he would be able to refund it in full, which wasn&#39;t a problem since I had saved the receipt anyway. 

I literally called him back a few minutes later with details of my receipt but on this call, he was being incredibly rude and said we would all need to bring in doctor&#39;s notes documenting that we had food poisoning. He proceeded to say that without substantial proof, they weren&#39;t going to do anything about it. 7 people ate dinner at your restaurant and all 7 people were sick later that evening. The funny part is, I never even asked for compensation initially. I simply wanted to inform him that they probably should look into their food!! **Chinese restaurants are notoriously known for not washing their vegetables and also for re-using ingredients from customers who don&#39;t finish their food! IRONICALLY, I FOUND OUT MY AUNT WAS DINING THERE WITH HER FRIENDS ON THE SAME EVENING AND THEY WERE ALL SICK AFTERWARDS TOO!!! Obviously, I will no longer be dining there and will be spreading the word through all platforms. LOUIE, you&#39;re an ass and you shouldn&#39;t be doing business in this dirty fashion."

This restaurant is always filled with mostly Asians, but also a good amount of non Asians, so you know you&#39;ll be getting authentic food here. I&#39;m not a fan of saucy Chinese dishes though, and Yu&#39;s dishes are definitely saucy and full of flavor. The dishes my family always orders are the Mongolian beef, happy family seafood dish, sweet and sour shrimp, lollipop chicken wings, and jjanjangmyun. All are good choices, and I haven&#39;t tried the other dishes because everyone I know orders these same things. Service is always accommodating, and the restaurant is fairly clean.

But I can&#39;t lie, I love some good shrimp fried rice and shrimp walnut.  

Must have: shrimp walnut.  I would take it to go though.

The menu is extensive with pictures of many of the dishes. We ordered beef with scallops. The beef was tender, the scallops perfectly cooked and the vegetables where crisp - tender with a very flavorful sauce. We ordered the noodle platter. Its a combo of seafood and pork topped with vegetables.  Its made with their house made noodles and its slightly spicey. The noodles have just the right amount of chew. It was delicious. The last dish was lemon chicken. No complaints here. 
We ordered the Blue Lotus drink. A generous drink for 7.00.

As my friend was a regular customer and was greeted by the Manager.

The check came and Yu charged us $45 for a 1.5 lbs crab. The local grocer is selling it for $10.99 a lbs. Perhaps its my lesson learn for not asking upfront but whatever happened to good faith and business ethics. Will not return to this restaurant for it&#39;s lack of integrity."

I now live in Texas and was looking forward to coming back to eat here for late lunch.  The server advised that we order asap before the kitchen close for the afternoon (currently around 2:30pm) so we ordered in the spot.  I was eating the kung pao chicken and thought it felt slimy and smooth.  I ate about 2 more bites and I could figure out why it feels that way so I spit it out.  The chicken was NOT COOKED!!!   Server was really nice and took it away asap and apologized and comp that dish.  I think the cooks were rushing to cook.  My other sister ate it too and my son had the sauce from it.  She was wondering the same why it was silky. I hope the chicken doesn&#39;t have any bacteria or anything because We do not want to get sick!  Please make sure to be aware when eating late lunch there.  It&#39;s nice but I wish they would not have rushed cooking.

We always get the xiao ping pork...we just love the sauce and veggies with the thinly sliced juicy pork pieces. Perfect with rice. 

The kkangpoong shrimp is a korean influenced chinese dish that is battered shrimp with a sweet and spicy sauce. I don&#39;t know what it is about it, but it&#39;s one of my favorite shrimp dishes of all time.

We tried the green beans but I think I&#39;ve had better green beans at other places. I&#39;ll just have to try the mixed veggies next time!

You really can&#39;t go wrong with a bowl of jja Jang myun. Those black noodles are the kind of comfort food that this korean American girl grew up eating. We didn&#39;t get the jjambbong today, but we&#39;ll have to get it next time. We already had too much food as it is anyway."

Service is slow if you dine-in. Takeout is better, and you can order online if you create an account on their website. I had the veggie chow mein - I liked the noodles, but way too oily. Large portions, but tossed the leftovers. The lunch special comes with a spring roll (which I liked) and a wonton (what is the point of this item?). My coworker had the moo shu beef, which he said was nothing special. It came with large flour tortillas, a strange cultural meshing.

I&#39;m always suspicious of any asian restaurant that tries to cover more than one cuisine - I&#39;m not sure why this place needs to serve chinese, korean, and now japanese food. Just pick one. Ok, maybe some non-asian people in the suburbs don&#39;t know better, but its hard to be good at so many different cuisines.

We ordered honey walnut shrimp, some beef dish, a tofu dish, and a pork belly dish - they all came out quickly and they were all decent and tasty. I&#39;d say this is a really decent americanized chinese restaurant and acceptable if you didn&#39;t want to drive to downtown."

I tried to order online, but their site was not working properly. So, I called in my order to a bumbling American woman who asked my my name at least four times - in a row. I should have gone with my gut at that moment.....
 
The food was not good at all. Ordered sesame chicken and crab rangoon. The chicken was so dry and over cooked it was actually crunchy and very much like jerky. The crab rangoon came with no dipping sauce and tasted of burned fryer oil. 

I called the store to let them know I was extremely disappointed and my call was met with a combative woman who wanted to argue &#34;woman to woman&#34; that &#34;they&#39;re the best in the area&#34; and that &#34;she ate that exact thing for lunch and it was to die for&#34;. Clearly we have different taste. 

The solution I was offered was, to call back on a Monday or Tuesday and get whatever I want. I wanted to eat my lunch. I ended up throwing the entire meal in the trash and going 12+ hours with nothing more to eat because I was at work. $23 for that &#34;food&#34; (including tip) in the bin. 

My office frequently orders out locally for meetings. When my manager asked why I threw away the entire lunch, I told them what happened, they said they will take Yu&#39;s off their list. Very unprofessional. 

It&#39;s impossible to find GOOD quality Chinese food in this area.  And yes, I expect and understand that Chinese food quickly declines from the moment they take it off the pan.  If you don&#39;t change the oil in your fryer, it doesn&#39;t matter how long ago you fried it - everything will taste nasty.

Oh, and if you want the &#34;free meal&#34; from Yu&#39;s, and you are in Rolling Meadows/Schaumburg area, let me know.  You can have it.  I won&#39;t eat there again even if the food was free.  The woman&#39;s disposition left a horrible taste in my mouth.  Worse than the taste of the &#34;food&#34; they put out.  But don&#39;t forget - you can only order that free meal on a Monday or Tuesday! (because refunds for poor quality should always come with crazy stipulations and rules, right?)"

Our total for everything was very nice to look at vs. The price of 8 for a buffet. It was a lot cheaper. 
Dishes are good price. I wouldn&#39;t order from a Chinese place. I would rather come here BC why wouldn&#39;t you not want to eat here! This place is amazing! The food is off the chain with chefs that has experience if 25-30 years! Plus they have a window where you can watch them cook and depending on the time the have a Lil show they put on and introduce each chefs from where they came from and how long of experience they have. Then, they come out and show you how they make their noodles from scratch! Its seriously jaw dropping. I was completely amazed. The food taste beyond wonderful. Its was super delicious."

The first time was for dinner and we had the noodle platter and the Honey glazed walnut shrimp.  Both were outstanding!  , We loved the food so much that today, when we were driving in that direction with our daughter and her husband we stopped here for lunch.  We were seated right away and greeted nicely by our server.  The only problem came up when we looked at the lunch menu that we were handed, not much in the vegetarian category.  While the kids are not really vegetarian but pescatarian there just weren&#39;t many options here.  The noodle platter that we had last time has meat in it.  I asked if we could order off the dinner menu.  Good news!  You can!  

The kids placed an order for the shrimp dumplings and the waitress was sure to tell us that it would take about 15 minutes for them to make them.  I really appreciate it when they you give a heads up like that!  I had a cup of the hot and sour soup which was average.  The shrimp dumplings though were worth the wait.

For our mains we had the vegetarian noodle platter, honey glazed walnut shrimp and the Szechwan eggplants.  We ordered the noodle platter medium spicy but I would have like it spicier.  Also, the regular noodle platter is better than the vegetarian one.  The honey glazed walnut shrimp were just as amazing as the first time.  I also really enjoyed the Szechwan eggplant.  Though the eggplants are fried it is such a light and crispy fry that it just make it great!"

I came here on a Friday night, and the restaurant had a few tables seated. I figured that I got lucky, as most of the reviews stated that Yu&#39;s gets very busy.  After looking at the menu, I decided to start with the crab rangoons and have the Mongolian Three Ingredients (chicken, steak, shrimp, and vegetables as an entree. While waiting for my food, I noticed the huge carafe of hot green tea. Unfortunately, the tea fell flat. It was lukewarm and tasted like plastic. But I didn&#39;t come for green tea, so I let it slide. The staff was very nice, quick with refills on my ice water and diet Coke, all with genuine smiles. 

My food arrived quickly, and it was great. The crab rangoons were huge, and with lots of cream cheese and crab filling. And the Three Ingredients had a nice amount of sauce, not too overpowering. 

My server was very polite. I usually write little thank you notes on the receipt along with a tip, but I usually leave before the server sees it. This time, as I was leaving, he came by, thanked me profusely for the tip, and read his note aloud: &#34;#1 server!&#34;  And he replied, with a smile, &#34;Yeah!  I&#39;m the top server here!&#34;  It really warmed my heart to make his night a little cheerier. 

Thanks, Yu&#39;s!  I will definitely be back!"

The interior is nice, clean and upscale. Plus you get to watch the cooks make your food if you&#39;re seated next to the kitchen windows.

My parents treated the extended family for... Halloween, I guess? Anyways, we split two appetizers and four dishes, and overall the experience was pretty good.

Potstickers - Allegedly fried, but... not as fried as they could be. Still, these were decent, with a good amount of filling and yummy accompaniments.

Crab Rangoon - Very crispy, unlike the potstickers. Still very little crab flavor. With that said, I like cream cheese more than I did when I was younger... so I didn&#39;t hate these. :-D

Sesame chicken - Crispy, and not too sweet. Sesame chicken isn&#39;t my go-to dish when it comes to chicken (and frankly, I don&#39;t know what is) but it wasn&#39;t gloppy or terribly sweet, so I approve.

Vegetarian noodle platter - My wife said this was garlicky, I called it bland. The noodles were cooked well, though, and it wasn&#39;t greasy. I think it had to do with the fact that this dish normally comes spicy, but was ordered not spicy. 

Sizzling beef - The sizzling of meat hitting the hot plate is always welcome in a Chinese restaurant, but the meat itself was excellent. I don&#39;t know where the sweetness came from, but it was a perfect blend of savory and sweet. This has to be the first time I&#39;ve ever wanted to order sizzling beef again.

Salt and pepper smelt - Finally, taken from the &#34;traditional Chinese&#34; part of the menu... smelt. The smelt was excellent. Salty, tender, small fish dipped in batter and fried to a crisp, served on top of bell peppers and vegetables. I try to order something unusual with every Chinese restaurant visit, and today I was not at all disappointed.

We were seated right next to the windows, where chefs waved at my daughter as she watched the cooks do their thing on 10,000+ BTU stovetops and with authentic woks. That was a nice touch, and is just one of the reasons I&#39;m looking forward to returning."

We had take out for hot &amp; sour soup (I was feeling something warm because it was a cold day...but the soup wasn&#39;t good at all...I can probably cook something better than this. Won&#39;t recommend), honey walnut shrimp (sooo good! Shrimp is bouncy! Loved it! This dish doesn&#39;t look that fancy but it tasted amazing!), Szechwan eggplant (was decent but too saucy...Chef Ping&#39;s better for this), and noodle platter (I personally liked it! Noodle was not overly cooked like many Chinese restaurants. And I liked that they added real scallop! This dish not spicy at all!). Yu&#39;s reminded me a lot like Chef Ping. Overall, I was satisfied with my orders and most likely will return and try some more if in town (and order their honey walnut shrimp again! yesss!)"

The host and servers are very friendly. I like that there is no secret menu...even though I am chinese, reading it is a different story! Someone said this was not a good place to benchmark chinese food but then goes on to say they ordered mongolian beef, sesame chicken, and pad thai...maybe 1 of those things is &#34;chinese&#34;. My family always gets stir fried pea pod tips, szechuan eggplant, chive/pork stir fry, or stir fry green beans. Taste is always consistently good. My parents also love the &#34;liang zhang pi&#34; which is this mustardy cold noodle salad with seafood and veggies. It&#39;s a giant platter and best shared with at least 4 people! 

Bathrooms here are pretty clean for a chinese restaurant. I wouldn&#39;t go unless I had to but I also won&#39;t hold it here! You know those places where you have to go but would rather challenge your bladder&#39;s strength than to step foot into their bathroom...!"

I made a reservation and when I arrived they told me I had to wait as they sat people before me with no reservations. Their front end dude was trying his best, but he was way over his head. Felt bad for that little dude. Our waitress also was rather pathetic. We never got silverware until we had to beg someone for it. Plus, she was kind of unpleasant. 

The food is the only thing that is carrying this place. It&#39;s obvious. The food is so good that it more than makes up for their terrible service. If their food wasn&#39;t that good, this place would easily have received 1 star at best. This is simply the greatest Chinese food I have ever had. It&#39;s not even close.

Yu&#39;s might have been a good restaurant a decade ago but it certainly is not any longer. The food here is very overrated. It&#39;s borderline mediocre and overpriced.  The meats they use especially their beef were pretty low grade and wretched tasting. 

The service leaves a lot to be desired. The customer service motto at Yu&#39;s is SERVE &amp; FORGET. 

Waiter was inattentive, forgot to set two plate settings, no water, no refills after receiving water, served (4) out of the (5) meals and had to be reminded multiple times that an entree was missing. The 5th entree arrived 15 minutes later with no reasoning or apology.

The dining space in and around our table was super dirty. Bottom line, save your money and your appetite for a place that appreciates your business and extends basic hospitality to it&#39;s diners."

I&#39;m a huge noodle freak and their noodle soup is something that I literally crave.  It&#39;s also huge, definitely enough to split with a friend. I get it non spicy because I tend not to like any heat. Their beef chow fun (I think that the menu describes it as beef with flat rice noodles) is also pretty good. 

Noodles aside, I have had their Happy Family (mixture of seafood with chicken and I think beef),  their salt and pepper squid, rainbow fried rice, and walnut shrimp.  Deep fried shrimp in a mayo sauce with candied walnuts and steamed broccoli (you know, because we have to at least pretend to be a tad bit healthy). 

Other cool things about Yu&#39;s include the cooks visible behind the glass, clean restrooms (for a Chinese restaurant), the ever entertaining noodle show on the weekends, and hostesses who are generally pleasant. My husband likes the zombie drink but I don&#39;t drink so can&#39;t really weigh in on that one. 

Cons: The service is not the best, especially from the female wait staff. My husband wanted to order a pork belly dish and the waitress told him no because that  for Chinese people. He was understandably upset.  I am half chinese (which is besides the point) and told her that we knew what it was.  She said fine but we couldn&#39;t send it back. Another time we brought friends and needed a few minutes. The waitress lost her smile and was no where to be seen for most of the meal. 

I would also stay away from most of the appetizers which are pretty standard deep fried stuff when you could pay a few dollars more for another entrée. Do not go on the weekend during dinner hours or be prepared to wait for awhile.  But during off hours when you&#39;re craving good Chinese food, don&#39;t mind hit or miss service,  and don&#39;t feel like driving into Chinatown, check this place out!"

They have an impressive array of beers on tap, as well. The bartender went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed, and I appreciated her hospitality.

Prices are comparable to what you would pay at Applebee&#39;s or a local pub. The most we have paid for dinner plus drinks and tip is around $60 for two adults. 

Check local circulars for coupons. Some will publish 10% off the bill coupons (including alcohol) that you can use.

They have a great tap selection and there were a good amount of tv&#39;s so I imagine this is a great place to be on game day.  But I have to admit the hostess (who was also our server) was interesting.  It&#39;s like she was going for a Tilted Kilt vibe.  I mean I&#39;m all for showing off the goods if you got them but I thought maybe she was taking it a bit over the line. I don&#39;t know, maybe she was getting really good tips and I should just shut up but I thought this place was a little more classy than that.

I went there for lunch, no beer there, but I got to see their craft beer menu and like Aimee M said, the &#34;craft beer&#34; list is pretty main stream.

The place is a very nice size. It&#39;s very cold though. Not inviting enough for me.

Onto lunch. We got pretzel sticks and they weren&#39;t that memorable. The appetizer portions were pretty small. 

Between three of us we got a wedge salad, Caesar salad with Portabella mushroom, and a Texas burger. I had the burger, it had more of a meatloaf taste than an actual burger taste. I tried the Caesar, average dressing taste but the croutons were buttery, fluffy goodness. The salads were fresh and crisp.

I know a few friends that have gone to Trivia night here and they love it. If anything I&#39;d go back for that and some beers. Otherwise, been there done that."

I was saddened to hear when Nova shut down it ended an Era/Decade of Addison nightlife. I am proud to have called it my bar at one point . American tap is a great replacement. It is a great sports bar amazing specials and lots of tvs. 

The food is delicious need I say more. They serve mainly pub fare But, it&#39;s so good I decided to give it it&#39;s own section. If you love a good burger this is the place for it. I have prety much ran through ever single item on the menue. No conplaints at all. TIP: I always order my meat medium well. 

I would say the price is fair just like any other bar in the area. THE SPECIALS are amazing they always have a way for you to get the most bang for your buck. They have a wide assortment of beers and liqueur you would have to be a hardcore alcoholic to get bored here... 

The owners are great with clients and all around swell guys. They really know how to keep this business going the right direction.Thanks for all the good work Mike &amp;Gus."
american-tap-pub-and-eatery-addison,Ericka A.,To0GTLW5MGZwOg5TxxZIQA,"Chicagoland, IL",1,1,1,1096,1149,3rS4HR0IJs1RAeRbPJRo-g,3.0,2013-09-11,"We come for decent beer pricing and stay for trivia. In all honestly, we mostly come for trivia. A good beer menu doesn&#39;t hurt, though. It spans two large pages of its own and has a couple categories - featured, on tap, bottles and cans. It has both domestic cheap beers and pricier craft options; however, they run specials. This makes the cheap beer even cheaper and the more expensive beer more affordable. For example, PBR pints were $2 and Goose Island&#39;s Sofie and Matilda are $7. That&#39;s about average. I think the most expensive beer is $9. I usually stick with pints of Angry Orchard Hard Cider for $5.50.

The trivia (Tuesdays 9pm) is a good time. It&#39;s hosted by Chicago Trivia Guys and American Tap gift certificates are the prize. I originally came to use up a couple vouchers my friend won the week before. We ended up taking 1st and walked away with more certificates. I just hosted an Unofficial Yelp Event there and our team got 2nd place and another set of certificates. So I guess I should say the prizes are really what keep us coming back.

Cigarette smoke seems to always make its way in from the patio and there was an odd, fishy smell last time (which is annoying), but it&#39;s also incredibly loud inside (which is obnoxious). That&#39;s not to say the customers are loud. It&#39;s just LOUD! The stereo is cranked up even when a few groups there to play trivia are the only customers. We asked our server if the music could be turned down because we were shouting over it and couldn&#39;t always hear the announcer. I don&#39;t think they ever adjusted the volume.

The servers can be hit or miss too. The first time we came we had a super peppy new girl. The second server that came to the table seemed a bit out of it. On our most recent visit we were served by Caroline (sp?) and she was great! Unfortunately, my friend told me she had stood by the bar before we joined her and was completely ignored by the staff behind the counter. In fact, one of the employees wasn&#39;t even behind the bar. She was sitting in a chair, chatting with other people and acted as if my fiancé was bothering her when he approached her and asked a question.

As far as food goes, I can&#39;t say as I agree with Yelp&#39;s label of &#34;Gastropub.&#34; There&#39;s really little to nothing high-end about the dishes. I found the Southwest Wrap to be very yummy but we didn&#39;t like the Mushroom Swiss Burger at all. The Pretzel Sticks are a nice snack but there&#39;s something odd about them. I like that they use black pepper but wish they&#39;d use the type of salt that normally comes on pretzels rather than table salt. I also found the Baked Mac &amp; Cheese with added Chicken and Bacon to be decent. We weren&#39;t very impressed with the Sampler Platter. I have a feeling food is an afterthought at this establishment."

This place just recently opened up not too long ago (used to be another bar), so we wanted to check it out.

When you first walk in, it feels like a younger (mid 20&#39;s-30&#39;s) bar with the taps on display on the wall (that was one of my favorite parts), a dart board, tons of seating, and plenty of TV&#39;s for your viewing pleasure. I felt like they are trying to make this into a Hooters/Tilted Kilt atmosphere with the cute waitresses and beer.

However...there was a slight...smell that none of us could put our finger on. It wasn&#39;t like food or a clean smell. But it was bothersome enough that we all said something. May be they cleaned with dirty mop water? I&#39;m not sure. It just wasn&#39;t pleasant. It was also pretty dead for being a Friday night. I was a little surprised.

Our waitress was very nice and attentive. She came by quite a few times. The guys ordered nachos before we got there and said they were very good, but I didn&#39;t try them so I couldn&#39;t tell ya. I think overall their beer is overpriced, especially since many of their beers aren&#39;t unique (Miller, Dos Equis, Etc.). 

Overall I just wasn&#39;t feeling it. I think there are a few other places I would try/go to before I came back here."

It&#39;s got TV&#39;s and typical bar food. It&#39;s roomy and has patio seating that faces Lake street.  Nothing really sets this apart from other sports bars available in the area. So it&#39;s definitely A-OK.

I did have a lot of fun on Trivia Tuesday, and much of that is due to my team/friends and  the wonderful host (Dan? I know he hosts Trivia nights at other locations). So as of today, Trivia Tuesdays at 8pm for the next month at least. 

The food menu runs from appetizers like wings and potato skins to mains like burgers, tacos, salads. My bacon cheeseburger was quite large and I could barely finish half, but it was good. I asked for a side of cheese for my fries as I&#39;m a huge &#34;on the side&#34; person. Alas, the fries came DRENCHED in cheese sauce.  Now the 20 year old me would eat these without a care in the world. But the current me,well, had to reconsider, but did eat some and had my own side of guilt to add to it. I usually bring things like this up to the server, but it was trivia night and I was focused on the task at hand: Winning!

The beer selection is nice. They do have a lot of domestic brands. Their craft beer list is nice too, but mostly stuff I call &#34;mainstream craft&#34;.  Bigger names that are pretty much in every bar or restaurant in the Chicago area that say they serve craft beers. (Three Floyds, Allagash, Two Brothers, Delerium Tremens for example).  Our server really couldn&#39;t answer my questions about some of the beers I had never tried before, but she was still very sweet and offered to ask the bartender or manager for me. 

There were probably about 20-25 people that night in the bar area while some customers were seated on the patio. So the place seemed really roomy and open. I can&#39;t comment about the numbers on weekends. But for now, Trivia Tuesdays might make me return."

That said, my impression of the food was that its typical bar food- 3 stars. The popper burger was nothing special, except that it had a jalapeno popper on it.

It&#39;s obvious that they are committed to showcasing craft brews as witnessed by the cool beers they serve.

Not many people were present while we there and service was a little slow.  The friendly gentleman who seated us told us that they were offering a $1 sliders special.  My wife and I figured we would try one a piece.  &#34;Could we have two sliders please?&#34;  
A half hour later the server brings out two large plates with 3 sliders on each plate.  She placed the order for two slider APPETIZER plates.  The friendly gentleman immediately saw the problem and said that it would be corrected.

Hot on the heels of our sliders, came the entrees - a little too fast considering we were still on the appetizer.  Oh well.  I had the steak tacos.  The seasoning was very good and I enjoyed the salsa and puffy, homemade chips.  The steak was a little chewy.  My wife ordered the veggie sandwich which she really enjoyed but the fries were less than lukewarm temperature.

One of the owners, Mike, came over and introduced himself and asked how the food was.  I decided to be honest and upfront with him and he was appreciative that I gave him input.

We received the bill and lo and behold were charged the full price for the sliders instead of just a buck a piece.  We just laughed.  In fairness, she realized the error and came back a couple of minutes later and said that she forgot to make the adjustment.  OK, no harm - no foul.

We&#39;ll definitely be back.  I really like the laid back atmosphere and although they have dozens of TVs the volume was turned down so that you could relax to a nice music track they had playing.  I like their menu and figure that their execution will improve over time  

Considering that they have only been open a couple of months, I&#39;m sure they will have all the kinks worked out in due order."

My buddy and I are both servers so we tend to have higher standards for service but also tip accordingly. Rocky was ON POINT! She was fast, very efficient and super friendly. I never saw the bottom of my glass. She knew the menu very well. 

Decor wise it&#39;s got a chill modern feel to it. All wood walls (sounds weird I know but they made it look classy Similar to a Millers Ale House). They have mainly high tops with some booths around the perimeter and it looked like they have a separate room for private parties. High tops range from 2-6 tops, booths are 6-8 tops, they also have pretty decently sized bar seating maybe 10-20 people give or take.

Prices were reasonable but not outrageous. Good craft beer selection and great beers on tap. They also offer a &#34;take your favorite beer with you&#34; which I can only see this being beneficial if it&#39;s closing time and liquor stores are closed. Domestic 6 pack is $12, that was a tad ridiculous. 

Otherwise, this place is great! We will definitely be back! I highly recommend this place, make sure you ask for Rocky!!

One more thing, this is a place for the craft beer enthusiast. Similar to other pubs, this is not a place for finer liqueurs (whiskey, scotch, bourbon, tequila etc). They have a couple options of those but nothing to write home about."

Other than that, the place was far less than stellar, unfortunately. The bathroom had a terrible smell that made me gag. I think there is a sewer/plumbing issue that needs to be addressed. 

My friend had steak tacos, which she said had good flavor, but the steak itself was mostly gristle. I had a grilled cheese sandwich, and the cheese wasn&#39;t even melted. I think the bread was too thick, honestly.

Then there was the regular (I&#39;m assuming he was a regular. He seemed awfully familiar with the servers) sitting near us. He was crass and vulgar and was talking loudly about the &#34;white stuff&#34; he was doing the night before with &#34;some b tch&#34; he met there.

The beer selection is vast and rather impressive. They have the 20% ABV Not Your Father&#39;s Root beer for $8 as well as 2014 BCBS by Goose Island for $11 (a bit steep in my opinion).

This is the not so politically correct term my buddies and I used in college for a lady who looked great from a distance, but when you got a little closer... Not so much ( for the record I was a beauty from no less than a mile and a half).

That would be an accurate description for the this Ale House,100 yard beauty.  Decor looks amazing, craft beer list is on point and upon entering it has that modern craft beer vibe with a nod to sports that I look for and usually enjoy (wooden tables, open exposed ceiling, leather booths, lots of taps, TV&#39;s on display).

When you sit down you see the place is not clean.  The kind of not clean where your arms stick to the table, you have to sweep away debris from the previous sandwich and has a bathroom that looks like it has survived one too many bar fights.

The menu, well it is plastic, has pictures ( in case you don&#39;t know what a hamburger, salad or Philly cheese steak looks like) and has items more closely associated with an Applebee&#39;s than a craft beer bar.  Get a little creative, have some fun.  Bring on the pork belly, duck wings, flatbreads, charcuterie or a burger that will knock your socks off. Upscale pub food with a creative twist is what one thinks of when you see their marketing.

The service was friendly, but long delays between drinks.  When my second beer arrived I was told, &#34; we only have one bartender today&#34;.  Not surprising since there were only about 10 patrons, but I digress..

This place has the look but overall the blemishes take away from what would be a good craft beer bar experience.  

I will go back, with significantly lowered expectations, and enjoy a game or two because the TV&#39;s, booths and beer list are all great.... It is after all a sports bar with a good beer list."

The food is TERRIBLE.  Clearly everything here is from a bag, box or microwave tray.  I&#39;ve had wings that were miserable, a salad that was sad looking, and calamari that should have been left to die in the ocean.  

I&#39;d drink here, but I will not eat here EVER again.

They also don&#39;t seem to understand that Sundays in the fall and winter is NFL season.  We had to beg them to change the main TVs from tractor pulls and racing to big games of the week.

Edit:  I appreciate the response from Tom, who identified himself as the owner.  However, my question is this, in response to your comments

1)  How did the guy in the The Game wrestling shirt go into the back offices at least three times while we were there, and turn the volume up on the stereo, if he was not an employee?  If i owned the business, i would check into that if i were you.  Again, thank you for the response.  As a Wood Dale local, i prefer to frequent and support local businesses."

The cheese on the bloody Mary garnish was hard and old.  They did not have celery salt for the rim of the glass - this is something standard that every bar would have.

My friend ordered one of their draft beers and there were suspicious particles floating in the drink that looked like pepper.

The women&#39;s bathroom was clean,however, it smelled HORRIBLE!  It had a musty/sewer smell and we were referring to it as the &#34;outhouse&#34;.

Service has always been a little rough when it&#39;s busy which is understandable when you see the girls running around like crazy.  Except they make sure all of the owners &#34;boys&#34; are taken care of first.  At first I liked the place but for only one reason, UFC pay per views.  Im a huge fan and many bars don&#39;t show them.  Anyway, it&#39;s pretty much become a meathead hangout now.  Fist-pumps, the whole deal.  If that&#39;s your scene, than you&#39;ll love it.  Last time there the owner and some of the other guys were literally comparing biceps.  It was as hilarious as it sounds.  The place is pretty clean.  Lots of seats.  Tons of Tvs.  The outdoor patio is bigger than most too.  Food is average at best with very high prices.  Beers on tap get a star, the cute staff gets a star and the jersey shore like comedy gets a star.  Not a bad place just not my scene"

I enjoyed the decor and style of the bar with it&#39;s twist on something between a sports bar that serves craft ipa&#39;s at the same time.  It wasn&#39;t too loud and felt just right.  The servers seemed new and training, although my service was not terrible the bartenders and waitresses seemed more intrested in flirting with the guys at the bar then actually doing their work. 

My second visit was a disaster and we walked out.  It was on a Tuesday night, the place was not a full house with a bunch of scattered empty tables.  There were plenty of servers to handle the patrons that were there.  The host, who I assumed was the owner, just told us to grab a table anywhere.  We were not approached by a server for a solid 10 minutes.  When she did finally come to our table she struggled in remembering what beer we wanted and had to come back a few times to check what our order was.  We patiently waited for our beer to arrive, figuring that normally you get your beer served right away; it never came.  I observed the waitress talking to some guys standing at the bar and floating around.  I also overheard the table next to us complaining that the food they waited for came out wrong and incorrect.  After 15 minutes sitting at a table with no beverages in hand or any attempt to get our order, we left. On the way out, I advised the owner he needs to get better service or a better server and the owner simply reply &#34;sorry bud.  have a good night&#34;.  I was shocked.  If I was the owner, I would have made sure my customer was not leaving out the door, apologize, get him to sit back down and get his order in right away and possibly even give him a beverage on the house.  Customer service and how you treat your patrons goes a long way.   Not sure if I will make another attempt to come back here.  I would be cautious"

Soups were OK and Nacho Platter had no depth . . that means that the goodies were only on the top and not layered in as big Nacho platters should be, and there was not enough to have a little with all the chips on the plate. Make sure you ask for plenty if you order it . . it is tasty.

Everything looked like it had a greasy film on it or hadn&#39;t been wiped down.  When I brought it to the manager&#39;s attention, he just stared at me.  I asked him to please report it to the head of maintenance or hiring, whomever was responsible for ensuring the restaurant is thoroughly cleaned each day and again, he just stared at me.  When I asked him again, he hesitated, then said he&#39;d clean it up, which is not the point I was making!

Since today is Wensday they have this promotion going where you can get endless snow crabs or endless varieties of shrimp. I went with a group of people everyone else got the snow crabs and i got the shrimp. I kind of regretted it right away... i found myself getting really full really fast not even half way through the first plate and I CAN eat. The shrimp really didn&#39;t convince me it was as if they were missing something flavor wise. I tried the two different sauces that accompanied the plate but one was too sweet the other too plain didn&#39;t really see the purpose for these. 
Drink wise, I ordered a virgin pina colada and it was a little on the sweer side for my taste. I also tried there bloody mary and that was absolutely awful. To me it just tasted like watered down tomato juice without alcohol.
 Aside from this, everyone ordered the different varieties of snow crabs I got the chance to try everything. I definitely recommend the cajin style snow crabs those were absolutely amazing! Alot better than I expected. (Even better when dipped in butter). If i were to go back this is definitely what I would order.
As for the service of the restaurant, our waitress I believe was avoiding our table at some points. I say this because we sat litterly near the kitchen hallway where all the food comes out and she&#39;d constantly pass by and not even address us if we needed anything after we were clearly done with our food waiting to be refilled. There was another instance where one of my drinks and my friends corn on the cob didnt even come until I had to remind her. 
To conclude, besides the little downfalls I can oversee that because those cajin snow crabs were really good. I recommend coming here with an empty stomach and a nice wad of cash."

I&#39;m not a seafood person, but found several options. We were given a free appetizer, chose the voodoo chicken bites (with fries) (hubs thought they were amazing, I thought they tasted fishy, but it&#39;s because they used old bay), I had the chicken club with onion strings (didn&#39;t even taste, onion strings were fantastic and long, although extremely greasy), hubs had the Arctic bay steam pot (he said it was good, had a good variety, lacked seasoning, lobster was a bit overcooked, satisfied the seafood craving) and the crabby Apple crisp thing (amazing, came with vanilla ice cream, cinnamon explosion! So good!). They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer for our next visit. Overall, it was good, not phenomenal. May come back. Nicole, our server, was attentive and prompt."

To me this has been the better crab bucket or cajun crab we&#39;ve had in the past decade.

I was advised to make reservations because this place gets super busy.  I did, but when we got there it was not busy at all.  Go figure.  We were seated right away, and the menus were provided with glasses of water.  That was the best it would be.

Service got really slow.  Still, we tried to not let it get to us because we just wanted to have a good time on our date nite, which has been difficult to do of late due to our conflicting schedules.  I changed my mind and wanted to add, have, a coke.  Had to call the wait over, then took awhile to come.

We love crab but wanted to have a variety of seafood to eat.  Based on that we ordered.

KJ Steampot 
I would have like to get King crab but this offered a better seafood variety.  Along with the crab came mussels and scallops.  This was drenched in a garlic wine sauce.  That was the other reason.  Once I see &#34;garlic&#34; I get focused on it. I will not order everything with garlic but I will give it some serious thought.  This steampot was the way to go for us.  M ate alot, so did I and we fought who would eat the last bites bc we were both full.  It was delicious.  Easy to eat, not too hard to get the shell off into that sweet meat.  Many times I got the meat out in one whole big chunk, and gave that to M to eat who hasn&#39;t eaten as much crab as I have in my life.  Just trying to balance the scales.  Good thing this steampot is more than enough for two, and was very delicious to eat.

Over all service was okay.  It was hard to call the server too bc she was somewhere we couldn&#39;t easily find. Didn&#39;t have to wait too long she was checking in on us but would&#39;ve been better if she was more available to customers.  There was another couple in the booth next to us. I noticed they were getting a little frustrated waiting have their bill taken care of.  But, the food was good."

JCS is pretty standard in terms of seafood offering. Again, for a chain restaurant I guess it is good. I had the blackened red fish which comes with rice. It was a hefty portion for lunch and a pretty dollar. 

JCS has a ship like interior theme to go with the whole seafood atmosphere. There is a community jar of silverware as well as paper towel roll for when you get down and dirty."

At Red Lobster you get simple crab legs or lobster. I can get that at the grocery store. Here you get a bucket or steam pot of both in seasoning that is so good. I can&#39;t recommend one because I haven&#39;t tried them all. Both times I&#39;ve been here the crab tasted great.

They had a painting class going on when we got here. That&#39;s not something I would normally think was cool but my girlfriend thought it might be a lot of fun and on second thought it is kind of cool. It looked kind of Bob Ross style.

We brought our baby with and the person at the door, without any hesitation, came up and held the door for us. That was so nice! I wouldn&#39;t have been offended if he didn&#39;t but it was really nice. 

It was night Friday when we went to this location, maybe 745 or 8. After the painting class the place kind of cleared out. Maybe every other table was empty.

Really liked the crab cake. The bacon stuffed shrimp was ok. Too much going on in that one too get a good taste of all the flavors. My daughter had the salmon and that was well cooked and very tasty.

I ended up ordering the blackened mahi tacos and a bowl of clam chowder. The clam chowder was a yellow brothy liquid. It wasn&#39;t creamy like clam chowder should be. The tacos were ok. 

The most shocking part was when it came to paying the bill and there was no line to add a tip. We put a cash tip on the table. Then I get home and read the reviews to see if anyone else had a bad experience and I read that tips are included in the price of the food so in other words we double tipped.

Nikki has the best customer service I can tell she enjoys the customers, she kept my glad full and the refills of crab kept coming (I had to tell her n that&#39;s enough) she took great care of us and I wouldn&#39;t go to any other joes as long as nikki is here and the service continues to be so great."

I was in the mood for a really good seafood meal and I automatically thought of Joe&#39;s. The chowder was good but my steampot only &#34;so so&#34;. I ordered the garlic &amp; herb seasoning and I got a pot of sliced garlic. I love garlic but that was ridiculous. It looked more like a little seafood with my garlic. My son gave me a a lobster claw from his pot, which I saved till last and wish I hadn&#39;t it. When I bit into the meat, it was awful - kind of like biting into an old rubber band. I usually love the food here but this was a disappointment. I almost wish I&#39;d driven 10 more minutes down the road to their competitor. Not sure when or even if I&#39;ll be back."

The hostess was talking to her co worker by the bar and was not paying attention. Luckily our server was much more attentive. I do think the prices are a little high for what you get. My husband and I both got steam pots and the food was good. When it came time to pay and I saw no second receipt for tip and I asked my server about this, he stated, &#34; we do not accept tips here&#34; I&#39;m glad I asked because I believe they include in the prices for the food, so I would&#39;ve tipped twice!"

Let me start by saying that the place looks like it has been semi-renovated. The staff is nice. Everything else is trash. 
We had a party of ten and most left with one symptom or another. I think I had the worst. 
Food to me was gross. I didn&#39;t eat most of it. I gladly passed it on to my spouse. I ordered the king crab broil. Potatoes were soggy and gross. Corn on the cob looked like baby corn. I didn&#39;t even attempt to eat the sausage, macaroni salad, or coleslaw. Hushpuppies were over fried. I shared the legs. I hardly ate and was still able to walk away with a tummy ache.

We sent a platter back because it was cold and seemed to be sitting. My steam pot was good, but very greasy...not buttery...greasy.

Came here on a Saturday night for a nice sweetest day dinner, to my surprise the place wasn&#39;t OVERLY packed but they did have a full house, we waited approximately 15 to 20 mins top to be seated.  The decor and ambiance is very fitting to the restaurant and it&#39;s nautical theme I  LOVED it felt like I was in a ship :) ... Corny I know lol ;) ..... We most DEF worked up a large appetite, once we were seated it was so hard to choose what we wanted because everything sounded great! 

So being as that it was a new place for both us, we very much enjoy trying a little bit of everything you can say... so brace yourself lol.....

Appetizer : We got the Classic Sampler that had &#34;Crazy-good crab dip, great balls of fire and crispy calamari&#34; -straight from the menu. I must SAY that I didn&#39;t know what I loved more about this sampler if it was the dip or the surprisingly good great balls of fire ( jalapeno poppers with crab I think in them ).   Both were extremely good!! I LOVED it all.. and for being fried it wasn&#39;t overly greasy. 

We had one of their Share Steampot: The Bean Town Bake, which basically had  2 whole lobsters, Clams, shrimp and a sausage link with potatoes and corn on the cob.  SWEEEEET MOTHER OF GOD everything and I do mean everything in this steam pot was absolutely delicious!!!  the corn on the cob was just so damn good had some type of seasoning on it that was just a heaven to devour lol. I had a difficult time I won&#39;t lie since I am not a seafood eating guru yet lol but the adventure was fun lol . 

we also order a king crab because well we had to see what their crab shack is all about!! EVERYTHING tasted extremely fresh I might add

Our waiter was very friendly and the experience was great especially when you get to chuck the pieces of shell into a bucket!!  I def can&#39;t wait to come back and give this place another go It  was worth EVERY penny!!  Good food, good company, GREAT experience!"

I feel that the service has been getting worse and worse as time passes! This last time our waiter was so inattentive that we never got our appetizers or drinks! We ordered those first as we wanted to get a treat before our steam pots and we actually got our steam pots before anything else! We had to let them know we were missing our appetizers and drinks. Even then it took a good while for us to receive them and all the while our steam pots were sitting there getting cold! It sucked!!! The drinks were watered down and I felt like there was no liquor in them. I have been there often and know what they are supposed to taste like so I was disappointed when I got this drink.

The wait staff did make it better, so I bumped it up to 3 stars, but the deal is totally deceptive and the picture large beer battered shrimp as they describe, but they are really popcorn shrimp.

We arrived at 11:30 AM on a Friday to beat the lunch rush. As it turns out, there was no rush at all; the ample dining room remained fairly empty for the 90 minutes we were there. 

The food, when it arrived, was outstanding.  My wife and I both had the coconut shrimp.  The serving size was generous. The meal came with cole slaw - very tasty- hush puppies - best I ever had - and French fries - the only disappointing element. 

It did take a while for the food to be delivered to the table.  With no prior visits to compare I can&#39;t say if this is typical or an anomaly. Considering each dish is freshly prepared, maybe this should be expected. As we were in no hurry this was not an issue.  And maybe it explains the few lunchtime customers. 

We will return again. I really want to see what they do with the crab!"

Now I know that this isn&#39;t a high end restaurant. But I ordered the lobster daddy feast. The crab was delicious but the lobster was a different story.

So needless to say I was very excited when I returned for the first time in many years. The experience was disappointing to say the least. The service was the worst I&#39;ve experienced anywhere and anytime in my life. The waitress took over 20 minutes to get the our table to even acknowledge us, keep in mind it was not busy whatsoever, there were only 3 tables with customers in the entire restaurant. She spent a solid 25 minutes talking at one of the tables to another group, legitimately sitting down with them to talk. When we finally were able to put our order in, we ordered the appetizer plate as well as entrees, the appetizer came out SECONDS before our meals. Being familiar with the food industry I know this is because the waitress was lazy and put in the orders at the same time when she was supposed to stagger them. The food was decent at best and in the 1 hour and 20 minutes it took for this ordeal to end, we got 1 refill of our drinks. Damn good thing it&#39;s a no-tipping location because there wouldn&#39;t have been a tip anyways with the service we received. I suggest avoiding it at all costs.

I thought it was just a Miami thing, but after attending a bridal expo in Schamburg, one of my friends suggested lunch at the nearby Joe&#39;s Crab Shack.  I was pretty disappointed when we walked inside, and it had a really cheesy, touristy Buba Gump&#39;s feel to it.

We started off with the clam strips, which were not that good, I would not get them again.  I shared a steam pot with two of my friends.  I will say that it was more than enough food.  We stuffed our faces and then some, but it was like the pot was bottomless because there were still more crabs, sausage, and potatoes.  I also tried some of my friend&#39;s crawfish, which was pretty good.

The food was great, but I like more a local feel when I go to restaurants.  I also wish I would have had enough room to try the key lime pie because I have heard it&#39;s pretty awesome.  Oh well, maybe next time."

As we were walking through the I read &#34;this is a no tipping establishment,&#34; I had never heard of it so I brushed it off and walked in.  We only waited for about 25 minutes which wasn&#39;t too bad considering the line. Now let me start by saying my problem wasn&#39;t with the food.  We had the classic sampler, it includes calamari, crab dip, and what they call &#34;great balls of fire (crab stuffed with jalapeno and cream cheese).&#34;  I dined on the Go Shrimpin platter and that included jumbo fried shrimp, coconut shrimp, and shrimp stuffed with crab, cream cheese, and jalapeno. All of it very tasty. The other person I was with had this enormous platter called Reel Big Catch, that came with coconut shrimp, stuffed shrimp, crispy fish fillets, and beer battered chicken tenders. That looked good as well and they seemed to be pleased with it.  Our waiter was personable and on point and just all around provided a good experience for us since neither of us had ever been there. Now onto what I did not appreciate about the restaurant, I asked the waiter about the &#34;no tipping establishment&#34; they explained that the restaurant just established this policy and they are giving it a try. I think this is the most ridiculous policy for a restaurant who employs people who depend on tips.  Yes I understand that they are &#34;supplementing&#34; tips lost with an hourly wage however that is not what these servers signed up for.  Coming from a family of servers I couldn&#39;t imagine going to their places of business and not leaving a tip whether they get paid hourly or not. My first job was as a waitress and I depended on my tips to live, I am no longer a waitress because it takes a special kind of person to deal with people&#39;s crap on a daily basis.  The point is that the food prices get jacked up so they can pay an hourly wage and the tips that these people relied on are taken away and then they get taxed on their hourly wage.  If a person receives good service then the server should be tipped point blank. Tipping also ensures good service, servers work for tips so most of them put their best foot forward to ensure that a decent tip is received. It makes me sad to think that restaurants such as Joe&#39;s are implementing this policy and I would hope that they reconsider. In my opinion if it is so difficult to tip for services provided to you or you can&#39;t afford to tip then you shouldn&#39;t go out expecting to be served. What is wrong with society these days that &#34;no tipping establishments&#34; even exist."

For an appetizer, I had the New England Clam Chowder soup which was &#34;okay&#34;. It seemed a bit thin and not very creamy. It was lacking a bit in flavor and &#39;savoriness&#39;. 

For my meal I ordered a steampot (about $26) which included snow crab, mussels, and scallops; as well as corn on the cob and red skinned potatoes (halved). The Scallops appeared to have been cooked on a grill and tasted burnt (there were areas on the scallops that were very blackened). They were also a little overcooked, as they were mildly chewy. They were about the size of a quarter in diameter. The majority of the mussels in the steampot were not even opened, so either they were dead before they were cooked, or they were not cooked long enough to open. Only about 3 of the mussels were opened and able to be eaten. I had the others sent back, and they (eventually) brought me out replacements which were not even in their broth (1 of those &#34;replacement&#34; mussels was also not opened). This tells me that the quality of the food needs to be monitored more closely before it is sent out of the kitchen. Anyway- the mussels had pretty much no flavor. The alleged white wine sauce/broth that they were steamed in was almost flavorless (borderline gross) and tasted like a plain chicken stock or vegetable stock with no seasoning. I was extremely disappointed by this. What makes mussels so delicious is the delicious, flavor broth/sauce that they are cooked in! The crabs were okay, although they also seemed a bit overcooked, as they too, had a borderline rubberiness to some parts of the meat. The potatoes were not cooked through. They were still about half way raw. The corn was probably the most perfectly cooked thing in that damn pot! For the price that they charge for their food, they definitely need to step up their game. 

Overall, this was a very disappointing experience for a seafood lover."

It was a bit messy eating, but pretty good. And, while I understand that seafood is expensive, I felt it was a bit TOO expensive for what I got. If I&#39;m going to pay $30+ I want to be STUFFED and crab legs always leave me hungry and slightly frustrated.

The staff is really friendly and enthusiastic...perhaps a little TOO enthusiastic. It almost seemed to me that they were forcing themselves to seem like they were ecstatic about working there. At one point, they played &#34;Car Wash&#34; and lined up to dance it out. Which was entertaining, but a little strange and interruptive. 

Again, not a terrible experience, but not necessarily somewhere I&#39;ll be returning."

Im disappointed in the service and outcome of our order. We order the pot with 2 types of crab. Per our waiter, snow and queen crab are not the same. Well I didn&#39;t see the difference. I tell you the the crab were either premature or anorexic. Almost no meat in them. Then we would ask our waiter for information and he was NOT knowledgable. And lastly, if you are looking for a seafood Red Lobster is better. Not worth my $80 spent....:("

We figured they&#39;d be extremely busy so I called ahead to make a reservation. They said they could only take reservations after 7:30 PM because they were too busy, but to feel free to call a half hour before we arrived and we&#39;d get on the seating list. I was a bit disappointed, but we got there and were second on the list, which meant about a ten minute wait. This was a nice surprise seeing how busy they were.
 The server was very good in my opinion. She took our orders promptly and checked back with us several times throughout the meal.
   The food was a bit pricy for the amount served, but very good nonetheless. It&#39;s hard to screw up king crab legs right? The mussels were very good and so was the Mac and cheese my son had. 
   The dessert was delicious. We had the peach cobbler and the key lime pie. The portions were huge and the cobbler was warm with ice cream on top. 
    Overall, a descent place with a fun atmosphere. The servers danced and sang happy birthday after announcing fun facts about the birthday person, such as &#34;was voted the swimsuit model of the year last year, she&#39;ll show us some poses while we sing&#34;."
joes-crab-shack-schaumburg,Jeff C.,WEGWG2ahF1ScyhbrtsIC2Q,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,82,3,pczTla9XmygGKCc1qng5Mw,1.0,2014-06-02,"I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s called &#34;Joes&#39;s crab shack&#34;, it should be renamed as &#34;Joe&#39;s shack&#34; as the crab served to me was MISSING MORE THAN HALF its portion. 

I just couldn&#39;t help thinking how falsely advertised the proportion was when served, its funny i mention this because the table behind me also had a complaint on menu to portion serving size. It&#39;s like when you see commercials of a big mac versus when you actually get the sandwich it looks like someone stepped on it and served it to you, what a deal for $27.49! 

I ordered the Great Barrier Steampot, as it looked highly appetizing in the menu pictures. The pictures in the menu show 5 legs BUT i only received 2 legs. There was also about 12-15 mussels, one of which was still closed indicating that it is not fully cooked.10 baby clams with meat no larger than a penny in size, 3 red potatoes, 1 corn for $27.49. Out all these steampot items, I think the CORN tasted the best. 

Lets discuss service: my water wasn&#39;t refilled during my 1.5hr stay even after asking still wasn&#39;t refilled, I was just so thirsty and when I would look around to see if I could find my waiter, and when i spotted him, he was dancing in the center with the other waiters/waitresses. I would have expected this establishment would minimize the theatrics and put service first. Utensils came out long after the appetizer had cooled on the table as i had to remind my server again. 

In short:  if you are on a seafood diet and wishing to pay a high price,  prefer staff to dance over your service needs, and have any interests in suicidal dehydration then this is the place for you. 

I don&#39;t want to write anymore of this establishment as it is a waste of my time and an endanger to my health."

I ordered malibu grilled shrimp, one of the lowest calorie items on the menu. My husband ordered Maui mahi. Both of us enjoyed our food. Some of our friends were less satisfied. Also it took about 1/2 hour just to get our drinks (sodas) and/or soup. Then another 15 minutes to take our order. Altogether we waited over an hour to order and get our appetizers. Too many items on the menu are very high in calories/fat, etc. Probably this is because most items are either fried or have a lot of butter. Not enough healthy choices.

Me and 2 other people walked into Joe&#39;s Crab Shack today and we literally looked like the only people in the building (maybe 2-3 other tables). The atmosphere was also not great and was kind of creepy or just dead. This should have been the first sign for us to leave, but no we decided to give it a try seeing as we have never been there before. 

We sit down and order the appetizer sampler and also ordered some popcorn shrimp appetizer and to be honest, nothing was good. The crab dip was just blah with a bunch of nasty clumpy cheese on top, the calamari was bland and boring, and the balls of fire were SOMEWHAT okay (I was the only one that liked them). The popcorn shrimp also had no flavor and I felt like I was chewing on rubber. On top of that they put the sauces in tiny disposable cups and it just looked cheap and dirty.  

Then we get our entrees, which were the snow crab bucket, cedar roasted salmon and the go shrimpin platter. I had the salmon and it was just dry, bland, and anyone on this planet could tell it was clearly frozen and not fresh at all. If you are at a seafood restaurant don&#39;t you think you would get something fresh or at least that tastes good?!? The other entrees were also nothing special, and later on all three of us are feeling a little sick. 

We didn&#39;t say anything to the waitress because, being a server myself, I know she doesn&#39;t cook the food and it&#39;s not her fault. So in the end, we ended up paying 80 something dollars for a meal we did not enjoy and we are all feeling the repercussions of this food. I&#39;m seriously questioning if they have been visited by the health department because I am sure there is no way they could have passed inspection. If you just look around you can see the dirt and dust everywhere, can you imagine the kitchen? I have seen other reviews on here also stating that they ended up sick after eating here. 

There were no managers in sign whatsoever. This was my first and last time ever eating at Joe&#39;s Crab Shack. So basically don&#39;t eat here if you don&#39;t want food poisoning! If you do then go ahead."

There&#39;s inadequate parking.  There&#39;s no good waiting area if the weather is too cold to sit outside.  Poor patrons who are already seated but happen to be near the entry will have people hovering over them while they wait, whether they mean to hover or not. And don&#39;t hope to shop for a &#34;Got Crabs?&#34; tee while there is a huge wait in the entry area because you won&#39;t be able to reach the merchandise.  We parked across the street.  We did not look at the tees because we couldn&#39;t get to them.

Beyond that...

The food is good.  It&#39;s not stellar, but it&#39;s good.  And it&#39;s cheaper than its counterparts overall.  Where else will you get crab legs or lobster at this price?

It&#39;s kitschy. The decor is entertaining.  It&#39;s fun to watch the staff dance and announce birthdays.  We all had a good time.  It&#39;s hardly high-end seafood, but the price is right overall, and the decor keeps you occupied. 

It&#39;s VERY loud.  It was hard to hear the people at my table... even when I asked them to repeat themselves.

We asked about a military discount.  We were told that we MIGHT get one... one manager gives discounts, the other does not.  Hummmm... Too bad it&#39;s not a policy they can just fix... but we did get a free appetizer because we asked about the discount.

Easy walk from the Hyatt.  Lots of other dining options to choose from, but if you want shellfish at a moderate-to-low price, I say go for it."

Made it out alive from the zoo known as IKEA and needed a celebratory drink  for my escape

They still have the cheesy birthday singing and dancing here as well as the crab/Joe t-shirts. They have definitely added more stuff to the menu since I was last there, circa 2005.
I went with the Sam Adams Steampot which inlcludes Snow Crab legs, lobster claws, corn on the cob, andouille sausage and oysters. A great dish, I must say. We also got the coconut shrimp which is always good.

Our server was very helpful as he let me know there was a Blue Moon special for $3.99 (hit the spot). For dessert, I went with the gigantic root beer float. Good stuff! Thank you Joe for being there when I needed you"

Def.  A sub-genre of science fiction/fantasy that includes social or technological aspects of the 19th century, such as steam-powered machinery, along with a deconstructing or reimagining of said era.

Oh wait.....that&#39;s steampunk.  

I meant steampot.

Def.  A delicious way to look like a pig eating out of the vessel your meal was cooked in.  How often do you get to do this without having people heckle you?

Now, it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve eaten at Joe&#39;s Crab Shack, and this was our first visit to this particular Joe&#39;s. Looking over some of the past reviews of this place caused slight trepidation on my part in dining here, however, the full dining room and 5 minute wait for a table made me feel like maybe it would be okay.

After a wait made short by browsing all the kitschy wares and souvenir stuff, we were seated in the middle of the dining room, which made for prime seating for the shenanigans led by the waitstaff every 15-30 minutes or so...It was pretty fun watching them try to get the birthday celebrants to either eat their dessert without using their hands or have to get up and do a birthday dance.

We were pretty hungry when we got here so we opted for the Classic Sampler, which included Fried Calamari, Crab Dip and Great Balls of Fire.  Calamari was crispy and not rubbery, Crab Dip could have used a bit more crab and less cheese, and the Great Balls of Fire weren&#39;t as spicy as I thought they would be, but everything was good.  We smashed our way through this app and then it was(wait for it)

STEAMPOT TIME!  

Mel got the Santolla steampot - a mixture of King crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, smoked sausage seasoned with garlic wine sauce and Old Bay.  Mel didn&#39;t want the sausage, so our server offered her more mussels and clams instead of sausage.  Score!  Also in the pot were potatoes and corn, and considering my wife&#39;s taste in seafood, it must have been pretty good.  It was heartwarming to watch this former non seafood eater tear her way through the crab legs with reckless abandon, slurping briny liquid from the shells of mussels and peeling shrimp like there was no tomorrow.  It brings a tear to my eyes.....

I got the Arctic Bay steampot, which had Queen(snow) crab, shrimp, sausage and a whole split lobster, along with the potatoes and corn, steamed in a garlic bath and topped with Old Bay.  Everything was as good and fresh as I hoped they would be for this first meal back, and seasoned perfectly.  Old Bay is the quintessential seafood seasoning; I&#39;ve had a healthy appreciation for it ever since my first trip to the East Coast back when I was a kid, so that taste always bring me back to a more innocent carefree time in my life.  I&#39;ve been cracking, cleaning, and eating seafood all my life, so this made for a very joyous dinner with my wife, who recently started eating seafood that isn&#39;t popcorn shrimp.  The best part about Joe&#39;s is the seriously no-frills bucket slot in the middle of the table, for throwing all your garbage.  As much as I love eating fancily, I equally love eating at places like this, elbows on the table, food flying, and no utensils needed.  

A full belly after dinner is always a good sign, isn&#39;t it?  A broken pants button must be a better sign, no?  I&#39;d like to make return trips to Joe&#39;s until I&#39;ve cleared through most of the menu, because there was so much I wanted to order, but only enough room for so much.  Thanks, Joe&#39;s, for filling the seafood hole in my soul!"

I made reservations about a week in advance and had to call the night of to let them know that we were running late. They moved our reservation without fuss. When we arrived, I saw that the lines were nearly out the door. We went to check in expecting to wait at least a few minutes, and instead were immediately seated. The hosts and our server were great! Food and drinks arrived promptly, the food and drinks were great, and our server checked in but was not overbearing. The only downside, was that though I had not been here in about a year, the steampots were a LOT smaller than it used to be. I recall having more than 2 skinny crab legs and a tiny lobster with a couple shrimp and a few potatoes tossed in for measure. Despite this slight disappointment, the food was good, and we had a great time ( the music was great) and were glad that we decided to go casual instead of the formal restaurant we had originally planned to do. The manager (?) stopped by our table towards the end of our meal and checked in with us as he moved throughout the dining room greeting everyone with a smile. He was very friendly, upbeat and made us feel even more welcome as patrons. We will certainly be back!"

I just moved close to the area and had a taste for crab legs so why not Joes! Boyfriend and I dined here last night I loved my food he hated his. Appetizer- we had the fire balls. They were a bit spicy but good. Entrees-I had the queen crab with corn and potatoes. The crab legs were so good and juicy and I got them traditional style although I meant to order them grilled and forgot.  The corn was so sweet and good! The potatoes were ok I was disappointed to learn they didn&#39;t have sour cream in the place as I like to eat my potatoes with butter and sour cream but it was ok. I forgot to mention the fire balls come with fries on the bottom so I munched on those with my crab. My boyfriend had the east coast platter which he didn&#39;t enjoy. He ended up taking most of it home which he later threw away (which tells me he didn&#39;t like it) it&#39;s basically a bunch of fried food. A crab cake stuffed shrimp and fish. It didn&#39;t look good when it came out and certainly wasn&#39;t worth $18.99. The turtle sundae we shared made him feel a little better. Our bill was around $70 for the two of us. I will go back but only for crab legs that&#39;s what they do best.

What a disappointing experience overall. Food was horrible. From the appetizer sampler to my salmon entree, it had no taste. That&#39;s not the worst part. My husband ordered the cheesy chicken and halfway through he realized the chicken was under cook. We didn&#39;t notice at first since it was covered in sauce. We told the waiter and sent it back and my husband along with the rest of us lost our appetite. 
The general manager (Viola Diaz) came to talk to us and she was actually being a bit defensive. She offered him another entree but he refused. She actually said it was a thick piece of chicken, that&#39;s no excuse! She said that he should be ok because the edges of the chicken were thinner and were probably cooked. She said she would give us her card so if my husband felt sick we can contact her. She never came back to give it. My husband actually had to ask a waiter for her card since she left the premises already. And the best thing they can do is to remove the fee off my receipt for that entree.

With over 60 reviews, I&#39;m surprised that Joe&#39;s Crab Shack only has three stars. Each time I have been here, the place was packed. Why? It&#39;s seafood without costing an arm and a leg. These prices are reasonable and it satisfies your urge when the sea is calling. Only $30 for a bucket of king crab and as low as $10 for a crab cake sandwich.  

We ordered several buckets of seafood, crawfish ettoufee, and coconut shrimp. The food took some time to come out but it was worth the wait. Our table was silent and the only thing you heard was the sound of crab legs being cracked and chewing. Who has time to talk when you are biting into succulent little morsels of shrimp, mussels, scallops, and crawfish? My wife has learned not to talk to me when the food is good. 

A strobe light came on and the wait staff were doing the Cha Cha Slide. No joke. I was embarrassed for them but kept eating my meal while trying to avoid eye contact. Maybe the three stars were a result of the poor dance skills because it wasn&#39;t from the food or the service.

We order a combo of this and of that. There was a lot of food on the table. And, we all tried a little of this and that. No one ordered crab though. Hmmm. There was a fisherman&#39;s platter and lots of shrimp. Everything was pretty good. 

Overall, it&#39;s a bit expensive for a lot of fried food, but when hunger strikes and you need a place that everyone can agree on...Joe&#39;s worked. Add a lot of noise and a lot of kids and you&#39;ve got a place to bring the family."

The mussels and clams were super fresh and the dirty rice was oh-sooo-dirtayyyy. My friend&#39;s fish and chips weren&#39;t bad either! 

The portions are large (huge, colossal, gargantuan). The food is well-cooked. The walls are abound with cheesy nautical decorations. You can&#39;t really ask for a whole lot more! Service was a little off, but I think it was just our particular waitress. 

Overall, Joe&#39;s is a little pricey, but given the quality of the seafood I think that the few extra bucks are well worth it. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try their steampots + alcoholic beverages. (:"

That being said, Joe&#39;s is really a nice place if you want the beach-side crab shack feel in the midwest. 

My reasoning for four stars is as follows: 

Food is a five (The most important variable in my calculations for any restaurant review... by far!). The steampot offered a great variety &amp; the seasoning was just right for my order (classic with sunset spice). Crab was great and the shrimp were perfect as well. The corn &amp; potatoes were a nice complement. 

Service is a three. I&#39;ve been twice, and the service has been inconsistent. All servers seem very knowledgeable about the menu, but on my second visit, the server forgot the appetizer, didn&#39;t offer/bring water, and also forgot utensils and accessories (the bib + claw cracker... if that&#39;s what you call it!). Also, my second visit was an uncrowded Wednesday night when it was about 0 degrees outside... if it was busier, I might have been so picky on this.

Ambiance/Environment is a four. The environment is kind of corny, but I&#39;m a sucker for corny themes; reminded me of pretty much every seafood shack on the south-east coast.

(5 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 4 stars!

Hope this helps and happy eating!"

But trust me, they earned those two stars.

The service was extremely poor. Our server came to the table and spoke so fast that we hardly understood her. She didn&#39;t even ask us if we wanted drinks before she walked away. Super frustrating. Eventually she came back and asked if we wanted drinks. We wanted an appetizer, too, but she was gone before we could even tell her that. When our food came, she had given me the wrong side, despite my clarifying that I wanted the green beans, NOT the broccoli (life altering, I know, but nonetheless...). Her most obvious flaw was her poor follow up. She never asked if we wanted our drinks refilled and she came back only once after the food came out. We had to stop her in her tracks and ask for our bill.

The food is mediocre, but you&#39;re charged fine dining prices, and the atmosphere feels low-class. The last time we&#39;d been there was a few years ago. We certainly didn&#39;t feel this way then, but it seems the quality in both food and service has declined immensely. We&#39;ll definitely not be eating there again."

Time of my visit: Lunch hours

This place was close to work and I needed to scratch my wings itch from earlier in the week...  Even though, it is a chain, however, I see a value to reviewing this place for one reason and one reason only, their Buffalo Bliss sauce.

The beauty of living around the area is I knew exactly, where the place was.  I had a chance to take a look at the menu before coming over and kind of had my kind set on something, but then I saw that they had lunch special... $5.99+tax lunch deals (between 11am and 3pm), so I ordered 6 original (drumsticks only, damn it!) wings with wedgies fries (coleslaw was an option) and a glass of water.  I could have gotten a drink for a dollar more, but opted not to.  This place did not strike me down as a casual dinning type of place (i.e. a sit down type of restaurant) but more like a fast food type joint, so why did it take 15-20 minutes to get my food?

Off to my food.  The portion was smaller than I anticipated, but not too tiny.  The potato wedges (I LOVE potato wedges) were average, seasoned, but bland at the same time...  My wings (honey BBQ sauce) were nothing out of this world, neither the sauce, not the wings themselves.  And don&#39;t even get me started on the ranch...  I don&#39;t know if it just went bad or just was supposed to taste like that, I just could not handle more than one dip in it. 

Now, here is why I wanted to review this place, regardless how I feel or what I think about chains (mostly there is nothing unique or special about them, you will get 90% of the same crap, anywhere you go and that&#39;s the point of them all, once you tasted one, you tasted them all, so what&#39;s the point?!).  I am huge on different sauces and their Buffalo Bliss (I asked for a little container, so I can dip my fries/wedges in it) and that sauce was to die for!  It was delicious! I have had different buffalo sauces in the past, but this one had an interestingly spicy and cooling taste to it, I could not quite get my taste buds to figure it out.

Honestly, the Buffalo Bliss sauce is what saved this place from lower grade. C!"

I was surprised at the price I paid for 30 wings, there&#39;s basically no discount built into their combos at all! I tried a handful of their flavors and none of them impressed me, considering Wingstop has equivalents to everything but they taste better and aren&#39;t nearly as dry or crusty.

Honestly, if it weren&#39;t for the high prices I&#39;d eat here semi-often just for those sweet samurai boneless wings. But they are just a little more than I&#39;m willing to pay so I might stop by once in awhile if I have a coupon."

I was impressed by the size of the menu, but was not impressed with the wing sauce selection. They are pretty typical, but have fancy names.

Ordering: I ordered the 7 pc boneless wing (buffalo bliss) lunch combo for 5.99 (wings, fries, drink) and found that very reasonable. What I didn&#39;t realize was that they charge for dipping sauce. You don&#39;t even get one with your meal. This...was actually kind of annoying. I understand paying extra for EXTRA sauce, but this comes with nothing.

Prep: He told me up front it would be about 15 min wait. At first I thought this was a bit long for a place to offer takeout, but then I realized that the wings are made fresh, not pre-made and baking under a hot lamp so the wait was more understandable. Unfortunately, 25 mins later, people who ordered after me were getting their food. When I went to the counter, they had put my order in their delivery bag, but I can handle honest mistakes.

Food: The chicken was very tender, but parts of the breading were chewy. the fries were pretty good, but some are cut way too thick (just not my thing. They are similar to kfc wedges). I was disappointed in the Buffalo Bliss sauce. They list it as 2 peppers on their 4 pepper scale, but there was no heat at all. It was not only mild, but almost seemed watered down on flavor as well. They might be cutting their sauce to make it go further. As for the extra I got charged for ranch, it was about a 2 tablespoon cup. If they want to charge for it, they need to give you much more than that. 

Overall: I am not impressed. I feel like they have more to offer and will go back to try the burgers (some of them look amazing). Make sure you order ahead if you are tight on time."

I don&#39;t know if I got the wrong sauce or what but the Tokyo dragon or whatever was NOT good, it had a weird sweetness and just did not want to make you keep eating, I also tried the lemon zinger and it was just ok.

This was my experience:
I ordered the 6 strip combo w/fries a 3oz coleslaw and drink

Pros: the fries were good, the sauce hot, clean restaurant, barqs cream soda hell yeah

Cons: here we go... Walked in at 11:01 ordered the 6 strip combo, and the employee asked me if I wanted coleslaw or fries, the picture depicted and scripted that it came with fries and a 3oz cup of coleslaw, so confused I say I whatever give me a small coleslaw on the side, okay no biggie.. Gets more confusing, a combo meal should include a drink but I didn&#39;t see that this meal doesn&#39;t, so the meal with out a drink is $10.29 already okay cool add in a drink a coleslaw and you&#39;re at $15.39....I say no buddy take the coleslaw out, aight drink and meal $13.43 cool... My buddy orders his food...

To put it simply: employees here are undertrained not knowing the menu well, I get my food 45 min later than when I ordered it *with a 3oz Coleslaw* , employee had little knowledge about the menu configurations, I finish my food and my friend asked where his food was and the employee at the register was confused and asked to see his receipt... They get to working on his order and he gets his food 53 min after ordering

The manager comes out and looks me in the face and apologized and I tell him to look at my friend not me....


The sauce was overly salty and decently hot the breading on the strips was falling off

Usually if the food is garbage it is buffered with amazing service...won&#39;t be going back anytime soon, especially since this place has been opened up for months"

They had peanuts on the table, and she got a huge kick out being able to throw the shells on the floor.... being messy on purpose!

I liked the thin crust pizza (OK, and the peanuts, too), the restaurant uses fresh made Italian sausage, and whole milk mozzarella, which gives the cheese a nice stretchiness quality. They had a smattering of herbs which I find pleasing, as well.

The original location was overlooking serene Lake Zurich, IL, but that location burned down in 2004. They moved up the road inside the arcade building at a mini golf, and I stopped in there once or twice over the years, but only for take out.

Finally they moved to their present location, on Highway 14 in Palatine, into s cozy building that was previously another pizzeria, which I can&#39;t JJ Twigs Pizza Reviewremember the name of. It&#39;s smaller than the original location, but a warmer decor, and they offer their entire lengthy menu of pizza, sandwiches, and entrees, along with a full bar.

JJ Twigs is known for their unique &#34;double decker&#34; pizza, which is two fully topped thin crust pizzas, one atop the other, sealed together with a thick hand-turned outer crust.  I&#39;ve never tried it.

I had my &#34;usual,&#34; a thin crust sausage with green olive, and double cheese. And it was fabulous. Chased it down with an Italian beef but took most of both home, of course. The pie is every bit as good as I remembered, and I&#39;d stop by more often, but it&#39;s quite a hike for me.

There are four additional locations, one in Wauconda, IL, and three in St. Louis, MO. Same menus, recipes.  JJ Twigs menu is competitively priced for the area."

It is a small place focusing basically on pizza. Their specialty is a double-decker pizza which is probably what you think. One thin crust pizza with another piled on top of it. I like the fact they serve this in triangles so you can hold on to the crust at the end. So many places around here do squares, and for cheesy pizzas such as Twigs get to be a real mess. Anyway... if you like thin crust - but want more &#34;fixings&#34; than usual - the double-decker is a unique option

Toppings are fresh and plentiful. Lots of cheese. Very good fare. Reasonably priced. Easy place to find; on the curve of Northwest Highway on the SE side of Palatine.

I&#39;ve found service to be on the slow side, albeit friendly and accommodating. TV screens throughout - Food Network was on!"

We tried the Western pizza with BBQ sauce and sausage and the JJ Twigs was good too except a lot of onions. It has sausage, green pepper &amp; mushroom, yummy. The paper stuck to the crust so I took a couple bites with paper on it. I like a little more cheese on my pizza but still not bad. Fun place to go with a group.

Sure their pizza is good, and the double stuff pizza is great, but it&#39;s more than that.  It&#39;s unique among restaurants in Chicagoland.  It&#39;s cozy like Chicago Pizza and Ovengrinders on Clark. It is festively lit like Firkin&#39;s in Libertyville.  When it&#39;s not all lit up, it feels like a comfortable, kickback pizza place you&#39;d find in Wisconsin. And because it&#39;s a well kept secret like Mac&#39;s on Slade (just minutes from this place), there&#39;s rarely a wait.

The parking lot is tiny, and you might not be able to find a spot in the lot. We parked on the street. 

My wife had a grilled chicken sandwich. The sandwich looked really good, and the fries were excellent. I split fried macaroni and cheese with her cousin. It was good, but when is fried macaroni and cheese not good?

We ordered a double dough pizza with sausage bacon and onion. the dough was crisp on the outside with a little bit of doughy-ness inside. It was really good. There were plenty of toppings. We only ate 5 of the 8 slices.

I believe it. But imma take it a step further and say it&#39;s the best thin crust pizza in the world... or maybe how much I loved my first (but certainly not last) taste of this pizza is directly proportionate to how hungry I was when I ordered. How Hungry Was I? Like a Wolf, Yo. I was H. like a friggin&#39; wolf. 

Nevertheless, it was a damn fine pizza. The Manz and I were simply unable to get the pie back to his place before making a nice sized dent in it while transporting by car with mattress strapped to the top. We got a black olive and fresh mushroom pizza that was outstanding. Everything from the sauce to the ultra thin crust was beyond perfect, and to be honest, I really want to call it my most favorite thin crust ever, but I think I should wait until I&#39;ve had the pizza more than once, first.

Oh, hell... who am I kidding? Best.Pizza.Ever! 

OOH! And I feel like I should also mention that I pretty much never eat pizza (diet, diet, diet!), like maybe 3 times a year, but you could bet your life that I&#39;ll prob be back at The Twig this week, straight fiendin&#39; fo mo. 

Also, we picked up our pie around 10pm on New Years Eve and the staff were so.freakin&#39;.friendly! I remember when I worked my first job at a pizza place and having to be there on New Years sure made me one crabby piece- but not here. Pleasant as Pie, they were."

Where it sits on the street, its narrow and long shape, and the way it sits up on the train tracks made me wonder if this was an old train station. As long as I&#39;ve lived in this area (almost 30 years) it has been a restaurant. For a long time it was Jake&#39;s Pizza, but I think it&#39;s been JJ Twigs for many years now. This was our first visit to Twigs.

Inside, it is decorated to look like a backwoods lodge. Woof planks line the walls and ceiling. There are trinkets around of fishing, and bears - lots of bears. There are several TVs and a room on the south that can be set up for parties. In fact, there was one going on while we were there. There was a decidedly musty smell - an old smell, in the dining room.

The food is the typical Chicago pizzeria fare. Alongside of the pizzas are hot dogs, hamburgers, Italian beef, combos, etc. My wife and daughter wanted the pizza -that was the main reason we went there. Jon had a combo and I had a hamburger. Both Jon and I thought our dinners were unremarkable. The hamburger had little taste. I did like that they broil the bun so it was crusty. And, the fries were actually very good. Sarah and Kerrie raved about the pizza.

The servers were very pleasant and attentive. The service was very slow, however.

If I had gotten the pizza, I might have given it more stars. But, considering the quality of the burger and the slow service (good, just slow), I rate three stars. I added a star because the everyone said the pizzas were so good."

My best friends kid got married and bought a house so I flew there to attend.  He told me where he lived and I made arrangements for several old friends from high school to meet at the pizza place that he recommended by his house.

It turns out that it was the same place that I worked at when I was a teenager in the mid 70&#39;s.  Originally a Dog N&#39; Suds (drive in, not drive thru), when I worked there it was Sookies (hot dogs).

In any case, I&#39;m not a BIG fan of pizza, but I&#39;ve been dying to have one of those wafer thin crust pizzas that is the REAL Chicago style pizza, as practically every pizza place in Chicago area made that type of pizza, and it&#39;s rarely found anywhere else.

Myself and my guests all think this was very good... as good as any thin crust I ever had.    The party room wasn&#39;t available for our reunion, but there&#39;s a few BIG tables in the main dining room that fit all of us.


I got to sneak a peek in the kitchen.  It looks identical to when I worked there over 40 years ago.  I was amazed that it wasn&#39;t totally reconfigured during that time... but hey, ya gotta go with what works!"

The pizza is great.  The thin crust is crispy, sauce is good, and toppings and cheese are quality and in good quantity.  The salads are great as well.  It&#39;s no small feat to get three kids to eat their salads, but the family sized salad that is dropped at our table is gone quickly.  Finally, the kids talked us into the wings one night and they have now made it into our regular rotation.

I visit the Combat Arts Institute dojo (see my review on Yelp) at least on the second Friday of every even numbered month for promotion qualifications.  After working up a big appetite, we all head over to JJ Twig&#39;s for some good pizza and conversation.

The staff at JJ Twig&#39;s is very accommodating.  There have been plenty of times we arrive close to closing hours, yet they stay working late just to feed us.  They even provide separate checks for each of us.  You can&#39;t ask for anything more out of a place, and that&#39;s why JJ Twig&#39;s will be our spot for a long long time.

But what about the food?  For being a Chicago suburban pizza joint, they do alright.  I&#39;ve tried almost all of their thin crust specialty pizzas and enjoy them all.  The BBQ Chicken, Hawaiian and Western are quite tasty... oh, so is the Italian Beef pizza.  The crust is so thin and crispy, and has a good taste to it, and the grid cut slices are just the right size.

Just a note, the BBQ Chicken and Hawaiian pizzas are on the sweet side, but are quite tasty if you into that.

Two visits back I ordered a thin pepperoni and green pepper pizza, and my friend Jose ordered the same, but as a Double Decker Pizza.  I had never even gotten that far on the menu to see that option. LOL  Well needless to say we swapped slices and the double decker was amazing!  It really is two pizzas on top of each other with a nice thick pan style crust.  I was hooked!  This last visit I ordered my own double decker :D

If you are looking for a place to accommodate your mid-sized group, I&#39;d highly recommend JJ Twig&#39;s."

I eat pizza at least once a week, so I have to admit that their pizza is average.

For an appetizers we had the cheese fries with bacon bits, mm mm delicious, the fries were crisp the bacon bits were more like bites not bits at all.  For pizza we got the thin crust.  The pizza was really good, we had garlic as a topping and they definately dont short change you on the toppings.  I would give this restaurant five stars but the only thing was that it did take quite a while for the pizza to come through, but it was definately worth the wait.

In the summer it&#39;s very open and has a beachy vibe on the patio. The layout is open even though it gets crowded, so it never feels gross and stuffy. And if it does, you can head to the patio, where there&#39;s another bar and some games to play along with another dance floor. There&#39;s good variety to the music. I found myself sitting down for a few songs, then getting up to dance for the next few good songs. The music inside can be super loud, so instead of yelling at my friends, we are mute indoors and head to the patio to relax a bit and talk. So far, no drinks have been spilled on me, and no sticky floors. It gets pretty loud and wild in here, though, making it a great place to spend an evening if you&#39;re in the suburbs and don&#39;t want to deal with parking and a long ride home from the city.

Bartenders have been friendly and fast even on busy nights.

You should get a pool and have beach parties :D"

A very spacious indoor and outdoor venue that gives the nightclub feel without the downtown crowd. Good for that 21 ish crowd all the way to the middle ages. 

My favorite thing about this place is the outdoor area. A giant tiki bar, meets south beach cabanas with corn hole, fire pits and beach volleyball to top it all off. 

Really good house music outside on Thursday and most Friday nights, a fair priced food menu with a pretty tasty $3.99 burger, and several drink special nights. 

Good for dancing, hanging outside with friends and just plane old people watching. Wear your casual clothes or your club dress...whatever you like....just don&#39;t come in here acting like that VIP snob. This is THE SUBURBS... it is fun, local and relaxed. We like it that way!"

My buddy came in town and I told him we could try Drink out because I hadn&#39;t been there and I think it will be close to his scene. Trying to show him a good time. We walk up to the door and the gentleman kindly point out our shoes and politely turned us away. The other gentleman near him corrected him and said &#34;no they are straight.&#34; They let us in with no problem. We were dressed in regular clothes. Acceptable. I happened to have a plain light blue hoodie on and Nikes. I like to think we were pretty solid looking guys so that may have had something to do with it. But next time I will dress nicer to avoid this. We entered the club around midnight and it was packed. We were feelin pretty good vibes when we got there. 

Once we walked in we knew we were in the right spot. My buddy also commented on how cool it was. Multiple floors. Everyone dressed well. Temperature was good. Not too hot or cold. The drinks were very reasonably priced. The service from our bartender was great. Very quick given the amount of people there. Short and thin brunette with glasses. She was awesome. The music was great. Everyone around us was having a good time. Even being a tad underdressed we were welcome by the other guests. I am excited to go back again. 

I have read through some reviews and horror stories that give one stars. Their accounts and experiences would give me the same bad taste. I am nervous/excited to go back but I will and I hope that the good times continue. Well done. So far."

However, it should be said that how much you enjoy an evening out at this place has as much to do with you as it does the club. It is most certainly not for every taste. 

It is essentially a meat market styled dance club that pumps out loud EDM music til the wee hours of the morning, caters to a younger demographic, and is a place where it is still fashionable to pound down Jager bombs and make out with random girls you just met. The brazen and reckless nature of this club is reminiscent of a college bar. The only major difference is none (or very few) of the patrons are in college anymore, yet none have settled down yet either. It is a limbo of those who have moved on with their life/career, but have somehow managed to avoid the whole wife, kids, house with a picket fence, etc. routine. 

The dance floor is huge, and they have a large outdoor bar and seating area as well, which comes in handy as it gets pretty hot from doing the white boy shuffle non-stop for hours on end. I wish I had dressed a tad nicer, as my torn blue jeans and t-shirt were a little out of place as most people were to the 9&#39;s. 

The progression of the evening was fairly predictable. I have been to places like this a million times before in the past, but it has admittedly been awhile. The club was pretty dead at 10 when I arrived. By 10:45 the dance floor was packed and shots were flowing like a tidal wave. By 11:45 I had already met, been grinding on, and was in the midst of a passionate embrace of a lovely young female accountant. By 1:30, I was in love. After that, things get a little fuzzy. Glad I have my Uber app on my home screen for quick access. 

As guilty as I should probably feel for being so wantonly irresponsible, it actually felt pretty BA to cut loose for a change. I am certainly not saying that I plan to become a regular here, as I would like to think I have evolved a bit in my life. That said, it felt pretty cool to have fresh texts in my phone this morning telling me what a great guy I am. Whatever it was I said, it must have been good."

This was my first time here, I didn&#39;t mind it but I felt the crowd was way younger and more geared toward college students or anyone under 25.  I did spot few older people, which kind of creeped me out a bit.

The Drinks were reasonably priced compared to Chicago, but I guess if you want to attract customers to stay in the burbs, you better lower the prices.  The music was a bit odd, they played good music but they were older and not very current compared to the Chicago DJs. but then again I went on a Friday, maybe it&#39;s different on Saturday?"

I like to visit places at least five times before I give it a grade.  This is not a good place to party.  For one, the music is extremely loud.  You can&#39;t hear anything and it&#39;s hard to conversate.  I have left there with my ears ringing and my hearing is usually impaired for at least 2-3 days after visiting there.  Very little top 40 and lots of music I&#39;ve never heard of.

Fellas, if you&#39;re looking for ladies you will be dissapointed.  Most women who come here are my mom&#39;s age or older....BTW, my mom is in her 60&#39;s.  Not allot of young people come to this venue so if your mom wants to have a party,  this is the place.  I would say the average age for people that come to Drink is 40-50 and up.  

Drink isn&#39;t the most popular place to visit either.  It rarely gets crowded.  There have been plenty of times I&#39;ve been there and the parking lot is full, but when you get in.....you&#39;re like, where is everyone?

If we do decide to follow through with our plans to go here, I may update this review to reflect our experience actually IN the club, but as far as trying to organize/plan/book a party here, the experience has been dismal.

The events coordinator is slow to respond to emails and difficult to get into contact with on the phone, but that is forgivable as I am sure they are a busy person and keep odd hours due to the nature of the business. However, the information they provide for party packages once you do get a chance to speak with them is inconsistent (details of offered packages change from conversation to conversation), unclear (due to inconsistencies), and deviates from what is advertised on the website (the advertised package is only available for Friday evenings, despite restrictions not being stated on the website, and the two packages available for Saturday evenings are not listed online, making it difficult to keep track of details and pricing).

TLDR; event coordination at this club seems to be unorganized and unprofessional."

I like it because it&#39;s local and convenient to those not trying to drive out to the city for fun.  I have heard of them having coverages but both times I went it was because a friend was having a birthday so I didn&#39;t have to pay. 

 The first time my friend rented his own section downstairs and it was very nice! Their was plenty of space and we had our own bar! Plus partying with peeps you know is always fun. They were playing good music and I was on the dance floor most of the night. It was getting very turned at a point and one of the club promoters began giving free shots if you walked up and he poured it in your mouth. He had a towel and was careful not to spill on you and that&#39;s good! Because I didn&#39;t want alcohol on my chest lol! 
 The second time we went we surprised my buddy in Halloween weekend and that was another very successful event! This time my friend rented the upstairs area which I never seen and it was very nice with a lot of side lounge booths and also a bar. People had awesome costumes! We got a deal if we got a certain amount of friends to come and everyone got 10 free drinks for 20 dollars I think.

There is usually a cover charge past 10pm, but usually it is roughly $10 for ladies and $15 for the gents. If you get in before 10pm, you can usually avoid the cover charge. 

There are 2 stories with 3 different bars inside the venue. There are also two different dance floors inside as well. There is a lovely outdoor patio with its own very large bar too. Great scenery outside, smoking is also allowed there if that matters to you. 

Music is usually going to be fast and full of bass. If you are a person who only likes to dance to rap, this is not the place for you. No rap is ever played here, usually only top dance beats and some techno or Euro music. Also, a lot of remixes of current popular songs too. 

I have fun whenever I go here...so much more convenient to go to Drink than to go to the city and drop $100&#39;s just to get a buzz. Also, the dancing it just a plus.

Ladies be warned, there are a few creepers here! Better to go in a group or with your boyfriend."

My wife and I are celebrating our 1 year anniversary and decided we wanted to find a nightclub where we could kick back, dance, and have a few drinks. Drink Nightclub didn&#39;t let us down. The bartenders were great and delivered top notch service (Thanks Debbie and Kallie or Hallie. Sorry but the music made it difficult to hear your name. Nevertheless you were a blast and made great drinks.). The DJ played a nice mix of songs that kept us on the floor all night. The only downside of the night was when some drunk guy dropped a bottle on the dance floor and some of the glass hit my wife&#39;s foot. The management at Drink was very attentive to this and made sure the floor was clear in no time. Tom and Nola tended to my wife&#39;s needs and made sure she wasn&#39;t injured and also made sure we had a great rest of the night. Overall, Drink was a great experience for nightlife in Schaumburg. I can honestly say we&#39;ll return and we highly recommend this spot to anyone in the area looking for a good time."

The manager, Nola was excellent to work with, however I think the communication on what to expect when setting up a birthday for a 21-year old could have been better. She never mentioned there was a dress code or that if the establishment over-serves someone that the club will kick you and the entire party out.  Very poor communication.  The bartender Matthew was great and made sure my son enjoyed celebrating his 21st birthday.  Thank you Mitch, for working with my husband and doing the right thing.

And now for the negative.  Beware of the bouncers!  They&#39;re awful.  They don&#39;t know how to difuse situations or handle them appropriately.  They&#39;re extremely aggressive and use their positions to abuse people.  They definitely need better training on how to minimize hurting people.  They&#39;re bruisers!"
drink-schaumburg-2,Jonathan W.,kII9dGPRFSJmyQEycczfyQ,"Orlando, FL",0,1,0,1,2,wrKGMysajDmzGqFZ9C99SA,2.0,2016-03-20,"Visited Drink for the first time last night with a group of 4 to celebrate a birthday and new job. We arrived pretty early around 8 to get a feel of the place, talk to the staff, have a few drinks to start the night. Before I get into the problems with Drink, I&#39;d like to be fair and talk about the good things we experienced. Venue is huge, multiple floors, great sound/lighting system, more than enough bars to take care of you. Bathrooms were big and clean, and located conveniently near the entrance. The DJs were awesome, and even took requests, just be respectful and tip them. Bartenders were great, as well as our server for bottle service, so don&#39;t skimp on the tips as they deserve it. 

Matthew, our bartender was a great guy, friendly, and appreciated the tip that I left him. He recommended coming back around 10, when it would be busier. I inquired about bottle service, as our group wanted to secure a table close to the DJ. Matthew told me that we&#39;d be fine, we just had to buy one bottle and they would take care of us, and to let the doorman know that we spoke to Matthew.

This is where the problems begin - with the management. We arrive around 11, the place is packed, but there were still areas that didn&#39;t have many people as the venue is pretty huge. We came well dressed, and got respect from the doorman, (he was turning away people who were wearing sneakers, boots, or basically looked homeless). However, after I mentioned that we were here earlier and spoke to Matthew about a table, we were told by a guy named Jason that we had to buy 2 bottles, and it couldn&#39;t be champagne (since those were $75). I was a bit surprised about the shakedown at the door, which reminded me of some sleazy used car salesman trying to screw me over. I reasoned with Jason and said that we were told something different by Matthew, and that we were here to celebrate and have a good time, and that we&#39;d probably be drinking more anyway, (if this rude idiot wasn&#39;t trying to haggle with me at the door). He agreed to put us in the Absolut Lounge, with a bottle of Tito&#39;s vodka ($170 for a 750ml bottle that normally costs $17.99).

Our party of 2 Indian men, 1 indian girl, and 1 white girl is placed in the far back of the venue, away from the main DJ, and the main bar. I am starting to regret my decision. I decide to go to the bar and have a chat with Matthew. I explained what happened at the front, as well as the fact that we were placed away from everyone else. He says not to worry, just talk to the hostess at the front and she will have us moved closer to the main dance floor. I told him that I appreciated his help, and slipped him a $20. I explain the situation to the the girl at the front, named Olivia, and she looks at me like I&#39;m crazy. She calls over Jason, and he says to me that our party cannot sit over there unless we buy two bottles. I look over, and there is literally no one over there, out of the 7-8 tables. I explained that Matthew said it wouldn&#39;t be a problem, and you know what he tells me? &#34;Matthew is just a bartender, I don&#39;t know why he is telling you anything, he&#39;s not a manager. I&#39;ll have a word with Matthew later.&#34; 

Instead of raising hell or being angry, I just sighed and shook Jason&#39;s hand, and thanked him for his help. I knew then that I would never come back to this place. Here&#39;s some free advice for the management, the whole point of marking up liquor by 1000% is to provide good SERVICE, that&#39;s why it&#39;s called BOTTLE SERVICE. By paying $170 for a $17 bottle of liquor, I&#39;m expecting to be treated with a bit of respect and accommodation. It would have been one thing if the entire section was packed full of people buying $500 Belvedere magnums, but it was empty. My advice for working professionals with money, go to Underground Wonder Bar in Chicago, they will take care of you there. If you need a cheap place to get drunk, Drink is the place for you.

P.S. - My apologies to Matthew if we got you in some trouble with management, you were trying so hard to take care of us, you are definitely one of the best bartenders I&#39;ve had!"

When I started asking questions about my check they told me it was at another location and if I wanted it to drive there and pick it up. I said no that&#39;s not how it works.. Either have it here or mail it to my house. I told them that if I didn&#39;t have it by a certain date I will contact HR for my check.

I was told because of this matter I&#39;m banned from Drink, I said it&#39;s bs I&#39;ve done nothing wrong.

After trying to get first drink we went and got a refund because the drink selections that we were told include certain alcohols didn&#39;t actually include those. Manager was helpful in getting a refund. Those alcohols were considered premium alcohol (above top shelf) so they were not included.  Drinks after that were okay tho some beers literally tasted watered down. The bar tenders said they believed us and didn&#39;t want to taste it as well (which by itself is shocking) a beer is a beer but these bottles tasted like water to several of us.  We&#39;ve been here several times but every time It&#39;s seemed less and less impressive.  Dance floor atmosphere is kinda fun but our friends are moving from just down the street so we likely will never have a reason to come back to a place we have Had problems with over and over.  

Once it fills up drink can be a lively dance floor of that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for."

The drinks are a tiny bit more expensive than your local bar but they give you a good amount of alcohol in your drink so it&#39;s worth the price. Good music. The only down side is sometimes the female bartenders tend to help males out first before they even look your way. Other than that it&#39;s a great time and I recommend going for a fun night out in the suburbs.

But let me separate the review into two. One for the venue and club itself, and one for the event. The club is quite large inside, but the best part is outside. In the summer, they have a sandlot which turns into quite the beach party. We were lucky to show up on the first night they opened the outside bar, limited opening and drinks outside, but winter was finally over and we were feeling nice. Inside, we went upstairs and sat on the couches overlooking the dance floor, felt quite VIP. 
Now, the event. They advertised Jay Sean on Friday night for which we had to buy tickets online. On the site the time to show up was 7pm, facebook said 9pm. we got in around 9. The place was totally empty except for one dude that really just wanted to dance it off. We didnt have to pay cover since we got there so early. No one asked about tickets, so money wasted there. Those that came later had to pay cover... (I am not a big clubber so this was not my scene) The &#39;artist&#39; showed up at 1:30am instead of 9,10,11,or midnight as we were told. They had a really annoying hype man stalling and passing time till Jay Sean got there. I get that he used to be somewhat famous.. but cmon man! I was there for my fiance and her friends who got a kick out of Jay Sean performing half of his song, and one that wasnt even his.. then sitting down to drink... i had a good time drinking outside, and would rather come to a summer beach party than try to attend an event here. Some of you clubheads would call this the typical club experience... At least the drinks were affordable."

Then the bouncer was asking us for money in order to get out friend in.  He had the nerve to ask us to pay $50 despite the fact that there was no one inside!!! We ended up going to Rosemont...

I wasn&#39;t always happy with the service there, however I do like the atmosphere, their outside patio is really nice. Last night I went there with lots of friends, we got  bottle service again. The staff said there is a two bottle minimum, and we will get a free bottle of champagne with that. We were told that each bottle will cost $125. We get seated at the table, the waitress asks what kind of champagne do we want, we said not sure, and asked to see the menu, we selected which free bottle of champagne we want and continued with our night. When we were given the bill at the end of the night we found out that the bottle of champagne that we chose was $250 extra, double of what we initially wanted to spend on our bill. No one has ever mentioned that if we chose a particular brand of champagne it will cost more. We didn&#39;t even want the champagne, but it came with the package so we took it.

We brought up the issue with the waitress, she then called the hostess, and eventually security guards were called to deal with the problem. One guy came up and said he was the manager. He was one of the rudest, and most unprofessional people I have ever dealt with. I explained the situation, said I would be willing to pay for what we originally wanted. He said that he doesn&#39;t care, and we have to pay for the entire bill, if we don&#39;t want to pay he will call police and we will get arrested for retail theft, and the club will still get their money. We went back and fourth few times, police came, at the end of the night we decided its not worth going through all this trouble and paid this fraudulent bill. This place will stop at nothing to add bogus charges to your bill because they know they can get away with it. What was going to be a $300 tab turned into a $650 tab. This place needs to review how they handle their disputes, and better train their employees on how to deal with customers in a respectful way. I will make sure to spread the word as much as I can so more people know about this fraudulent business."

Not sure I&#39;m missing out on a whole lot as a club is a club, right?  Let me first say that I am NOT a club person.  It is extremely rare that I actually want to go out and dance like a freak to stupid music and flirt with a bunch of boys.  
However, I went there one night in that mood and it was just SO LOUD.  Are clubs normally that loud?  I have to say I appreciated the size of the place.  It&#39;s absolutely huge and there is a nice loungey place you can sit at where it&#39;s generally pretty empty so you can get away with the craziness.
The bartenders weren&#39;t particularly pleasant but I get that.  

Honestly what I really liked about this place was the atmosphere in the summertime.  The outdoor area is huge and has tons of stuff to do.  Bags, volleyball, sitting by a bunch of bonfires, etc.  That&#39;s more what I liked about this place.  I don&#39;t have anything terrible to say, but nothing too exciting either except for the outdoor options.  If you&#39;re looking for a nice to just let loose and be stupid and get crazy, yeah why not, check it out!"
drink-schaumburg-2,Khris L.,gU5CPdNIyHiYxKEOnqB1LA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,93,2,PiaXv6v-s6LEu8fyM8RlQw,2.0,2014-08-26,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I&#39;ve visited this establishment a couple of times in the past month.  The first time we visited, my girl and I had an awesome time.  The bartenders were super nice and we had a blast playing bags in the outdoor bar area.  Since she lives near, we decided that we would visit often to have a few drinks and play some bags(cornhole game).  
The second time we visited, the experience was a bit strange.  We ordered the spinach dip appetizer and some beers to get our night started.  The bartender(not too friendly) brought out the chips and dip, and also gave us a couple of appetizer plates.  Both of the appetizer plates had some gooey brown syrup still on the plate.  We decided to not say anything, and just ate off the big plate of chips and dip.
After eating and drink a few beers, we went outside to get some more beers and to play some bags.  I opened up a tab at the outdoor bar with a bartender named Elena.  She was nice enough throughout the night. 
At the end of the night, when I went to close my tab, she accidentally ran my card on the wrong tab.  Eventually, after figuring out what happened, she charged my card for the correct tab.  At this point, I thought she voided the incorrect charge, but I guess she didn&#39;t.  
After a couple of days, multiple charges showed up on my card.  A pending $50 authorization hold, a pending charge for the incorrect tab, and also a pending charge for the correct tab.  I let a couple days pass by to see if the authorization hold and incorrect charge would disappear.  Well, the charge for the incorrect tab didn&#39;t disappear, so the first thing I did was call Drink nightclub to fix the problem.  This is when the nightmare started(worse than Comcast customer care, if you know what I mean).
I called and spoke to multiple people who claimed to be the manager there.  Eventually, they told me I had to call their corporate office and speak to a lady named Jackie Bruno.  I did so, and she told me that she would have to get someone at Drink to look over the receipts.  Someone called back and told me that they found the receipts and would have to call me back after speaking with the bartender.  No one called me back.  I called again and they said I would have to leave my name and number.  I did so, and no one called me back.  The next day, I called again and they told me to leave my number again because Mitch the manager threw away my number.  I gave them my number again, and no one called back.  I called again the next day and spoke to Mitch, who said he had no idea who I was and that he just came back from Minnesota.  By this point, I realized that I was being given the run around.  He said he would call back, and when he did, he told me that Jackie Bruno from corporate had already put in the refund on my card and that it was out of his hands now that corporate said they were going to take care of it.
I called Jackie Bruno at corporate the next day and she said she had no idea who I was and that I never spoke to her before.  She told me that she would call back that day, but never did.  I called the next day, and she didn&#39;t pick up.  I called multiple times in a row with my cell phone, and no one answered.  I decided to call with my office phone(by the way, everyone at my office was being updated on the progress), and surprisingly, she picked up.  She seemed surprised that it was me, and said that she would call back later.  I stood my ground and told her that this was ridiculous and that I shouldn&#39;t have to call everyday for two weeks to get my money back in my account.  She sounded like she couldn&#39;t care less.  
Eventually, a guy named John called me back and told me that he would be putting my refund through.  He called everyday to see if it went through, and eventually it did after 3 days.  
All in all, the place is fun and the drinks are affordable, but it wasn&#39;t worth the trouble.  Mitch and John both offered to buy me my first round if I come back, so I may go and see if they honor what they said, but I don&#39;t know.  If the experience is better, I&#39;ll change my rating.  The whole experience left a sour taste in my mouth, as you could imagine.  If you do end up going here, make sure to bring cash and don&#39;t use your card.  There are a bunch of careless people working there and you&#39;ll go through what I went through."

I like that they have a lot of lounge seating, and several bars in which to get a drink.  This place has wonderful outdoor space in warm weather.  I like the red leather sofas and the cocktail servers are friendly.

They have an entire room dedicated to Absolut vodka and where they have every flavor of Absolut available!   I&#39;m not a &#34;club&#34; person but this place works for me, and I pay in cash when I go to a bar.

It&#39;s a big place, the old Alumni Club. Very nice decor, had a Vegas feel to it. Only been here once and it was a great time $95 bottles of Effen. Only thing I had an issue with was jigger pours which I&#39;m not a fan of. The staff is attentive and friendly. Lots of suburbanites letting loose.

Shame that on the Friday&#39;s I have been there the other rooms are closed off. The outside area is nice though, definitely not enough people and quite a few older people as well, but it happens. 

The music is not bad, but it isn&#39;t good either. 

The bartenders in the main area are a joke. I didn&#39;t give them a tip because they were being an asshole and also he shook his head when I didn&#39;t. 

I actually think it&#39;s kind of quiet for a club and pretty calm as well. At least there&#39;s a decent amount of people dancing. 

I think the dress code is pretty relaxed tbh. Just come in with nice jeans and a simple button up shirt and you&#39;re good. 

It can be a fun time, but I think it closes way too early for a club. They started kicking us out at 2:30?!? I can&#39;t get drunk at a place that closes that early..."

This is a very trendy spot and draws all the people that don&#39;t live in the city here.  There are many night club spots where you dress to impress and go to be seen.  Places that you feel like you are somebody and tonight is your night.  These are all great things but it is tough for me to believe these people are equivalent from city to suburbs.  

All the bells and whistles are included here from the long line for entrance, possible cover and the full on club experience.  They have the lights, the displays, the music and the performances.  The people here are what I would like to think are the shore like type of people.  Very metro-sexual guys and done up girls both with super tans.

The outside bar garden is beautiful. HOWEVER they have become a lot more snobby as they have gotten more exposure the past couple years. I had my 21st and 22nd birthday here and had bottle service but for my 23rd, I was told there was a 3 bottle minimum (a couple small tables had only a 2 bottle minimum) and even though I had been coming there for a couple years, they would not accommodate me. The year before, they even Facebook messaged me and offered me free wristbands for my party for a 2 hour open bar! 

It makes sense to raise prices as your demand gets higher but I believe all companies should try and keep their returning customers happy as well."

Hmm where to start... as a dance club it seems to be waste.... have the night there today and had a mixed feeling... for dudes this place is a bad investment of your money and energy if you are going for dance. 

DJ had a good collection but the remix was bad....  the lights were amazing and balloon drop was awesome. Enjoyed the light show and lasers. 

A good beautiful girl was a thought of mars...only amazing girls were the waitresses and the go go dancers. They had a lady who was dancing with the ropes hanging from roof. On dance floor the boy to girl ratio was 5:1. For a year end weekend the number is too scary. Most of the ladies were in their late 30s. Can&#39;t recommend for New Year eve party.

I will recommend this place for dinning and drinking and for dancing it&#39;s a thumb down. There were around 3 fights within 1 hour. Most people don&#39;t know how to dance and dudes were eyeballing each other. 

For interior and ambiance this place is a 5/5. You can&#39;t find a classy interior club in the suburbs. Parking was free and huge."

$5 cover?  In Schaumburg?  Serious?  I hate paying cover anywhere, especially in friggin&#39; Scumburg, or Schramburg as Bob Saget says, but I&#39;ll do it here.  Wanna know why?  Because I enjoy drinking in open air venues like Vertigo, Market, the Wit, and if it can be done with $2 wells within 20 minutes of my house, it is on like Donkey Kong.  Unfortunately, $2 drink days are Tuesdays, and we don&#39;t live on the West Coast, so the only time Drink gets my patronage is between March and October, and as long as it isn&#39;t raining/snowing/hailing/locusting.  

Valet your car, if you must, but I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary.  There&#39;s a free parking lot adjacent to Drink, but if it&#39;s full, you can park in the lot that&#39;s just another minute away.  Don&#39;t be lazy, and save your valet money for the cover.

As far as the Jersey Shore comments I&#39;ve read on almost all the other reviews, I mean, come on, what &#34;club&#34; doesn&#39;t have Jersey Shore-ish types in it?  Not many, and even if they are here, the douchebaggery factor is pretty low, it&#39;s not like Ronnie is out here punching people and yelling &#34;One shot, kid! That&#39;s one shot!&#34;  So what if they&#39;re here?  They&#39;re not bothering anyone.  Oh they&#39;re loud you say?  Who doesn&#39;t get loud when they get drunk?  I know I do, and I&#39;m as far from Jersey Shore as they come.  They have the right to get their drink on too.

Plenty of bar space and seating outside, including a side area for playing bags.  The DJ on Tuesdays play a mish-mash of radio tracks, and that&#39;s just fine.  It gets loud though, inside and out, if you are near the bar.  If you want to be able to hear yourself, just grab a table on the outskirts of the patio.

Overall, it&#39;s a solid place to have cheap drinks and have fun with your friends.  the boy girl ratio is high however, like 3:1, so good luck fishing."

I didn&#39;t know what to expect since I had never heard of this place. There is valet parking ($5  for &#34;regular&#34;, $10 for VIP),  but also a private lot that is free. I recommend parking for free...it isn&#39;t like it&#39;s hard to park in a parking lot. We paid $5/per person to get in. I&#39;m not a fan of paying cover charges, but whatever. I can see why, because they had the live DJ, some live entertainment (a girl that did acrobatics from some cloth hanging down from the ceiling, and a girl that had a lit-up hoolah hoop).

 At about 10:30 hardly anyone was on the dance floor, but the DJ was goin and the bars were starting to get busy. They have a lot of seating areas (pretty nice too) and a few bars to choose from. At about 11:30 the dance floor was PACKED. It&#39;s a goo sized dance floor too.The age range is mostly people in their 20&#39;s, but a saw a few older people in the crowd. There is some amazing people watching opportunities here!! I think that was probably the best part. The drinks are about $6 each, and they have shots for $4 and $6. There are girls walking around with shots that you can buy as well.  

Needless to say, I was surprised that the suburbs had a dance club for younger peoples...pretty exciting! I would say it is pretty comparable to a place you would find in the city."

The crowd is quite young, lower 20&#39;s.  The decor inside is great, but the best part about this place is the outdoor area.

Service is definitely much improved from when they were Mad Mark&#39;s (but that&#39;s not saying much as the service with MM&#39;s was HORRENDOUS!), but the draft beer still tastes watered down and even had a coconut flavor to the coor&#39;s light for a few weeks.  but for $1 draft beers and $2 well drinks on Tuesday nights, it&#39;s hard to be beat (and also probably why they water down their drinks)."

The entire interior was renovated to look more like a true nightclub. It looks completely different compared to when it was Mad Mark&#39;s &amp; Alumni Club. Seating &amp; tables for bottle service, outdoor cabanas, tiny fire pits, lights &amp; bars were added. The upstairs is now open, too, not just for private parties. Outdoor volleyball &amp; bags games went on up until the place closed. 
I was happy to hear about the drink specials; there is a different special every day of the week. Last night, there were none, but well mixed drinks were only $5 &amp; our bartender, Sean, was very generous.  =)  It didn&#39;t look like a lot of liquor was put into the drinks, but they were pretty strong and others agreed. Bottles start at about $75, which is really cheap compared to bottle service in the city; those normally start at $150. Plus bottles are half off on Wednesdays, I believe.
I really didn&#39;t want to pay cover and called ahead of time to see if there was no cover before a certain time. The girl on the phone said &#34;no cover before 11&#34; but they still tried to charge us at the door (two girls, mind you). Eventually, we convinced the guy to let us in plus he put some metallic sticker on my driver&#39;s license &amp; said I could get in next weekend for free by showing the sticker at the door. That&#39;s good customer service right there. 
All in all, had a great time. I&#39;m glad so many people were dancing because I only like to dance in bars when a lot of others are as well. The girls with fire &amp; on the swinging ring were cool to watch; not your typical go-go dancers like at every other club."

It seemed like we had problems from the beginning. We bought tix online and they had an issue where we couldn&#39;t print our tix. Great customer service skills would&#39;ve told them to mail the tickets to us. Instead, the manager or whoever that girl on the phone was told us they&#39;d resolve the problem and call us when they had it fixed. When the girl called us back a week or so later, she said &#34;problem has been resolved and you guys can come get your tickets any time before Saturday&#34;. So being me, I say, I thought you resolved the problem, if we have to still come pick up the tickets, you did not fix the problem. I wouldn&#39;t have much to complain about if I hadn&#39;t seen people turning in printed tickets at the door.

Then we came for NYE, since I had picked the tickets up already, we didn&#39;t have to stand in line, which was nice. We went inside and the coat check line was pretty full. My bf checked our coats and I waited for my friends to walk in. When they got in and waited in line, they told them the coat check was now full and to come back in 30 mins, what do you do until then?! After the second disappointment, we walked in and it was packed tight.  I wiggled my way in to the bar after finding the rest of our group and ordered a blue mf&#39;er (typically you only need one of these if that since I&#39;d had a mojito earlier). The drink was the weakest, least tasteful blue mf&#39;er I&#39;d ever had. We made our way to the dance floor and seemed like all you could do was fist pump or jump up and down. We looked for the &#34;other rooms&#34; of music they advertised online but didn&#39;t find any. Every few seconds it seemed  like some drunk person was trying to push you down. And some of them would even try to fight you if dont let them push you around. I stumbled upon another bar, hoping for a better drink experience. I ordered a tequila sunrise, which is pretty hard to mess up. And it was made with Jose Cuervo. Surprise surpise, it wasn&#39;t good either. It was really hard to keep a buzz going with all the sucky music and rude people everywhere. Like several other reviewers said, the effects are awesome here, but awesome enough to keep us entertained. When my friend made an attempt to make a request, the DJ told her they don&#39;t play hip hop there, and this is the kind of music they play all night until the end. They could&#39;ve at least played more than 3 songs with words. All we seemed to hear were beats all night... Eventually we couldn&#39;t take it anymore and decided to leave around 2. It&#39;s safe to say I won&#39;t be back, not even for another $25 party."

I didn&#39;t enjoy the music at all. The DJs in the reserved area and the main floor played mostly the ommmps oooomps beat which deafened my ear drums throughout the night. 

As commented by the past reviewers, there were quite a few jersey shore wannabes with their tight fitted Ed hardy shirt. I didn&#39;t care much for the crowd, since I was there to hang out with people from the chamber of commerce. HOWEVER, some of the jersey shore douchebags were f**king RACIST. I did not see this my self but one of our guys saw this on the dance floor. There were 2 Caucasian guys who circled around our group on the dance floor pointing their middle finger. So we stood out in the crowd being a group of Asians, but who the f do you think you are. Most of us are more accomplished and successful than you will ever be.

So I guess Tuesday is &#34;Ladies Night&#34; or as my friends know it... $1 drink night! We showed up after 9pm and my guy friend had to pay $5 to get in... wouldn&#39;t have been a big deal but the place was EMPTY. I get it, it&#39;s a Tuesday... but it was ALL men. I think there was myself and about 5 other girls. I felt like a piece of meat! 

What pissed me off the most is that it is $1 drink night..cocktails are $2 BUT when i opened a tab they authorized $50 on my card! I understand you don&#39;t want people to run out on you but come on I&#39;d have to do a lot of drinking on your $1 drink night to max out that tab! ... oh, and by the way, it&#39;s Thursday and the authorization is still holding... you should have signs or have the bartenders tell the customers they are doing this. The real kicker is... I paid my tab in CASH at the end of the night.

The DJ didn&#39;t seem to understand the concept of a drop, the drinks are average at best, and most people at Drink are *well* into their 30s. Very disappointing, especially since there&#39;s nothing better in the surrounding areas. You&#39;re better off at a dive bar."

I have been here many times, and I should admit that I always had a great time, except one.
For the New Years Eve Party I bought the special package where unlimited drinks were promised.Let me tell you - I paid a hefty amount for this unlimited drink package thinking that I can compensate for it easily.  I bought it online and when we handed the print out when we checked in. We were given some fancy band in exchange to be produced when we needed a drink. I put it on my wrist feeling all privileged!!
The club had other plans for me instead. As soon as I absorbed the music and the decor, I wished to get a drink for myself. There was this huge huge rush across each of the bar counters. Finally I squeezed myself to the front where the bartenders were supposed to help me fix a drink. 
I waited for 30 mins were I saw waves of people come and leave, somehow I was the only person not getting attended to. Then I realized that they were only attending people who had cash/card in their hand. After trying for 30 mins I changed to another Bar counter and tried waiting for another 20 mins, when I lost my patience and tried signaling to the bartender to attend me, I was promptly told by the bartender that I was rude(I admit in that case I was, but the bartender did get time for me, but this time I got some free advise if not drink ). She has been taking orders from people right beside me with cash, but she would always ignore me as if I never existed. 
In short they never attended anyone with the band in their hands for unlimited drink.
Feeling cheated was one feeling, but being duped on new years eve was another great one!!
I felt a bit consoled when another man walks to me and says that he has been observing me from the opposite side of the counter. He also had the same experience. I felt a lot better that I was not the only one who get ripped off that day!!!

So folks ... do enjoy the place, but with caution!"

Drink definitly owns the suburbs! I&#39;ve gone to so many clubs downtown &amp; this place is still my #1 choice. I&#39;ve spent two birthdays in a row here &amp; numerous friends birthdays.

Tuesdays &amp; Saturdays are the days to go! Always great music, it&#39;s always packed, there&#39;s a lot of room to move around or bars to go to so you don&#39;t have to wait forever for drinks. Not to mention two rooms inside. Outside theres another bar, which is so convenient in the summer so you dont have to walk back inside for new drinks. There are fire-pits &amp; heaters outside when it&#39;s cold out. Drink prices are so reasonable. Tuesdays are really great with $1-$4 specials. At the end of the night, they sell pizza by the slices which is great after a night of drinking for your drunk friends.

Schaumburg&#39;s hottest new club is called &#34;Drink.&#34;  

They have Alumni Club alumni with grey hair, guys in tuxes and top hats with bow ties, bikers, Vinnie from the Jersey Shore, guys whose barbers love Dragon Ball Z, women straight from 80s music videos, Dennis&#39; &#39;dead tooth&#39; wife from Always Sunny, bartenders doing &#39;Cocktail&#39; tricks, and Noah&#39;s Ark in the ladies&#39; room. 

The food is pretty good, with homemade potato chips with dill salt. And the drinks aren&#39;t super overly priced for being a &#39;club&#39; in Schaumburg.

That was one of the worst club experience I have ever had. I live in Schaumburg and I always try to support suburb clubs and bars because there are not many out here. I have visited Drink couple of times including times where it was named Alumni club in the past. I expected good music on that say . I mean come on 2 DJs playing same music all the time ???? Where was retro, disco, club music, techno??? None, zero.  10 minutes before midnight and that guy is playing music like his turntable went crazy. We went for drinks there was not many people at the bar and yet she is going so fast (spilling most of the vodka outside the glass) like there were 100 people in line. On top of that misery I saw vomit on the dancefloor, disgusting...We went home around 1am and finished in home with much better music. They should send their DJ to Europe or Ibiza so they could see how to celebrate with fine music."

I was very amazed when I went there last summer and ordered a pizza and spring rolls in their outdoor patio/bar. The  atmosphere was very nice; but the food blew me away. I would never expect that a suburban club, full of dudes wearing sweat pants and gym shoes would have such good food. I was there again today and decided to write this review.

Today, I ordered pizza again - which was very good, in fact better than many restaurants that call themselves pizzerias. I also ordered tequila lime shrimp skewers, which also tasted great. I could feel that the food in this place is made from fresh ingredients and it has a very gourmet taste. The presentation of food is also great. The shrimp skewers, were served on top of cabbage salad, which had a very delicious dressing.

Therefore, despite the overall low rating for this place, the food is very good. Anyone who had been to this place and didn&#39;t like it, should come back here just to try the food, it is just so surreal that this tacky place would have such good food.

Also, as a side note, if people hate this place so much, and give it such low ratings, why is it always so packed on weekend nights?"

Love the outdoor bar to get some air.  Parking gets full but there is parking across the small side street.. just BEWARE of PEOPLE walking in the dark...

warning to dudes who decide to wear hats or jackets to drink: you will be harassed by the parking staff. these fine specimens of late night laborers have a keen eye of spotting what clothing is or isn&#39;t permissible into their techno-fueled meat fest. so just don&#39;t it...put your prized hat or jacket into the car, and take a deep breath-you will need one. no, you will need several.

  

i had a craving for a bloody mary, simple drink to make, yeah?after waiting for 10 min. at the bar downstairs, the bartender told me that they ran out of bloody mary mix and that there should be some upstairs. being the determined girl that i am, i walked upstairs and waited about another ten + minutes, only to find out that they don&#39;t have bloody mary mix period. at that point i was ready to go..."

The website advertises half off everything (bottles) yet they failed to mention that does not include bottles of wine which is why we decided on this new place. Meh... it was fine. While I understand the place is new and there are always bumps to iron out, our waitress seemed a bit on the clueless side. We ordered a bottle of wine, someone else came out to open it and rather than pouring a taste filled each of our glasses to the rim. Um... OK... Again, i know I&#39;m not at a 5 star establishment, but as a general rule all servers should be able to work a wine opener and know how to pour a glass of wine. 

We ordered the fillet mignon sliders with horseradish which were quite tasty. The homemade chips it came with were also quite good. We ordered the carne asada tacos too. They were just OK. They seemed to be a bit flavorless, but for the price and the fact they are clearly not a Mexican restaurant, I wasn&#39;t going to complain. 

The atmosphere left a bit to be desired. There seems to be very little change other than new &#34;trendy&#34; furniture since this place has been Alumni Club. After we ate we moved inside where there was an eclectic mix of patrons sitting at the bar. We joined them for another couple glasses of wine and then left. 

I have to preface the following comment by first saying the staff was very kind and I acknowledge this place is not my normal cup of tea... but seriously, I almost asked if there was a &#34;how trashy can the staff look&#34; contest going on?!?!?

You know the cons: dirty bathrooms, overcrowded, obnoxious patrons...

First, I think its fitting to discuss the &#34;parking&#34; situation at this place.  5 dollars for Valet parking when you can park for free in one of the many lots they use at the local business seems to be a waste but I guess if you have an expensive ride that needs attention to it might be worth to sling a 10 spot so you can get &#34;VIP&#34; parking.  

So cover in the suburbs?  hmmm thats interesting granted its only 5 dollars but you might as well make it a dollar or something just out there like be BOLD and make it three if your trying to get some money in that place.  So you walk up to the front door and what do you know it 4 bouncers.. REALLY four in Schaumburg of all places.  Bottom line is 5 bucks to get in to some shitty ass place, here is the REAL review

Went there on Saturday night with my Fiance&#39; to meet a group of her girlfriends there for a birthday.  We showed up just around 10 when it seemed to be getting busy but we were lucky enough to escape the pounding music and lights inside to find a table in their outside seating section (THE ONLY REASON THIS PLACE IS GETTING 2 stars)

In waiting we get a text saying &#34;they wont let us in&#34; we come to find out that one of the ladies that was part of the birthday group had a brother which got in a fight with some bouncers at the Snuggery ( why that would have any implication on HER getting in is beyond me)  So while they are trying to decide how to handle the situation some bouncer grabs a video camera and films them until they leave the parking lot.  Nice going you creeper, maybe you needed some video for your late night wank session who knows but that is just outright weird and wrong as far as I&#39;m concerned. 

So to you D-bag bouncers I have no desire to ever come to your crappy &#34;club&#34; and want your managers to know you missed out on a group of people getting bottle service.  

OH the icing on the cake is after they left we come to find out more people were arriving for the birthday celebration and they said they were with out group, the bouncers laughed and just said they weren&#39;t aloud in.   

I hardly write reviews any more but this had to be stated!

When my husband and I got there the waitress didn&#39;t get to us like 10 mins after we sat down.  She asked what drinks we wanted and I asked what kind of martinis they had.  i can&#39;t remember which one it was but she came back and said they can&#39;t find the juice for the drink.  i asked her for a drink menu and her response &#34;a drink menu, umm...i&#39;ll be right back&#39;  umm, FOR REAL??
so after ordering drinks I asked for some kind of avacado spring rolls (yummm) these were really good.
that waitress had to leave so the tab got closed and she brough over the new waitress. after she introduced herself and asked if we needed anything, i asked the 2nd waitress to put in a order for spring rolls. the 1st waitress said, &#34;um, did you want me to place that, cuz&#39; i just closed your tab&#34;
umm, no not you, the 2nd waitress.
the point to all of the above....the 2 girls that took care of us were rude and mind you, when we got, not very many people were there. so, sorry you had to do some work.

*the place looked as if it were updated from the previous place.  that was a plus.
*we didn&#39; pay cover.. i agree with some of the other reviews, your a burb club not a chicago club.

*the cabana tents out back, great idea..we loved them..

The music was decent enough, but when the female dancer started posing &amp; hanging on the ceiling swing, that confused me a little, maybe this is typical at clubs these days but it looked very out of place.

On the outside there are bright colorful pictures of freshly cooked food. Step through the doors and you&#39;ll find a dark, dingy, depressing take out joint. But the kids wanted noodles, and really, how hard can it be to make some noodles? Panda Express does it all the time.

As we walked through the entrance, there was a guy right outside handing out samples.  Since we had decided that we&#39;d go here, I told him to save his sample for someone else.  We didn&#39;t need it.  We were already sold by the awesome pictures.  Now I regret having not taken the sample because it would have saved me from what turned out to be an extremely lackluster meal.

We ordered the yakisoba and I had a taste for soup noodles, so I ordered the chicken soup noodles.  Afterward we sat down to wait for the food.  The lady who took our order at the cash register, who I&#39;m guessing is also the owner/manager, started to argue with her cook about how she only carries Pepsi products because they are cheaper, and the cook told her with the money she was saving with the Pepsi products that she could put a few extra dollars into the cookware that they used. He pointed to the wok (and by the way, the ONLY wok that they owned), and said it didn&#39;t work.  She said she had bought it in Chinatown and had gotten it for $5 and that all Chinese woks were created th same.  

I watched them prepare the food and noticed that the meat was pre-cooked and that they put it in the microwave before throwing it in the only wok they owned to finish it off.  I also noticed that the guy that was handing out samples would come back in and reheat the samples that he hadn&#39;t handed out in the microwave and then head back out.  Guess that gives the samples that freshly cooked taste.

The food was done and it was placed in flimsy Styrofoam plates and bowls (seriously, probably the cheapest you could possibly find).  I had a hard time picking my bowl of soup noodles off of the tray because the bowl was so wobbly.
 
The food tasted like reheated leftovers.  That&#39;s the only way I can describe it.  It tasted of a former greatness was that perhaps three to five days old and had been re-heated several times by a college student as a midnight snack while studying for finals. 

And the crowning moment was when I looked at my cup and saw that it was a Philly Cheesesteak cup.  What the...

In all fairness, I found out later that Samurai Sam is affiliated with Cheese Steak Factory, hence the explanation for the cups, but c&#39;mon.  A little ghetto, don&#39;t you think?

I&#39;m sure other Samurai Sams around the country live up to the hype that their posters advertise, but this particular Samurai Sam is doing some major cost-cutting and quality is suffering immensely.  Someone needs to call up Samurai Sam and tell him that the owners/managers of his Schaumburg/Woodfield establishment have turned it into Samurai Scam (c&#39;mon, I&#39;ve been saving that one this whole review)."

All I have to say is that everything that you read in the other reviews is indeed correct. i just came back from the place, and I have now experienced it for myself.

I cannot actually believe that a restaurant of this low quality is in Woodfield Mall at all. I would expect this from a run down strip mall in the ghetto, but not something next to the Rainforest Cafe...

The food was bland as all get-out. The crab rangoons were extremely oily and had no flavor. I&#39;ve seen from sweet, through sour, through salty rangoons, and they&#39;re all fine -- these had no actual taste to speak of, besides overused frying oil taste.

I got the Teriyaki wrap (the Teriyaki is supposedly their signature item). The chicken was of low quality (I&#39;m not sure how else to describe it), it just had this strong &#39;animal&#39; flavor to it, like as if they used all dark meat and the worst cuts of it at that. The sauce was flavorful, but nothing to write home about. As expected, the wrap was stuffed with 80% rice, and the chicken and vegetables constituted a small portion (Rice is a cheap filler).

The strangest thing of all, perhaps, is that YES, the cooks seem to LEAVE the restaurant WITH YOUR FOOD, go someplace, and then come back. I read about this in the previous reviews and couldn&#39;t believe it, so I looked to see. Yes, sure enough, it happened with the crab rangoons. The guy put (what looked like pale, frozen rangoons) in a metal serving tray, and left the restaurant, and went to the restaurant next door to the left. I followed him to see where he was going, and saw him chatting with the staff at that restaurant. After 5 minutes, he came back with the rangoons, which now looked brown and chrispy -- he fried them in the other restaurant&#39;s kitchen, basically. Ok... what the heck?!

Sooo... overall, really really mediocre food (and I&#39;m being as nice as I can here), good service with a smile, but the whole &#39;cooking my food at another restaurant&#39; thing was a bit too strange even for me -- I grew up in a communist eastern European country, I thought I&#39;d seen it all. Again, I can&#39;t believe this place is in Woodfield..."

Liars. They demand a purchase.

There was a crazy line at Panda Express so we made our way over the Samurai Sam&#39;s in the Sears wing.  First time eating here though we&#39;ve passed it by many times in the past.   Good-sized eating space about six tables that seat 4 people each, and then counter space along the walls.  The tables are really close together which was made tighter by us bringing in a stroller.  My first impression of the tables though, was &#39;sticky.&#39;  I don&#39;t want to say dirty or unclean because that&#39;d be too harsh, but it just felt like the tables/chairs/floors could use a good (clean) wipe-down. 

Counter service with menu posted on the wall above the register.  They also cook the food on the spot, behind the counter.  Menu has pictures which is helpful when you have kids. Our food was cooked quickly, and service was not unfriendly, but not friendly either...more &#39;brusque&#39; or curt.   It was ok for fast-food stir-fry mall food, but greasier than I expected, particularly the potstickers which were burnt on the bottom.  Combo plates are kind of pricey.  Also, I guess the egg rolls are free with purchase of selected plates.  I didn&#39;t realize that at the time so I said No when they asked if we wanted one...only to realize later that it was free.  Would have been nice if we were told that, but it&#39;s ok.  We had teriyaki bowls (shrimp/chicken) with soba noodles and rice and they hit the spot but more because we were hungry than anything else."

What was hilarious: When we were looking at the menu, one of the workers rushed out with a coupon for free egg rolls!! Yes, please!

Sooo, we went in. The woman at the register said they&#39;re known for their teriyaki chicken -- so teriyaki chicken (and beef) we did!

The teriyaki sauce was pretty good. Flavorful, sweet, ... I don&#39;t think the beef was the best quality. The chicken, however, was much better.... 

The egg roll: not worth it. It had way too much crust. Not enough vegetables. They tasted horrible. Definitely not a fan of this.

Went on a Friday evening. This place was packed but we were able to snag a booth.
Ordered grilled calamari, fish tacos, a salad with shrimp + avocado, a filet special, and their &#34;Mile-high meatloaf&#34;. FYI:This place is incredibly noisy inside. They really don&#39;t have any elements to dampen the noise so conversation can be difficult.
I wanted to try the Itasca chicken but was told by the waitress that it took 40 minutes. They should put that on their menu because had I of known this I could have ordered it at the same time as we ordered our drinks and appetizers.
On to the food.......It was all disappointing. The fish in the fish tacos was cooked to oblivion. The calamari was basically swimming in balsamic so it became a one note item. The fillet was supposed to come with gnocchi but it didn&#39;t. It was more like spaetzle and I was told that the sauce tasted like tomato soup.
I had the misfortune of ordering the meatloaf since I couldn&#39;t get the chicken. It was not good.
Nowhere near a mile high. It was a slab of meatloaf plopped on some potatoes with some dried onion things on top. It had bacon on it. Here is the thing. The bacon was almost raw in one place and was also burnt black on the same piece. Now I owned a restaurant and I would go ballistic if I caught a cook sending that out of the kitchen no matter how busy they may have been. I called the waitress over and showed her. I told her to take it back to the kitchen and show the cook because there is no excuse for sending that out to a customer. I don&#39;t know if she did but a manager came over to apologize and offer to replace it or give our table a desert but I just wanted out at that point, so I passed on both. He did take it off of the bill.
So many good reviews of this place and I wonder what went wrong. A new cook? Kitchen turnover?  People evidently like it as based on the positive reviews. I can only share my experience, didn&#39;t want to turn it into a rant.
I wanted to like this place so much but ........... maybe I will work up the courage to try it again and give them a mulligan for my first time.

Cheers to all"

However we learned quickly that only 3 items are left for brunch from the brunch&#39; used to be &#39; menu. But that was ok because there were so many other delicious options. The restaurant is really really nice! Open, airy and very modern wood décor, gives it a great vibe and view, with one entire long wall, all windows overlooking the beautiful green golf course. If I I&#39;m ever in need of a party room, I&#39;m definitely booking this place. Overall good experience. The food was awesome, and my company was even better. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Ill be back definitely!"

My glass of wine was plentiful. The salmon had a crisp coating on top and was heated clear through. The salad was delicious. My husband liked the pot roast tacos. There&#39;s a very varied menu. The atmosphere is cozy pub and fun.  The service was attentive and prompt. We&#39;re from Indianapolis and it&#39;s definitely on our list of Chicago restaurants to return to when we come to Chicago.

The atmosphere is great, the food is great and so is the service. Christine our server was wonderful so was the manager that came over to check on things. The grilled cheese and fries was great, my husband had the skirt streak sandwich and really liked that as well. We also treated our selves to an order of creme brulee and it was awesome. They also have a great selection of craft beers. They also have a little beer brewery opening up right when you walk in. We will be back for sure."

I&#39;m not often in the Itasca area and most definitely didn&#39;t know where the country club was, but Yelp worked its magic and led me to Fox &amp; Turtle for a great lunch!

Unless you&#39;re familiar with the club you really wouldn&#39;t know this restaurant is here, but you definitely don&#39;t need to be a member to pay this restaurant a visit - it&#39;s open to the public! It&#39;s not visible from the neighborhood street it&#39;s off of, but there are signs at the entrance so that&#39;s helpful when driving down the long driveway back to the club.

The Fox &amp; Turtle entrance is located on the left side of the club - just go in the door and down the stairs and that&#39;s where this beauty is. The decor is super cool and from what I could tell it looks like they grew their own beer!

I met Kate S. for lunch and we were seated at a table by the window that overlooked he golf course. They have a huge outdoor patio with seating as well. At lunch time they offer a pick-2 menu for $12. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me.

I went with the soup of the day which was chicken and wild rice and then the chicken Caesar wrap. Food came out promptly and our waitress was nice and kept our waters filled. 

I absolutely loved the soup! It was creamy and filled with fresh ingredients. IMO, you can&#39;t really mess up a chicken Caesar wrap, but they definitely got it right. I was surprised by how large the wrap was! At first I thought it was weird that croutons were in the wrap as well, but I kinda liked the crunch.

I&#39;ll definitely be keeping Fox &amp; Turtle in mind next time I&#39;m in the area!"

What a perfect Friday afternoon lunch spot in one of my favorite areas, Itasca. I met Jacqueline B. here for lunch and I will most definitely be back again soon.

Though I was afraid I wasn&#39;t entering at the correct spot when I had first gotten here, a previous Yelper had photographed the &#34;cute main entrance&#34; so I was relieved when walking up to Fox &amp; Turtle. What a cool place! Once I entered I was seated right away next to big windows facing the Itasca Country Club golf course/outdoor patio seating. The restaurant itself has a classy atmosphere because of the Country Club but resembles a hip brewery at the same time. 

Jacqueline B. and I had taken advantage of the Pick-2 for $12 lunch options available from Monday-Friday 11am-3pm. Of course, I had to try the Mac &amp; Chicken with the Soup Of The Day: cream of chicken with wild rice. The wait for our meals was short and our waitress was sweet and attentive. I honestly would have came back for dinner the same day to try a heavier meal and perhaps a drink! 

So obviously for the most exciting part of this review...the Mac &amp; Chicken. This was a hell of a lot tastier than I thought it was going to be. The cheese was tangy, there was juicy white pieces of chicken throughout, the serving size was actually pretty large (I had to take a to-go box home!) plus they used my favorite spiral noodles. Can you tell I eat a lot of mac &amp; cheese...

All in all, I appreciated the service, the view and especially the rather inexpensive lunch option available. It was honestly a super satisfying visit! Though I&#39;m not a golfer in any way, shape or form, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to bringing the boyfriend here to play a few holes and grab something to eat on a nice day! I&#39;m in the Itasca area pretty often so I sense that Fox &amp; Turtle will become a new regular for me."

Located in the lower level at the Itasca Country Club, Fox and Turtle doesn&#39;t attract people who just happen to be walking by. It&#39;s more of a destination spot. 

They&#39;ve been open to the public for about a year (I certainly didn&#39;t realize it had been that long). I wanted to visit and so we made our way to downtown Itasca a few weeks back. There plenty of parking in their private lot which is nice. You have to either walk down some stairs or take an elevator to get down to the dining level. 

When we first walked in, it seemed we may have come in the wrong door. We keep walking and eventually came upon the host stand. We were quickly seated next to the window facing the golf course. This worked for me. The trees looked beautiful and even though the weather wasn&#39;t quite beautiful, the greens were. 

Our server was excellent!  She explained everything and was quick to anticipate our needs. I would go back just for Bridgette!

We had burgers and a steak sandwich. The hubs loved the burger and I ate almost every bite of my sandwich. The dressed arugula on the sandwich had a nice bite. Their menu had quite a few things I want to try. So yes, we will definitely be back!"

The food is wonderful and the portions are generous. It was hard to make up my mind when looking at the menu so I took the recommendation of the staff to try the daily special, the Pot Roast. I was not disappointed! It was the best Pot Roast I&#39;ve ever tried - tender and delicious."

Fox and Turtle (which is probably walking distance from our new digs...if you&#39;re not lazy, that is.) is going to definitely be a regular stop.  At least for lunch.  Here&#39;s why:

1.  The skirt steak sandwich is freaking incredible.  Seriously.  There is delicious medium-medium rare skirt steak, caramelized onions and mushrooms, blue cheese, and some tasty garlicky sauce that they throw on top of the arugula that made me even like the plants on my meat.  Amazing.  (We also got a french dip, which was good, but it was nothing compared to the goodness of the skirt steak sandwich).  The fries are hand-cut and perfectly cooked too with just the right amount of salt.  Yum.    

2.  The service was good (although we were there right as they opened and no one was there yet).  I&#39;ve heard horror stories about the dinner service there so we were glad to have that going for us.

3.  The restaurant looks cool as hell.  There&#39;s a very cool rustic/industrial/but classy vibe going on there and you have a nice view of the golf course to boot.

4.  There is a small brewery when you walk in that is not open yet (Itasca Brewing Company...you let me know when you are open!!!) but the list and tappers that were written on were all awesome local taps.  This will be a gem (for craft beer drinkers) once it opens and could definitely be a good waiting or beer dessert stop as you are coming or going.    

5.  Speaking of beer, Fox and Turtle actually has a decent list too.  Not a million crafts you probably haven&#39;t tried, but a craft list nonetheless. 

Overall, I was pretty impressed with this place.  I can see it being rough if you are there during a busy time because it all (including the staff) seems very new and perhaps unable to handle a rush, but at off peak times it is awesome.  At least if you are eating the steak...we&#39;ll see how the spicy mac and cheese is next.  Keep you posted!"

The service was great. We even left our doggie bag on the table and our waitress ran it out to us.
The only thing I would like to see them do is have a beer list. They have a wine list and whiskey list. We were not seated in eye shot of the tappers, and our server could only name a few."

Located in the lower level of the Itasca Country Club, this place has an awesome chef and there is something on the menu for everyone.

You can enter from the front of the building or the rear but if you enter from the front, you need to go downstairs.  The vibe is the current trend of warm industrial.  I love the light fixtures and the bar doors to one of the private dining spaces.  And, Itasca CC is charming on it&#39;s own!

One of the daily specials was 3 beef tenderloin sliders with a some sort of roasted tomato compote and another sauce.  They were delish.  They have three flatbreads, all sound and looked good.  My husband loved his skirt steak sandwich.  It was huge and great bread and  he couldn&#39;t finish it.  Lots of good sounding salads, soups and other sandwiches on their large and varied menu. They have 2 for $12 lunch deal and from what I saw this is a screaming deal.  I want to try this with the mac and cheese and wedge salad.  I love wedgies! ;-)    They are waiting on the go from the village to open their own brewery.  The space looks great, how cool is that!

We plan on coming back for brunch on Saturday or Sunday.  This one is a keeper and so glad we checked it out."

After the meal, we really had to agree with him. I wouldn&#39;t have thought to look to a country club for such a quality meal, but with a little help from Yelp, we decided to try it out. We arrived pretty late and I&#39;m pretty sure the three of us were the only customers still at the restaurant, so they led us to a booth and made sure we had everything we wanted. We ordered sliders, a burger, and a chicken club sandwich. They took a little while to come out, but with such a good playlist jamming away as we talked, passing the time was easy. When the food did come, we were pretty amazed. The portions were very generous and everything looked fantastic. The burger was rare (as I had ordered), the chicken juicy, and the sliders flavorful. The sides of fries were well seasoned and fresh, and really, everything was great. In the end, we were extremely happy to find such a good place open late and exactly where we needed it to be. The portions were large and the prices were exactly what you&#39;d expect based on quality/size. I will definitely be coming back."

I was astonished that I had grown up in the next town over and never knew there was a country club in Itasca!  Guess that underscores that we were not of the 1% back then!

This is a really well-designed place.  You come in the pub doors and go down a flight of open air stairs to enter the actual place.  We were greeted right away and shown to our table.  They offer a good selection of local and other beers and many more cocktails.  I got the skirt steak for my entrée - it came with a loaded baked potato and huge onion rings stacked on top.  Husband had a wedge salad to start and the filet with baked potato (Some things never change).  Service was incredibly fast.  For a Saturday night at 7:00 we literally had our meals within about 15-20 minutes from sitting down.  While my steak was over-cooked, it is hard to time a filet at medium rare and a thin cut like mine to be done at medium at the same time and it didn&#39;t suffer in flavor.  We had the spumoni gelato as well - a little &#34;thicker&#34; than I had expected (isn&#39;t gelato supposed to be creamy and fluffy?)

We will definitely be back - perhaps with the twins in tow - for brunch or lunch sometime soon."

I ordered the buffalo chicken sliders and didn&#39;t care for the at all. They just put some fried small boneless buffalo wings on a bun and they were overcooked and didn&#39;t have much meat on them. Very disappointing considering how great the rest of the food we ate was. 

I liked that they had crayons and coloring pages for my little ones to keep them occupied. My kids got ancy towards the end and I saw that they had a grassy area for kids to play in the outside seating area - next time I&#39;ll take them outside to run off some energy. :) The service was fantastic.

The walk from the parking lot, down stairs, through the entire restaurant to the bar was long and awkward. You feel as if you&#39;re interrupting people&#39;s dinners just to grab a drink. The prices are high on the food menu as well as the drink menu. And in order to get nachos you have to order the loaded fries without fries and with tortilla chips and add chili. We were told by the bartender that this &#34;is what people usually do when they want nachos&#34;. It seems easier to me to just put nachos on the menu if they&#39;re requested this frequently. They were however, very good and fresh. 
The place has great potential. It&#39;s huge, the food looked and smelled good. But I was also thrown off by a man who seemed to be the manager when he was unable to tell us prices of the draft beers. Overall the staff was really friendly and smiling. 
They recently opened to the public, I&#39;m assuming because they were struggling a bit. They would really benefit by having drink specials to get people in the door."

I ordered quesadillas for an appetizer, the rosemary and raspberry martini, and the New York strip steak. The quesadillas were absolutely delicious and not greasy. The martini was mixed just strong enough; I didn&#39;t know how the combination of rosemary and raspberry flavors would work, but it was surprisingly delightful. The steak could&#39;ve been better for the $29. I got it cooked medium rare, and while it was just that, it was incredibly dry. There was a lot of juice on the plate--I feel like that was all of the juice that was once in the steak. It was also really charred, so all I could taste with every bite was just the char/burnt flavor and not the meat itself. The vegetable and rice sides were pretty good, though. I&#39;d probably come back to this restaurant should I ever be in the Chicago area again, but I would definitely order a different entree."

The food is excellent - I heard the head chef came from Rosebud or Rosebud prime, and has done some really nice things with the menu (that prime rib dip sandwich served with house made chips and umami au jus is my go to). The 3 star rating comes mainly from the disorganized service and amateur bar staff. Went here for my dad&#39;s birthday and sat with a group of 8-10 people. We came to the table at different times and when the last group of 3 arrived it took over 20 minutes for them to get their beers. Waitress claimed it was due to the swim meet that was cancelled due to rain.. but do you really think 12 year olds are downing bottom shelf liquor and blue moons? Right. Anyways she did seem sorry but continued to disappoint on the service front, even saying &#39;she hopes the food comes out on time, haha&#39;. Its fine looking back but when you&#39;re saying it to a hungry group of people while fumbling over drink orders it wasn&#39;t funny. The decor, layout, and views of the 18th green are awesome, especially form what the Country Club used to be (think maroon seats and floral carpet) and I would like to try the brewery one day (if its ever open). The food is consistently good I just think the staff needs to get it together (one bartender did not speak english, so if I order two beers on the menu and a drink on your menu and you don&#39;t know what i&#39;m saying and need to grab the other bartender.. I&#39;m not sure how to correct that problem). This was probably the main reason for the delay in the drink orders earlier in the evening. i&#39;d really like to give this place a more positive rating but the service has given me reasons on more than one occasion not to do so. I&#39;ll be back as my family is from the area and I can&#39;t complain about the food (also had some chili fries for an appetizer, very tasty! other items included a shrimp scampi and mexican burger) but want to let the outsiders know to expect a few hiccups along the way."

When you first come in there is this odd bar just sitting against the wall and it confuses you thinking maybe you came in the wrong door, but keep continuing forward and you will see the hostess.

If you are interested in dining here, maybe keep that in mind. 

Our experience was typical for any other bar we have been to. My food was alright, but nothing I would crave. I enjoyed the beer selection and my wife enjoyed the wood decor. However, the service was not that great and the wait staff spent a majority of the time standing around gossiping (we could overhear them).

Well, trust me I tried to finish, but there was no dag-gone way I could!!! The wedge salad was 3/4 of a head of lettuce drenched in all the yummy goodness of thick cut bacon pieces, blue cheese crumbles, cherry tomatoes and amazing blue cheese dressing. Then out came the chicken!!! The chicken, no $h!t, was almost a whole chicken... The sauce it came with was to die for... Don&#39;t get me started on the potatoes!

She offered me two samples of different brews she would think I&#39;d like and I ended up ordering a glass of her first recommendation. Kristine also recommended the house potato chips to go along with my veggie burger (Never say NO to their potato chips).. The food is delicious! You must try it for yourself! We spilt the loaded fries, I ordered the veggie burger and my fiancee ordered the chicken mac n cheese.

There were three of us in our part and we came for lunch. The place was not that busy. Our waitress was SO sassy.

We went there tonight for dinner and it was bustling and lively.  The host told us it was about a 45 minute wait.  We had second thoughts about waiting that long at 6:30 on a Wednesday night, and considered eating at the upper bar, but up there they only serve drinks.  So we decided to just take our chances and wait upstairs with a beer.  Ten minutes later we were seated.

The place is a new and improved versions of the old Harry&#39;s.  The front windows facing Vail have been replaced with clear garage doors and screens.  So when it&#39;s nice out you can sit and feel the breeze from outside without having to experience the bugs.  There are also more TVs than before so it&#39;s easy to watch the game from anywhere in the place.  They kept the patio!  This is my favorite patio to eat on of any I&#39;ve ever been to in Chicagoland.

The food is a notch above &#39;bar food&#39; and there are plenty of beers and wines to choose from as well as mixed drinks.  The place seemed very noisy, but looking back, we were able to speak at the same volume we would if we were walking down State street during a work day.  So it&#39;s not like we had to shout or read lips to carry on a conversation.

We would go back.  We were told they have a DJ for music and are considering live bands at some point."

Good: This place has great happy hour and normal beer specials. I drank summer shandy all night for $2 a glass. Can&#39;t go wrong with cheap beer, even if I know they are trying to get rid of their keg. The food was served pretty quick, which was nice, and the server was relatively prompt. 

Bad: from the start the hostess was out of her element. We walked in asking for a table for two, assuming there was not a wait as I could clearly see an open table in front of me. She informed me that I was third in line and when I asked about the open table she said she was &#34;seating them now&#34;. Low and behold 20 minutes later, after we have been seated, that table was still empty. Now I can take it on the chin but what do I see, the boyfriend of another server gets that table sitting my himself. 

The food was ok, kinda hipster-ish for me, but ok. The apps were a little over priced but the entrees were reasonable. 

Recap:  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be heading back to this bar, unless I&#39;m just going for the drink specials and no food. This is a shame because the bar layout is great and it looks very welcoming."

Good beer menu.  Good wine menu for a neighborhood place.

It used to be called Harry&#39;s and they always had decent burgers and good drinks with a nice patio out back.

When we arrived, an over served patron was stumbling down the front stairs, cigarette in hand and almost had the railing in her mouth.

I ordered the Long Island tea (great), the mac-n-cheese fritters with coarse ground mustard, and a trio of sliders: Kobe, pork belly and braised beef short rib. I wasn&#39;t asked how I wanted the trio cooked and offered no suggestions. The Kobe slider was dry, overcooked and tasteless as was the pork belly (difficult to do considering it&#39;s a fatty cut to begin with) and the braised beef was more like jerky.

The mac-n-cheese fritters were a winner, but since they had bacon in them, I couldn&#39;t offer a bite to my vegetarian wife. The coarse ground mustard dipping sauce was a good accompaniment. 

I&#39;d go back for the mac-n-cheese fritters and a cocktail but I&#39;ll pass on their burgers or sliders."

Really still Harry&#39;s but all cleaned up. I do miss the second floor viewing area that used to be along the South side of the second story. This used to be an old pool hall and that was a viewing area which was historic and unique. The exposed brick is beautiful. The space is too loud however without the second story structures. We had a hard time hearing each other. Overall a nice place.

My dad was excited to hear about their opening, as he always wants to get their burger and hang out when he visits me downtown. So, we came for dinner during the week to check it out.

We had to wait a few minutes (less than 10) to get seated. The interior reminds me of the downtown location - exposed brick, wooden furniture and TVs everywhere! It was busy, but not overly crowded.

They have some great beer specials during the week, so we all ordered Coronas while we perused the menu. It&#39;s very similar to the other location, with an emphasis on their burgers. My mom got some soup and my dad and I both ordered a burger. The food was really good, with big portions. Apparently it took longer than usual to come out of the kitchen, because the manager (I think) came over to apologize for the wait, but we didn&#39;t notice because we were just catching up and watching the Cubs game on TV.

It seems like they have been working out the kinks after the initial opening, as we didn&#39;t experience any problems with the service or food during our visit. All in all, a good solid 4 star addition to the downtown AH scene. As we were leaving, it was beginning to pick up and get busier, so I would like to come back and see the nighttime/bar scene."

The food was amazing my courtland burger was cooked to perfection. Hard to find a place that actually knows how to prepare and cook a burger to temperature . The bar was busy inside full . Patio outdoors was awesome as well, they have a outside bar with 4 drafts and fully stocked liquor. Ordered a beer outside and they didn&#39;t have it but the bartender rushed inside and.

Our service was not great and I had to ask twice to get a refill on water.  The food was a mixed bag but I&#39;m hoping they can work through some of their issues and make it work in downtown A.H.  I&#39;ll definitely give it another try.  

The renovations to the space were done well and those of you that remember Harry&#39;s will be happy to see the restaurant has been refreshed and updated.  Sadly, something in the updated design killed the acoustic properties of the space and it&#39;s now incredibly loud.  At a small table, we could barely hear each other without talking super loud.  If you&#39;re going there to have a conversation over a drink or food, you may be a bit disappointed.  

We ordered two appetizers and two burgers
Nachos - The nachos were just okay and the portion size was good but they were bland (lacking seasoning and any hint of spice in the chili). All of the chips were soggy.

Chicken and Waffles - Not your typical bar food.  The chicken was fine, but nothing special and the sriracha infused maple syrup didn&#39;t have the kick we were hoping for. 

Burgers - the burgers were the highlight of the meal. Both were big and have lots of toppings.  The bacon on both burgers was crispy and they give you a huge amount of fries."

There was no wait.  We were greeted by 3 friendly employees when entering and were seated promptly.  Plenty of sports on the TVs around the room.  Friend found a decent beer and i had a coke.

We both had burgers (cortland&#39;s) which were very filling.  No complaints.  Fries were great.  Total bill was 35 bucks which seemed on par with the neighborhood. 

I&#39;m going to give them 5 stars because everything seemed to be in line w/ expectations.

Cortland&#39;s will have to keep it up and offer other great options as there are already a couple good burgers in close vicinity.   Welcome to the neighborhood."

This place could be great, but the service is horrible.  It&#39;s not that busy, they don&#39;t even have the upstairs open.  Something is wrong with the kitchen, because no food is coming out to any tables.  I&#39;d wait a few months before trying this place, maybe they&#39;ll figure it out.

Updated from one to three stars:
Went back again after they had several months to work things out.  The burgers are good, but you&#39;ve had better.  The service is ok, but I watched the bar tender stare at the ceiling like she had nothing to do while I waited for my drink.  The waitress apologized, but it seems that some basic management issues remain.  We ordered chips and guacamole (I know, a risky move) and the guac tasted like it was made months ago in a New Jersey factory.  When it was delivered to the table, the guy that brought it was do awkward (not our waitress) that it felt like he had never been in a restaurant, much less served someone.  I really miss the former restaurant/bar that at least had live music.  No one asked for or needed what Cortlands has delivered..."

Unfortunately, in this case, I see a disappointing trend.

Service - lacking, especially in the basics such as refilling of water and soda, removal of used app plates, &#34;enjoy your meal&#34; etc - not sure if this is supposed to be a hip way of treating guests, but the demographic in AH is not the neighborhoods of Chicago - maybe a rethink needed here.

Food Quality - bland - we had mac fritters as an app - no flavor whatsoever. The Cortland burger was nothing special on an overly toasted bun. Fish tacos were OK, Mac and cheese had little flavor just like the app. The grilled cheese was very hard for my kid to eat. 
The fresh cut fries were probably the best item we had, but that&#39;s not going to differentiate much from the competition in the area

Atmosphere - it was a busy evening, a lot of TV&#39;s in the place. There is a confusion of character it seems, with trying to pay homage to the old Harry&#39;s, and searching for its own identity, a mixture of young and old guests throughout.

I never once saw a manager/owner on the floor - IMO that goes a long way in a neighborhood like this.

So, would I go back, right now its a maybe, but there are many others ahead on the list of go to places."

Had to go inside to get seated outside? Sign says wait for a hostess no one showed up so in we went. Came right back out and were seated. Beers were cold service was ok at best. Food SO SO. Ordered a burger thought it was going to be special. Well was I disappointed. The size of the burger was very big YEAH, Taste like hmmmm, .... not much even laden with crispy onion rings, guacamole and bacon. And who doesn&#39;t love bacon could help this burger.. fries were a tad overcooked. The wait staff although easy on the eyes didn&#39;t seem to quite get it. My meal was finished before she came back and asked if we waited another beer. Thankfully we had water to get us through. They have one of the best locations in downtown Arlington Heights. Now if they can only make something of them selves. If your a people watcher this is a good place to watch the people go by or enjoy the bands outside on Friday&#39;s. I know of a place it Cary that has the BEST burgers around. Too bad I was hoping to find another place but going to pass on this place for awhile. Maybe a year down the road if they are still here I will revisit them. For now move along."

The place was packed. It has a good atmosphere....pretty much the same as Harry&#39;s though, albeit a bit cleaner looking since everything is updated. I like what they&#39;ve done with the place.

We waited about 10 minutes for a table, and were sat upstairs. The waitress was overwhelmed, but handled it amazingly. No complaints there at all!

The food was great! The Cortland Street burger was as delicious as advertised. I get to eat it for the next few days too...it&#39;s huge! Fries were the best I&#39;ve ever had. 

Our problem was that there was no good option for our daughters. No kids menu, just an upscale bar menu for them to choose from. Now, I don&#39;t necessarily expect a bar to cater to kids....but this place isn&#39;t really a bar. It&#39;s a restaurant....and a restaurant on a prominent corner in the middle of a suburban community full of families. I may go back for a burger and a beer with buddies (though like I said it&#39;s not really a bar...there are better bars), but we won&#39;t be back with the family. And they&#39;re our standard dinner guests most nights. 

So it&#39;s a good date place for adults, but go elsewhere for a beer or if you happen to have procreated."

The problem is they need more ironing! Slow service and poor communication was the start of the experience. Our waitress took out drink order and then came back with my friend&#39;s beer but not mine. Then said there was a keg being changed and walked away. After 15 she came back and wanted to take our dinner order. I still had no beverage. I then asked again for another beer. She left and 10 minutes later I had to flag her down and ask about a beer. I finally got one 30 minutes into waiting. The food was good but kind of cold. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll go back.

We were dining with 2 children.  When no kid&#39;s menu was provided, we inquired.  We were told that they could offer buttered noodles, grilled cheese or cheese quesadilla for kids.  Although chicken tenders and cheeseburgers are on the regular menu, there is no kid size offering of these items and, in fact, server discouraged choice of tenders describing them as &#34;a little spicy.&#34;  Clearly, they do not want to encourage young diners.  However, this is a surprising strategy for a downtown Arlington restaurant (kid central).

My husband and I ordered salads.  He said his was just OK (BBQ Chicken) and mine was not (Chopped chicken).  I was eating it, thinking at least something was missing.  I asked the server if there was supposed to be bacon in the salad (as there usually is in chopped salads but not in mine) and she said no.  I thought for sure I had read that in the description, but in the interest of getting out of there, I proceeded to eat my very boring salad.  We paid the bill and as we were leaving I checked the menu.  Half of the ingredients were missing from my salad (red peppers, pasta, bacon).  I talked to the manager and explained what had happened and she was less than apologetic.  She suggested I could come back and try again at no charge.  Right..."

I decided to go to Cortland&#39;s Garage early since it was a Friday night and I wanted to avoid a wait.  We got there around 4:45 and were seated immediately.  We were seated at the last table.  What I&#39;d like to do in this review is tell you me experience, but also try to not be overdramatic since this was the first week.  Believe it or not, being a waiter/waitress is not as simple as it seems.  Also, everyone has room to grow and improve (that seems to be a shocker to some).

The Good:

- The waitress that we had was very friendly and attentive.  We saw her many times, and she always asked for feedback
- Many additional workers stopped by from time to time to ask for feedback, which shows they are committed to fixing mistakes early on.
- The environment is nice, and it was good to get fresh air in the restaurant with the opened garage doors. 
- After looking around at what other people ordered, I thought about trying a few items the next time.  Their menu includes many items that I was interested in and I was disappointed that I could not try them all at once.
- The nachos were good as advertised.  I&#39;m all about nachos and while they may not have been mind-blowing, they were good.
- The portions were what I would expect.  The nachos filled me up more than they appeared they would.  I took home half of my meal from being too full.
- The men coming around to grab plates and give boxes for leftovers were always watching to see how they could help a table.
- The manager, or possibly owner, came to ask feedback and was very concerned about any issues we had.
- Despite customers who might have had an experience that was not stellar, many people were smiling and having a good time.
- Nice to see the location filled once again.

The Issues:

- No place to wait.  We were fortunate to have been seated early.  I might not have been interested in standing around while waiting for a spot if we had to wait.
- Space was tight.  I had more than enough space, but I&#39;m not sure everyone else did at other tables.
- My beer glass was cracked on my second beer.  I noticed and was given a free beer (free beer is always a positive though)
- My girlfriend and I ordered burgers.  She had waffle fries as a side and I had regular cut fries.  Our fries were switched when the order came out.    
- Upstairs wasn&#39;t open despite a wait (my assumption is that they want to make sure they have everything running smoothly first before opening that up)

I&#39;m looking at this place with the glass half full.  There is room for improvement, and that was my mentality going in there for the first time.  The food is solid and the environment is a nice addition to Downtown Arlington Heights.  For those who had poor service, I hope you try it at a time when the restaurant staff is more experienced.  There is no excuse for bad service and cold food, but there should also be realistic expectations in some cases.  For those of you who read this whole thing, kudos to you."

Good food means you have to wait especially at prime time eating like 6-7 on a weekend.  Burgers are delicious, fries are yummy, and portions are huge.  My only compliant would be that when my husband asked for a burger with a side salad he got fries instead.  When we pointed this out to the person (not our waitress) bringing the food, they took his burger back.  After 5 minutes the waitress apologized and said why did they take your food???  She went back and brought back the same burger, fries, and a side salad."

Awesome service in the dining room and particularly at the bar. Nicole the bartender is not only gorgeous she&#39;s the best bartender ever! Always attentive and you&#39;re never left thirsty! The BBQ wings are top notch and the bleu cheese sauce is spot on. Overall an awesome place that I&#39;d recommend to everyone.

This was our second attempt to get in, since it has always been so crowded. I must say, the look of the bar as a whole is much improved from the old Harrys, but that was the only improvement. We found the food to be just average and WAY OVER PRICED! We ordered an appetizer, 2 burgers, and 2 drinks each and our bill was over $70, I find that to be quite pricey for lunch. We did luck out with a great server. She was very attentive, but I believe we had the best server in the restaurant. Most of the tables had to ask for silverware, plates and cups for their pitchers of beer. I realize Cortland&#39;s is still working out the kinks, but I think it&#39;s time to get your act together. Your bar in the city is so successful, but I think you need to take a different approach to a suburban family community."

The reason I am giving it two stars is because we got sat a two top tall boy and it was so small there was barely room for our food and drinks. The food was not that good either... Grilled cheese sounded good but there are three pieces of bread and not enough cheese. My husband said his burger was okay despite missing a big chunk of his bun. We both got the tots and they were bland, tasted like they had no seasoning at all"

It is so loud!  This is a neighborhood bar people not the city.  This place is not family friendly at all. I overheard them talking about trying to discourage people with kids from even coming in.  The food, considering that they are newly open is fair, although my husband thought his burger was good.  The buffalo chicken salad was terrible with 3 dry tasteless pieces of chicken.  I asked our server if it was always this loud and even she said it makes her angry.  If you want to enjoy a meal with friends,  this place is not for you.  I will not be going back."

Sat upstairs for the Cub &amp; Blackhawk game and everyone was just talking with each other and you have your own little small bar to get a great selection of craft beer.

I had the cortland burger--avocado, bacon, onion straws.  The fresh cut fries were delicious as well.  Our service was great.  The place does get crowded, but that means it is doing something right."

It was already pretty packed by 5:45 so we had to wait 15 or 20 minutes for a table, but it wasn&#39;t too bad since we found a spot to wait at the bar. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive and once we were seated our drinks and food came out quickly. The food was great and from what I saw they have good drink specials throughout the whole week. The only negative thing I have to say (and it&#39;s not even that big of a deal) is that the entrance has no waiting area, so if there&#39;s a lot of people waiting for tables then it gets a bit crowded at the door. But we had a great experience here and we will definitely be back soon."

They had great drink specials, a fun atmosphere. Sadly the patio was closed and it was a perfect night for it and the music was a little too loud to hold a conversation/successfully order drink. If they could make a small adjustment on noise level this place would be 5 star rating. I really enjoyed it. Great staff!"

What a gem for our neighborhood! This is our 3rd time here since they opened and they have yet to disappoint. Food is fantastic, service was great and it is a great place to watch a game. The perfect slice of the city has been added to our suburb."

Being a mid-50&#39;s guy, I&#39;ve never felt and been treated like I was out of place. The atmosphere was like a college bar where staff and customers were close friends. Never seen (or heard) a customer go to the waitress station at the bar and say &#34;what&#39;s up b_t_hes&#34; except when partying with my sons @ college. Attention was definitely paid to the friends of the staff and the 20/30 something crowd. My 1st empty drink sat on the bar rail completely empty for over 10 minutes and I sat 6 feet away from the bar station! I actually had to get the bartender&#39;s attention to get a second drink. The third was timed at 7:39 before I was asked. I had to ask a second time for the Bulls game on a nearby TV. I didn&#39;t mind asking a second time, but the unconcerned attitude was not what I expected. On the plus side, the wings and homemade buffalo sauce were one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Problem is, the atmosphere wasn&#39;t welcoming so I won&#39;t return. Bottom line, if you&#39;re over 40, there&#39;s much better places in downtown Arlington Heights than the Garage. Once the newness and the 20/30 something fad fades, so will the Garage. They cater to their friends, not the customers that will give them longevity."

The front door makes for an awfully cold eating experience. They will have to think about getting another door at the bottom of the stairs because that was dreadful to try and eat while the cold air is blowing in every time someone came or went. The white bus boy/runner, blonde hair, skinny, was extremely rude multiple occasions. We asked how long the wait was and he said I don&#39;t know, I mean wait if you want. Then he brings out the food and doesn&#39;t know who any of the food belong&#39;s to and was just yelling out what it was. We asked if it was without this or was this and he said, I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t see under the stuff on it. Maybe you should know what you are bringing out to a table and not be such a snot. Then our regular server who looked like the girl from We&#39;re the Millers, just with brownish hair, was the worse server I have had in years. She never smiled once and was not friendly at all. Getting her to give us a refill on a drink was like we were asking for the world. The food was mediocre, nothing to write home about at all. The burgers were tasteless along with the fries. The other girls working seemed to be pretty friendly but our server was not and between everything else, it was an awful experience and was completely overpriced. We will not be back!"

We went there the other night and the menu is about the same with a few delicious additions....like the Chicken and waffles appetizer. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Any of the appetizers are a great choice, chili is phemomemal, and of course the famous &#34;Cortland Street Burger. &#34; We will definitley be going here again and again!!!!!"

Seriously, I heard more people bashing the place than anything else.  If you want perfection don&#39;t visit for 3 months or so.  Our burgers were very tasty (yes,some ingredients were missing), the service was slow and the bartender did not know how to make a long island iced tea, but, it being their 2nd day we came in without expectation and had a great night at the Garage!  The remodel is beautiful, women&#39;s bathrooms are beautiful and quite functional (if you compare it to Harry&#39;s), garage door windows and crank out windows give the place a wonderful feel and I love the staging of tables from low to high to bar.  A couple of things regarding décor ... a little &#34;cush&#34; on the back of the wall benches would be nice and the restaurant needs a bit of baffling to reduce the noise level.  It was very loud when the place was full. I can&#39;t wait for my next visit."
