Come for the artistry, the flames, the smiles and the goofiness that is somehow the Japanese/American hibachi.

Big and roomy, there are plenty of cooking tables to be seated at. Been here twice, once as a large party of 12 and another a party of 4. We had our personal chef blast flames and play with our food. 

If you&#39;re just hungry and want terriyaki chicken, there are other places to go to that&#39;ll be better priced and with more food options. Tsukasa veers on the entertainment side and is a fun and easy time to spend on a celebratory meal."

I&#39;ve been here for both lunch and dinner on different occasions, but I ALWAYS order the Golden Shrimp- yum! 

Lunch: They have an awesome lunch deal. When we arrived, we were actually seated in our own table rather than being seated with another party-- which is a plus for me (I don&#39;t know why). As mentioned, I always order the golden shrimp so I got that while my boyfriend got the chicken. Both came with fried rice as well as a soup or salad and were about $13 each from what I remember. 

The soup is immediately served once we get our orders in. The soup is a warm, savory, yet light. It&#39;s has mushrooms as well has fried onions-- really tasty! The chef was great- we had great conversation and definitely cooked everything to perfection. 

Golden Shrimp is always satisfying. The egg yolk sauce is much lighter than other places, and, in my opinion, the best I&#39;ve ever had! 

Dinner: I had dinner here with my sister awhile back. Like lunchtime, they seated us in our own table instead of seating us with other people (yay for me!). Food is great as always and I love how the room didn&#39;t get foggy/smelly even though there were so many chefs cooking at the same time. 

I definitely recommend-- the food and atmosphere are both great!"

The only reason I give only 4 instead of 5 stars is because the first time I went the &#34;show&#34; part was so much fun, the chef had great energy and kept us laughing the whole way though.

I&#39;ve been here like 4 times. I actually tend to like the filet here better than the Vernon Hills location. I&#39;ve gotten bad (chewy/gristly) filet a couple times at VH, and the filet here always seems to be so buttery soft. They&#39;d probably tell me they use the same meat distributor for both locations, and who knows?! that may be true. Maybe it&#39;s a mental thing at this point. 

Anywho. Why have I said any who twice in one review? A little excessive. This location is quite a bit smaller than VH, but i like the inside better. It&#39;s got a bit more of an ambiance to it. 

The fried rice is to die for. Sometimes i&#39;ll get an extra side order to take home with me, since i never finish my filet. That way i can make it into two meals! :) 

Chefs always do a nice job. Waitresses are improving. They used to be horrible, but they are definitely improving. 

If you love Hibachi, definitely try Tsukasa. I can&#39;t speak to the sushi because I don&#39;t do seafood. It ends up being a smidge expensive. I think i usually drop around $60/person, keeping in mind i order filet/fried rice and a soda. That does not include any alcoholic beverages. 

Def worth the stop!"

We went there in the summer on a Friday night and were seated promptly(party of six). When our server started taking our order she was downright rude. We were almost getting yelled at for requesting a veggie miso soup because the current one has a chicken broth. We wanted to split our hibachi and she gave us the worst look ever repeatedly asking us if we didn&#39;t want to order anything else?? She then told us it would be an extra charge for splitting and we were fine with that. I ended up ordering sushi(spicy tuna/shrimp tempura) and it was pretty good. However, the service was unacceptable. This is not a place I&#39;d recommend if you&#39;re looking for a good hibachi experience."

The place looked very modern and very clean. Also it wasn&#39;t as smoky as other hibachi restaurants in the area. The service was very fast and we were pleased that we were able to get our own table. We came on a Wednesday at around 8pm. 

Our server was very energetic and asked to make sure that he got our order correctly. I would def go here from now on than the other hibachi place that i usually go to. It&#39;s more expensive, but it includes more food. The combination plates include soup, salad, and appetizer, and dessert. 

I got the entree of Steak which came with soup and salad. Then I also ordered a side of golden sauce which was really good. It was as filling as I thought. 

My sister got the combination plate of Golden Shrimp and salmon. She enjoyed her meal as well and we both had a good experience."

This time however we were definitely feeling sushi.

Red dragon: Mmmm very generous on the spicy tuna that tops this roll. Perfect amount of spiciness so that it wasn&#39;t overbearing on the raw fish taste.

911 roll: this is a sushi no no. There must have been some kind of chili paste mixed with spicy tuna to make this more spicy- which made it taste awful. The extra spiciness was too Americanized for my taste, not natural for sushi at all.

Fried rice: always perfect. Their fried rice is to die for, especially with a little added teriyaki sauce on the side. For $3.50 you get a very generously packed bowl of this heaven-sent, fried goodness.

Service is friendly but slow. This was my first time at this location, and it is definitely a lot less busy and big than the original in Vernon hills, but still Tsukasa nonetheless. A must for teppanyaki if you are in the area, and the sushi isn&#39;t bad either!"

Well, Tsukasa of Tokyo has earned my five stars award. They are truly the best of the best in the Chicagoland area. The quality of their food and their customer service are absolutely second to none. When you go, you must try their Yellow Ferrari Roll and JJ role. Since we started dining there at their grand opening few years back, we go there at least twice a month.

Wife and I sat in the sushi section, at the sushi bar because the window seats were too chilly from the A/C. As far as the food, this was the best sushi we have ever had, hands down.

We ordered the Yellow Ferrari roll, Rainbow roll, Spicy Tako Tempura roll, and a salmon skin roll. They were all delicious, beautiful, and carefully made. We did what we always do - put a little wasabi and soy sauce in the little tray for dipping, but we discovered that the rolls actually taste better if you don&#39;t add anything at all. I have never been somewhere where that is true. The sushi chefs really know what they are doing, friendly too but not intrusively so.

We saw one roll being prepared behind the sushi bar with a blow torch, and we got excited because we like those kinds of rolls. It turned out to be for us - the Yellow Ferrari. And it did not taste like fuel at all, like at some other sushi places. Really tasty, start to finish.

We took leftovers home, about one roll combined. Next time, we will get the Spicy Tako, Rainbow, and a few pieces of nigiri - yellowtail, bass, salmon. We are definitely coming back."

It&#39;s my ex&#39;s fave place and we used to go here for special occasions the 11+years we were together. We&#39;re good friends and we still go here once in a great while when I&#39;m in town. Funny, cuz every anniversary or new year&#39;s eve, we came here for dinner and about 20 minutes after, while we were in the car, about to go to the next thing on the plan, he had to use the bathroom and we ended up going home. Yup, it gave him the shitz each time but we still went there all the time.

Don&#39;t you love my review? Tee hee. It&#39;s better than the review on the lion killer dentist. I thought my ex&#39;s shit story is just as vile. I hope they would start tons of threads on it. Nuh, never mind. I changed my mind.

This place is great though. They moved to a bigger location as they were busting at the seam in the original location we used to frequent years ago. The place was tiny and they always had Bears players eating dinner there and they looked massive in there.

The special part is they have this combo dinner and it&#39;s a great value. You could mix and match your proteins like filet and chicken, shrimp and steak, salmon and shrimp, etc. Plus, if you go with the combo, you get to choose an appetizer like shrimp tempura or California roll. You also get soup and salad and ice cream. It&#39;s not cheap but it&#39;s shit ton of food!

Their filet is tender, and the egg yolk shrimps.. Omgaaa. That thing will clog your arteries I&#39;m sure but it felt like it was worth it until if something bad would happen to you aka heart attack. I dunno.. It was so creamy, hot, and yummy, which my ex is no longer any of those things to me. However, the egg yolk shrimps are still good through the years! 

One thing I don&#39;t like is their use of teriyaki sauce in the fried rice. I don&#39;t care for it but they gladly made me my rice with just soy sauce. The show that the chef put was also cool and not obnoxious at all. It was just enough entertainment.

We had a great meal tonight and we had a lot of fun. My sister thought it was as good as how she remembered it. My niece was enjoying the fire and the choo choo onion train. All were the same as usual and I&#39;m sure he got the shit again. Good thing this time we were in separate cars."

Came here for dinner the other night. The wait for the hibachi was about a half an hour, but there wasn&#39;t a wait to sit at the other tables. You don&#39;t have to sit at the hibachi tables to order it, fyi. I was told to pick my own seat (I think the host was overwhelmed). Later I was asked by another person if I had checked in at the front (since I was seating myself). Out waitress was nice and had no problem splitting the bill. Beside the odd host situation, the service was good.

My friend got the hibachi, and I ordered sushi. They don&#39;t have a huge list of maki rolls, but enough to give you a selection. The rolls were good, but not the best I have had. They were a little warmer than what I would have liked, and they fell apart easily. Still, they tasted good and it wasn&#39;t bad enough to complain. I just have had better at other places."

Service was awful from the moment we walked in. Waitress was very rude. Her greeting was &#34;you guys wanna sit here or there?&#34; and that was all while she left the menus on the table. 

We ordered 3 appetizers and 2 entrees for 2 people. The asparagus wrapped with beef was was hard to chew; the meat obviously overcooked. The GIANT CHUNKS ( not slices ) of tuna sashimi was ridiculous. The chicken teriyaki was also grossly overcooked and was just tough pieces of chicken mixed with mushrooms and a weird sauce, thrown on top of rice. 

Our waitress didn&#39;t stop by our table to check on us. FORGOT our order and we had to ask her a few times to check on our food. Very rude wait staff. She also never cleaned our table off. We sat throughout the whole meal with a pile of used dishes of the table. 

Considering the price range, I expected food and service to be above-average. Both were worse than a truck stop diner. If you&#39;re looking for AUTHENTIC Japanese food that isn&#39;t overpriced and a much more pleasant dining experience, I highly recommend Sakura in Rolling Meadows or Tensuke Market in Arlington Heights. 

Just as a reference point, hubby and I have tasted sushi and Japanese cuisine in general, in different parts of the world (including Japan) and in the US. My husband is a Culinary Institute of Art graduate and has food and beverage management experience in 5 star hotels and resorts."

If you don&#39;t like sushi and you want great habachi, they will be your one stop shop! Always prepared fresh right in front of you, and the chefs are always excited to be there.

Very accommodating for large groups, family dinners, or even for date night. Great food and good service.

Pink dragon

White dragon

Udon soup

When I visited the first time, Shochu (essentially Japanese Vodka,) was on the drinks menu. The manager (owner?) asked if it was my first time having Scohu, to which I replied in the affirmative. He insisted that I had a taste before he&#39;d serve me a full drink, just to make sure I enjoyed it. 

I also got a waiter, who was still in his first week. He straight up apologized to me when he first came to the table, telling me it was his first week and to please be patient with him. The problem was that if he hadn&#39;t told me that, I would not have known it was his first week!

The chef was absolutely wonderful. He didn&#39;t do any of the trope &#34;funny&#34; chef moves that certain other places do, he just made the food quickly and efficiently. He also modified the food as he was cooking when I told him I was lactose intolerant. And the servers didn&#39;t complain and make me wait forever for other customers to show up like other Hibachi places would. 

It&#39;s little things like this that put Tsukasa above other Hibachi places in my experience. This is five star customer service all the way. 

Add in the good, nay great food and we have a winner. Steaks are of good quality meat. Seafood is fairly fresh. Drinks are strong, yet the balance of ingredients is perfect. 

My biggest regret is that for the foreseeable future I have no reason to come back to the Kildeer area so that I can partake of Tsukasa again."

It all comes down to food temperature. The tempura, the miso, and I dont know how, but even the food straight off the flat top was hotter than in VH. Crazy! 
And might I add, I am a boom-boom-fatty when it comes to the golden sauce and I always order extra for my fried rice. Our chef did something that made me turn to my sister and just about faint.

We were seated right away and ordered pretty quickly after that (we&#39;re the type that doesn&#39;t typically deviate from our menu choices here.)  We were the only two at our table, which was good, that way, we really didn&#39;t have to impress anyone with our small talk and just concentrate on stuffing our faces.

I ordered: steak &amp; scallop combo with fried rice and veggie tempura as my side.  Also, a side of golden sauce (for on top of my rice.  If you haven&#39;t done this, you haven&#39;t lived.  All combos come with soup and salad as well as dessert.

Our chef was awesome,  but I regret I didn&#39;t get his name.  He knew exactly what that extra golden sauce was for, and like a boss, layered it in with the fried rice for optimal boom boom fatty status.  Additionally, all of the food was on point.  My sister made the comment (to which I agreed) that all of the food (even that off of the hibachi grill) seemed hotter and fresher than the Vernon Hills location.

This location is definitely my new favorite, everyone from servers to chefs to hosts to bartenders are friendly and accommodating.  The food was better, hotter, and tastier, not over or under seasoned.

For the sake of my waistline, I hope to not be back too soon, but you know I won&#39;t be able to stay away for long!"

Both Vernon Hills and Kildeer locations are great! Vernon Hills location is bigger, but feels like their hibachi tables are a little more crowded. I personally love their sushi the most. Very fresh, never fishy smelling and always beautiful! I never experienced any poor quality sushi like some people have written about and I&#39;ve been going the Tsukasa  for almost 6 years, (starting off at the Vernon Hills location) Their basic rolls are fairly priced, and their specialty rolls, though a little expensive, (mostly 12+) they are so good. My favorite is the JJ roll and Yellow Ferrari (I think the two most expensive hahaha) but they&#39;re so good, and a there&#39;s a variety of fish on both so the price is understandable. The pink dragon is always a good starter roll for the specialty ones.

My family goes here for everyone&#39;s birthday and the Hibachi tables are always fun. Each chef has their own special tricks, and they&#39;re always very friendly. I think all their meals are great, but if you like steak, go all out and get the filet, it is literally amazing. 

Also if it&#39;s your first time, get the fried rice. Really great!"

Fast forward to another Girls Night Out....

I can see NOW why Tsukasa of Tokyo is a popular dining spot for the North/Northwest suburbs. I had heard about the NEW Tsukasa of Tokyo that opened in Kildeer and that was much closer to me than the other one.  Got some gals together and we went!

The restaurant storefront is very unassuming.  It is built into a medium sized strip mall.  The Vernon Hills Tsukasa of Tokyo is a stand-alone building and I actually got lost trying to find the place driving all the way from Streamwood.  The Kildeer Tsukasa of Tokyo was easy to find with large red letters lighting my path to its door.

As I step into the restaurant, the host desk is right there with a few chairs in the small waiting area.  Beyond that area is a bar and to the right of that it opens up into a sushi bar and a lounge area.  I was thinking, where is the teppanyaki dining area?  I turn left and in a doorway I see it opening out into a fairly big teppanyaki room full of at least 10 grilled seating areas that seat around 8 or more each. 

It was a busy night, but I fortunately put in a reservation for my gal pals and we were able to be seated relatively quickly.  Got a nice corner table that made it possible for me to view the entire dining area from my chair. Great for taking pics! :)

I ordered one of their Steak and Shrimp combos with a side order of Golden Shrimp. I only got a side order because I didn&#39;t want to get too much richness with the sauce.  I was on a special diet and had to pass on the rice, so, I opted for more vegetables.  I was easily accommodated and got a two servings, which more than filled me up.

The veggies were a great combination of broccoli, onions, zucchini and carrots.  Most places only have zucchini and onion....so, it was a nice mixture. 

They also have THREE dipping sauces for your steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops, etc. - Hot Mustard, Ginger, and Teriyaki.  I opted for the Hot Mustard and it was a very delicious addition to my meal.

The starter soup was nice enough as was the salad.  The steak was done a nice &#34;medium&#34; as I requested.  I have no qualms about the food.  The teppanyaki cuisine was what I would have expected of a great teppanyaki.    

IN FACT...I give much love to restaurant for preparing a yolk sauce that is not too rich and heavy.  It was actually lightly tasting of egg yolk and was done perfectly. I enjoyed it quite a bit better than the other Japanese places like Ron of Japan or Rokbonki that serve this particular style of yolk sauce on their shrimp and seafood.  Might have to get more next time.

The combination menu also stood out to me as they had a LARGE variety of combinations from their various meats and seafoods.  The choices that stood out, in particular, were the tuna steak, calamari, and salmon.

They have a &#34;Sumo Special&#34; which is twice the ounces of lobster with a filet mignon with a mound of vegetables and a side order choice as well as a dessert. YUM!

They also have sushi, which I haven&#39;t tried, but I&#39;m sure it is as great as the rest of their food.

I also enjoyed the show we got from our friendly and interactive chef.  I had seen all the tricks before, but it is always nice to see different chefs do them.

All of the staff was very attentive to us and repeatedly asked if everything tasted good and we  were doing alright. So, service is top notch, even with it being busy!  I found out recently that Tsukasa of Tokyo is a family-owned restaurant, so, I was very happy to patronize a fine establishment such as this! 

Will I be back?  You bet!  It is a little far, but I think I may drag my family out to Tsukasa of Tokyo to have them try it for themselves.  Next time I think I will try their sushi to see how it is.

Tsukasa of Tokyo, don&#39;t change a thing, you are doing teppanyaki RIGHT! :)

KAMPAI!"

Both chefs were friendly and helpful. This is the same Tsukasa that is open in Vernon Hills that I&#39;ve never been to but have heard great things about. This restaurant is a storefront in a strip mall - looks like a small sushi place when you drive by, but the backroom has several Hibachi grills - I hope to try that on my next visit. 

I enjoyed a spicy octopus salad and an &#34;Urlacher Roll&#34; as well as a few standard maki favorites. The place was busy until about 8PM, then it kind of cleared out. 

I gave this place the benefit of the doubt - really more of a 9 out of 10 rating. Sushi-wise, I&#39;d give Naomi Sushi further south on Rand a slight nod as they have more variety with their specialty makis. But both places are different and Naomi lacks the sit down Hibachi option. Nearby Rokbonki better watch out - Tsukasa is definitely the best of the two."

I would&#39;ve loved to give Tsukasa (our fave restaurant) 5 stars, except I personally am not too keen about the manager there. Everyone else is extremely polite and fun to talk to and interact with, except for the manager. At first, the manager was pretty nice but after some time he started acting strange and it just has left a bad taste in my mouth. Really, if it weren&#39;t for the excellent customer service and our favorite chef, Brian, we would stop going here just because of the manager. 

Every visit, we are treated like family there and that is a nice feeling. I read through some of the people&#39;s reviews here and putting Tsukasa in the same boat as Benihana is pretty ridiculous. The only other teppanyaki place that could possibly compete with Tsukasa is Kyoto but we stopped going there because their customer service has gotten pretty bad. Let&#39;s just say that success has really gotten to the heads of the owners/managers there at Kyoto (but I&#39;ll leave that for Kyoto&#39;s review). I&#39;d say just try Tsukasa one more time and if possible, request Chefs Brian or Jin. To us, we like every chef because each chef has their own style of cooking. Honestly, if you speak up and ask them to add salt or put less salt, etc, they will do it without a problem. We have been to Tsukasa on many occasions and each time we chat with the chefs (all of them), they really feel that the customer is always right and are wiling to do whatever it takes to make your experience 5 stars.

P.S. We aren&#39;t big drinkers but when we did, the bartender was awesome too."

We ordered the famous yellow Ferrari (which totally lives up to the hype-so delish) and the mexi-maki (very refreshing). Order came super fast and staff kept checking in with us to see how we were doing. But what really won the fifth star, was their generosity. We didn&#39;t realize they closed at 2 pm. We ended up chatting for AN HOUR after they closed and they never said a word. Not a sour look was sent our way as we slunk out the door. That is going above and beyond!! Thank you, Tsukasa.

However, the food was not cooked as perfectly.  The veggies were cooked last and not cooked thoroughly.  The fried rice had too much teriyaki sauce and not enough rice - I received only a half a bowl.  My filet was cooked medium well versus medium - as I requested.  

With that being said, you can always rely on Tsukasa for the highest quality meats for Teppanyaki.  The cooks are always sarcastically funny and aim to entertain you based on your mood.  They get it if you don&#39;t want to be bothered too.

Perhaps I&#39;m biased to the Vernon Hills location because they really have things down to a T there.  It may take the Deer Park location a little longer to get there."

I don&#39;t really come here for the teppenyaki only because their SUSHI is what hits the spot.

They have Chicago Bears named sushi. The Urlacher and The Bear is awesome and the J.J. is my absolute favorite! It has every topping that I love in sushi all rolled into one! Their 911 sushi (I think) is much more spicier than the one in Vernon Hills which I LOVE! 

This place is definitely a lot quieter than Vernon Hills and definitely a lot smaller. The fountain in the teppanyaki room is beautiful and the ambiance is definitely date worthy. The staff is extremely nice here.

The hostess doesn&#39;t even apologize, and instead of allowing me to keep the excess sushi for the inconvenience removes the incorrect sushi, takes 10 minutes to replace it with another roll, and hands it back. I guess it really ticked me off because of how long it took, and that they didn&#39;t seem to care.

Then you walk into the back and behold the several big hot tables. These places tend to look the same, but Tsukasa has a classier feel with really cool metal curtains on the walls and an interesting fountain in the room. I liked that they sat my beau and I at our own table instead of just adding us on with randoms where there was still space available. We had an entire cooking show to ourselves!

I think our server was new to the wonderful world of serving, and maybe has already left it? She was shy and tentative and had to ask me twice what martini I ordered (saketini-yay), then spilled it as she put it down. She was then scolded by her mentor, an older Asian woman, for forgetting to put down napkins for our drinks. It was a gentle kind of scolding though. Maybe under her tutelage, something really did become of our young server. 

I guess you might say, why the 3 stars? Doesn&#39;t sound so bad. And it really wasn&#39;t. I just can&#39;t give star boost to put this place above average.

Went there on superbowl night with a few people and we sat at the bar. You cannot spend under 30 bucks per person there...it just aint gonna happen. But for a suburban sushi spot, i&#39;d say this is a chart topper. Awesome staff and beautiful &#34;sheek&#34; decor. The spicy tuna rolls were off the charts. Saki was great, the JJ rolls, wow. If you go to this place, you must try the JJ roll . It&#39;s their signature roll. I&#39;ll definitely return sometime."

main reason we came was for the teppanyaki. the chef looked young and did not really season the food at out table well. 

hibachi scallops - asked for teriyaki which i was expecting a sweet flavor but it was pretty bland

filet mignon - asked for medium rare but came out more like medium to medium well. way too tough for my liking 

chicken teriyaki - again had to ask for more sauce to make it more flavorful since it was bland. 

for two people it was expensive for what it is; over $120 with a couple beers and tip."

My first thought was will it be the same? The answer is yes. Dinner is pricey compared to other places but so worth it. Fried rice is a must. My niece who doesn&#39;t like fried rice ate most of my sister&#39;s. I am pretty standard chicken and shrimp which are great. My brother in law got the fillet and it looked great, would recommend. My parents who have never been enjoyed it and will return. My niece&#39;s got a really cool Japanese cola which i am not sure what it was but they loved it. They have kids menu so great place to go with the family, and for special occasion&#39;s. For me it was my birthday and the food and chef was great. Always entertaining for the family. Their sauces are home made so if you like ginger and teriyaki please get both and try them. So those who wonder, it is same quality as Vernon Hills."

I stopped back in a few weeks ago while craving food and in the area. My food was so-so, warm but not hot. My expectation is that you&#39;re going to know what Wendy&#39;s food is like, and I&#39;m just comparing it to other locations. 

The people were nice enough, but nothing about the customer service or the food stood out to me. I just felt, while driving away and snacking on my food, that I probably would have made a better choice if I had gone down the street and ordered from Portillos."

We ordered lunch to bring to Mom and it was pretty unappetizing. I went with the Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger and ended up with a somewhat warm burger between a dense, oddly rubbery bun with cheese that didn&#39;t seem to be melted at all. It had the telltale sign of being aged around the edges with discoloration, and not in the delicious way. The fries were barely heated.

It&#39;s sad because Wendy&#39;s, in my opinion, used to be one of the better grab-n-go options. Their quality has greatly declined and I&#39;m not sure why we were asked to pull ahead and wait for our order when what we received clearly wasn&#39;t as fresh as it could have been."

I haven&#39;t been to a Wendy&#39;s since high school probably, it had grown to be kinda meh and outdated. My boyfriend and his brother are fond of it though and word of improvement has been reaching my ears. 
Well well, Wendy&#39;s has made us happy today. I wasn&#39;t sure what to order, they were patient. Our coupon was apparently expired, the lass working the window said she&#39;d ask her manager about it: the manager happily honored it (i wish I knew both of their names, this was at 2:30 on 10/10/14). Tasted the food: it was hot and good! I got the chicken caesar wrap, great price, reasonable size. 
If they are all like this, then welcome back to the competitive floor, Ginger. 5 stars for surprising me."

Every time I come to this Wendy&#39;s location, the experience has gotten worse and worse. 

This time was a big disappointment. I ordered the new pretzel bread cheeseburger. Being in a fast-food place, I wasn&#39;t expecting anything as nice as Fuddruckers or Smashburger, but I did expect something edible. I stood and waited for what felt like forever for my burger, and I took a bite. It was pretty bad; the pretzel bun was too chewy and slightly cold. I decided to take a look between the buns and saw the problem: my sandwich was not fresh. At all. The cheese was practically plasticized and fused to the bun. Yes, I waited close to 10 minutes for that. It was absolutely gross. My appetite was ruined and I ended up throwing the food away.  I hated that I wasted almost $9 on this crap, but pleased that I didn&#39;t put that garbage in my body.

I am finished with this location. The orders are usually messed up, the service is slow, and the food is awful. I may even quit Wendy&#39;s altogether, it hasn&#39;t been good in years. 

Bye, now. My body needs fresh fruits and vegetables to detox from whatever the hell I attempted to eat."

Yes, they have healthier options, but sometimes you&#39;re just in the mood for a GD cheeseburger...and a salad that has chili on it (yes, that exists).  Sadly, it wasn&#39;t fantastic, but i applaud them for trying.

It was slow-going to get my food because they were making a batch of....something they were out of.(I was only half-listening).  But the order was correct, I will give them that much!

The highlight was the nice/funny guy behind the counter, Dean.  He put up with my indecisiveness while I sat in front of the menu for five-ten minutes asking questions like &#34;What comes on a bacon cheeseburger?&#34; and &#34;can I get extra cheese on my cheese fries&#34;.
