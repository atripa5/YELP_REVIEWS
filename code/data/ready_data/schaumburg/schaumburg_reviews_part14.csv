Our waitress was unpleasant from the beginning - she literally acted inconvenienced by our presence as patrons in her restaurant. She ignored our table entirely during our 45 minute wait for our food (scrambled eggs, cottage cheese, biscuits and gravy and an egg sandwich) She did not check on us ONE time, did not offer us coffee refills, and did not make eye contact in our direction while serving the tables around us. We had to leave our table to seek her out and ask about our food to which she replied &#34;my boss will speak with you shortly&#34; while looking in the other direction. (That never happened). When we finally paid our ticket at the entrance we were asked how everything was - to which we said &#34;honestly not that great&#34;...the cashier replied &#34;sorry to hear that, do you want your receipt?&#34; All while looking down. No ownership. No class. Not worth it."

If you are lucky to get a good waitress it&#39;s a good thing. Enjoy their food and the many specials they have during the week. Too bad the service can&#39;t be consistent. Last time there I think our waitress forgot to put our order in. Tables of people that came in after us got their food and left before we got ours. If you want consistent good service and FRIENDLY staff it&#39;s better to go to Bentleys. Both restaurants have good food and value but Dino&#39;s could improve on service and friendly staff that know how to smile once in awhile.

But this waitress looked like she was pissed at the world. The food was not like it used to be. I believe it&#39;s because of the new owners. I&#39;m not sure if they have new help as well in the kitchen. Also, the big host was not friendly either. I&#39;m not sure if he was the owner or not, but, he should put on a smile too. Maybe that&#39;s why most of their servers are not friendly. Not sure, but maybe that&#39;ll make me come back the next time. Smile some more to your customers people."

Me: Well... No... and yes. Basically all breakfast places in the Chicago area are Greek-ish.

My Big Fat Greek Breakfast!

This is my absolute favorite breakfast place in Bloomingdale. I&#39;d even go as far as to say it&#39;s so far my favorite breakfast place in the burbs. Though service can be hit or miss, the quality of the food is consistent.

My biggest complaint would be that it sometimes takes a while for the food to come out, it can be hard to get the attention of your waiter, or side items are missing from the order. But the servers are only human and they will quickly run to grab that sour cream or Cholula that they forgot if you remind them politely.

Dino&#39;s doesn&#39;t just do breakfast. They have pretty solid lunch and dinner options, as well. My cousin-in-law loves the blackened chicken sandwich and their lamb shanks are cooked to perfection. My mother was pretty happy with her meatless spaghetti, though she noted it was a bit soupy and had to add a lot of grated cheese to thicken it up.

My two go-to items are the Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast and the Denver Skillet with added diced tomatoes and sour cream and Cholula on the side. I&#39;m usually not up early enough to eat breakfast at the normal time, but my husband says they serve you orange wedges with your meal in the AM and then switch over to the Greek bread in the PM.

You gotta get the rice pudding!"

Truth told, I was having a shitty day. First of all, the morning started with one of those snows that completely sneak up on you. When I looked up at the skylight above my bed and saw nothing but white I thought my eyes were deceiving me, but no, snow. Everywhere. When I got to work and found almost nobody there I decided to zip over to the visitation service for my high school best friend&#39;s grandma who passed away over the weekend. Unfortunately as I was arriving, the dearly-departed&#39;s hospice nurse t-boned me on the way into the funeral parlor. You can&#39;t make this stuff up!

So I spent the day getting estimates on my damage rather than having a mundane day at work, which eventually led me to drowning my sorrows in a bowl of split pea soup at Dino&#39;s Cafe.

I figured something ought to go well that day, and thought a nice lunch would help. By that point it was mid-afternoon and I was starving, but also so far past the point of hunger that I didn&#39;t even want to eat anymore.

My waitress was delightful and a bright spark in an otherwise awful day. The food was good. I ordered a Ruben. I really wasn&#39;t expecting anything above average, and quite honestly it was typical diner fare. I probably didn&#39;t need to go out of my way to visit Ericka&#39;s favorite diner (I&#39;m assuming) because it&#39;s about the same as the food at every other diner in the Chicagoland area.

The good ones, that is. I&#39;m not knocking the food, service, atmosphere or anything else. I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s probably not worth a drive if you&#39;ve got a place closer to where you live. And I do. 

But if you&#39;re in the Bloomingdale area, I&#39;d definitely recommend Dino&#39;s for good food at a fair value. And maybe next time I decide to stop, I&#39;ll try something breakfasty because that seems to be what all the cool kids do."

It&#39;s usually always busy there but it&#39;s only because the food is plentiful, service is good and the pricing is beyond fair. Never had more than a 10 minute wait unless you go on a Sunday after 9 a.m. 

You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the meals. I have had the &#34;mile high meatloaf&#34; more than once and it definitely fills you up, and then you get some good chocolate pudding to take home.

She said, &#34;I don&#39;t make the rules, I just follow them!&#34; Okay .... 

I really don&#39;t understand their thought process here. If we were sitting in the restaurant and ordered, it would have been fine, but ordering it to go is NOT! Either way they have to prepare it, regardless if it&#39;s to go or not! And either way we would PAY!

This isn&#39;t the case at Dino&#39;s Café. You won&#39;t have to worry about long lines and you can take your time here. Despite the name, it has a full brunch and dinner menu. The warmth of the staff was reminiscent of Greek diners.
 
We ordered the Mexicana skillet and the 2x2x2 which comes with two sausages, two eggs, and two biscuits with gravy. I love skillets because you also get pancakes with the meal so it&#39;s the ultimate sweet and savory brunch item. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. The food will take about 10 minutes to arrive so don&#39;t be impatient. Other reviews commented on how the food took a while but no one around us seemed to mind. You definitely get a local feel to the restaurant and a sense of community - it seemed everyone knew each other.
 
This might be my new brunch spot for the area. It may not have the wild and crazy pancakes/waffles that some other places have but instead you can enjoy a meal with your family here.  Take a moment and have quality time together at Dino&#39;s Café (insert generic stock photo of family eating here)."

Their friend recommended this place, said it was really good and the best thing ever....I think that is just this girls personality. She thinks everything is OMG THE BEST. 
So we went around 9:30am on a Saturday and were seated right away. They have your standard breakfast/lunch menu offerings. We looked it over for a bit before we were approached by our server. She was a cold woman, not friendly or welcoming. That is a big turnoff for a breakfast joint. I mean, you gotta be a people person &amp; a morning person...
So we all figured out what we were gonna stuff our faces with, and everyone ordered breakfast. I wanted lunch, because I am not a big breakfast guy, since I don&#39;t like eggs...so I ordered and my server says I can&#39;t. Well it doesn&#39;t say anywhere on the menu that lunch is unavailable until a certain time, which I pointed out to her. She stares at me and replies, you can&#39;t. What do you want..
Really???
So then I decide to go with the biscuits and gravy. The dish came with eggs and I asked if I could substitute the eggs with bacon or fruit. She said no, no substitutions. Really? So I finally end up ordering chocolate chip pancakes with a side of bacon and a glass of orange juice. 
We could see the line and I saw where my orange juice came from....a jug, that they prolly got from Jewel. It tasted like Sunny D. It was gross. 
Our food came out quickly and this is the only redeeming thing about this so far 3 strike experience. The food was delicious! Bacon was thick and crisp. Pancakes, light and fluffy, perfect amount of chocolate. Biscuits and gravy my friend ordered were delicious and flavorful. And the other breakfast dishes, I forget what, were devoured with satisfaction. 
Food is good, service is horrible, juice isn&#39;t fresh. It&#39;s a miss with service, but they redeem with their food. A-Ok."

My dad and I went here for dinner last night with a couple of his friends from work. It was packed, which of course is always a good sign. After waiting a few minutes for a table, the hostess seated us and a waitress came by within seconds to take our drink and food orders. I was surprised considering that it was so busy and thought for certain that we would be waiting on our food for awhile, but they are very quick here! After ordering, we waited maybe five minutes before they brought out our soups and salads, and another five minutes before they brought out our meals.

I ordered the Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers, which for a little over $8.00 comes with soup and french fries. For an up-charge of $1.75, you can order a salad. It was absolutely delicious! But I couldn&#39;t even come close to finishing it all. The portions here are massive! My dad ordered the corned beef and pastrami sandwich. He also thought it was very good, but was disappointed to see that it didn&#39;t come with sauerkraut, swiss cheese, or thousand island. Make sure you pay attention to the menu and take note: the pastrami and corned beef sandwich on the menu is different from the Reuben sandwich they have. One of the guys we were with ordered the tilapia with fresh veggies, and I think his looked the best by far--like something they would serve at a five star restaurant. 

To top off our evening, we ordered the rice pudding. One word: Amazing. 

The service was great, the food was great, and the prices are reasonable. What more can you ask for? I am definitely looking forward to my next visit so I can try their breakfast!"

Like the other two places there is no Dinosaur or prehistoric theme here despite what your first thoughts might be with such a name. And fortunately this is the best of the places I&#39;ve visited called Dino&#39;s as well. Since they failed to utilize the dinosaur theme with a name like Dino&#39;s, I&#39;ll make up for that by writing my review to better emphasize this.

One day a friend of mine and I came in with a jurassic appetite. We couldn&#39;t quite decide where to eat and came across Dino&#39;s and figured it would be worth a try and having never previously visited it was like a lost world to us when we entered. After looking over the menu and not seeing either Fruity or Coco Pebbles, I decided to feast on something made from eggs of a descendant of the dinosaurs(a chicken). I choose a ham and mushroom skillet with pancakes. Before our main course was brought out we were offered some bread, the outside of it was as hard as the stone age and I suspect that this fossil of bread might have been sitting around for a while. 

Without using a thesaurus to find words to describe it, I&#39;ll say that the skillet I received was dino-mite. It had well scrambled eggs, and a good amount of ham and mushrooms. I&#39;m glad I ordered it as I considered ordering the Denver skillet (perhaps named after Denver: the Last Dinosaur) but I don&#39;t regret my choice. The potato&#39;s were nice and crisp and it had an overall pleasing texture and taste. The pancakes were nice and fluffy and came with a maple syrup that was sweet and not dino-sour. If you&#39;re an omnivore or a om-nom-nom-nivore like I am this was an excellent choice.

While a lot of places take the &#34;It&#39;s a living&#34; approach to service, the waitress was friendly and speedy. She refilled drinks quickly and tried very hard to pleaseosaur. My experience here was rather positive and I wasn&#39;t dino sore with my visit.  I recommend it as it&#39;s well worth giving a try(ceratops) if you&#39;re nearby and looking for breakfast.This is a five star breakfast joint that place with quality entrees like this they shouldn&#39;t be going extinct any time soon."

I ordered the day&#39;s special, Pork Chop Vesuvio and it did not disappoint. Started with navy bean soup of the day. It had good flavor with a good portion. 
Next came the entree which was also a good portion. Two large chops and several quartered potatoes. It was juicy and flavorful too. I was full after the first chop. Guess I&#39;ll have leftovers for tomorrow. 
What? Comes with dessert too. Yeah I got room still. Scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. 
Now I&#39;m full. Good times, good friends!"

We were greeted quickly, seated quickly, drinks were brought almost instantly and our soup arrived within a matter of minutes. The service was very good!  I took the advice of my lunch date and ordered the pot roast atop of noodles. I think this is where I made my mistake. The food was very blah!

I gave them an 3rd chance, my first mistake. I came here with my grandma (91 yrs old) for breakfast &amp; there was an wait. The girl in the front refused to get an 91yr old a chair we saw stacked in the back &amp; made my grandma stand with me for 15mins. Then when we were ready to order we had no idea who was our server was for 35mins. When she took our order (with an attitude) the order was wrong (lamb dinners instead of stake and eggs). When we said it was not what we ordered she yelled at us and said we had to pay for her mistake which I refused too. Then when we got the right order the food was not cooked in spots and over cooked in other spots. An stake should not be half burnt on one side and room temp/not cooked on the other side when I asked for medium cooked. The eggs where not even cooked, just cracked over the stake. My grandma food looked like it was tried to be cooked by a child with an easy bake oven. After returning our food 6 times and an argument with the server each time, we got our food right on the 7th time. They tried to charge us for there mistakes. I only paid for the food we ate. After we got home and later in the day we got very sick with FOOD POISONING. I don&#39;t know how or why they stay in business here. IT WOULD BE NICE TO HEAR FROM THE OWNER ON THIS PROBLEM HERE.

Unfortunately, this place has gone under new management but instead of fixing anything to better suit their customers, they&#39;ve only found ways to squeeze every penny out of them and we won&#39;t be back.  
The new owners haven&#39;t made any real effort to meet their customers but just take the money with a half smile and say a generic &#34;everything ok&#34;. Especially the older hostess who has never smiled once and looks completely miserable every time.  Months ago when the new owners came in we asked the waitresses if they were going to change anything and they said that the new owners said everything would be the same.  Boy, what a lie that was! The portions are less, prices are up a few bucks and every little thing is an extra charge.  Everything good about Dino&#39;s has changed.
The final straw was when I ordered my usual Denver Skillet and wanted to substitute no onions for tomato in a breakfast skillet but the waitress said she would have to charge me an extra dollar to do so, or that the owners would charge her for not charging me.  I couldn&#39;t understand why, to substitute vegetable for vegetable? Are you serious, a whole dollar?
I guess if you like being overcharged and not appreciated as a customer, go to Dino&#39;s. This place has majorly declined and now we now why the place has not been nearly as full as it used to be."

We stopped by here for lunch around 1:30/2 ish and were greeted promptly.  We were able to order quickly but it took a bit longer than I thought it should have to get food but the food was really good and the service was good.

I had a Sausage, Onion, Green Pepper, Mushroom Skillet with Sunny Side Up eggs.  The Italian sausage was great!  Full of flavor and good enough to eat alone.  The hash browns underneath were actually nice and crispy unlike most skillets I have had.  The rest of it was cooked perfectly as well except the egg, it was a bit over done, barely runny sadly, but looked beautiful haha.

The pancakes that came with my meal were a bit over done and lacked flavor, even with all the butter and syrup I put on it (the outside was a bit overcooked so it wasn&#39;t absorbing any of the flavors well enough sadly).

I would come again, price is around 10 dollars a person after tax and tip without drink."

She got a burger with blue cheese and I ordered a double cheeseburger. 

The soups that came before the burgers was DELICIOUS.  The bread was warm, and our friendly server brought out more warm bread.  Mmmm.

It seemed a lot of the waitstaff were bored, however, as they stood near the kitchen window just waiting.  Our server came back with refills and to check on us pretty regularly.

Our bugers, which we asked to be cooked medium, were both VERY dry.  They were actually the driest burgers I&#39;ve ever had, and almost not worth eating the next day as leftovers.  We weren&#39;t sure if they just use really lean beef or what..  Still, no good.

The hostess/cashier was less than friendly, which is NOT the normal Greek-owned diner experience.  I love me some Greek-owned diners and am now looking for a new fave now that I&#39;ve moved far away from my regular Mrs. V&#39;s...though I don&#39;t think Dino&#39;s is going to be it.  Sad.

How many people?&#34; This would have been a nicer greeting than the miserable young woman at the counter with a notepad taking names. I got &#34;Two? Name?&#34; and that was it. No &#34;it will be a few minutes.&#34; No &#34;ok give us just a minute.&#34; She just looked down and expected us to read her mind about what was to come. Just weird. 

We were going to go to another local breakfast joint on this particular morning, but after checking my Yelp app, we decided it would be fun to go try a new place. 

They were kind enough to allow us to choose to wait for a bigger table or take a 2-top close to the kitchen. We were hungry so we opted for the 2-top.

The food was mediocre, at best. It was incredibly bland. Pancakes were overcooked. Actually, my fiance&#39;s were burned, if I&#39;m being honest. Of course, the cook, must have thought that because he put the burned side down, the person eating the food would not notice. But baby, we look at our food before we eat it!

I judge a breakfast place by their breakfast sausage, much like I do a dinner place by it&#39;s soup. Their sausage was, simply put: average. We ordered our hash browns well done. We were lucky they were even cooked, it seemed. They were barely &#34;browned&#34;. 

The quality was not there. The staff was unfriendly. The food was overpriced. They should have thrown away the burnt pancakes and made a fresh batch and the simple fact that the cook chose to serve them instead of replacing them, shows me what kind of quality they are willing to put out there. There are a variety of other places nearby, I suggest checking those places out."

What works 
Nice atmosphere and extensive breakfast options and inexpensive. 

The skillets are tasty and as with any other place, too much to eat in one sitting. 


What didn&#39;t 
The drawback or unpleasant part of my dining experience was service. From the hostess to the waiter, they were a drag. Like have a seat and tell me your story. Unhappy. So, assuming they are roommates and had a bad day, I&#39;ll say service was marginal. I would never return for the service and would rather go some place else before &#34;putting up&#34; with it again. 

Food - 3 stars 
Price - 3 stars 
Service - 1.5 stars *** if you are not a people person, you should find a place that does not require interaction with the public.

Would I circle back? I guess. ..... Just not anytime soon."

First off, I ordered a burger and the order was put in and never once did the waitress tell me they didn&#39;t have soup that came with the meal, then my burger comes out wrong it gets sent back, my wife ordered an omlete that tasted completely sour, we told both the waitress and the manager and neither seemed to care. It took 45 to finally get my burger, can&#39;t say how it tastes because I no longer had time to eat. I&#39;ve heard many people that live locally as I do say horrible things about this place, but figured I&#39;d still give it a shot, big mistake.  Find somewhere else to eat"

How did I come to a determination that this is a 1 star establishment?  Well, a buddy and I decided to head to Dino&#39;s for dinner after work.  The waitress, who looked like we woke her from her nap time, started to take the order.  My buddy ordered a sandwich and instead of french fries wanted to substitute a small salad.  The waitress initially balked at that idea, but then said OK, but that will cost an additional $1.59.  No problem.  He then said to the sleepy eyed waitress about the soup that comes with the sandwiches and she replied &#34;you don&#39;t get soup, because you ordered the salad&#34;.  Wait, the salad was a sub for the fries (at $1.59), not a sub for the soup.  She basically said, sorry.  Can&#39;t do that.  Time for a manager.  So, I asked Miss Personality to send over her manager.  What then?

Well, the lady of the house came over and after my buddy explained the details to her she said, OK, but we don&#39;t substitute normally, but she would make the exception (huh? the exception?  Pay an additional $1.59 to sub, but that&#39;s an exception).  How about the soup?  OK, she relented and said she would do that as well.  I pointed out to her, clearly printed on the menu, it said &#34;SUBSTITUTIONS AVAILABLE AT ADDITIONAL COST&#34;.  But, the manager (owner&#39;s family member, perhaps) said they don&#39;t substitute.  Anyway, she said she would send the waitress back over.  

I thought best we start with a fresh waitress.  So, she sends over a pimply faced young man, who sulks up to our table and says &#34;What?&#34;.  His attitude was pathetic.  He obviously had a conversation with Miss Personality and didn&#39;t want to wait on us.  My buddy placed the order, and this waiter still was on the &#34;We don&#39;t substitute&#34; kick.  He was rude, obnoxious and downright nasty.

Fearing food tampering if we would have stayed for this meal, we just NO THANKS and left.  We drove across the stree to Bentley&#39;s Pancake House (now open for dinner) and were treated to great service, excellent food and a nice experience.  Good bye Dino&#39;s forever.  Do yourself a favor and do not patronize this establishment.  Go someplace that actually appreciates your business.  Yabba, Dabba, Don&#39;t to Dino&#39;s."

despite the mediocre food, service was slow-paced but they were very sweet. an older lady goes around dusting the plants most of the morning, not sure if she was the host or not. her presence was very fitting though.

I&#39;ve heard through the grapevine that Dino&#39;s was the spot for classic breakfast//lunch//diner grub. The food was average and the service wasn&#39;t anything to get excited over. I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t go back, but it&#39;s not my top choice for brunch. 

::Grub::
I had an itchin&#39; for some biscuits and gravy, so I ordered the 2x2x2 (2 eggs, 2 biscuits and gravy, 2 sausage links). I order my eggs (whites only) scrambled, and opted for the chicken sausage over the pork. The egg whites were cooked perfectly, which is shocking because many places screw them up and over-cook them. These ones cooked for me were light and fluffy! A+ for scrambled egg white skillz! I also dig their chicken sausage - super juicy and had just the right kick. The biscuits and gravy didn&#39;t taste like they were made from scratch. Not to mention (based on the temperature, and the film on top of the gravy) my plate was sitting under the heat lights for some time. But either way, it scratched the itch just fine. I was starving and not in the mood to send it back and wait again. 

My boo ordered a Colorado//Denver omelet. He said it was really good. It looked light and fluffy, but since I can&#39;t eat egg yolks I didn&#39;t sample it myself. I will say that his hash browns tasted like freezer burn and weren&#39;t all nice and crispy.  And the pancakes were barely luke warm. Boo. 

::Service::
Sloooooooooooooooooooow. Now, I understand that Sundays at noon can be a busy time, but waiting a good 10 minutes for a waiter to take our order seemed a little lengthy. When we went to pay the register didn&#39;t have enough change and we had to wait for management come and screw around with moving money. Really?!? During a brunch rush? Get prepared, yo!

In a pinch I might give Dino&#39;s another go. But with Portillo&#39;s and Caputo&#39;s across the street, chances are I&#39;ll go there first."

A week ago I took my wife for lunch on a Thursday and walked in to a half-full place.  We sat and did not get even a hint of service because the three old coot servers were all yap yap yapping at the food pickup spot.  The manager in the corner even watched my frustration and did nothing.  Until we got up to leave.  Then she made a feeble attempt to come our way but never made it the 20&#39; to meet us at the front door.

Goodbye forever, Dino&#39;s.  Back to Bentley&#39;s for sure.

Incidentally, this seems to happen a lot (very poor service) based on what my neighbors and fellow Bloomingdale family friends experience too.

That location will make a nice flower shop or dry cleaners spot in the months to come.

Shame on the ownership/management of this place.  

YELP forces me to pick 1 star for this place but I can assure you I would have chosen ZERO if allowed."

I came here with my friend and her family while visiting. I feel like Dino&#39;s Cafe has sooo much potential, but there need to be a few tweaks in order to get there. 

The interior was really clean and decked out in holiday decorations, which was a nice touch. After we arrived, we were greeted warmly and guided to our table. Our server, I think her name was Joanne, was really nice and friendly. Dino&#39;s menu offers several items as well as a few Greek specialties being that it is a Greek diner. What makes Dino&#39;s Cafe such an amazing place to get your bang for your buck is their suuuuuper generous portions at rock bottom prices. Along with your entree, you get an option of soup or salad and a dessert after your meal. Did I mention that they serve warm bread when you arrive? Yesss...so good.

Because of the large portions, my friend and I decided to share. We ended up getting the Grecian chicken and the fried chicken. As a warning, both of these entrees require about 25 minutes to cook...so you might wanna call in advance. Along with the entrees you can choose a side from options such as hash browns, rice pilaf, baked potato, fries and mashed potatoes. I don&#39;t know what they do in this 25 min, but let me just say, it is soooo worth the wait!! Before our entree, my friend and I got the lemon chicken rice soup. It was delicious - the soup is thick and lemony with rice. I suggest asking for a few fresh lemon wedges to squeeze into the soup - it adds a fresh punch of acidity that elevates the flavor of the soup. Now...back to our entrees...the Grecian chicken that I tried was bursting with flavor with hints of olive oil, citrus and herbs. But the highlight of the night was defs the fried chicken my friend and I had. The skin was salty and crispy without being greasy. The chicken was so moist, juicy and well seasoned - I almost wished I had gotten my own order. I ordered hash browns with our meal and they were hot and crispy - nothing spectacular but just really well made hash browns. We ended our meal with rainbow sherbert, which was an amazing end to our meal.

Now for some of the negatives...although the main proteins and soups were really great, the sides that are served with the entrees could definitely use some work. The fried chicken dish came with a side of corn that I&#39;m 100% sure came from a can along with half a canned peach. C&#39;moonnnn...with kick ass entrees like the Grecian chicken and fried chicken, I feel like Dino&#39;s could step up to the plate and come up with something more modern or homemade instead of these canned ingredients that you&#39;d find in a hospital cafeteria. Other than that, everything else was pretty great.

Service was pretty on point - Joanne was quick at refilling our drinks and clearing plates - very attentive. The owners also came around and asked patrons how their meals were. 

Overall, I feel if Dino&#39;s makes some improvements to their sides to their menu, the ratings for this place could definitely be higher!"

My husband and I, and even my two kids, love Dino&#39;s for breakfast. The eggs are always perfectly done. Same with the hashbrowns. The variety on the breakfast menu is awesome. I&#39;d indulge in some of the sweeter items, but I&#39;m on a diet. :( But diet or no diet, I never pass up the bougatsa! And we take home the avgolemono soup by the buckets! As for the service, it&#39;s always been excellent. We&#39;ve always received very attentive service. I&#39;ll admit, for dinner, which we only came once, the food was less spectacular (not bad... just run of the mill). But breakfast always keeps us coming back for more."

My mom mentioned her friend thought this place was good.  I was pretty hungry and thus eager to try it so we stopped in.  I ordered the Venetian skillet (something like $7.50) which was a breakfast skillet with italian sausage, onions, and peppers.  I got it with pancakes.  Now I like greasey spoon diners but the pool of grease at the bottom the skillet I had made me sick all day.  The italian sausage in the skillet didn&#39;t taste good and the hash browns in the skillet didn&#39;t taste anything like potatoes and had turned to mush because all the grease was soaked into it.   I don&#39;t know if they just had huge portions or the food eliminated my appetite but it was really a struggle to eat my meal.  It just wasn&#39;t pleasant.

The location is completely bizarre, but it all makes sense inside (it&#39;s like it was made for it yet was originally a Walgreens).

There&#39;s a bar upstairs with a little dance floor where you can make a fool out of yourself, and the bowling lanes are all below. Wait times are hit or miss. We&#39;ve gotten really lucky the few times that I&#39;ve been here and never had a wait that would put us off, but I&#39;ve heard from others that it can get pretty ugly (and they ultimately leave and go elsewhere).

I&#39;ve always had fun here. If you set your expectations a notch lower than a regular bowling alley, you&#39;ll be happy. The thing is, it ends up being way more fun than regular bowling because you can have a drink and see hilarious music videos while you stumble your way to a turkey.

Poor planning on our part!

I found Strike Ten via my handy-dandy Yelp app.  It ended up being $35 for 3 games, shoe rentals, and two soft drinks. I haven&#39;t bowled in a few years, but that price seemed a little bit steep.
 
The place looks a bit upscale, so it was a nice environment.  I&#39;d have to disagree with a previous reviewer, though; the couches are vinyl and cloth, not leather. It was clean and tidy.  The woman who rang us up was also working the bar, and she was nice and kind of humorous.  The bowling shoes seem updated - they had some swanky velcro (no laces).

The bowling lane area was pretty dark and a variety of music played (more hardc0re hip-hop to Taylor Swift to 80s pop).  At first we were the only two patrons there bowling (save for 3-4 guys at the bar area) until our second game, when a father-son-daughter group also started bowling.  For some reason they ended up cranking the music during our second game, which made it extremely difficult to have a conversation unless you were six inches away from the other person.  Ugh.  We dealt with it for 15 or so minutes, and it was finally turned down.

Strike Ten is a more adult environment that may border on &#34;sophistication,&#34; but the prices and music volume were a bit obnoxious.  I wouldn&#39;t go running back unless we encountered another League Night elsewhere."

Lanes are good but thought they were shorter and thinner than the actual bowling lanes. Service was good but the manager was very rude.

One thing which was different is you pay for everything at the end of your session at the counter.

I know that the previous sentence is a strange one, but it&#39;s actually true! It&#39;s beautiful inside! 

The decor marries an upscale lounge with the active approach of bowling beautifully. 

Instead of typical plastic benches you are sitting on comfortable leather sofas at the lanes. The interface is very user friendly and the screens at the end of the lanes are huge. 

On the other side of the lanes is a small sports bar with booths, high top tables, and a bar to sit at and watch the game! Or games - there are always 3 TV&#39;s on! 

After meeting the bartender, I learned that you need to be trained and certified to serve Guinness, which is why not every bar has it. They have their certificate on the wall :) and then the bartender poured me a Black and Blue which BLEW MY MIND!! It was Blue Moon on the bottom with Guinness sitting on top and it was separate!!

Things to find out
1) what is there a fancy dining room in this place for? I imagine people in there after hours in a room full of smoke ripping hookahs and playing poker but if you know better - let me know.

At first we thought we were imagining the whole thing about the staff catering to their nationality but it looks like others noticed it as well....

We were told you could not make reservations then got there and  waited way too long and by the time we got &#34;seated&#34; all but 2 lanes were open. When we stated that we wanted two lanes instead of one since we had 7 people, the waitress told us the other lanes were reserved and just walked away. This infuriated us since the lanes stayed open the majority of the time we were there. 

The music was decent but way too loud and it sounded like they had a DJ booth run by an 8 year old because new songs would just start in the middle of other songs...  

The waitresses were not attentive. We asked for waters half way through the stay, and she brought back one. One. When I asked if everyone could get a water she looked like I asked for a kidney. 

Best part was when the lane just shut off for no reason at all right after my 3 year old son rolled his little 7 pound ball down the lane and of course it got stuck. The man who came to reset the lane walked down the lane and donkey kicked it back towards us! The thing came flying back down towards us! Luckily my son did not get hurt. But of course my ankle bone learned to catch bowling balls that night.....

We will never return here. Honestly, a bowling alley is a bowling alley, but when the customer service is that bad, it negates anything that could have possibly been positive.

This is a nice bowling alley.  Nothing like what I remember growing up, where the name Brunswick could be easily confused with Greyhound Bus Lines (somehow I always saw similarities between the old monotone colors, smells, and general brand presentation from Brunswick bowling with the depressing interior and feeling of malaise from a Greyhound Bus terminal).

Anyway back on topic, Strike Ten is a modern and upscale place that has made bowling exciting and new for the younger generation.  We enjoyed ourselves with a quick bite to eat before we got started.  The pub food is what you would expect, only nicer.  Then we drank a few beers as we tried to avoid the gutter and roll a four bagger.  There is an entire upper level inside that had a DJ booth (he was not on shift while we were there) and another full bar with plenty of seating with comfortable plush chairs and couches.

We apologized for being a little loud and she just kept shouting! She then proceeded to shut off our prepaid games! She then proceeded to swear at us and make racist, deragatory statements. We were SO disrespected! For a business who cant afford to lose any customers, since its clearly going under, they really proved why no one goes there - cause they&#39;re disrespectful and mean! I had to literally complain to the Village, and guess what? They said this wasnt the first time they got a complaint for service issues from there! I also called the Better Business Bureau, and when they looked uo the business, it showed it having one of the lowest ratings. I lodged s formal complaint and the Village of Roselle also recommended a police report- thats how bad it was!

I don&#39;t mean that the place turns bowling neophytes into fanatics. I mean that, unless you take your bowling seriously, you&#39;ll have a very good time.

Though only 14 lanes in size, my friend and I had no problems getting a lane one Tuesday night. They no longer have $2 bowling on Tuesdays, but somehow we got the deal anyway. The bar was well-stocked and we each had craft beer off the tap for $4, where lots of other places would charge $5. 

With each lane, you get the greatest rest area I&#39;ve seen in an alley: a big comfortable couch, facing sideways to make it fit, with a coffee table for every two lanes. It&#39;s a great set-up if your party has two lanes, but can be a bit uncomfortable if you&#39;re facing strangers. Fortunately, we bowled next to a larger group of three lanes, all of which were fun-loving and respectful. 

So why am I not enamored with this place? Because, for the actual sport of bowling, it&#39;s not good. The lanes themselves LOOK okay, but they&#39;re made of some material that has a quality of, shall we say, springiness. I&#39;ve never had my ball bounce upon hitting the lane, but I was getting single- and double-bounces on my strike ball, and I&#39;m not one with a lot of loft. When you take your bowling seriously, as I have done in the last year with great results, having your ball bounce to the pins is not a pleasant sight, as it can affect the spin of your ball and the overall result. Having a bunch of big-screen TVs just above the pins is far from optimal when you&#39;re trying to find your mark on the lane but have to deal with the TV reflection. (This is troublesome during Cosmic Bowl, which suddenly took over mid-game. The black light and fluorescence might be cool for some, I suppose.)

A year ago, I would&#39;ve loved Strike Ten. Now that I care about my game, I&#39;m not so happy here. If you choose your bowling ball by color and have a designated &#34;beer frame,&#34; you&#39;ll enjoy it. But I&#39;d rather find a place where I can get a decent lane, cheap games and no gimmicks. Breaking 200 is enough entertainment for me."

I started going when it opened and the owner constantly surrounded himself with 6 HUGE bodyguards and had bouncers all over the place.  

My pals and I went there a lot.  We hosted my son&#39;s birthday there and were given 2 lanes for 20+ kids to bowl.  

The owner simply doesn&#39;t care about his customers.  He acts like he never recognizes us, has never been friendly and prefers people of his nationality.  One Saturday afternoon I brought my son in to go bowling and half the lanes were unused because the owner&#39;s family was having a party upstairs and wanted them reserved.  We were told &#34;10 minutes&#34;, but after 1.5 hours we left. The owner was there and acted like he&#39;d never seen me before in my life.  Didn&#39;t even offer us a free soda while we waited.

I&#39;ve seen hookers in there, drug dealers, and all sorts of other BS.  He runs it like an immature, spoiled kid who only wants HIS PEOPLE in there.  I&#39;ve never felt more unwanted.

We quit going. Shame, because it has potential but it&#39;s not a freakin&#39; dance club, it&#39;s a bowling alley in the burbs...in the burbiest part of the burbs.  I&#39;m sure his family has plenty of money to keep it going...hopefully those family members pay full price for their lanes because he obviously doesn&#39;t want regular customers."

 We were delighted that they offered a full menu and the food was good! Prices were reasonable, I guess for our needs that night was bowling and dinner and this place made it work for us.

I visited this facility on Wednesday 5/22/2013 for a birthday party around 5pm. The birthday party was being thrown for my nephew, who was turning four years old. There was a group of roughly 10 kids ages 8 and under, and a handful of adults.
When we called to make the reservation for the party about a week beforehand, we specifically asked the manager if we could bring our own cupcakes and pizza. He told us that would be fine.
When we arrived, we set up decorations as well as a table with chips and drinks. The manager immediately came over and informed us that outside food and beverages were not permitted. My sister explained that she had specifically asked when making the reservation about outside food and drinks and was told that it was fine; in response, the manager scoffed that pizza and cupcakes were permitted, but nothing else. My sister apologized and the manager walked away.
Roughly 45 minutes later, with the kids halfway into their bowling games, we brought out the pizza. The manager immediately ran over and began to make a scene. He yelled in my sister&#39;s face, &#34;This is ridiculous! No outside food and beverage!&#34; Then why were we told not once, but TWICE (when making the reservation, and when we were confronted about the chips) that bringing pizza was fine?
The manager continued to rage at my sister, yelling at her in full view of other patrons as well as the children who were eagerly waiting for dinner. Finally, he shouted at her,&#34; You need to leave, now. Get out.&#34; We followed suit immediately, packed up out belongings, paid for our game, and headed to a local park to continue the party.
Okay, let&#39;s be clear. I can understand a bowling alley not wanting guests bringing in their own food and drink. But then why would you even tell a guest -multiple times- that is was okay in the first place? If he had been clear about the policy from the get-go, there never would have been a problem.
Furthermore I have to question any business that would be so crass and merciless with their guests. There were literally dozens of other ways of handling this so-called &#34;misunderstanding&#34; about the outside food/beverage policy - giving an outside food charge, similar to a corking fee restaurants have, for example. But to scream at a customer, in full view of other patrons and CHILDREN, is the hallmark of a poorly run business. And then to have the audacity to throw out a birthday party, especially one comprised of mostly kindergartners... unacceptable.
The owner of this bowling alley should be ashamed of himself, as should any and all employees present who failed to speak up. I find it disgusting that anyone could so heartlessly kick a group of young children out onto the street and  ruin a four year old child&#39;s birthday party. In under an hour, Strike Ten proved itself to be a poorly run establishment weighed down by atrocious customer service. I will not be visiting this bowling alley again, and I urge anyone reading this review to bypass this facility as well."

Well then we&#39;re going to get into it. Based on the reviews, i can say these people are right. He favors people of his ethnicity. He tried to move my party because he said he gave us the lanes on accident and they were meant for the other party. All you have to say is sorry let me offer you a discount i will move you. I would say OK no problem. but all he kept yelling was we have to move you! we have to move you! Uh. Sorry buddy I&#39;m not going anywhere. Turned into a screaming match between me and him.

When we got there, the place was pretty empty but it definitely started to fill up shortly after. There aren&#39;t that many lanes, maybe 10-15 total. If your lane is next to someone else, you do share a seating area. Instead of traditional bowling alley seats, there are oversized couches. There are also huge screens at the end of all the lanes which can be a little distracting...I think it helped me though because I bowled my best ever here. The screens play music videos or are on sports channels. The music played here was a little bit of everything from early 90&#39;s hits to top 20 hits. At one point there were playing a song that just had &#34;t*tties, ass&#34; over and over again and there were a few f-bombs thrown in. That doesn&#39;t offend me but I would hate to have my kid there and have them listen to that....but then again, who brings a young kid to a bowling alley past 9 pm?

Didn&#39;t order any food but the menu looked good. Had a drink from the bar (Malibu and pineapple) and it was pricey considering there was barely any alcohol in it.

I had the blueberry cheesecake smoothie, since most people on here have tried it and took pics of it. Bottom line, it&#39;s very satisfying. $9 and change is the most I&#39;ve paid for a non alcoholic drink though. 

I&#39;ll be coming back to try more options soon!"

The inside has a nice atmosphere and the employees were welcoming. It can be a little noisy inside because of the blenders but there is also some seating outside as well. 

They had some samples to try out which was a plus! I tried the Chakra smoothie. It was ok but mostly tasted like banana. 

One thing to note is that the prices for the juices and smoothies are expensive. Expect to pay about $8 for a 20oz smoothie or 16 oz juice. It is worth trying out but for me, the prices would have to be lower to come back on a regular basis."

I&#39;ve been here twice now and each time I&#39;m about to purchase an item and promising myself that I&#39;m doing my health a favor, I see the prices next to each menu item and I end up changing my mind. 

The drinks are delicious but worth $8+? I got the Pulsating Green which was good but I felt tasted it tasted very similar to the Tropical Green Detox from Squeez&#39;d at Marianos which is only ~$4. 

The staff here are very friendly and willing to answer questions. I&#39;ve seen them put out samples to try which I enjoyed.

We followed up with the pumpkin cheesecake.  Hard to believe there was no dairy in it.

Due to a cancer dx, decided to reset and just wasn&#39;t motivated to make my own juices at the time. I found Pure juice and love that they did cold pressed and no HPP. The plastic bottles are not my favorite, but I get it - glass would be costly and heavy. The bottles are fine. I am not 100% sure about all the produce being organic. I did ask at the store but was given an ambiguous answer. I Saw somewhere on their website that the produce is organic but I&#39;m not convinced. I&#39;m on my 3rd juice cleanse in about 5 months and I have to say, despite the cost I&#39;m hooked - because when I pay this kind of money for a cleanse, I know I&#39;m going to stick to it. The easy cleanse is pretty good and I also liked their ginger pineapple garlic &#34;flu shot&#34; from the refrigerator case in the store. Overall, they are just what I need when I need it. I would definitely recommend"

The juice is good, the attitude is hit or miss. 
Be careful how you order. Example, there are two juice sizes on the menu, but if you order a large, thinking the larger of the two, you&#39;ll find there is a third, larger size.
Also, I ordered a three ingredient juice, and they charged me a 50 cent surcharge for creating my own juice, which Actually made their work easier. I also didn&#39;t see that Bonnie feature on the menu.

It was my first raw food place I&#39;ve eaten at and I really really enjoyed it. At first, I was a bit skeptical because I wasn&#39;t sure about what to expect. Food that isn&#39;t cooked, what?!? I tried the salad which had couscous and berries in it. So delicious and flavorful. My brother got the lettuce tacos. Wow, I was so very impressed with the flavor. It tasted like real tacos without any meats in it. For weeks after, I was craving them. The best thing about these foods is that they are relatively light. They definitely make you full and are a bit pricier, but foods like this are way better than your local fast food restaurant. I will definitely be back. Highly recommend!"

I am a huge juice/smoothie fan and even have a juicer at home.  I like ingredients I can pronounce without the artificial stuff.  

This is a small shop tucked into a strip mall which means it has parking right in front of the store.  I say this because I parked across the street because my directions were a little off.  

The menu has a huge selection to choose from of juices, smoothies, and some other food items.  I came for a smoothie.  I got the Liquid Super Chocolate.  I don&#39;t remember all of the ingredients but here it goes: cacao. banana, almond butter, almond milk (I think), macha, and that is all I can remember off the top of my head.  It was delicious.  I usually use something like this post work out, but it was a treat today.  

The smoothie tasted fresh, the customer service was top notch, and the inside had a cool vibe.  

The employee who served me informed me about their loyalty program which is buy 9 smoothies get the 10th one free.

After seeing my sister perform in an awesome show in Evanston with my parents and taking nearly two hours to get back to their house due to construction work, breast cancer walks, roads being closed, and rush hour, I was very cranky. And hungry. Oh man, so hungry. So when I had to hop into my hot car, which lacks air-conditioning, and then deal with more rush hour on my way home (I just really wanted to get home and have dinner with my husband), I was not a happy Laura. When I found myself sitting in traffic on Euclid, I browsed Yelp for nearby bookmarks and noticed this place, less than a mile away. YES. A healthy smoothie and potential vegan sweet was exactly what I needed.

I pulled over, drove around, and found this place tucked away in a strip mall.

When I walked in, my happiness level grew. A lot.

The interior is decorated kind of as I want my house to look -- contemporary and sleek, with lots of green color and wooden elements. It was small, yet bright and spacious. And oh! The menu! Everything is raw. Everything is vegan. No dairy, no gluten, no processed foods, no HFCS, no preservatives, no GMOs. Just pure awesomeness. Pure Juice has so many mouth-watering juice and smoothie options, along with meals and treats in the display case.

Good food, as in pure-and-totally-healthy-for-you, costs money. While this place wasn&#39;t overly ridiculous, be prepared to spend about $8-10 for a smoothie and around the same price for a little veggie dish. You get what you pay for; in this case, you&#39;re getting a dose of super-healthy pumped into your veins. It&#39;s more than worth it.

After staring at the menu for ten minutes and going through all the mind-blowing options, I ordered a Romantic Date. It ended up being the best almond milk/banana/cinnamon/honey smoothie I&#39;ve ever had. OK, maybe it&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve had with that combination, but it was amazing -- fruity and sweet and tame all at once. Drinking it was like curling up with a book under a tree on a calm autumn afternoon. How could I not fall in love with it!?

I also ordered two vanilla macaroons. The $3 for 2 wasn&#39;t a bad price and they were incredibly good. I pretty much shoved them in my mouth instead of taking my time to savor the taste. Oops?

The smoothie and macaroons were just what I needed. I was satisfied.

Pure Juice Cafe, thank you for the love affair. I&#39;ll be back for more!"

They have raw and organic food cafes all over the place.  So, I can&#39;t even explain how happy I was to find Pure Juice.  I started making my own juice a few years ago because I had researched and read about it&#39;s benefits.  I try to do it as often as I can, but it is hard with a family.  Washing the juicer alone takes FOREVER.  It is so nice to have a cafe that offers fresh, raw juices quick and on-the-go.  So many of the other juice bars I have found use conventional produce.  What&#39;s the point of seeking out a super nutritious beverage if it&#39;s served with a splash of pesticides?  Pure juice is all organic!  Yippee!

It&#39;s also a very adorable cafe.  It&#39;s a great place to meet a friend if you want something healthy to drink/eat.  Try the zoodles! (zucchini noodles).  It has a cashew &#34;cheese&#34; sauce that is creamy and delicious.

Having spent a mere few minutes in the cafe, perusing the menu, it was hard not to overhear their conversations with each other, people that really care about each other and like their jobs. That carried through to their customers, even a newbie like me. I&#39;m not a vegan. I probably never will be. I may become a vegetarian at some point. What I do know, is that I like incorporating more healthy choices into my diet where I can. Enter Pure Juice Cafe.

Having gotten my new shoes and fitting from the running store a couple blocks over, I wanted to go with the moment and get a green smoothie. The staff here was so patient with me making my decision, and knowing I had calorie and sugar content concerns, handed me their business notebook showing many of the drinks and the nutritional info for each. Fantastic! For a mom and pop kind of place, I didn&#39;t really expect that info. 

I settled on the &#34;pulsation green&#34; in kid size (8 oz), spinach, apple, ginger, etc., as well as the &#34;certainly not coffee&#34; made without actual coffee/espresso, and with carob, chicory and something else I can&#39;t recall instead, with an optional splash of unsweetened coconut milk. Two drinks, just in case I hated one. I was not in a mood to gamble. ;) Both were good, the &#34;not coffee&#34; tasting of mocha, due to the carob. The green smoothie was delicious, refreshing and light. I happily gulped all 97 calories down quickly. I would definitely order that again, even in a larger size, what&#39;d ya know! :)

Feeling like I was ready to further embrace some veganism, I took home the fall salad, 2 vegan bon bons, and a vegan tiramisu, hoping to tempt the hubby. The fall salad ($10) included a garlic/tomato/sunflower sprout pâté, 3 carrot crackers, and a kale salad with marinated onions. I felt there was too much pâté or not enough crackers to work with each other proportionally, and the marinated onions were way over salted. I was kind of bummed I paid $10 for this salad. The tiramisu ($8) was delicious having been made from cashew cream and included a walnut crumble, which was disclosed to me, however it was PACKED with nuts, no way to avoid them which won&#39;t work for the hubby since he has texture issues where nuts are concerned. (That just doesn&#39;t sound right, does it?! Lol) So I was disappointed he couldn&#39;t enjoy it, but he loved the flavor- spot on! I haven&#39;t tried the bon bons (2 for $3.50) yet, so we shall see.

Please consider that, as I said, I&#39;m not a vegan or raw diet person; it&#39;s all fairly new to me. So even though I/we didn&#39;t love everything, I can appreciate the possibilities of it all. Further, despite it being a bit spendy for what amounts are received, I can also appreciate the labor-intensity that goes into creating some of these items, possibly justifying the costs. Beyond that, the cool and soothing colors and aesthetics of the cafe, coupled with the friendliness and accommodating nature of the staff, puts the experience in a perfectly positive light for me. Heading into spring, a time of renewal and rebirth (not to sound too hippie), makes the Pure Juice Cafe a place I want to visit more often. Bring on the spring, and the green, and the happy! :)"

Raw.  Vegan.  Gluten-free.  Dairy-free.

I love the concept of Pure Juice Cafe and am glad they decided to open up shop in downtown Arlington Heights.  I&#39;ve probably tried three-fourths of the smoothie menu and have loved each and every one, so don&#39;t worry your pretty head deciding which to choose.  Avocolada, Lavish Raspberry, Blueberry Cheesecake, Electrolyte Berry...oh, just close your eyes and pick one.  One of my many favorites is the Pure Green Goddess.  The cilantro adds an extra element of freshness.

I should probably substitute my daily latte for a daily smoothie.  As of lately, I&#39;ve been trying to grab a Maca Mocha, in place of my latte.  Everyone likes a little chocolate and banana with their espresso.  If you&#39;re not into a smoothie to satisfy for caffeine fix, Pure Juice also offers Organic Intelligentsia coffee &amp; lattes.  Also, do not miss out on the Vegan Cashew Hot Cocoa!  SooOoo good (with extra O&#39;s).

Anyone want to do a cleanse with me?  For $49 a day, they&#39;ll prepare 6 separate sixteen ounce bottles of juice for you to drink throughout your day.  They also have different options, such as a 5 day plan for $149, which would come with one juice, two meals, and a dessert or snack.  I&#39;ve juiced on my own before, but I usually only make it about three days.

Since opening, I&#39;ve seen a vast improvement in the foods and desserts.  In their first week of opening, the slim pickings of food seemed to be limp and lacking.  Now they appear more fulfilling.  The Detox Salad is nummy.  Desserts range anywhere from $3 to $10, and most of the food ranges from $7 to $10.  I frequent Pure Juice more so for the smoothies, which range from $6 to $10.  Honestly, I debated giving only 4 stars because I&#39;m not a fan of the pricing.  I understand the rent in Arlington Heights is out the roof, and they are delivering a delicious fresh healthy product that you can&#39;t find everywhere.  With prices this steep, it&#39;s hard to choose Pure Juice on a daily basis.  Luckily, every 10th drink is free!  Hey, it&#39;s better than nothing.

It&#39;s not the best location, in the center of a strip mall, nestled in downtown Arlington Heights where passerby&#39;s cannot see.  Although being in a downtown area is good.  They are located in the Evergreen Plaza, next to Pulsation Yoga, and across the way from Fausto&#39;s.  I wish they had outdoor seating to enjoy my juice or smoothie in the summer.  Maybe a few of those white tables and green chairs will make their way outside come summertime, although there&#39;s not much room and probably Arlington Heights would have a problem with it.

Pull into the downtown Arlington Heights area and grab a drink.  Here&#39;s to a healthy 2014!  Drink up!"

I love that this is a small,  local , woman-owned business with a holistic vibe!  It is in alignment with the organic, clean lifestyle that I live.  I love to invest in businesses that support my ideals.

They have a great variety of smoothies . Runner&#39;s High, Avocolada, Lavish Raspberry, Pure Green Goddess, Blueberry Cheesecake, Liquid Sunlight Mango, and The Essence are my faves.

It&#39;s a nice looking place inside, even though the exterior shopping plaza isn&#39;t as nice as everything else around downtown Arlington Heights.

I ordered an Extreme Green juice which was made to order.  I also picked out a black bean quinoa salad which was already prepared in a container.  I didn&#39;t ask, but I&#39;m assuming it was made fresh and it sure tasted like it.  Despite being mostly green vegetables, the juice was pretty tasty.  I expected that it MIGHT be a little heard to swallow, even though I&#39;m not usually a picky eater, but it went down quite well.  It also wasn&#39;t overly sweet as it supposed to be a raw drink.

I would describe myself as a rather typical American in my choice of lunch food, often opting for the quick and unhealthy fast food places, but I also enjoy healthy food.  I do it rarely, but I have made my own fresh juice and have also cooked quinoa before - Pure Juice Cafe had the same fresh taste that I&#39;ve had at home.

I&#39;m not sure how normal this is, but it wasn&#39;t busy.  I&#39;m the only one that sat down and ate - the other 4-5 customers that I saw ordered their juice and left.  I only bring this up because it&#39;s not a big space, perhaps only being able to comfortably sit about 20 people, something to keep in mind if you went with a lot of people."

It&#39;s not cheap, and I think that has something to do with the fact they use ACTUAL FRESH FOOD. I know this may be a shock to some people but the juice and food options here are expensive but very good for you. 

If you&#39;ve made it this far, I suggest googling the benefits of ratings raw diet or a raw food cleanse. 

Love this place, I highly recommend it."

I am new to the NW burbs from Colorado and I am desperately seeking ANYTHING HEALTHY!  And this is a place to go!  I too tried the good skin smoothe - and I loved it.  It was really similar to one at Whole Foods - and I think it pretty much has the same ingredients.   
And yes - just walking in the place is a nice relaxing treat - very soothing, mellowly invigorating - I know that sounds weird - but the wall of plants, the whirring juicers, the friendly quiet smile. . .  feels very comfortable.   
I WILL BE BACK!  Thank you for opening your shop!"

No I don&#39;t salivate over porterhouses, but I very much enjoy a filet now and again. Thus, every once in a while when I make the trip to dine upon a raw meal, I try to keep an open mind. And Pure Juice Cafe is a welcome addition to the myriad of none too healthy dining choices in AH. I felt healthy schmealthy and full after my meal here! 

The interior is low-key green chic - clean lines, bright spaces and even an area where the kiddos can play with stuffed vegetables (not for consumption). It&#39;s also worth noting that the staff is exceptionally sweet and helpful. 

A few things I sampled...

Tiramisu: 5/5: This was a star. Flavorful and creamy - I would probably eat a bucket of this if it wasn&#39;t so pricey. 

Breakfast oatmeal: 4/5: Berry berry tasty. A filling mish mash of blended fruit and other goodness topped with a smattering of granola.  

Raspberry bar: 3/5: The flavor on this one was nice but the consistency threw me off a bit. It was stiffer and tougher than expected

Glow juice: 4/5: This was sunshine in a cup. Very carroty (is that a word? it is now). My only ish with this juice is that it was fairly warm and some serious separation was happening so I had to swish it around quite a bit. 

Honestly, there&#39;s nothing like Pure Juice even remotely close to this shop. I hope they spread the juicy love all across the NW burbs."

The boyfriend and I decided to attempt the cleanse to reset our bodies prior to starting a new and healthier diet. I called in advance to order a 3-day cleanse for two people and was charged a total of $390. I know juice cleanses are expensive but I still found their prices to be pretty steep. I had done some research and the prices here are definitely not the cheapest (or the most expensive) that I came across. I decided to go with Pure Juice because it is closest to my house, making it the most convenient.

Now on the actual juices... I was expecting to feel pretty bad during the cleanse but it was so much worse than I imagined. Each day, you need to drink 6 different juices, which calculates to roughly 1 bottle every 2 hours. I didn&#39;t enjoy most of the juices and this made it difficult to finish each one. By the time I finished one, it was time for the next. This went on for 3 days. The only part of the day I looked forward to was the end when I could drink the &#34;Good Nut Milk&#34; (my favorite of the 6 daily drinks). I only wish the juices were tastier so it would take my mind off how miserable I was. In my opinion, each of the juices tasted too similar and I was craving more variety. I have to say that I am a little disappointed with my juice cleanse experience. If I ever decided to try it again, I&#39;ll do more research and find out if I can sample the juice flavors prior to making such a huge investment."

However, I got the raw &#34;spaghetti&#34; dish and found mold in my &#34;sauce&#34;. This is disappointing, but I think there are a lot of vegan restaurants that have this happen since all the dishes are made with fresh produce and no preservatives, so I won&#39;t ding them too much for this. Also, the lady was really apologetic and gave me some chocolates (which are SUPER delicious and the perfect bite at the end of a vegan meal) to make up for it. 

I tried the equilibrium sample and that was absolutely divine, as well as the sunrise drink, which is essentially oranges and lemons combined to make an orange juice. All in all, if I were to come back, I would just stick to a smoothie next time."

The cold pressed juices are the best I&#39;ve had in the Chicago area. Fresh, raw, and organic.

I don&#39;t eat enough veggies and love supplementing with their green juices.  Its an acquired taste but I love them now.

First thought I had walking in was how the owners of this place were geniuses for opening a juice bar next to a yoga studio. Anyhootles, their menu is intimidating. Its this long list of drinks, I didn&#39;t know where to start. Thankfully the staff were very helpful in getting me to pick a drink.

I ordered the Avocolada. It took a few minutes for them to make it, no biggie. The atmosphere is relaxing, especially when you&#39;re around all of these people who just finished yoga. Ok, drinks done, I walk out, take the first sip and let out an audible, &#34;GODDAMN&#34;. I turned around, walked back into the juice bar and told them how insanely delicious the drink was. This place is a tad more expensive than Jamba Juice, but man is it worth it!

The coffee is fantastic, as well as the raspberry bar and pumpkin pie, which I think is seasonal.

Second time I order from here. The spicy baja hamburger has real japenos and guacamole. Sweet potatoes are so enjoyable and the chocolate shake is out of this world. 
The staff here are so nice. Jen was super nice and efficient. Took care of order fast and they seem they like their job.

Will definitely be coming here.

Overall, everything was fine. They have gluten free buns, at one dollar more, and is very much appreciated for celiacs like me. 

I had the avocado burger and it was decent. The burger was very well done and loaded with mayo (I would get it without next time). The fries were also insanely oily. Still good, but I left feeling like I just ate a terribly unhealthy meal. But I guess I didn&#39;t go there expecting something healthy. 

Would I go back?  Yea.. But it was 12 dollars for a burger, fries and drink. I could get the same thing at a restaurant for less."

It&#39;s funny, because since I&#39;m a gamer, Everytime I see a two-toned sign that&#39;s red and white, I&#39;m thinking GameStop. Walking-in, the restaurant was pretty unique. Having smash themes, the red decor, very interesting...

I ordered the Spicy Cowboy Burger, and the smash fries. When you place your order, they give you a tall number that stands up on your table, and you wait for it to be served. 

When I got my meal, I noticed that the fries looked comparable to a mix between McDonald&#39;s fries and Steak &#39;N&#39; Shake fries.  I did order the Smash fries, which I believe is their signature fries. They have rosemary, garlic, and tossed in an Italian oil.  The Spicy Cowboy Burger featured a single grilled beef patty with freshly sliced jalapenos, fried onion strings, applewood smoked bacon, aged cheddar cheese, and your typical American burger toppings of tomato, lettuce, and onion. 

The cheese on the burger didn&#39;t taste like aged cheddar. It almost seemed like it was that kind of cheese you get from the can, where you press on the nozzle and cheese cheese comes out. It had the type of taste, and now to think of it, I think it&#39;s called Easy Cheese. 

The other flavors of the burger was pretty good. I liked the fresh jalapenos. It wasn&#39;t overbearing with spiciness, but kept you satisfied with the desired spiciness. The bacon, was my favorite part. So crispy, and so good!!!The burger was juicy, and of course because it was freshly grilled. The fries were very lack luster to me. 

They did have a slight rosemary taste, and I did taste olive oil, but there was no hint of garlic anywhere. I expected for their signature fries to be &#34;smashin&#39;&#34;, with flavor, but tasted like they could barely make me break the glass from loving them like I wanted to. 

Overall, I do believe they need some work on their Cowboy sandwich. Perhaps, try a white aged cheddar, rather than some weird spread or whatever that cheese is that&#39;s on there now? The fries definitely need help. More garlic, and leave the subtleness that is the rosemary because it was perfect. I believe the Italian oil is unnecessary.

Smash Burger, I&#39;m sorry it wasn&#39;t a smashing meal for me, but I have hope!! It was great experiencing it for the first time, I just wish the flavors could have been there for me."

Overall though, I have had a few less than perfect trips. In the last month I have gone there 3 times with coupons. The first time I went their register froze and they had to check me out after I finished eating my food. They handled the mishap appropriately so I don&#39;t have much complaint there. 

The second time, the employee misread my coupon and wouldn&#39;t let me order the exact item I wanted, but if you read the note (*) at the bottom it said I could order the item I wanted. The employee was gracious about it but it put me in an awkward position because I didn&#39;t want to say &#34;No you are wrong!&#34; and cause a scene over a 40 cent coupon. Also my burger had toppings on it that I did not order. 

The third time, I ordered a burger and I forgot to say to cook it well done. It was really on the border for me between raw and cooked enough. I&#39;m not sure if that is how all their burgers come, but normally at other restaurants when I forget to specify it is not that pink (I&#39;m guessing for safety reasons). They really should ask customers how they want their burger cooked, especially because they cook their burgers less than medium. 

My shake was really good, I definitely would recommend it! I also really enjoy their burgers and fries if I remember to order my burger well done. 

I want to like this location more because the staff tries so hard but they really need to work on perfecting their customer service."

They do have a good variety of burgers to choose from though you kind of have to know ahead of time what you want.   I especially love their Buffalo &amp; Blue Cheese Burger.    The ingredients are pretty basic with the main star being Frank&#39;s Red Hot Buffalo sauce.    It has great flavor through each bite.   I&#39;ve only tried their Smash Fries which I find too oily.   

Service is friendly and I&#39;ve typically ordered out and timeliness of bringing order is reasonable.   I just wish you could order ahead on the phone and have it ready for pickup.    But that minor hassle aside, they are a good go-to place for burgers."

The manager was very friendly and my food was cooked perfectly. I had the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger and it was very juicy and cooked just right. The only problem was that the burger itself is one of the blandest burgers I have ever eaten. It tasted like a plain beef patty with no seasonings at all. They could at least put some salt on it. I ordered the regular French fries and those were seasoned well and very tasty. I probably won&#39;t go back for another tasteless burger. I only gave a two star rating because this is a burger joint and was expecting a much better burger. The burger isn&#39;t worth more than two stars in my book.

I&#39;ve been here a couple of times in the past few months. It&#39;s not you that&#39;s changed, it&#39;s me. And I pretty much only like burgers with meat that has been seasoned now.

The windy city burger remains one of the better burgers, while the mushroom truffle burger continues to disappoint. I do just get singles, but the burgers were better proportioned at the beginning of Smashburger&#39;s tenure in Bloomingdale.

On the most recent visit, even the sweet potato smashfries were just not good. When I got them, they didn&#39;t have nearly as many herbs as they used to. After I told them (because I thought they gave me standard sweet potato fries), they returned the fries back to me with a whole lot of olive oil dumped on top of them, and an absurdly minimal amount of herbs.

Yikes.

The quality dropoff here has been so far that I&#39;m starting to wonder if, outside of Tom and Eddie&#39;s, it&#39;s possible to get a great burger in the suburbs. Portillo&#39;s is pretty good. But I won&#39;t be coming back here."

I placed an easy order online. The website almost seemed to brag about how easy it would be to pick up my food. &#34;No need to wait in line, just walk right up to the To-Go sign, sign a paper, take your food and leave.&#34; My e-mail confirmation came a few minutes later and gave me the same gist. Ok, I was looking forward to this easy experience. 

Well, I get in the place and there&#39;s no sign. One person is at the register, no other workers in sight. Given no other options, I hop in line to wait for my order that is likely ready. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t mind waiting but I was told twice by Smashburger, &#34;No need to wait in line, just pick-up and go.&#34; So I waited. 

When there was only one customer in front of me, the manager (I think) needed to be called to check the ID of the person. After she checked the ID she went to the window to the kitchen and someone added a side of bacon to their order. I&#39;m not sure exactly what happened but she YELLED into the kitchen (she was on the customer side) &#34;I NEED YOU TO HAND ME THE SIDE OF BACON. DON&#39;T THROW THE SIDE OF BACON AT ME.&#34; Listen lady, if anyone is going to throw food at me, I&#39;d happily have it be bacon. But take your &#34;lovers quarrel&#34; or animosity or spite away from the restaurant side. Leave that biz in the kitchen. 

I was super turned off by that, if she talked like that in front of customers I can&#39;t imagine what goes on in the back. I&#39;m really not a fan of what&#39;s going on at this place."

Thinly pounded out but juicy, they are delicious. My bf however likes the regular smashburger much more.

I will say that I don&#39;t plan on getting the salads again. Almost $9 for a Chicken Caesar salad that&#39;s only slightly larger than my hand! The dressing was in two sauce containers inside the bowl so that took up even more valuable salad space! I&#39;m also assuming they use the same greens for all the salads. Mine had some red onion in it and it was a mixture of greens (sometimes i had a strong bitterness). Totally ruins my Caesar salad experience. I did appreciate the guy asked the cooks, &#34;No tomatoes right?&#34; to double check my request. Great customer service there.

Their service has always been great every time I go. Very friendly.

First off, this location seems to be dirty every time I&#39;m here. The tables need to be wiped, the restroom deperately needed a good cleaning, the floor has food on it and they are ALWAYS out of clean silverware.  I just don&#39;t get it. 

On my most recent visit, my gal pal ordered a chicago chicken sandwich and they served her a burger. The 3 people in our group were sharing sides, so it made sharing the sides difficult for the person that ordered the messed up sandwich and had to wait for her food to be remade. I ordered my sandwich on a plate (because I cut it with a fork and knife and I learned you can request your sandwich on a plate from the founder of Smashburger, himself) and it was served in a basket which you can cut right through to the metal basket so I asked again for a plate instead.

It&#39;s obvious to me that the people taking the orders at the register should repeat the order back to the customer to make sure it&#39;s correct but this is not being done. 

Overall the food is good, they need some work in other areas.

Never tried their chicken sandwiches but if your kids like chicken tenders and you get a chance to sneak some off their plate, by all means you should do so - their tenders are exceptionally moist and well seasoned.

It has eat in service and a to go menu, the inside is clean and they have a handful of different menu items including burgers, chicken sandwiches and hot dogs.

In visiting Smashburger I decided to try the Chicago style hot dog. At 4.29 it was one of the more expensive hot dogs I&#39;ve come across. So with that I expected it would at least be fairly decent,

The hot dog I received came on a very hard poppy seed bun. Instead of a pickle slice or spear they simply applied hamburger pickles to this dog. The sausage itself was charred and sliced right up the middle so that any flavor the dog itself might have had can soak out. The application of mustard was uneven and too much relish and onion were applied. I didn&#39;t detect any celery salt. If there&#39;s any one positive to this hot dog it&#39;s that the peppers were the right size and neither too hot or too tough and the tomato slices were properly cut and well applied.

Overall this is easily one of the worst Chicago style hot dogs I&#39;ve come across. If it were 2.00 I might be more forgiving but at roughly $4.50 with tax this is inexcusably bad."

I pretty much always get the same burger - Windy City Smash (no mustard, no veggies, add ranch). I recommend that you eat anything with onion strings at the restaurant.

Tasty food- I tried the haystack onions this time instead of the fries- very skinny and very good. I loved my make your own burger on the pretzel bun- I added smash sauce, lettuce, tomato and pickle- great!

And I&#39;m quite upset I wasted my burger allowance for the month at this place.  I&#39;ll say this much good about it.... my husband&#39;s burger (Spicy Baja) was &#34;ok&#34; according to him.  And the cost for fries is reasonable for the portion.  

I did a create your own.  I&#39;m simple.  Bacon, cheddar, avocado.  And that&#39;s it.  For $1.50 for the bacon I got 4 tiny pieces of fat (reference picture)  It didn&#39;t even cover half the burger and for $1.50 I would expect to actually get some bacon.  Same for the $1.00 add of avocado.  So thin I could see through them, and barely was detected while I ate the burger.  The meat..... I&#39;m not usually picky about meat but I did not like the taste of their meat.  You know when you eat a burger and you question if the meat was old or possible just not seasoned?  That&#39;s what it tasted like to me.  I did get the pretzel bun which was only ok.  

The fries - Both my husband and I got the sweet potato fries.  His were doused in olive oil like they advertise, mine were dry as a bone.  Odd to send out to very different versions of the same thing to one table.  Portions were good for the $1.99 price.  

I tasted his burger.  It was ok.  There were so many toppings on the Spicy Baja that it covered the taste of the meat so to me was more edible.  

For $22 it was a complete fail.  I ate half of my burger and gave the rest to my not so picky husband.  For that money I would of rather gone to my very much more favored Red Robin located right across the street.

Service was fine although as a bit of a germ freak, I did not like when being handed our burger, the server/manager was talking directly over our baskets as he was figuring out who&#39;s was who&#39;s.  Ick.

At least I tried it and now I know....... Smash burger is not for me."

Pros:  
1. There are pretzel buns!  PRETZEL BUNS!  I love me a pretzel bun.  There are also some other fancy buns but I wasn&#39;t about to mess around with them once I saw that pretzel buns were on the menu.
2. There is crumbled blue cheese and Frank&#39;s buffalo sauce.  Yum and yum. There&#39;s also a lot of toppings to choose from and a build your own option. Perfect for the pickiest of people. 
3. There are fried pickles.  Though they are seriously salty. 
4. There&#39;s also some fancy fries that are pretty good with rosemary, garlic, olive oil. (Though they are REALLY OILY.)
5. They sell beer too.  Not great beer, but there was Goose Island IPA so I was just fine.
6. It&#39;s pretty quick (8-10 minutes) and pretty cheap ($20 for two complete meals).

Cons:
1. It&#39;s small.
2. Staff is hit or miss on general customer service.
3. Do I tip or not?  I&#39;m not sure what to do in places like this.  It&#39;s an order at the counter place but they bring your food out and clean up after you.    
4. This is not a place where there is a lot of variety BUT it is a burger place so I&#39;d assume you&#39;d be going there for a burger most likely.  Bottom line: Leave your vegan friends at home.  
5. The regular fries are those teeny tiny skinny ones. Not my fave.
6. The burgers are all skinny and well done and smashed. Thus the name. 

I definitely like this place for a quick and decent burger fix.  It is DEFINITELY better than Five Guys, so there&#39;s that, and it offers more than most order-at-the-counter places.  Check it out."

I purchased a Groupon and went in to use it. I mentioned the Groupon and proceeded to order. Once I finished ordering, I was told I needed to use cash only because of the small balance. This forced me to run out to get cash. As I was walking out of the door, they were fixing my milkshake which would have melted by the time I returned. I asked if they could wait until I returned with the cash and they agreed to do so, but prepared my food. 

I came back and had to wait in line again as my food sat under the light. I was given the order. I mentioned that I had a few minutes drive and the fries are probably cold. She assured me that they were fresh out the fryer. When I mentioned they were sitting under the light for at least 10 minutes while I waited to get to the register, she said &#34;they should still be okay&#34;. 
I ordered a burger, smashfries and a chai tea milkshake. I really enjoyed the milkshake. The fries were pretty good cold, so that is a good sign. I will give it another try but really do not expect too much."

I tagged along with my parents to visit this new burger kid on the block. Walking in I didn&#39;t know what to expect. I found the menu on the large screens behind the cashier to be sort of distracting because it would change right when I found what I was looking for. I will say that Smashburger does offer a lot of options. They have combinations already put together for you - like the Windy City, Mushroom and Swiss, and Baja Burgers - but you can also create your own from the type of bun to the toppings. Also, you can order a chicken sandwich or salad if you&#39;re not looking for a burger.

I ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger. It&#39;s usually my go-to burger combo. I also ordered some sweet potato smashfries. My order came out with regular smashfries. Which was disappointing, but that was quickly remedied by the staff that brought out a fresh order of sweet potato smashfries after I brought it to their attention. The burger is well, smashed, and seemed to be of a good quality but I couldn&#39;t tell because it was covered in salt. The fries however were great! I loved that they had a touch of rosemary on them. If you like sweet potatoes, you&#39;ll like these fries.

I still put Five Guys ahead of Smashburger when it comes to burger making, but am not ready to tell Smashburger to pack their knives and go. I like the number of combinations that can be ordered and am curious to see how they handle chicken. Oh and any place with green river soda on the menu gets some major props from me."

I&#39;m not a burger person but this is definitely a step wayyy up to Mickey Dee&#39;s or other fast food. 
The haystack onions are good, quite the same as Tom and Eddies. Its a toss up between those two but for the short drive, its this place."

Smash that burger! I can&#39;t believe how many of these burger places have open up in the past year (five guys, epic burger, etc.) but I am sold after my first visit. I had the big smash &#34;windy city&#34; which has melted cheddar, onions, lettuce, tomato, spicy mustard, and pretzel bun. The first thing I notice is the meat flavor that is absent from McD burgers and unlike steak and shake, there is a good amount of meat. The pretzel bun is soft and likely the best bun on the menu. The sides come separate and I ordered the sweet potato fries which were fried perfectly, unfortunately the size of the sides leaves much to be desired. Also I couldn&#39;t figure out why I had a few random non-sweet potato fries. For those who are picky, you can build your burger completely ala carte. Service is fast and they bring the food to your table. The only downside is the seating arrangement is slightly cramped but bearable.

Pro- excellent &#34;meaty&#34; burger, okay price, fast service

Con- small sides, cramped seating

This place is delicious.

If you&#39;re in the mood for a great burger and want a quieter night than Portillo&#39;s but a less expensive night than, say, Red Robin, Smash Burger is the place to go. It&#39;s a nice looking place- very modern and clean. Definitely one of the more refined burger places I have ever been to. And just because there&#39;s no where else to fit this sentence in, I&#39;ll say it here: Smash is WAY better than 5 Guys.

Moving on, the experience its self is similar to going to Noodles &amp; Co, but unlike Noodles, the service continues throughout the meal. It&#39;s enough that it warrants a decent gratuity, so do factor that into your evening if you end up going.

Generally, I compare most burger joints to Portillo&#39;s- one cannot deny the value and deliciousness of a Portillo&#39;s burger. Compared to Portillo&#39;s the price point was maybe a dollar or two higher and you&#39;ll get a little less burger for the money. You will, however, get a more unique and (arguably) flavorful burger. The meat at Smash is fresh Angus Beef- never frozen, and some of the burgers (like mine) come with things like pretzel buns and spicy mustard.  Ingredients like these make the stop something really worthwhile.

The burgers are great, but the fries at Smash were even better. for $2 you can get the Smash Fries which are similar to McDonald&#39;s fries, but seasoned with garlic and rosemary- and they&#39;re made fresh to order. Outstanding.

They also have bottles of Green River on ice.

In short, though Smash Burger isn&#39;t the best value ever, and though persistent patronage may one day kill you, it&#39;s got fantastic food and is absolutely worth checking out at your earliest convenience."

My sister-in-law and my niece hadn&#39;t been to a Smashburger yet and although my hubby had been to one, he had never EATEN at one before (can you even imagine going &amp; not eating?).  So on Saturday, after my niece&#39;s cheerleading competition, we made our way back to Bloomingdale to give this brand new location a try.

So clean.  It&#39;s one of the reasons that I enjoy eating inside the Smashburger restaurants so much.  It&#39;s a nice feeling with their carpeted floor and cozy seats.  I enjoy the ambiance.  

My husband and I enjoyed more than our fair share of Smashburger goodness for about $23.  The Big Smash is just too much.  I keep ordering it and then I can&#39;t even come close to eating it AND a side like the fried pickles or the sweet potato fries.  I need to get the smaller burger or stop ordering a side.  Keep in mind that the portions are plentiful and the side can easily be shared.  

My hubby tried a Spicy Baja Burger.  His review:  &#34;It was good.  I&#39;d eat it again.&#34;  (This might be the reason that I Yelp and he doesn&#39;t.  I&#39;m just sayin&#39;.)

My sister-in-law went with a Spicy Baja Burger as well.  She seemed to enjoy it and made a good dent in her sweet potato fries.  

My niece enjoyed a kids Smashburger with bacon, fries and a chocolate milkshake.  She told us more than once how great the milkshake was and she drank every last drop.  She did mention that it was too much bun/bread for the burger though.

There&#39;s a nice seating area outside which we couldn&#39;t enjoy because it was way to windy.  Hopefully, Spring will be here before we know it though.  :-)

I dropped a star for a couple reasons.  The seating area is small.  It&#39;s the nature of the beast since the building was already, but it was very crowded and then we overheard a staff member comment on how long people were sitting there.  I&#39;m sure that he was just surprised because it&#39;s a fast casual restaurant and you don&#39;t expect people to linger, but we did - it&#39;s a nice place.  And cozy.  We weren&#39;t in a hurry until we realized that people were having a hard time finding a place to sit.  Also, the very friendly employee clearing plates off the table and wiping things off was almost too friendly.  I know that I probably shouldn&#39;t comment about this, but she hung around chatting for so long that it seemed like she should pull up a chair and sit down.  The whole focus of our conversation changed when she came by and that was kinda strange.  I like friendly people.  It was just a bit much.  

Looking forward to another visit soon!  Guess I&#39;m glad that it was crowded because it means you are doing well and will hopefully stick around for a long time to come."

Sorry to bash on your logo, but I&#39;m a design student and I cannot let it stand. Fair enough, helvetica is everywhere and an cookie cutter font for most business identity. Honestly though, the same color usage as well as a uniform tracking between both words. I digress.

This place really feels like a Steak&#39;n&#39;Shake recently had a facelift. I&#39;m not just speaking appearance, but also menu wise. I had the regular smashburger and their signature sauce was okay. It tasted like a tangy garlic aioli. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the tangy part was just ketchup, but it works and gives the burger a fun-ness to it. The burger was just mediocre, and decently priced. 

The highlight of the meal was the rosemary &#39;smash fries&#39;. It was very fragrant and you can taste the hint of rosemary without it being too overbearing. I didn&#39;t understand why they gave me ketchup for my fries as it would have covered up that awesome rosemary taste.

The shakes seemed a bit expensive, so I did not partake. Overall the rosemary fries were the saving grace. Do I think this franchise has legs? Well, currently they seem to be growing pretty steadily, however in Illinois/Greater Chicago, I think it is all novelty. Once that &#39;new car smell&#39; wears off Smashburger will struggle.

The place lacked the great service attitude I find at other  smash burgers. And just like a previous comment, there was a manager type sitting in a booth talking on his cell phone. The staff had to come out and get him several times when they needed him. Perhaps it would be a better place if he actually managed and stayed behind the counter instead of hiding in the booth.

We all got four very different custom burgers. Two of us ordered sweet potato fries, one got smash fries, and another got deep fried pickles. All of our orders came out very wrong. We had the wrong buns, wrong toppings, and wrong sides, we could barely tell whose meal should have been whose. They took them all back, and when the brought them back one of my coworkers orders was still wrong. They took it back and fixed it for her, but it was a process. 

After all the confusion, or food was finally right, and it tasted really good. A+ for all the fries and deep fried pickles. Yum! And they give a pretty good amount of avocado for the $1 price.

I have been to Smashburger with my boyfriend now about 4 or 5 times and we love it!
Here, you can create your own burgers, or just stick with the regular menu burgers they offer. You can get 3 different sizes with the &#34;create your own&#34; burgers. Small Smash, Smash and Big Smash which Im sure you can pretty much guess it&#39;s Small, Medium and Large.

For the regular menu selections you can only get Smash or Big Smash sizes. The Small Smash is pretty small, more of a child size burger, so for the ladies out there who share the same stomach as I do, a Smash will feed you plenty! For the guys, you will need to order the Big Smash in order to fill your tummy!!

The first time we came here I got the Spicy Baja burger and it was AWESOME. I love that extra kick from the spicy chipotle mayo gives to it. The burgers are pretty greasy, but they are made fresh. 
The french fries are really good too.. you can get their regular, garlic or sweet potato fries. I have only had the regular and garlic, as I am not a fan of sweet potato&#39;s. 

The only complaint I have about this place is it gets packed on the weekends because it is right across the street from Stratford Square mall and they do not have enough seating for everyone. You can take it to go, but where I live by the time I get home the food is cold. In the summer they have a small patio where I would say maybe 4 tables would be set up. Still, I wish they chose a better location for this place so they would have a bigger dining room. 

If your in the area, I would definetely stop in and try this place! You won&#39;t be dissapointed.

I had an American burger with the egg bun and I had some of my wife&#39;s burger with the pretzel bun (which was a lot better than I thought it would be). 
Great fresh food and clean place. Will definitely go back."

My first burger was the Windy City which was a 1/3 lb. burger with fried onions on a pretzel roll; my second was the Classic with grilled onions on an egg bun, both were amazing. Since Boston Blackies closed I&#39;ve been searching for a delicious burger place and this may be it. I do plan to visit Smashburger myself to get the full experience, but Im already a fan (&#34;Yay!&#34;) beause of the food. Sidebar: they add rosemary to the fries and sweet potato fries.. my mom isn&#39;t exactly thrilled with it but I think it adds a little something extra and I give them a thumbs up for that one."

Admittedly I&#39;ve only eaten there once, and the issue may be that I tried to pick a couple sandwiches from their &#34;Recipe Book&#34; where I may have enjoyed it more if I had gone off the board and mixed and matched to make my own creation.   Selection of toppings &amp; breads seems to be great.  

Fries were NOT good, in my opinion, and service was a little slow for a place that appears to be &#34;cafeteria style&#34;.  We were told by friends that they were 100% &#34;Five Guys&#34; goers until they ate at Smash Burger.  Personally, I&#39;d still go for &#34;Five Guys&#34;.  

I guess to sum it up - it was worth trying, but if I go back, I&#39;ll definitely &#34;roll my own&#34; rather than picking something they&#39;re suggesting."

This is hands down my favorite burger place.  Cooked to order, fresh lean beef, piled with onion straws and whatever else you can want.  AND ON A PRETZEL BUN!  Home Run...loved it.

Thanks Smashburger. See you real soon!"

My favorite is actually a buffalo Chicken sandwich. Yum! Fresh blue cheese crumbles are perfect for the tasty buffalo sauce. Food comes out fast and it is really fresh. I love that you can customize anything. 
I do agree with the other reviews about the portion size of the fries -- way too small. The shakes are great too!"

But, I thought the burger was gristly and waaaay too greasy. The bun was soaked and getting mushy. Also, I ordered a BBQ burger which, incidentally, had nearly no BBQ sauce on it. My daughter came with me and also wasn&#39;t entirely happy with her burger. I&#39;d sincerely rather have Wendy&#39;s because I spend less and really love what I eat. When I&#39;m eating fast food, I give up the whole &#34;health food&#34; discussion.. obviously, if I really wanted to be healthy I&#39;d go get a salad, not a burger. I probably will try it one more time just to make sure I didn&#39;t hit this place on an off day but, for now, it&#39;s looking like my daughter and I will show up and get a gigantic order of fries, then drive through Wendy&#39;s for our burgers."

I was hoping the taste would reflect that.  This will be our last stop here.  First of all, why is there a tip jar sitting at the cashier stand of a fast food joint?  This is very tacky.  I have to go to the counter, order my food, get my own drink, and get my own napkins, straws, etc.  McDonalds offers more than that without asking for a tip.  I paid with a Visa...and again, there is a spot for a tip?  For what?

Now on to the food.  Burgers were overcooked and the tiny dab of chedder was an insult.  For starters, it was situated only in the very center of the burger.  When I eat a bacon cheeseburger, I prefer to taste cheese with every bite.  Not just the middle few.  I ordered a burger with no Tomatoes.  I noticed that the receipt reflected my request for bacon but not my request for no tomatoes.  I went back to counter (I should have gotten a tip!) and was told the kitchen had the request.  Thats fine.  A few minutes later, our food comes out and my burger has no tomatoes (yay!), but no haystack onions either (which was in the description on the menu).  The runner apologized and went back to get it added to the burger.  Next my wife and I took a bite of our smash fries....virtually inedible.  The rosemary completely overpowered the fries and garlic was no where to be found.  Our 5 year old spit out his fries and refused to eat them.  We left hungry, dissatisfied with both the service and the poor quality.  If we want to overpay for burgers, next time, we will go to Five Guys.  At least their high priced burgers taste good.

Very disappointed!"

We have tried their burgers, but we prefer five guys for the cost. The chicken sandwich is by far my favorite, but their food does not travel well. You really need to eat it immediatly because it changes once u get home and forget warming it up! 
We are also not a fan of their fries. We have tried all of them and the staff tells s they are best served fresh and warm, I think they are best not served @ all! And for the cost, I&#39;d rather grab my chicken sandwich from here and the fries from five guys! 
As far as their side dishes are concerned, we each got a salad this last time and will never do so again! The lettice on both of our (one salad and one wedge) salads was horribly wilted and brown. Save your money when it comes to the sides.

The service is iffy at best. From the point of order to walking out with a take out order of a chicken salad and wedge it took about 30 min. All the while a server was vacuming place going under the feet of people sitting @ tables and the music was far to loud to be ambiance music. We don&#39;t stay usually because at either location we visit the staff is miserable and it shows. 

Doubtful we will return to this location as it just didn&#39;t &#39;wow&#39; us. We might return for the chicken sandwich, but we know now it has to be eaten right away!"

When you walk in, there&#39;s a sign that says &#34;grab a menu&#34;.  Great, this is our first time and if there is more than one person in line you cannot easily read the overhead menu up front so I thought the hand held menus would be nice. They would have been if there were any. The bin was completely empty and it was only noon and only two hours since their opening. The girl that took our order asked if this was our first visit, we said yes and she replied with, &#34; ok so do you know anything about our food?&#34; It was awkward and slightly flakey so we ignored her and went onto order. I ordered my burger minus tomato and mayo and when it came out i noticed there was tomato. I wasn&#39;t going to complain so I was just pulling them off when my husband noticed there was also mayo. My husband brought the food back up to let them know, and from my table I could hear the girl at the register yell back to the kitchen that my order was wrong. Tacky. They brought out a fresh burger and the girl said in a very insincere tone and without any eye contact, &#34;um sorry bout that.&#34;  I then noticed that they didn&#39;t even have the decency to replace the paper liner in the basket, so I have my correct burger with tomato juice and seeds as well as mayo spread all over the paper. The restaurant was dirty also. We sat next to the window and the ledge was covered in dust and food remnants. The staff was not friendly or professional. Nobody was asking customers how their food was or greeting/sending farewell as people came and went, and there were plenty of employees there for this to happen. 
 Bottom line: I&#39;m a bit of a customer service snob but I feel that being kind and genuine can go a long way. If you hate your job, then leave because people shouldn&#39;t have to pay for that kind of service. Definitely wont go back, will stick with Meatheads or Five Guys from now on."

So, as I mentioned, I am trying to find a great burger place, and I went here and ordered a chicken sandwich. I&#39;m not feeling too bright today. But anyway, we asked the girl at the register what she suggested, and she said either the Avocado Club Burger or Avocado Club Chicken. We both ordered the chicken. The fries are ala carte, so the hubby ordered Smashfries (Tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic) and I ordered the Sweet Potato Smashfries. We got a kid&#39;s cheeseburger for the princess. 
The fries, whether sweet or regular, were awesome. The chicken sandwich was fine, nothing to rave about, but definitely passable. But, here&#39;s the kicker. I was almost half way through my sandwich and hubs was almost completely done when I put the sandwich down, opened the bun and realized that there was no avocado. On my Avocado Club. No avocado. Not on mine, not on the hubby&#39;s. The manager was walking through the dining room and must have seen me because he walked straight over and asked if everything was okay. I told him about the missing avocado, and he said he would return right away with some. Before I complain, I was impressed with his observation of the dining room and his responsiveness. But, when a customer is about to put the last bite of an incorrectly made sandwich in to his mouth and the other has eaten half of hers, the solutions is probably NOT to go and get the missing ingredient. An ingredient that is in the title of the name they gave it. I think it would have been better to give us a voucher or coupon or something for our next visit. At least I would have felt like it encouraged a return visit.
In conclusion, for nearly $30 for 2 adults and 1 child at an fast food restaurant (albeit a somewhat upscale one), I was not thrilled. But, I kind of blame myself. It&#39;s called Smashburger and I ordered chicken. I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ll go back and try the burger at some point."

They&#39;re not the ritz, but they&#39;re not the pitz!  The burger was nicely cooked and well flavored and the herbed fries were a really nice surprise.  However, I like a burger with a little heft and methinks mine got smashed just a little too much giving it the feel of a giant slider.All in all, if you&#39;re near an outlet of this new-to-the-area chain, do give it a try.

Half pepperoni half sausage, green peppers, and onions

Along with that I had a coupon for a free small thin crust cheese pizza with any order over $20. 

They didn&#39;t ask for the coupon when they arrived and I got more with my order anyways. 

Delicious pizza. The only part I wasn&#39;t so excited about was the crust which has almost a stale taste. Yet was still okay crust. 

I loved that the pizza came with aluminum foil on top because it kept it burning hot. Took a minute to cool down but was well worth the wait. 

They are located in rosella and I live in Hanover park. Took our pizza about and hour and 15 minutes to get here. 

If you like Rosatis, Nancy&#39;s is comparable. Nancy&#39;s thin crust is thicker than Rosatis and their topping seem a bit more fresh.

We called, placed our order, and were told it would be a 45 minute wait.  No problem. Slightly less than 45 minutes later, our hot pizza showed up! Our bill was $17 with tip (not sure if that was because of the tax/delivery charges or if its because my husband is a generous tipper). 

I knew it would be a small pizza, but I hadn&#39;t quite expected four slices. Yes, they were big slices of stuffed pizza, but I was disappointed at the size for how much we paid for it! It was really good, though -- just the perfect amount of cheese and sauce and yummy-ness.

The bread was rubbery, the cheese was overcooked and burnt onto the bread, the lettuce was not crisp and the chicken was soggy. I will never order from here again. No clue how they stay open with the quality of food that they serve. If I could give it a half of star, that is all they might have received from me. I do not recommend ordering from here!!"

Upon walking in, one of the workers held the door open for my kids and I. The menu can seem overwhelming (not as uncoordinated as McDonald&#39;s and Subway) but there is a lot, lot, lot, lot of items to choose from.

I got the grilled chicken sandwich, which was cooked pretty well. It wasn&#39;t dry at all and the bun on the sandwich delicious. My kids had the ice cream sundae and Oreo mixer... they both loved it. The waitstaff called my 9-year old, &#34;sir&#34;, which he thought was super-cool. Haha.

BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the front, the bathroom consisted of one urinal and stall. My 6-year old utilized the stall for both needs (TMI) and was to his satisfaction. Urinal was pretty decent, and the soap dispenser dispensed soap obediently. Paper towel dispenser was on-point. Sit or squat? I assume squat, but my son sat. Ugh, not sure how to rate this now. Hmmm, a little squat-hover?"

I&#39;d describe Culver&#39;s as &#34;upscale fast food&#34;. This isn&#39;t fine dining by any stretch. However, the menu is more extensive than typical fast food fare. There are areas they handle quite well (the burgers and most of the other sandwiches and the sides) and others not so well (fried chicken, seafood).

Their frozen custard is quite good and very reasonably priced if you buy two pints together."

the custard was also super good, but i&#39;ve never had bad frozen custard, so i guess it just didn&#39;t stand out. it was delicious! i like that they have a flavor of the day (even though that day it was just a twist with m&amp;m minis in it). everyone here is super nice and friendly. also as a bonus, they have pepsi max in their fountain drinks in case you need an extra caffeine boost."

Mostly, because I had tried their custard. People swear by it, but I think it is inauthentic plastic glop.  Milwaukee has the best custard in the world (Kopp&#39;s, Leon&#39;s). Why did they send this mess south? That said, someone told me that their fish was good.  Well, the cod was excellent, with a wonderful crispy batter. However, the whitefish was downright old. I think the further south you go, the worse whitefish seems to be.  It has a short shelf life and doesn&#39;t ship well. The clam chowder was superb, as were the green beans.

Had it here in the U.S. and had it in Japan many times. Easily my most favorite beer-dish to have. Yakitori Boogytori is good. The portions are small (even smaller than your typical hole-in-a-wall restaurant in Japan), but it&#39;s good, but not GREAT. It&#39;s not a bastard-child of the glory that is yakitori. It&#39;s a good effort.

Now to the food:

The buta was great. It was tender, flavorful and a decent portion size. Premium pork, I don&#39;t expect a lot of, but this was easily the best part. Cooked thoroughly, cooked well, and something I approve of.

The gyu was tender and better tasting than the restaurant&#39;s across the street (Umacamon). Grilled the right amount, not as large, but a better cut.

The tori was ok at best. The skins were very small, never seen them this small before and they are often overcooked. The flavor was there, but this needs to be cooked less.

Chicken Karaage, please try this. Best one I&#39;ve had so far in the northwestern suburbs.

Service. It&#39;s gotten better. I think most of the waitresses are friendly now.

Price: About 25% more than yakitori should be.

Everything else is above average at best. Music is great. I&#39;d maybe change the lighting. It kinda sucks having a setting sun in your eyes while you&#39;re trying to eat dinner. Some people like it, but I&#39;m not a fan of squinting all the time. If you wanna try yakitori, this is a good place to start. But know that there are much better and with time, I hope Yakitori Boogytori can be there too.

Haven&#39;t had such delicious skewers since I lived in NYC and was a regular at Yakitori Taisho on St. Mark&#39;s.

Some of the selections can be a little leery for newcomers, like the gizzard and hearts, but stick with the shiitake (mushrooms), short ribs, and tsukune  (chicken meatball), and you should be fine.

A very nice selection of beers, sake, shochu, whiskey, and wines to pair with your hot meat skewers."

If you&#39;re looking for inexpensive eats or the most band for your buck then this isn&#39;t the place for you. If you&#39;re looking for good food try it out. The food is grilled over imported Japanese charcoal for you and served on bamboo skewers. They specialize is grilled meat (mostly cage free chicken) and vegetables. They also have a large selection of sake. 

I order the cage free chicken breast, chicken skin, pork belly, chicken liver and maguro Yama lake with a side of steam rice. I was leery of the chicken skin at first but man was it good! 

Yes, the portions are small and could be a bit bigger for the price that they charge but I guess you are paying extra for preparation and for having some grill it for you. 

My total came out about $32 after tax, tip and green tea. 

Give it a try if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. Definitely something I&#39;ll do only every so often."

So to help Yelpers find it, type the address into the Google Maps and look for the State Farm sign. It&#39;s the restaurant in the corner.

The food itself is splendid. The chicken skin is nice and fatty, the gizzard is just chewy enough, and the beef and pork is succulent. The problem is that the prices are exorbitant for each skewer, double what you would pay at izakayas in New York. Not only that, the skewers come out one at a time with way too much time in between so you never get full. I spent 48 dollars and I felt like I hadn&#39;t even started eating yet.

I think the place has a great chance to succeed, as the environment and food is great for people who have money to burn. But they&#39;ll need to make a few tweaks (like adding a sign and changing the method of delivering food to the customer) to ensure that they survive long enough for people to find them."

It&#39;s a nice place to sit down and grab a drink.  Although, the music may have been a little too loud (I lost my voice talking to my friend across the table).

So...  The servers didn&#39;t seem too experienced.  They didn&#39;t put our order in first of all so we waited for quite a while.  Their excuse was &#34;something&#39;s wrong with our machine,&#34; but I&#39;ve heard that before.  I&#39;ve used that before.  Anyway, after waiting 40 minutes with only the tiny Maguro Yamakake appetizer, we asked how much longer for the rest of our food.  &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, what are you waiting for?&#34;  Like everything...  So 15-20 minutes after asking (what&#39;s probably the usual wait time), the first of our kushimono arrived.

Food came.  Quality and sizing could have made this review more positive, but I&#39;ve had much better in other places in the area.  If your restaurant only serves one kind of dish, it should be pretty special, but nothing stood out.  Plus the pieces were quite small.  We spent $90 for two people (not including drinks) and I wasn&#39;t even full at the end.

Nevertheless, I really appreciated their green tea served in cute glasses and their music selection, loud as it was."

We got there early, and did not have to wait to be seated - always a positive when you&#39;re starting to get hangry first thing in the morning. 

I ordered their Popey omelet and my boyfriend ordered a skillet. I don&#39;t remember which kind it was, but I remember him mentioning there were too many potatoes in it. My omelet was pretty good! Very filling and not too dry. I usually think omelets end up being too dry because restaurants don&#39;t add enough cheese, but I didn&#39;t feel that way at Briana&#39;s. 

What I liked the most about their menu (it&#39;s a huge menu too! Which I love for breakfast restaurants) is that you have several things to pick from for the complimentary items. You can choose from potatoes or fruit, and then you can choose from toast, biscuits and gravy, crepe and pancakes. I think you can choose waffles too, but I&#39;m not 100% sure so don&#39;t quote me on it. I tried their pancakes for this first time and it was okay. Not the best, not the worst. Next time I&#39;ll order their crepes and see if I like it better!

Service was spectacular!! I really wish I could remember our waitress&#39;s name, she was so funny and playful! I love being served with a smile and she definitely delivered that!

Preparation is where they need improvement.  Our egg orders were not cooked to order.  Scrambled, well-done came out as runny scrambled eggs.   Over-medium came out as over-easy.   This is pretty much the foundation of a good breakfast restaurant....get the eggs right.

It was nice to see biscuits and gravy as an option listed with toast, pancakes, crepes or french toast with the eggs and meat.  I chose the b &amp; g and was not disappointed.

Coffee was good, but refills came slowly.

(brown &amp; white chocolate chips!).  It was as good as it looked in the pictures.  It was a lot of food (I only finished half), but our server, Carla, had warned us that this restaurant doesn&#39;t let you leave hungry.  The price isn&#39;t higher, just the quantity of food.  And because it&#39;s so good, it&#39;s tempting to try and finish it.

Next time I go I&#39;ll make a point to be hungrier.

2 TIPS: 
Carla said if you order 1 egg, they give you two, if you order 2 eggs, you get three, etc.   So instead of getting the usual 2 pancakes, They gave me 4! 

Also, I met my buddy there at 7:30 am Saturday and there were about 8 tables filled.  When we left around 9 the place was packed. So get there early.  And ask for Carla. She&#39;s a great server!"

I&#39;ve had the Portuguese omelet, banana pancakes, lumberjack skillet, traditional eggs Benedict, and the jumbo sausage links... all great.

Not to mention the coffee doesn&#39;t disappoint. 

The parking lot is awful and the location isn&#39;t the greatest. 

My new local favorite. Oh yeah, the serving sizes are large so depending on what you order, be prepped to take food home."

Not the real turkey breast. The chocolate cake tasted like Sara Lee. Whether it was or not it was not good cake. My friend had liver and onions and the liver was dry. My other friend had a breakfast burrito and that looked good.   They seem to cut corners on quality but the prices are not cheap.  If you like fries they give you a lot.   Maybe go back for breakfast burrito."

My friend got over easy eggs with bacon and brianas Potatos (hashbrowns) with white toast. He thought it was just alright for the most part

I ordered a create your own Omlette with green peppers, onions, sausage, and feta cheese. It&#39;s a pretty large portion. I took half home. I also got the hashbrowns with multi grain toast. It was good but not great.

The service was pretty good but not fantastic. The waitress was very nice but kept having me repeat the order. But hey, it recently opened and she may have not been a previous waitress so I&#39;ll give the benefit of doubt. But she was very quick to refill my coffee which was great. 

As far as the atmosphere, it&#39;s definitely a nice place, clean and some what roomy considering how busy they were. I&#39;d recommend trying this restaurant but if you ever did you wouldn&#39;t necessarily be missing much."

I read the menu outside while we were waiting for a table, so I was ready to order when we sat. Waited about 5 minutes before the waitress in our section even acknowledged us, and when she did she said she would be right with us.

Restaurant was busy, so our waitress was running around, but that&#39;s no reason to be rude when a new table is sat in your section, especially when the whole point is to make tips. Order was handwritten, they don&#39;t have a POS system, so we had to say our order very slowly and repeat it about 3 times because our waitress had to write it all out and she was older, so she wasn&#39;t very quick about it.

My boyfriend ordered a Coke and when the waitress came to give it to him, she practically threw it on the table, it slid across. Not exactly the nicest way to set a drink down.

Waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. Food was delicious. I had a spinach, green pepper, onion and Swiss cheese omelet and my boyfriend had the baked potato skillet. Food was great, hot, very large portions. I had fresh fruit on the side instead of potatoes, fresh fruit was so good. I also had the side of pancakes instead of toast with fresh strawberries on top, also delicious.

Coffee was ok.

Overall, food was good. Not a huge fan of the service. Sundays are a big &#34;go out to breakfast&#34; day and I think servers should know that&#39;s the time to make money and I would expect them to be a little bit more friendly and polite.

Would probably go back, but not on a Sunday."

It was our first time eating there, since they opened recently. Our server, Lia, was awesome! She was very attentive. The atmosphere was pleasant, and it didn&#39;t feel like the tables were on top of each other. The food was delicious. When you order eggs, they always give you an extra one! So be aware of that when ordering... if you order a 3 egg breakfast, you&#39;ll get 4! And the Briana&#39;s potatoes and biscuits &amp; gravy were very tasty!

One thing I noticed, there was an empty table that they had taken chairs from for a large party, which doesn&#39;t make much sense. Whichever server it was, lost a whole table, which cuts their income. And the restaurant lost income from that table during that time, also. Management should plan better. Maybe buy some extra chairs for special occasions, or holidays like this. 

Overall, it was excellent. Ask to sit in Lia&#39;s section! She&#39;s a great server and Briana&#39;s is lucky to have her! We will definitely be back!"

Their service was by far the best I have ever had in the Palatine area. Over all, this resturant is head and shoulders better than the Bread and Butter Cafe,Billy&#39;s and the Palatine Inn.

Couple of things would have brought this up to 5stars... Biscuits and Gravy were somewhat cold, refills of coffee were spot on but water refills lacked (even after requested) and within our table two items came out of the kitchen without the correct meat or cheese.

Broccoli might have been frozen not fresh but still good. Only downer was toast was cold. A bonus is you can get a biscuit and gravy instead of toast or pancakes!!

Service was good once waiter (Mike) arrived.  Attentive and good interaction skills.

The menu is large and if you want you can pick four things to make your own omelette or scramble.  There is a long list of possible sides including toast, pancakes, crepes, biscuits &amp; gravy, French toast.  No extra charge for anything either!

The portions are large and they give you an extra egg or pancake.  My eggs Benedict came with 3 eggs, for example.  The fruit is fresh and as least twice what you get at other restaurants. Basically, be prepared to take home a carry out. 

The service has always been prompt and the food comes out hot. The coffee is good and frequently refilled.   There is an extensive array of creamers as well as real half and half. 

The only downside is that the restaurant can get busy and be noisy at times. They have been courteous and helpful when we asked to be moved to a quieter location. 

The prices are reasonable, especially considering the huge portions. Overall the quality, broad selection and options make for an incredible breakfast experience."

The first thing that impressed us was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. After perusing their extensive breakfast menu my wife decided on the Veggie skillet, I selected the Vegetarian omelette. They were good choices. Both featured plenty of vegetables and cubed potatoes. We both chose pancakes, my wife chose GF pancakes for a small upcharge. The pancakes were cooked perfectly and had good taste, even the GF. The four egg omellette was cooked to perfection and challenged my ability to finish, which I wasn&#39;t able to do, we both took home leftover food.  
The food was tasty and tastefully presented with more than ample portions. The prices were comparable to other restaurants we have frequented.
Even though we drove from Cary it was well worth the drive. Brianna&#39;s hit a home run as far as I&#39;m concerned. We may have found a new favorite breakfast restaurant."

Two of us had never been there before so we tried it based on our third companion&#39;s positive experience the one time she ate there. 

We were waited on by the awesome Kathy, one of those seasoned waitresses who tells it like it is and helps you make the right choices. My friend was going to order a side of hash browns with her crepes and Kathy said, &#34;no way&#34;. She was right! My friend had too much food as it was. Kathy asked us if we wanted separate checks before we could even ask. 

I ordered the veggie skillet and it was super fresh and flavorful. I got the pancakes and they were the best I&#39;ve had in years - light and fluffy. Our other friend got some kind of benedict and her fresh fruit cup was large and filled with really, really fresh fruit. Our third friend got the savory crepes and she said the crepes were delicious, very light.

The breakfast choices were a plenty, and their lunch/dinner menu had a lot to offer as well. 
Since it was around 1:00pm when we went, of course I went with breakfast! I had the Lumberjack Skillet, which consisted of seasoned potatoes, corned beef hash, mushrooms, onions, and I opted for scrambled eggs. This came with either toast, fruit, French toast, pancakes, or biscuits and gravy. I have never been to a place where they would give you a side of biscuits and gravy at no extra charge, so I chose this. 
The skillet was hot and fresh when it arrived. The potatoes where cooks well, and were seasoned nicely; they were not salty or over seasoned. The hash was canned, but still tasty, and the mushrooms and onions were a nice touch. My eggs were a little over cooked, but overall the skillet was good.
The side of biscuits and gravy was a good sized portion, and the gravy was good, but nothing spectacular. 
I will say that the coffee was very smooth, and they offer the delights creamer! 

The only downside to this place is that I went into the bathroom, and there were signs posted that said not to flush the toilet paper, but throw it in the trash can...I know people with septic tanks do this, but at a restaurant it is a little off putting, especially when the can is full. 

I would recommend this place to people, but I would hope the toilet thing will be fixed!"

She greets us &#34; hey did the Cubs win last night ?? &#34; Now look it&#39;s almost 11 o&#39;clock in the morning after The Cubbies playing one of the most exciting games since 1907. Then we both noticed Val seemed a bit chipper than most. We both think Val was way higher than any kite I&#39;ve ever flown....Wow. On to the food. It was good and I would say average at best. We both ordered eggs Benedict and they give you tons of food for the money. After observing all the other servers it was quite obvious she had a Meth habit to feed. It may just be me but anyone running around and screaming at the top of there lungs might just have a little problem. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ll be rushing back anytime soon, but I know I won&#39;t ask for her section that&#39;s for sure. Have a great day !!"

Almost convinced us to go back to the car. It lasted until after the lunch hour faded, when many people had left.

We got our coffee quickly, but the food order was delayed. Once placed, the optional soup came with no delay. But the rest of the order took a looonnnng time. The explanation was that they were short one person in the kitchen at their busiest time. They did apologize, no-costed two coffees, and gave us a bowl of soup take-home. OK, we will probably try them again, but maybe not on a Sunday until after 1PM.

The cream of chicken/rice soup was very good, low salt, and thick and creamy. A Philly steak sandwich was delivered as a Philly steak wrap (same price), but we were OK with that. It turned out to be just OK. The Reuben sandwich was very good, with lots of meat, closed, not open faced, and toasted on the grill. The bread was light rye, very flavorful. Very good sandwich, but the grilling left it with oil in the toast.

Some good, some not so good. But it will be worth another visit. The menu is very heavily breakfast oriented."

When I saw it was going to be a breakfast place instead, I was quite excited since breakfast food is amongst my favorites. Upon entering, the restaurant has a clean and pleasant atmosphere. From the outside it still looks a bit like an Italian place, but don&#39;t judge a book by its cover. 

The service was a tad slow, but friendly. I&#39;ve had worse at other, more established places, so I think it will get better as they get used to everything. It took a bit to get seated, but nowhere near the time you&#39;d wait at other breakfast establishments.

The menu had a good selection of breakfast choices, and I decided to go with french toast, which ended up being very good. I expected mediocrity, and it was well above that.

The coffee was good, but as others have said, you have to ask for a refills or water, but that&#39;s stuff that can be easily corrected with time. Overall, I&#39;m happy to have a breakfast place on par with Walker Brothers close by, and I&#39;ll definitely be returning!"

I predict that when word gets out, people will be lined up in the parking lot waiting to get in.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights they&#39;re open until 8pm.  I can&#39;t wait to try dinner.  Friday night Wall-eye, yum.  Went with a large group and everyone loved it.  Also everyone left with a doggy bag.  Excellent service.  Our server was very attentive.  I think her name is Cathy.  Our group goes out for lunch once a month.  I think this place will be in heavy rotation."

Restaurants with too many options often don&#39;t do any one thing well.  My fears proved to be unfounded regarding the lunch I just enjoyed with my family.  My 15 year old son declared the BLT sandwich &#34;smoking good!&#34;  His fries were hot, crispy, with a flavorful batter.   I was surprised that the chicken in my chicken BLT wrap was breaded and would have preferred unbreaded, grilled chicken, but it was also very good.

The menu is well rounded with some nice perks you don&#39;t see at other breakfast places. Crepes and biscuit and gravy is a side option. Breakfast wraps are a great idea as well. Why only gripe, and I believe an important one, is that my food was served cold. And I&#39;m not talking lukewarm. My fried eggs were Cold, and the biscuits and gravy felt like they came straight from the refrigerator.  I realise they just opened and need to smooth out the wrinkles, so I&#39;m not writing them off yet. But serving food hot should be a top priority."

Lots of alternatives instead of toast such as French toast, crepes, pancakes or biscuits and gravy which you don&#39;t see at most places.  All new staff so it will probably take some time to work out the service kinks.  You have to ask for water and for refills on coffee and water so hopefully they improve in that area.

We were excited to have another family style restaurant opening when we saw the sign go up. We gave it some time to get the bugs worked out then decided to try it for lunch last week. When we walked in no one was in front to seat us so we had to wait for a server to notice us. We were brought water and asked for a beverage order promptly. We ordered our favorite standard lunches, a patty melt and a tuna salad sandwich, both came with soup and fries. The cream soup was extremely salty, the patty melt was ordered medium and it was very well done, the tuna was good but the toast it was on was toasted very dark making it hard to bite into. The fries are seasoned which I know a lot of people like but I don&#39;t. I wish places would offer a choice of regular or season fries, but that&#39;s just me. Our waiter was friendly and refilled our water as needed but there was a constant noise the whole time we were there like someone in back was hammering on something, very annoying. Also, they have no backround music on, why? I don&#39;t want to hear other people&#39;s conversations or every noise from the kitchen. The waiter told us to pay up front where again we had to wait for someone to see us. The man that came up asked us if we had been there before and when we said &#34;no&#34;, he handed the change back and walked away saying &#34;see you again&#34; over his shoulder. No I don&#39;t think he will."

I had the shrimp and they were the biggest I have seen anywhere and fried just perfectly. For $15.99 you get 6 colossal shrimp, vegetables, your choice of potato and desert and that is an excellent value. You can get the dinner menu at lunch time so if you want the all you can eat Friday fish fry and you are busy at night then have it for lunch. What makes the food and presentation so good is the owners are the chefs. They also expanded their dessert menu to be awesome and I had the red velvet cake and is was so good. Please try the sweet chill glazed Mahi-Mahi the best restaurants in Hawaii would be had pressed to do better. I caught my own Mahi-Mahi in Hawaii and had it prepared fresh and I still prefer Brianna&#39;s because there is something about that sweet chill glaze that keeps me coming back for more.

It doesn&#39;t have the light and fresh and pleasant atmosphere you&#39;ll experience at Fresh Start Cafe (Elmhurst) and is nowhere near as charming as a place like Lucky Grill (Chicago).  But if you are looking for a restaurant that will give you a delicious breakfast and specialty meals like their HUGE apple pancakes, this is a fine place to come.  I don&#39;t usually come to these places when I can go to one of the others I mentioned, but this was the most convenient breakfast restaurant in the area I was going to be.  Fortunately, we got an attentive and very friendly server, Marybel, which upped this place from a 3 star &#39;average&#39; place, to one that I might seek out again just to get her level of service and early morning smiles with my morning cup of coffee."

Fortunately a buddy of mine I was with knew about this place because he&#39;s from this area and grew up coming here. Therefore, we came here.

Fortunately, the wait was a lot less. Service was pretty good. Our waiter was nice. The manager even came out to our table after our meal to make sure everything was ok. On to the food.

I got the spinach omelet with cheese and had feta cheese added. The omelet tasted very different. Not nasty or anything but not like any other omelet I&#39;ve had before. It was made fluffy like a pastry. Nice flavors made into the omelet. The pancakes were good. I can see this place being worthy of a return."

My friend, who always orders this, said it tastes better with egg. So I&#39;m not sure if it didn&#39;t come with it because it&#39;s a side. It also literally looked like it was just corned beef fried into a hash brown shape. If you try other places, they don&#39;t look like that.

Some people dine out for great food experiences.  Some people dine out for great service experiences.  Unfortunately, my last trip to Richard Walker&#39;s produced neither.

We were seated right away and given coffee, so that&#39;s +1.
Our order was taken right away, and it was pretty straight forward (2 orders of 49ers, 1 side bacon, 1 side sausage, 1 over medium egg.)  It&#39;s not hard to order here if you&#39;ve been to any Walker Brothers or Original Pancake house and know what you like.

Other tables are seated around us.  2, maybe 3 others.  They also order.  We wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Our coffee cups are refilled.  We wait... are you getting the gist?

Our server comes out, and serves the tables who ordered after us, but had the same menu items (an order of 49ers for sure and maybe an omelette?)  Okay... maybe the omelette was faster?  I&#39;m a little confused.

Then, he comes out again with what I&#39;m convinced is our food.  Nope, it goes to the 2nd table who ordered after us.  What gives?

I&#39;m now on my 3RD cup of coffee and it&#39;s been at least 30 minutes since we&#39;ve ordered, the most basic of things on the menu.

When the food did finally come, there was no apology for the delay.  I know 49ers are chewy thin delights, but these were definitely undercooked.  They have never ever tasted like raw pancake batter.

I&#39;m wholly convinced he forgot to put in our order, and finally realized when we TRIED to make eye contact with him the multiple times he walked by.

The bacon was good... but that&#39;s to be expected.  I&#39;ll stick with Walker Brothers.  Sadface."

We arrived at the restaurant at 1:45 pm and ordered drinks. The restaurant was nearly empty. Even so, we didn&#39;t see the waiter again for 15 minutes. I complained at that point but the waiter said that he had to serve the table next to us as an excuse for his terrible service. That excuse didn&#39;t hold water because he wasn&#39;t serving that table either, he was just completely gone for 15 minutes, otherwise my wife and I would surely have stopped him to inquire about ordering our food and getting our drinks. My wife&#39;s orange juice was sitting in plain sight on the counter where they make mixed drinks (I had ordered a virgin mary and my wife, an orange juice). 

After we complained we received our drinks and placed our order. But by that time, we had ordered too late. The restaurant was now obviously in the process of preparing to close and the employees were focused on ending their day. My wife received a steak (she had ordered steak and eggs) that was overdone and dry. I received an apple pancake that wasn&#39;t cooked long enough (the batter wasn&#39;t cooked and was still batter in many parts of the pancake). 

My wife complained about her steak but I didn&#39;t complain about my apple pancake because I had nearly caused a scene when I first complained about the waiter taking 15 minutes to get our drinks and take our order and I didn&#39;t want to repeat that. 

To his credit, the manager reduced part of the price of my wife&#39;s meal. But we didn&#39;t come here to receive half priced bad food and service and this was the worst food and service that we have ever received at Richard Walker&#39;s in all the years we have been patronizing this restaurant. During the past year, my wife and I have observed that this restaurant&#39;s quality of food and service has been dramatically reduced from it&#39;s previous high standard. It&#39;s just not the same restaurant. 

Also, we would never patronize any restaurant for bad food and service, even if it were completely free. What we do need is good food and service, which is now clearly lacking at Richard Walker&#39;s."

I opened up my trusty Yelp app, did a search for brunch and pancakes, called Richard Walkers, and they said to come on over. Truthfully I wasn&#39;t super excited to eat there, as I had something more exciting in mind, but we headed over because we were getting pretty hungry. Thankfully I read Phill C&#39;s review about the restaurant being hidden in a strip mall, so that saved us time from getting lost. It took us about 10 minutes to get to our destination from Wildberry.

Truth? This totally random pick turned out to be a great success! We waited only about 15 minutes, they gave us menus while we waited, and we were led into an overflow room with lots of other families. We sat down and a server came over right away to give us menus and drinks, and before we knew it we ordered up, our food arrived, our coffee cups were consistently filled, and the service was amazing! 

My kiddos ordered chocolate chippy pancakes off the kids menu and a side of thick bacon. Their pancakes were a completely decent size. Not too big, but not silver dollar. Just your average run of the mill size hotcake. Oh, they also ordered a side of fries, which I tried. The fries were super classic and took me back to my days of being a kid and hanging out at the country club with friends charging their parents&#39; spending accounts.

I ordered a sweet cherry Belgian waffle that was super sugary delicious. It&#39;s exactly what I wanted. I also ordered a side of bacon, and it was so thick and rich I ended up sharing it with my mom. Note: 3 thick slices for $4.50. 

My mom ordered the pecan waffle, and I tried my hubby&#39;s veggie omelet. The omelet was light and fluffy and packed with veggies. I really wasn&#39;t in the mood for eggs, but the next time we come here, I&#39;d totally share this. It was ginormous! I truly think our entire table could have shared it. 

Yes, the decor feels a little older in it&#39;s style. However, the place was completely clean and efficient, and the owner was present throughout the entire experience. Good old fashioned pancake stop. Expect to leave really really full.

4 out of 5 stars, because it&#39;s a bit pricey. You pay for quality here."

The food is nothing to write home about, but definitely not bad.  I&#39;ve tried their BLT sandwich, some omelettes, pancakes, etc.  None of those were special enough to make me want to get them again so I just keep trying different things every time.  The bloody mary is pretty good.  It comes with a thick slice of fried bacon which was a nice touch.

In the last year, the service has gotten worse. The food is still good but without good service, it no longer makes it one of our favorite breakfast place. With the retirement of Jim, the previous manager, the personal touch is no longer there. We arrived today for breakfast. There were 4 of us in total. We were very surprised on how empty it was. It used to have lines out the door. Well we were quickly sat and the busboy brought us water right away. It took approximately 10 mins before anyone offered us coffee. Very unusual, especially when so much staff was just hanging around the hostess stand and at the bus stations. We were about to leave when the server came to us an apologized that he didn&#39;t realize this was his table. Ok, we forgive you...but I believe it&#39;s the servers responsibility to know which tables are his. The general manager, we only assume he was the GM since he was wearing a different colored shirt (black) didn&#39;t appear to enjoy being there. We never saw him approach any table to ask how the meals were. Jim used to stop by all the table and customers knew him. The restaurant wasn&#39;t busy at all and our meals seemed to take an awful long time to arrive. As always the food is great, but I don&#39;t think we will be coming back.

For whatever reason, their sign made me think it was a jewelry shop....maybe I&#39;m crazy, who knows!  Anyways, my friend and I stopped by for lunch the other day and were pleasantly surprised.  Immediately upon walking in, the host was very friendly and told us to take a seat, gave us menus to peruse, and told us we would be seated shortly.  He even asked how we were doing and how our holidays were.  That&#39;s more than what my boss asks me about my personal life LOL.  Just like our host said, we were seated within 5 minutes or so.  

As for the rest of our lunch, service was slower than anticipated but the food was pretty good.  It literally took about a half hour for our food to arrive but that may be because they were fairly busy.  As for the food, I was happy with my choice of the Best Western omelette which could have fed three people or if you&#39;re like me and don&#39;t share, then 3 meals!  The omelet was fluffy and they were very generous with the ingredients inside the omelette (ham, choice of cheese, peppers, and onions).  Overall Richard Walker&#39;s has hearty breakfast foods but the service and ambiance are average."

Well, it totally is. They have basically everything you could want from a breakfast place and more. Recommendation: the German pancake, which is HUGE. Seriously. 

It&#39;s on the pricey side but it&#39;s great quality. They have really good coffee and ingredients that are obviously not cheap. Customizing orders is expensive, however, if you want to add anything that is not included."

We tried to flag down our waiter, but he disappeared again!!!! At this point we complained to the hostess and asked for the Manager.  The Manager showed up and he seemed frazzled   He apologized and asked us what we wanted him to do?????excuse me???? I couldn&#39;t believe this was happening.

A good hearty breakfast place with a good variety of dishes that are hot and fresh.

Decor :
Nothing fancy in terms of look but it is very clean and organized.  It can get extremely busy but it&#39;s the marl of an excellent establishment. 

Service:
This place is very friendly and organized.  Couldn&#39;t complain about anything here.  The waiters have always been friendly and honest about their dishes along with their recommendations. 

Food:
The food is always hot and fresh.  There is nothing I could negatively comment about the food here.  Their chocolate chip pancakes are well done and their skillets are out of this world.  Only thing I wasn&#39;t happy about was their turkey bacon.  I found it rather sweet instead of savory. 

Price:
The price is very fair for what you get.  I have never looked at my bill once and gasped at the price. 

Overall experience:
Overall, I&#39;d definitely recommend this place to anyone.  You&#39;ll get excellent customer service, fair prices and fresh food. This place is a must."

I ordered the bacon waffle, it was ok.. just ok.. the bacon waffles at the Original Pancake House are much better.. you can taste the bacon more. I also got a blueberry waffle. My friend was disappointed because the menu description said blueberries cooked into the waffle then topped with a berry compote.. but there were no blueberries in the waffle, just a plain waffle with berries to put on top.

Santa fe: it tasted ok, didn&#39;t like how the cheese tasted and it wasn&#39;t spicy at all....thought it would be since there&#39;s jalapeno peppers &amp; jalapeno cheese in it....the cheese was kind of watery?...
Contains: Fresh onions, cilantro, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers with jalapeno cheese served with salsa on the side...and it&#39;s served with your choice of pancakes or toast

Pancakes: tasted good.. how can you go wrong with pancakes?..

Drinks:
Orange Juice: kind of on the pricier end for just juice, but it&#39;s freshly squeezed and tastes delicious..

Portion: are huge...really huge.. probably can eat the leftovers for 2 meals...

Customer Service: it was ok...not great...sometimes a wait time..

Atmosphere: families, older people, people from work...

I just don&#39;t like them and I don&#39;t feel that I should have to explain myself.  

Anyway- Breakfast: The only thing worse than having to be up in the morning, is having to be up and do things... even if those things are eating.

Brunch, on the other hand, I can find some potential in. I can get up at noon or after and it&#39;s still totally acceptable. There&#39;s usually still some pretty enthusiastic coffee service still happening, whereas at regular restaurants, java after 10:30 equals an automatic eye-roll from your server who will no doubt have to brew a fresh pot or go through the trouble of microwaving the mud left in the old pot. And you can choose between hash browns or french fries as a side, and everyone knows the best way to start your day is with a hefty amount of greased of carbs. 

So... I find myself at Richard Walker&#39;s at the prime starting point of brunch, 10:45 am. Within mere seconds, I had a hot cup full of joe and was perusing my many potato options, though I ended up getting a dish that did not involve the potato&#39;s collaborative effort. 

Our service was neutral to just fine, which alright by me because I am no peach to talk to before 2pm. The less banter and exercising of social skills, the better. I ordered the Mediterranean omelet, which is basically enough for 3 people and chock full of feta, spinach, kalamata olives and a bunch of other goodies that I kept shoveling until my gut cramped. I&#39;d say the flavor was was a bit bland, but it may also have been that after eating a third of the giant portion, my taste buds overdosed on the same flavor.

The bill for two breakfasts and two coffees was, and I can&#39;t lie, pretty darn steep at $30. I know the portion was huge, so really it wasn&#39;t any more than eating at a less fancy breakfast spot, I would&#39;ve rather had just one meal&#39;s worth of food and paid a 1/3 less. 

For now, I may not be entirely sold on this Richard Walker&#39;s but I know I&#39;ll be back ot give other not-so-hefty+hearty menu options a try in the future."

Only open from 6:30am-2:30pm, this place does very well for itself and the proofs in the pancake. Their website even outlines their strategy of their success and how they are known for thick cut bacon, homemade pancakes, and fresh squeezed orange juice. 

I have been to plenty of places for brunch but only a few are memorable. Richard Walker&#39;s Pancake House stands above the rest and remains a Schaumburg favorite. Some may argue that the prices are high for brunch but you taste the quality and the attention to detail. I would gladly pay $10 for brunch done right especially when I have the craving. And the service is excellent. The food arrives within five minutes of ordering and our server was genuine. He has been with the restaurant for seven years and knew regulars by their first name. 

Biscuits and gravy are not on the menu but you can still order it. The owner explained that they forgot to add it when the menus were printed. Personally, I recommend ordering something savory that comes with pancakes and upgrade them for only $2.50 more. For a couple of bucks more, I was able to get the banana nut pancakes which was the perfect &#34;dessert&#34; after the meal. 

For fans of brunch, Richard Walker&#39;s Pancake House delivers a five star eggsperience."

Highly recommended!"

When we asked if we could sit elsewhere he basically said no! He just moved the table over so one side had more room,  so basically I was squished against the table and booth. Not fun. 

I was not thrilled with the service at all. It took the waiter forever to take our order.  The restaurant was not busy and I saw him chatting with coworkers in the back of the restaurant. Apparently laughing &amp; talking is more important than customer service. 

The food is mediocre, but it can be due to what I ordered?  I ordered eggs with bacon that comes with a side of pancakes. For the price of the food I suppose I just expected more. My pancakes were average despite that I have heard rave reviews. 

I probably should try them again and order something different to see if their food really is average or my dish was just a poor choice, but honestly I don&#39;t have any desire to go back."

The menu is a good size, not too big, but provided a variety of options for whatever you have a taste for. 

We ordered pigs in a new car - sausages wrapped in pancakes - hash browns, and a bagel. It was very satisfactory.

The hash browns have a little bit of onion in them, which was a nice touch. Great pancakes, tasty maple syrup. 

Eric was our server, and he was excellent. The second I thought I wanted more water, a pitcher arrived at our table.

This last time I went, there was, to my delight, no line.  In fact the owner or manager was very prompt in directing me and my husband to a booth.  Before I knew what was going on, we were asked what we wanted to drink by someone who was not our server.  I felt a little rushed, but that was just me.  

We perused the menu and had a hard time deciding.  After much waffling (no pun intended), I decided to try something new: Challah French Toast.  I couldn&#39;t quite remember what Challah meant, but it sounded familiar.  I asked our server.  Her explanation was not clear but she said something about San Francisco?  I ordered it anyway, to be adventurous.  After she left, I looked up the word and saw the familiar braided bread I&#39;d seen in bakeries.  OH!  Different bread - got it.  But no, the french toast I ended up getting, though pretty tasty, had nothing to do with challah bread.  It was the standard thickly-sliced square toast some call &#34;Texas Toast&#34;.  I took a photo.

You&#39;ll notice the color of the plate is a bit off.  That&#39;s because there was a pink light bulb above us, tinting everything pink.  Even the ladies&#39; room lighting was oddly pink.  I didn&#39;t care for the weird lighting.

I enjoyed the food, despite the confusion about the bread, but felt the service was a little too hurried for me.  It&#39;s like they&#39;re always in super-efficient mode, even though the place was not very busy at the time.  I would maybe go again if location were a factor again, as it was this last time, but it&#39;s definitely not my first choice for a meal and nothing to write home about."

I liked that they handed you menu&#39;s in line so that you could begin browsing the items so there is less wasted time.  The wait staff was okay, nothing great, but nothing bad.  Prices seemed fair too.  I ordered something a little bit out of my comfort zone just for fun.  It was... bonkers!  I ordered the Cinnabon baked pancake.  It was as big as the standard dinner plate.  It was very rich.  It didn&#39;t taste much like a cinnabon, but rather just a very cinnamon(y) dutch pancake.  All in all, it was an alright experience for me and I did enjoy it, but I didn&#39;t love it.  I would not order it again however, because it was a little too intense."

However; the service and genuine warmth you feel at Richards is much better. Since they were one in the same up until 1989, makes you wonder why. The pancakes are pretty much the same but brother Ray (at Walker Bros) does a better job on the basted eggs, much thicker bacon, and the corn beef hash is fantastic. 

Still a notch above most breakfast places, and worth a visit."

To have a good breakfast with eggs , bacon,  hash brown, french toast, you have to purchase it all as sides. The cost is almost $20 to do That.  I think this is the restaurant&#39;s way of getting more money out of a guest. To be honest just cause of the Over Priced menu and separate pricing for every item I WILL NEVER BE BACK NOR ADVISE ANYONE I KNOW TO GO THERE. GO 5 mins down the road to WILDBERRY!"

I usually order either a skillet or omelette when I go to a breakfast diner so I&#39;ll size up both at Richard Walker&#39;s. 

Skillet - I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the skillet.  It lacked flavor and didn&#39;t have that crispy texture I enjoy from the hash browns and meat.  It did have a nice layer of cheese on it, but it wasn&#39;t enough to make me a fan.  I like the skillets better at Wildberry and Brunch Cafe.  

Omelette - This is where Richard Walker&#39;s shines.  The omelette is more like a quiche.  Get ready for a lot of delicious gooey cheese out of this bad boy.  The Santa Fe is no joke; a great balance of ingredients and of course that wonderful cheese.  It comes with your choice of pancakes or toast.  I get the pancakes, which are usually good.  Last time, however, the pancakes weren&#39;t fluffy at all -- actually kind of dense.  The pancakes certainly weren&#39;t criminal, but Richard Walker&#39;s is a &#34;pancake house&#34; so I was mildly disappointed. 

Get a cup coffee here.  Something about their coffee keeps me wanting multiple refills. So good!

The wait was definitely worth it. This was one of the best meals (breakfasts) that I&#39;ve had in a while. I ordered an orange juice to start and it tasted freshly squeezed. I ordered an egg white bacon omelette and my boyfriend had a Denver omelette - he had also ordered oatmeal, orange juice, milk, and a side of ham (hungry guy). He realized that he did not want the OJ after he&#39;d ordered it, and it had been on our table for about 5 minutes but they promptly swapped it out for the milk. He also said that the oatmeal was just ok. The problem was that they brought the cream and the brown sugar on the side of the oatmeal and he likes it cooked in. I hate oatmeal so I can&#39;t say how it&#39;s supposed to come, I&#39;ve never ordered it at a restaurant. 

When our orders came, the bacon egg white omelette was good but his Denver was way more interesting (and tasty!). Too much bacon and the cheese looked like velveeta had been squeezed into the middle. It was interesting, not bad, just interesting. There was a generous amount of food, I barely ate any of my omelette and I was stuffed.

Was surprised when the bill came by the $45 breakfast (ouch!), the extras add up. The omelettes were only $10.95."

I&#39;d say the restaurant was decked out in your average brunch joint decor. Nothing was overly cheesy but I wouldn&#39;t say decor is completely up to date. 

9am this morning for breakfast and did not have a wait. We were greeted by a lovely gentleman while someone led us to our booth. Our waiter was good, just the right amount of attention. I ordered the special- San Diego French Toast that was topped with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and bananas. I polished off my plate! My friend also enjoyed her bacon and eggs... but just a side note, toast and potatoes were ordered as sides as they are not included.

My wife had been here a few times, before I met her, so we decided to give it a try.

It was a Saturday around 9AM and we were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately.

We were quickly snatched up by a greeter/host and seating in a two person booth.  I can see how this would be more practical when you are a very popular dining spot as it allows more seating without the social stigma of sitting with strangers.  Unfortunately, I found it a little on the tight side.

The waitress was very efficient... almost too much as I felt a little hurried.  Once again I think this may be the result of evolving to deal with a place that is usually much busier than it was on this particular day.

The pink light bulbs that made up the majority of the lighting in this place cast an odd light on everything.  It made the food look odd.

When I did get my food I noticed that the eggs over easy were perfect.  The whites were just firm enough to be cooked without that lacy toughness that is so common at other breakfast places.
Th pancakes were tasty and fluffy.  They provided warm syrup which was a nice touch.
Unfortunately the corn beef hash was oddly gravelly.  I don&#39;t know what made it that way, but perhaps it was overcooked.  There were way too many onions in it for my taste.  I only occasionally allow myself to indulge in corned beef hash, so I was very disappointed in the quality.

Overall I didn&#39;t love Richard Walker&#39;s.  The small booth, the rushed service and the odd lighting do not make me think I would like to come back.  The perfectly cooked eggs and fluffy pancakes balance my review to a solid 3 stars.  I wouldn&#39;t avoid this place, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat there either."

Found this place on YELP and gave it a shot. The place was nice and clean. Beautiful ceiling (I&#39;m a ceiling man... can&#39;t explain it, I just am). 

Wife had the Eggs Benedict. Eggs were basted perfectly but she thought the Hollandaise sauce was weak. I believe She said it needed more lemon. I never order them but had a taste of hers and it was okay.

Not being a sweet breakfast eater, I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs. CBH was okay, kind of looked like it was cooked in a preformed shape. It was light and moist but came to life when I doused it in Tabasco sauce. Shame because it should be stand alone delicious. Eggs were basted better than any I&#39;ve ever had. They can specialize in basted eggs (don&#39;t really know why I said that).

Our server was awesome! We&#39;ll try this place again. Next time I&#39;ll have the Santa Fe omelette and she&#39;ll have the Berry Pancakes (not on the menu). Three and a quarter stars."

We were literally ready to order within 5 mins and lo and behold 20 mins of waiting later my mother had to ask for the manager so we could place an order for drinks! 

The manager comes by apologizes and offers us free dessert! Okay, that&#39;s fair! We proceed to order and the waitres comes with oue drinks fairly quickly! Kudos to her. A sip into my drink and i notice a finger print (out of flour) on my wine glass! TF... Are you shitting me? You can&#39;t care to wash down a wine glass? I bring it to the waitresses notice, she mumbles some half assed apology and goes on to get me another glass.. Okay cool, I guess I can deal with this.

We wait for our food and a couple mins later we get our order... Not bad I think things are looking up! Wrong, Wrong! Things are about to get worse, my friend! I get the pick 3 apps(boneless wings, friend green beans and LOADED potatoes) as my entree. I&#39;ve spelt LOADED with caps because the only thing they were loaded with was burnt cheese. No bacons, no chives nothing. 

It&#39;s like at this point they didn&#39;t even care! I went with my meal made sure my fam enjoyed their meal and before I left I brought it to the waitresses attention. Again, she could care less asked if we needed a box! Haha a box for what? Even a homeless person wouldn&#39;t want this garbage! 

With that and $82 later... I have decided that even white castle and I truly despise everything about white castle is better than this! I&#39;ve even tweeted at TGIF but I can guarantee they don&#39;t give a f*** because we got your $82!! 

Haha anyways all in all I rate them with a 0

P.S: This was a quiet Tuesday night with 7 tables occupied! Really quiet to get shitty service tbh!"

I appreciate that they also have families so they would like to be with and it was nice meeting up and go somewhere to eat on the holiday.

The service was top-notch can&#39;t say enough about it. From the host to the bartender and to a waitress everyone was very nice polite. But once once last call came everybody was in hyper mode to hurry up and get out there as quick as possible.

I got the 3 apps for like 11 99 or something like that and I thought it was a good deal but as soon as started  eating it it just didn&#39;t seem right. The wings were okay but I only ate a few of them because it didn&#39;t seem right. The cheese sticks very soft and not taste was bland. The pretzel sticks were great. Still hungry I got the desert brownies with ice cream. Meh is how i rank this dessert. The kiddo liked it but shes 6. 

Overall I left there with a party of three and a tab of $60. Not bad. I also left with an upset stomach that has carried over into today."

I used to come here when they do endless apps just to try the new apps. Each time they do it, it gets worse and worse. 

The service was so slow even with an almost empty restaurant. After we ordered the app, it took forever and every new time we got our apps, it got saltier and saltier. They are skimpy on the meat too. Basically they want you to get full on the carbs (bread, tostada, wonton skins, etc). The potstickers had very little filling. The &#34;new&#34; tostadas were mostly some weird salty, sweet white sauce and wilted cilantro. There was barely any braised bbq beef. Like a tiny piece on each. My flatbread barely had chicken on it... mostly bread. The last time I ordered the flatbread, there was NO chicken. I mean, they barely put chicken as it is.... but still! This used to be one of the best endless apps, but they ruined it!

I brought it to attention from my server but he just apologized. He didn&#39;t offer to fix it or anything. All he did was ask if we wanted to order dessert... Nice.

I&#39;m pretty sure the manager brought us our flatbread and I&#39;m sure he could see there was no chicken but he still brought it. Idk what that says about the service there.

You can tell the servers don&#39;t want you to order more. They act like it! They weren&#39;t like that before.. idk what happened.

So disappointing because their endless apps used to be good! It&#39;s only $12/person but I still feel like I was ripped off. It used to be $10/person and they raised the price. That&#39;s understandable, but what isn&#39;t is the quality of the food and service getting worse and worse. I most definitely will not be coming back and I hope you don&#39;t either. Save your money and your appetite."

I always appreciate restaurants that act as if they realize people may be coming during their lunch hour and ensures they are attended to immediately, which was the case here.  

We were seated immediately and ordered our food within 5 minutes of arrival.  The food arrived pretty fast and actually tasted great, but what happened to the waitress after the food came?!

I ordered the new  SICILIAN STACKED BURGER, and so did one of my co-workers.  It was good, but a little overwhelming after I kept at it.  It was stacked with so much.  By the end I had picked it apart and was eating just what I wanted.  

My co-worker ordered some type of salad that was supposed to have apricots and kale in it.. we never located either but she said the salad was good despite it.  

Another of my co-workers ordered a cajun pasta which was fell in love with.  

For some reason the waitress never came back to check on us, which was an issue because we had received the wrong drinks.  

Nevertheless, we settled for what we had.  I wouldnt say that was a game breaker which is why i was still able to give it 4 stars.  (I would say that is why here tip was not as large as it could have been.)

I will be back!"

I was wholeheartedly let down when our waitress told us she wasn&#39;t going to fill up our drinks every fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes is a substantial as well as appropriate amount of time to finish a Dr Pepper. This act of pure communism has not and will not go unnoticed. I recommend that unless you voted for Stalin last election you don&#39;t attend this disgraceful establishment. Not to mention the Jack Daniels burger tasted more like the whisky bottle than meat.

Due to the  food selection, we now know that if we are going to eat here, we plan to come much earlier to avoid any lunch rush.

She got the steak sizzler w spinach and mashed potatoes . I ordered the turkey burger w broccoli instead of fries and we shared a pick three app. 
At first the service was a but slow but we were chatting and in no hurry so we didnt mind. The app was great. Their pretzels and cheese, boneless wings and pot stickers are always very good. Their potato skins are very crispy and over fried , lots of oil coming from them.
Our meals came and i cut into my turkey burger and took a bite, it was so dry yet juicy in the middle. It wasnt too hot either so it might have been sitting waiting for my friends steak to be done. I told our waitress and she took it back and got me a new one, i asked for cheese this time hoping it would help. The new one was great and not dry at all. She came and checked back to make sure all was ok and it was.
My friend gave her info for the free meal and when she cane back she let us know that she took my turkey burger off the bill bc i had to wait for the new one . That is great customer service and she didnt have to do that. She got a bigger tip bc of it too and I let her know I would be letting Yelp know who to see when they to to TGIF in Schaumburg . Her name is Alicia , there was a survey in the bottom of our receipt to fill out for a free app next time we came in but i didnt know we only had 48 hrs to fill it out so it expired already . But I will call there and let them know how nice Alicia was and it was cool she took my burger off without me even saying anything. Which i didnt plan on bc we already got one meal free anyway."

I like that they have that daily drink special at an honestly good price.  I had the apple martini and it was the perfect combination.  We went during the middle of the week and it was very packed.  The waiter was attentive, friendly and efficient.  It&#39;s a pretty loud and busy atmosphere.  They also have a bar right in the middle if you just want to drink and watch sports.

When you stop in, be sure to request Axl as your server! He&#39;s incredibly observant (brings refills when you&#39;re actually thinking about asking for one), he checks in often (but not so often as to be bothersome), and makes great suggestions (for dessert or drinks or apps). We spoke to the manager about how great he was, and the manager told us he was one of the newer servers at this location. We couldn&#39;t believe it, they must have a good training process (or good luck to have found Axel!).

I ordered a classic cheeseburger, medium well and even said &#34;more well than medium&#34;. I noticed the server didn&#39;t write down neither how I or my boyfriend ordered the cooking type of our burgers, but I figured he would tell the cook. We also mentioned how we needed to eat quickly because we had to be somewhere. The food comes and my burger is SO PINK in the middle, almost rare. I was really upset. We didn&#39;t have time to complain and wait for another one, like I said we had to leave to be somewhere. I was starving so I just sucked it up. But it&#39;s unacceptable to me that he didn&#39;t listen to that simple request. I didn&#39;t ask for my mediocre cheeseburger to be served in a golden platter, I just wanted it cooked medium well.

2 for $10 deal might just be the best thing out there amongst mid tier trendy restaurant chains. Forget the 2 for $20/25/30 deals because this deal allows each individual person to get their own appetizer and entrée.  We chose the BBQ Chicken Flatbread, Spicy White Cheddar Queso Dip, and both ordered the Jack Daniel&#39;s Burger for an entrée. $20 bought you a lot more food than expected - we had to take two boxes home. 

In addition to the 2 for $10 deal, TGI Fridays also has a daily special like half off appetizers and $6 burgers. With these promotions, TGI Fridays is doing a great job of stepping up their game by offering options for the casual diner to family get-togethers.

They didn&#39;t even charge us for our appetizers which was nice of them but again we didn&#39;t mind the slip up, it happens.
What I didn&#39;t care for was the food and my drink. My drink was too cloyingly sweet with hardly any vodka in it. The French onion soup was super salty. The potato skins were dry and kind of burnt from sitting in hot oil and my husbands burger must have originated from a frozen patty because it was leaking water.

We were seated promptly (Saturday night) and our server was attentive - giving us time to peruse the menu. (We have a tendency to talk too much and not look at the menus right away.)  He always brought drink refills - always before we had even polished off the last of our drinks.  Awe-some!  I wish I remembered his name!  He was a Hispanic guy, perhaps in his 40s.

We ordered two appetizers to share:  the BBQ Chicken Flatbread and the Warm Pretzels with Beer-Cheese Dipping Sauce. 

I hate to admit it, but the Pretzels were REALLY good: warm, mushy, and lightly salted.  The Beer-Cheese didn&#39;t have any beer taste..it just tasted like a light cheese to me, but it was alright.  The Flatbread was OK - pretty light.  I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t have much cheese. 

Overall it was a pretty good Friday&#39;s experience. :)"

Besides that, I really don&#39;t suggest getting a steak here because they never get it right.
TGI Fridays is more for burgers, appetizers and desserts.

One thing that bothered me, was when I ordered chips and Guacamole, I literally received 1tablespoon of guacamole with lots of red onions. I didn&#39;t complain but i think there&#39;s a guacamole shortage here.

Besides that, our orders came in a timely manner and the food was nothing special except for the JACK DANIELS SAUCE"

How much effort does it take to clean the table??  I also would have been willing to wait for them to clean the table, but apparently that was not an option. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant that is very poorly lit. I was snooping through their drink menu and it smelled like barf with stains on it.  Ordered my steak medium rare and it came back medium-well. Asked for the manager and they offered to replace it with a new one (I don&#39;t believe in wasting food so I refused). Not only was the steak bad, but the mashed potatoes were very bland. Tasted even worse than something could come out of the box. Mac and Cheese had a burnt buttered noodle. Hardly any cheese and they use penne rigate as their pasta. After we called the manager to the table to let her know about the food, the waitress became very hostile and upset at us as she would make as little contact as she could with us.

There is a sign on the door that advertises free WiFi. As I tried to login to it, their website failed to work. I asked the waitress why it might not be working and she simply just shrugged her shoulders. 

As soon as I finished my meal I still felt hungry, for the amount of money I spent there I would much rather have gone 20 miles to Crystal Lake and dined at Texas Road house and received proper service and food. 

After this experience I will never dine here again."

We were the first people in the restaurant, which was kind of weird.  The bartender was our server.  I ordered a water with a lemon, my friend an Iced tea.  When the drinks came out, the tea was about as light in color as my water.  She asked for a diet coke instead and he brought her a different iced tea that was ok....he was also very creepy....

We ordered two salads, I had the Yucatan Chicken Salad, which is great, and she got the Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad, which was equally delicious.  We would have loved to enjoy our lunch, and our conversation, but it was almost impossible as this guy WOULD NOT leave us alone to eat!  He kept walking by our table, butting in to our conversation and was just overall ruining our afternoon.  We could not get out of there quick enough, we asked for the check, paid and split!

What is up with the pressure, buy appetizers, buy drinks, you need more drinks. I get it, you get paid off of it and there are probably contests each restaurant runs but back off buddy. I feel like they are pedaling crack and cocaine. I am going to spend MY money on what I want, not what You want. Ok, rant done.

Food is greasy and so chainy. I only came here to meet a friend to grab shoes I had lent her.

I got the spinach dip and the jack daniels chicken and shrimp combo. They cheated me on both. I could have eaten all of the dip with three chips. The chicken was small and dried out. My drink was all ice and no booze. Meanies."

However, if they took reservations, that would be a plus.  But they don&#39;t.  

On to dinner....took 10 minutes alone to get a waitress to come over and greet us after we sat down.  From initial sit down to leaving it took 3 hours to get in and out of the restaurant.....Far too long!!!  I ordered the Jack Daniels burger and had asked for medium.

I ordered a steak and shrimp combo but my steak came well, when I had asked for medium rare. Not only did the waiter take it back immediately, a manager came over to apologize and asked if I wanted anything else while I waited. 

I declined, although I appreciated the offer. Also, a new steak came out piping hot, with a fresh side of broccoli and it was actually delicious :) 

Here&#39;s where they won my heart: they only charged me for my drink. My one drink. 

Amazing!!

If run-of-the-mill family dining restaurants are seeking to win over my demographic (after-work alcohol drinker who eats a meal so I won&#39;t get too tipsy to drive home), this is what gets me coming back.

However, this was even better food! Two great friends and I came here after an hour at Gameworks and wanted to wind down. We were starving but also looking for something to drink. Honestly, we were looking for Houlihan&#39;s because I was told they serve pitchers of long island iced tea. Sounds good. 

So tra la la we&#39;re driving. Oh, I think we missed it, wait. Where are we?! Oh no, all we see is Hooters (not in the mood for beer thanks) and TGI Friday&#39;s. Well...alright. Let&#39;s give it a shot.

Wait time was a little less than what they said (15 minutes) and we got a nice private booth in the back. It was quiet, out of the way, and so very nice. We asked for a booth and that was the nicest one imo. 

Drinks first:
We had some kind of Hawaiian drink with a light rum that was nice, but after my friend and I tried our third friends&#39; Tropical Berry Mojito Shaker we were like &#34;WTF EFF THIS&#34; and decided to order one of those to share. It was about 3 drinks each shaker, our server was hardcore all about keeping things not sticky even before he poured them and after he shook them. It was so refreshing, so lovely and smooth and amazing. The third round of them we got (we ordered a couple to split after that first one between the three of us and got a nice deal out of it all in the end) was more potent than the last two. Either way, we got pretty tipsy, and thanks to the timing of our food and some water we felt just plain normal and fulfilled leaving. Oh and stuffed. 

Then food:
We all got 3 course meals for 12.99 each. There was a side with 16.99 3 course meals too on that particular menu flap so beware what you&#39;re looking at. One side has &#39;higher end&#39; food like ribs and things I suppose. We shared crispy green bean fries (THE BEST THING I&#39;VE EVER HAD!) well, that&#39;s how I feel at the moment at least. They were so much more amazing than I had believed they could be. Also, little mozzarella sticks, but they weren&#39;t sticks they were the shape of spam, so kind of rectangular with rounded edges. But longer than spam and without the spam. Marinara sauce in the middle. So good. Huge portions of everything by the way. Lastly, pot stickers. Not little bitch ones either. I believe it was 6 chunky pot stickers with a dark sauce in the middle. Very good.

Entrees were just as delish. Both of my friends had some sort of chicken breast sizzling thing with cheese and mashed potatoes and all of that. I had a Sicilian sandwich with french fries and I couldn&#39;t even finish it. It had chicken and pepperoni and cheese and...please just eat it okay? It&#39;ll change your mind about veganism. FO&#39; REALZ! 

Dessert was perfect to finish the meal off with. We had an ultimate brownie which was soft and full of fudge and vanilla ice cream melting over it all sensuously a delicately presented tall piece of vanilla bean cheesecake. Then our last trio dish was a peanut butter pie, delish. Delish. DE-lish. Everything was so wonderful. 

Our server:
Adorable flamin&#39; gay black guy who was super fun to talk to especially when we were tipsy. He actually had recommendations for us when I asked (always a plus, means you actually give a crap about where you&#39;re working and you have a taste for something there) and was super sweet the whole time. We gave him a nice tip.

Overall:
Less than 100 dollars for 3 three course meals, 3-4 rounds of drinks, and a really great time with friends in a nice quiet booth we ended up enjoying the hell out of. I&#39;d totally come back here again with friends. Decent food quality, not like Zed 451 or anything but not like McDonald&#39;s either! Not a great spot for a date, but hey, I dare TGI Friday&#39;s to give me an even more enjoyable dinner if I ever go back! I almost don&#39;t want to based on the consistent 3-4 star quality dinners at TGI Fridays&#39; on average. But even if this was merely a 5 star experience it&#39;s worth yelping about and rating it for what it was."

Our server was great - very attentive and kept checking on us even after we had paid the bills and had continued to sit and talk.  

The food was just there.  It was mostly overcooked and oversalted.  I haven&#39;t had great experiences with TGIF in the past but not so bad that I wouldn&#39;t come back.  Honestly, there are a lot better places out there.  We went here because that is where the other members of my group wanted to go.  My bill wasn&#39;t too bad, about what I expected really, 2 sodas, 2 entrees, an appetizer, and a desert was $52 with tip and tax.  I&#39;m to the point where when I go out, I want to have good food and at this point, Friday&#39;s isn&#39;t going to cut it for me.

We have been here before and had some excellent service, so I was VERY disappointed this time. 

The hostess at the front door had an attitude and a fake smile from hell.  She was upset that we did not want to sit in the bar area, so that sent her on a tailspin.  When she got over her problem, we were seated at a WET table, and our menus were slammed down as if they weighed 50lbs.  

I opened the menu to a slimy white goo (that reminded me of wheat paste)  all between the first and second page.  ICK!  I closed the menu and went to wash my hands STAT.  Princess Poutypants (the hostess) begrudgingly offered my husband a new menu for me.  

When I got back to the table, I told my husband that we had to leave immediately, and never return.  A manager was standing within inches of our table, and must not have cared when he saw and heard the issue we were having.

If you&#39;ve seen any of the newer or newly renovated TGI Friday&#39;s with the &#34;Nightmare Before Christmas&#34; decor and signage, they seem to be trying desperately to stay relevant by reinventing themselves, eschewing what put them on the map in the first place.

Gone are the long, peninsula-shaped wood bars; now the bar is off to one side, and its small.  And who doesn&#39;t long for the days of the suspenders covered in buttons- the trademarks lampooned in &#34;Office Space&#34;?  Like it or not, they were conversation-starters, and for the vast majority of the staff, it reflected at least a part of their personality.  

For the most part, the staff is still friendly, but now they are all wearing corporate-casual polo shirts that would be equally at home at a Target, especially given how small the logo is, I&#39;m sure its a mistake that&#39;s been made more than once.

I ordered something new on the menu. It was the Jack Daniels shrimp, steak and chicken on a bed of spinach.  suffice it to say- it was NOT A VALUE FOR THE MONEY.

This Friday&#39;s has been remodeled recently and is less gaudy than they used to be.  The servers can be hit or miss, but you can say one thing for eating pre-packaged food: it&#39;s consistent.  I&#39;ve never had anything terrible here - but I&#39;ve never had anything awesome, either.

I hadn&#39;t been to one in many years since I hadn&#39;t lived near one.  My previous experience had been good, so I was expecting it to be good again. 

Wrong.

They advertise their 3-course meals for $12.99, so my son and I both ordered that.  We had the appetizers (green bean fries and fried mac &amp; cheese).  The appetizers were good.  I ordered the Asian Garlic Chicken and my son ordered the Cajun Shrimp &amp; Chicken Pasta.  I swear that I&#39;m not that picky of an eater... but when I got my plate, I just found it to be not good.  I rarely, if ever, send back my food and order something else, but in this case I just didn&#39;t like it.  So then, in its place, I ordered the Argentinean Rubbed Flat Iron Steak.  I think they were trying to do a chimichurri-type sauce, but it just didn&#39;t work.  I didn&#39;t like that either and I sent it back.  At that point, I was done trying.  I didn&#39;t want to order anything else.  The manager said they would take it off my bill.  But when I got the bill, they had charged me for the appetizer.  When I pointed it out to the waiter-who-really-wasn&#39;t-that-good-and-didn&#39;t-really-seem-to-care, he took the ticket back... and proceeded to bring me back another ticket... this time it was a dollar more (for that appetizer).  My son wanted to send back his food too, but his food was ok... just not enough flavor.  When you think shrimp/cajun/alfredo... you expect more flavor.  Not so.  I spoke to the manager again and she thought it was fair that she was charging me for an appetizer.  I was pretty pissed off, at this point.  I went ahead and paid the bill, w/no tip.  As a former waitress, I&#39;m fully aware... and quite frankly, I don&#39;t think I have ever NOT left a tip.  

As I was leaving, the manager was standing at the door.  I said to her, &#34;The right thing to do would have been to take the meal off of my ticket and left it at that&#34;.  She tried to explain herself again, but then said &#34;If you want me to give you a coupon for a free appetizer for next time...&#34;  I said, &#34;No thank you.  It&#39;s too late for that&#34;.

Is this the norm for Chicago??  Is customer service dead??"

Cons: Few healthy options on the menu.

I chose this bar to watch the Hawks game purely because of the name, only to find that the Blackhawks goalie of the same name is not affiliated with the restaurant, though they do little to discourage that assumption. 

SERVICE: server was friendly,  if culturally insensitive,  and food and drinks arrived fast.  

SEATING: The restaurant is huge,  and unless there&#39;s a game on it&#39;s pretty empty on a week night. Bar seating consists of stools around the bar, and a handful of two seat high top tables. There are a multiple screens around the bar/restaurant showing a variety of sports games,  but this place comes alive during Blackhawks hockey.  More on that later. 

DRINKS: The beer list was a pleasant surprise,  with a good mix of craft beers on tap. They allowed me to sample my selection before I ordered a glass,  which was nice. 

FOOD: My server was knowledgeable about the menu,  and recommended the fresh made potato chips as a must have. I agree with her assessment. They were incredible,  and held their crunch after sitting in the fridge with my other leftovers. 
The appetizer was disappointing.  I asked about the spicy quesadillas and my server said that they are made with hot sauce by &#34;the Mexicans who work in the kitchen.  They know spicy.&#34; It was a dripping mess. 
My chicken parm sandwich also failed to meet my expectations.  It looked delicious,  perfect amount of red sauce and mozzarella and served on a garlic bread roll.  Unfortunately, the chicken breast was overcooked (dry) which ruined the rest of the experience.  
I liked that sides included an option for fresh vegetables,  which besides the beer was probably the best part of my meal. 

THE GAME EXPERIENCE: There may be no better place to watch a Hawks game.  All of the big screens show the game,  with sound broadcast through the bar sound system. When the Hawks score,  they play Chelsea Dagger (just the tune, but still fun). The bar is packed with fans in Blackhawks Red and it&#39;s almost as much fun as being at the game."

I went to Bannerman&#39;s a few years back for a few cocktails and was unimpressed but I learned tonight that our friends really like to come here for Hawks games. 

They have a lot of TVs throughout the entire bar. In fact, I don&#39;t think there is anywhere in this bar that you can sit or stand and not see a television. The games are projected on 6 large screens. The clarity isn&#39;t great but they do the job. The volume of the music is turned down and the sound of the game is turned up during the game. When the Hawks score, they have some red siren type lights that run, they blow a loud horn three times and they play a few seconds of Chelsea Dagger. Whomever is running this whole set up, it&#39;s a lot of fun but try fading out the music when the replays stop and the game resumes. It&#39;s ok if we miss a few seconds of the commentary. The abrupt stop of Chelsea Dagger is not fun and if we&#39;re singing along, it kinda sucks when you just shut it off. It appeared, by scanning the bar, that I was not the only one annoyed by this. 

Now, I did peek on Yelp before coming here tonight and even though the 2.5 star rating didn&#39;t impress me, I went with an open mind as our friends chose the place and I wanted to make up my own mind about it. 

We were greeted promptly when we walked through the front door, found our friends and joined them a high top table in the center area of the dining area. I noticed several children here so I&#39;m guessing they are going for a family feel if they allow kids but the place does not look family friendly. It&#39;s bar. Kids don&#39;t really belong in here and if they want to cater to families, then I would suggest a major remodel and layout change. It&#39;s a sports bar, people. 

So we were off to a great start with our server. She took our drink order practically while we were sitting down. I was impressed immediately! We grabbed a menu and started to flip through. I asked the server what was good. She recommended the chicken Cesar wrap (something she eats regularly), the broasted chicken and their pizza. I asked if they had soup and she told me they had Chicken Noodle soup tonight. I asked if it was homemade and she informed me it is not. I asked if the pizza is made fresh in house and she said no. So we ended up with the Cesar wrap and the broasted chicken. Our friends split a pizza and they had already had a nacho app before we had arrived. I noticed what was left on the plate from their nachos was a lot of lettuce and the chips you would find at Wrigley Field with that cheese sauce. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my broasted chicken and my hubby enjoyed his wrap. My complaint about my meal was the waffle fries were over cooked so they were hard and difficult to eat (side note: there is an upcharge for these fries). He mentioned that his wrap was light on the chicken and heavy on the lettuce. Which, as you know, he RARELY complains, so I&#39;m very certain he was right on the money. Now this stuff isn&#39;t a huge deal but now it gets worse. 

After our server dropped off the food, she disappeared for 47 minutes. We know this because the food hit the table at exactly 7pm when the game started and at 7:47, after we looked around for her (or anyone for that matter) she was nowhere to be found. We grabbed an older gentleman who was chatting with some (obviously regular) patrons and asked him if he could help us out since our server is MIA. He asked what we needed and took a drink order from us. She magically appeared as if from nowhere moments after he took our order. I&#39;m guessing he was the manager or possibly the owner because from this moment on, we had 3 different servers (no ours) stop and check on us approximately every 4-5 minutes until we left. It was almost annoying now.

Ultimately, our server never cleared ONE dish or glass from our table but everyone else did, I had to have another server get her for us at one point to ask her for refills on water and soda and someone else delivered them. Oh, did I mention that I had my plate sit in front of me with a napkin over it for about 15 minutes and ended up taking it and putting it on an empty table nearby to get rid of it?

Later, we learned that she was serving tables on the complete other side of the bar. Why? We don&#39;t know. I was a server for many years and we always had sections. If you got pulled for a larger party or something, you tell your table that you&#39;re switching to a different section and inform them of who will be their server from that point forward. 

Management, please section your serving areas so servers are always nearby all their tables if needed. Ease up on the filler (ie. lettuce) a smaller diameter wrap would have  fine but you try to make it appear larger by packing it with iceberg, is unnecessary. Consider looking into food prep as over cooked fries on two plates should have never left your kitchen.

I think this place could actually be something if they worked out the little details!"

My guess is their drains aren&#39;t filled.  Check your p-traps please!  

Beer buckets were decently priced but when our waitress brought us &#34;frosty&#34; glasses there was a monstrous hair strewn across the top of one of them, and mine had a lemon seed permanently stuck to the bottom of the glass--on the inside.  That was a nice little treat to discover upon my last sip.  Our waitress was kind enough to deduct $5 off of our bill but it doesn&#39;t make up for that being completely gross.  And the frost wasn&#39;t even real--like a fake coating to make them look cold.  Nice.

I went in to see the band Turbo Shot on a Friday night (awesome band!!). The door guy checked my ID which is fine. I do hate having to pull it out of my wallet, but he had a machine that validated the authenticity of my ID which I didn&#39;t mind having to take it out for that. That&#39;s not the issue though. When we arrived at our table, our waitress came up and asked for our IDs. The kicker was, she then said anyone under 25 had to be checked my her manager. Uhm, really? And it took about 15 minutes for her to come back with 3 IDs. Seems a bit excessive. Its not my problem if they&#39;ve gotten caught serving underage kids. I came to your establishment to rack up a bar tab, and you&#39;re doing a pretty decent job at trying to stop me. Finally when she came back with our IDs, we could order a drink. But even that took her nearly 20 minutes to bring out. And one of the drink orders was wrong. Since it took her forever to bring out the drinks, I decided to order food and another drink when I wasn&#39;t even half finished with my current one. Good thing I did, because I had plenty of time to finish my drink before I even got the second. I ordered the Italian Sausage as I wasn&#39;t feeling adventurous that evening. It was decent, but nothing special. The waitress asked me if I wanted au jus with it and I said yes. I&#39;m sure you can guess by now, but no au jus. And she didn&#39;t bother to stop back at the table to see how we were doing until I had eaten half my chips and half my sandwich. I was trying to prolong eating the sandwich so I could get the au jus, until I realized my sandwich would be cold by the time she arrived at our table. And of course, I have 3 bites left, and she comes back to check on us. I wasn&#39;t going to wait another 20 minutes for au jus, so I said screw it. The waitress MAYBE stopped by 3 more times, but each time would leave longer and longer intervals between checking up on us. I had 4 drinks that night, because that&#39;s all I was able to order with the times she came around. I definitely would&#39;ve ordered more, but seems like they have an issue with training/choosing good wait staff. Don&#39;t get me wrong, this girl was super nice. Waiting tables is not a skill of hers. The place is mediocre and might be alright to catch a Hawks game at, but I&#39;d rather go to elsewhere that provides at least average service. The interior of the place almost feels like you don&#39;t want to touch anything either. Good for live music though."

Yet, every time we&#39;ve been in the area or passing through, we stop at Bannerman&#39;s out of sheer nostalgia about how good their wings are. That nostalgia, however, masks the fact that our orders are consistently, and unapologetically, botched. 

I&#39;ve never had a single meal served without error in one form or another, be it take-out or sit-down. It&#39;s ranged from sauce missing, a size of an order being bigger or small than asked for to downright entire items missing! We&#39;d long since stopped getting wings take-out because I got tired of getting home to Schaumburg to realize my order had been screwed up, yet again. 

The last straw was during a recent visit when my wife ordered bone-in wings. About two wings in, she found hair wrapped around a wing as though it&#39;d been there while spun in the sauce. I tried to give Bannerman&#39;s the benefit of the doubt, but with her hair cut short and pulled back, there was little recourse. That, in combination with every messed up order over the course of about 3 years, finally and completely squelched any lingering fond memories either of us had for the place. 

The server was extremely sweet and apologized, removing the order from the bill after we asked her to discard my wife&#39;s wings, but when we asked to see the manager, he didn&#39;t so much as look in our direction. 

There are plenty of bars, pubs, wherever that one can get a cold beer and hot wings -- Bannerman&#39;s just isn&#39;t one of them."

They have yummy $5 wing specials on Wednesday nights, even to-go if you want to pick them up. I like that a lot about this place, and the portion sizes are good.

I don&#39;t like dining or drinking in this establishment, though. The feel inside of this sports bar is kindof grimy to me. It&#39;s not a very classy environment, and the lighting is fluorescent, bright, and strange to describe. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place if you&#39;re looking for a dimly lit, modern tavern to hang out in. 

They have slot machines by the bar if that&#39;s your thing. The location is very crowded and happening when a big sports event is going on. On some nights they also have live music, mostly cover or tribute bands for the locals. It can be extremely empty on weeknights when nothing is going on.

This place is probably worth a trip to check out if your expectations aren&#39;t through the roof and you enjoy trying out new spots."

I go there with my friends minimum once a week and have been there maximum three nights in a row.  LOL!  Still not crazy about some items on the menu.  I believe it could use an overhaul but i have had worse.  There are some things that are not bad and they do try to work with you on your special requests.  The Manger is awesome and the waitresses work hard.  I will not lie, when certain bands play it can get realy busy and you may wait, but if you are patient and keep in mind these waitresses do their best, all will be better. Cover charges are competitive and I have never paid more than $8.  If you have a problem they are quick to solve it. Oh, the desserts they have are huge, if you like milkshakes and ice cream sundaes you will be in heaven.  Half price pizza on Thursday who can beat that?"

Besides that, the food is awful.  I did take my 3 sons here for wings once, they love them some wings... Youch, they were even grossed out. 

I&#39;d recommend this place redefine itself... It&#39;s trying to be a kid friendly place, have live music, have games kids like mixed with bar games and be a sports bar.  They need to call John Taffer... The place can be salvaged, but needs a good clean up, a complete food overhaul, a remodel to put all that wasted space to use and a solid branding based on the changes."

We went to watch the Blackhawks game, since they claim to be an official Blackhawks bar. When we arrived, I requested a table for 5. As I was being seated the gentleman asked me very rudely were the rest of my party was. When I explained to him that one was at the video machines and the others were right behind me, he rudely said oh, well here and walked away. Once we were seated at our table he would walk by and make rude remarks and stare our table down like we were doing something wrong. When we explained this to our waitress, it turns out this was the owner and her was stressed about the game and the band they had coming in later in the night because of the crowd they normally have follow them. If you are that concerned do not book that kind of group to perform. The place is not large enough for the types of groups that they book. And if they are an official Blackhawks bar, which they are not as they are not on the list on the Blackhawks website, and do specials for the games, they shouldn&#39;t book bands at all! 

As we were leaving, I was finishing a drink and walking away from the table but not leaving the place yet, the manager and owner rudely grabbed the glass from my hand and stating that I couldn&#39;t take the glass with me, which I wasn&#39;t! I paid for the drink in the glass and I was finishing the drink in the glass. I was not happy about that. There is no reason to treat your paying customers like that. 

I wish things would be different but they have lost my business because of the owner."

Oh the tables...sticky sticky, yuck. As well as the standing drink menus, I think there was some dried sauce or something that made the laminated pages stick together. 

Oh the drinks...get beer. The mixed drinks are super watered down and not made well. 

The food. Just OK. I ordered the chicken tenders because I was hungry. It&#39;s bar food, hot and bland. Although the server tried to make us feel bad when we all asked for our bills. She said she didn&#39;t know how to split a bill or something like that. 

I guess if you&#39;re in the area and can&#39;t get to a decent sports bar to watch a game, Bannerman&#39;s will do. For live music, the venue is good.  I&#39;ve been here on non-event nights and found the place just so-so as well."

My husband is African American and then a white guy walked up and was helped right away. We left after 15 minutes and no order was taken. We went back the following month to see if it was a 1 time thing again 10 minutes and still no one asked for his order and he was at the bar.

I&#39;ve always gone here over lunch. The first time I had the $1 burger, which I would have rated... &#34;don&#39;t get&#34;. This time I got fried haddock and our party shared waffle chips and a whole bunch of wings.

They have an asian-inspired sauce there, which is reminiscent of a sweet teriyaki sauce, and I recommend it. They also have a spicy ranch sauce, which doesn&#39;t really taste like anything. Their regular and hot sauces weren&#39;t anything to write home about, but they were halfway decent.

Happily, all the wings were cooked through and  incredibly moist, something I cannot say for *any* other chains in the area.

The haddock was apparently &#34;the best seafood on the menu&#34; but I didn&#39;t think it tasted much better than your generic battered whitefish, particularly with the bottled tartar sauce served in a small cup. The accompanying homemade cole slaw and veggies were good but nothing special.

Service was friendly, but there were only about 10-15 people there for lunch.

We entered the restaurant and there was no host or hostess to seat us at our table. We waited for about five minutes and still no one. The atmosphere was dark with a lot if projector screens and arcade games. It took the while for the server to get our orders and she seemed very impatient to get us in and out quickly. We went on a Wednesday where the wings were .50 cents each but you have to order at least ten. The wings were big and full of flavor for the price. The only downside was the celery was downright embarrassing.  The only downside is the lack of employees and the VERY VERY LONG SERVICE. We waited for a good 20 minutes for our credit cards back and there were about 4 other people in the restaurant. I give this place a total of three stars because of the cheap and good wings but the service is very slow. I&#39;d recommend this place only if you have nothing else planned later that day.

Witnessed the mayhem of the Hawks going up 3-0 against the Sharks, and the joint was jumpin&#39;. So go and watch a game, have a beer, just skip the food. 

I had a cheddar bacon burger. Not sure if it was an homage to hockey, but it did resemble a puck, much to my dismay. Machine formed, overcooked, no flavor and dry. Side of beans was cold, slaw was warm...you get the picture. Fellow diners did not enjoy the wings boneless or the real deal. They all looked slightly burnt. Many complaints about the pizza as well. it just did not look appetizing at all, so I did not imbibe. I did notice another table that had ordered a cheese and mushroom pizza. Looked to me like they made a cheese pizza and then tossed a handful of sliced canned shrooms on top after it was baked. No thanks.

Bottom line, five stars for the space to view sports, one star for the chow. Service was decent considering the amount of people that were  here for the playoff game."

It is so loud in there you have to step outside to clear your head after about 20 min. They also show the UFC fights there, but you got to pay cover..to get in, Real Time Sports in Schaumburg shows them for free, so don&#39;t waste your money..you also pay cover when their are bands.

When i called to ask about their restrictions on balloons and cake, the owner informed me that the fight was on and encouraged us to arrive early to make sure we had enough seating, but just so happened to fail to mention a cover. After all the money my colleagues spend their weekly, this was outrageous. He did, however, offer us the &#34;VIP&#34; room, but made sure to threaten to charge anyone in our group who tried to &#34;sneak&#34; out to watch the fight. He stood by our door and monitored who came in and out, and a different employee ran into our room when he saw an advertisement for the fight on the TVs that THEY turned on for us, without us even asking. The owner then hung outside of the room for the remainder of the night until we left. We felt uncomfortable and not trusted. I say all of this with regret because this was always the first local bar I would suggest for Blackhawks games. Their service is generally good, and their drink specials are fantastic. Sad to have such an experience at a place that usually has a great atmosphere. The bartenders and servers are great, but management is what made for a terrible experience."

Initially we liked the idea of having a bar near our home but Bannerman&#39;s is probably less-than-average for a sports bar.

The inside is usually clean and it is a big place with decent decor.  However, the food is poor and service is barely average.  The biggest problem is that the music  gets extremely loud inside.  It is so loud that it impossible to talk, so we&#39;ve stopped going there.  

We talked to others and they have said much the same thing.  We were also told that nearby neighborhoods have started complaining about the noise but the owner has refused to comply with the wishes of his neighbors."

We arrived after they had begun their first set.  There appeared to be a manager standing in the front area when we first walked in.  He didn&#39;t say anything to us, so we just kept walking.  My friend found us a round table to the side of the stage so we sat down.   We sat for atleast 20 minutes and never even saw a waitress.   They were not packed so it was a little suprising and since we were sitting next to the computer you would assume a server would appear there occasionally.   My friend went up to the bar and got us our drinks.   Took her at least 15 minutes to come back, and when she did it was over $12.00 for a bottle of Miller lite and a small mixed drink.     We had our drinks and were enjoying the band so we wanted another.   Again a server was no where to be found, a couple servers ended up walking past us but when we would try to grab their attention  they would just glance our way and keep walking.    Finally a server stopped at the computer to put someones order in and we were able to get her attention.   This time ordering just a shot and a diet coke plus the beer it was still over $12.00.   Very expensive for the type of venue it was.  

When the band went on its first break we approached them told them how great they were but we were leaving because the staff was very poor.   The band even offered to speak to a manager for us, but seeing the attitudes the servers already had we didn&#39;t even want to deal with them again.

If your a venue that caters to bringing bands in, you should expect them to be bringing their fan base with them.  I would expect to be welcomed as someone new, not ignored.

I doubt I will ever return."

I&#39;d give them 5 stars if not for the minimim $10 spend in order to use a debit/credit card.  That policy irks me.  I rarely carry cash.  I mean, it&#39;s 2016, time to accept it.

First off, the atmosphere is very chill, with that old school diner/neighborhood restaurant vibe.  The owners (father and son) run the restaurant and you can really tell they care about their product.  Come in often enough and they know you by name.  Very inviting and makes for a great dining experience for a quick bite out.  

The food is always amazing.  You have to try the Gyros Burger (you guys might as well call this &#34;The Heffy&#34; on the menu).  I know I like gyros.  I&#39;m sure I like burgers.  Throw some bacon and gyros sauce on that and whats the worst that can happen?! Deliciousness, that&#39;s what.  Legit, never had a bad meal here.  I always order the fries extra crispy and they are on point every time.  Burgers are great.  Hot dogs have a nice authentic chicago taste to them.  Italian beef and sausage was also good.  I get their homemade sweet peppers on the side and hot on the sandwich.  I even randomly ordered a vanilla shake and that was perfect.

Pro tip: Grilled chicken sandwich comes on a pita (still ridiculously good) so if you want your traditional grilled chicken sandwich, just ask for it on a bun.  

Great spot.  Give it a try and you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Heffy&#39;s is a hot dog stand, not a 4-Star, linen table cloth bistro. Yes, the cooks probably did have grease spots on their apron. Want to know why, because they work around grease. Take a look in any kitchen, including the world famous eateries and I bet you they have spots on their aprons &amp; uniforms as well.

Heffy&#39;s is a family run place- a comfortable spot to bring the gang for a quick bite.  Here&#39;s an example: 

I was here with my sisters and my little nieces and nephews (ages 4-7) on Sunday.  We popped in after seeing &#39;High School Musical 3&#39; at the Randhurst Cinema.  The kids were a bit unruly after sitting for almost two hours through a REALLY (REALLY)  long movie.  (I secretly feared that we might get thrown out) But the owner couldn&#39;t be nicer.  The kids were fascinated  with the various gum ball machines and then enjoyed their &#34;all white meat&#34; chicken nuggets kid meals.  The adults had no complaints about the dogs and fries.

None of the employees speak English very well, so it is difficult to convey what you want on your sandwich. The clerks do not even know what they sell, as when I wanted the value meal with the cookies instead of the chips, he asked me if I wanted five cookies instead of the usual two. Then when I declined, he asked me how many. Hey, buddy, you work here! You tell me how many cookies I get with your value meal!

The food itself is mediocre. Despite being toasted, the meat is lukewarm and the vegetables taste the opposite of fresh. I&#39;ve tasted better bread in the grocery aisle. Plus, the server could have been friendlier and more knowledgeable about his products.  This is one Subway I will not be frequenting often."

We ordered some sushi platters, all of which were fresh, succulent, and absolutely wonderful. And can I say, each slice of fish is HUGE! My favorite is the chu-toro, which is so tender, like butter in your mouth. Their shrimp are so fresh. They also have an excellent and fresh selection of shellfish, like abalone and scallop. 
We also had tsukune (chicken meatball) stuffed shiitake mushrooms, which were so juicy, so hot, so authentic, reminded me of Tokyo back-streets, as well as pork katsu kushi, a pork cutlet skewer. Excellent.

We ordered several rolls and all were good.  They came out in great shape and tasted fresh and delicious. 
Our service was very good.  Our girl was attentive and very sweet.
If you can sit in a room it&#39;s such a fun intimate experience.  You remove your shoes and sit down so if anyone in your party struggles with getting on the ground this is not for you. We enjoyed the experience. They have slides for you if you need to take a bathroom break. 
The bathrooms need some serious attention to detail. The hall to the bathrooms is nothing short of disappointing and the bathrooms themselves are in desperate need of updating. They were clean just not 4 star worthy.
We found this place on yelp while at a dance competition in Schaumburg. I&#39;m glad for yelp. We would have never gone here otherwise.

The salmon and tomago nigiri were fantastic and we had to hold ourselves back from ordering too many. My wife compared them to sushi we had in Vancouver, which is very high praise coming from her. 

The Tonkotsu ramen had a great balance of flavors and the broth was rich yet not too salty. 

FYI: Our waitress told us that Daruma offers ramen every day, however the selection/type of ramen varies from day to day.

Prices are what you would expect from a typical sushi place. It didn&#39;t seem to be overly expensive or surprisingly cheap."

Upon arrival, you&#39;ll notice Japanese workers and customers. Surely a good sign that this place is authentic. We didn&#39;t make reservations, but it took less than five minutes to be seated (granted we had to opt for bar seating for minimal wait). Next time, I&#39;ll know to make reservations instead. The decor is nothing fancy but does the job to make it a comfortable environment.

We both ordered the Daruma Sushi dinner entree, which consists of eight pieces of assorted nigiri with the choice of tekka maki or California roll and a side of miso soup. I chose the tekka maki (salmon). The nigiri had huge cuts of fish and tasted fresh. I didn&#39;t feel full after devouring everything, so I ended up ordering an appetizer of Shumai dumplings and drinking water to help get me there. That did the job.

The service was fantastic. The bar server was very attentive and tolerated our conversation of discussing my friend&#39;s issues. Our cups of water were consistently refilled in a timely manner as well.

Dinner is a big pricey at $23.95 for the dish we ordered. I would definitely come back to try their lunch specials. Next time!"

I think it&#39;s been 15 years since I&#39;ve been there. I got a few comments from people I know and the reviews are pretty solid again. They do cater to a more authentic menu and don&#39;t have 100 Fake rolls to satisfy the white palate. They have a lot of dishes that cater to the Japanese culture and I like that. Since it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve been here I ordered my usual standard and a few other things to test out the kitchen.

My standard nigiri order is Hamachi, Salmon (or fatty salmon if they have it), Ama Ebi, Unagi, &amp; Toro (they had ChuToro so that&#39;s what I had). It all was fresh but not one thing stood out as really good, all mid level flavor. Had a veggie tempura app and it was ok, not a great selection of vegetables compared to other restaurants but batter was light and clean as it should be. Had the Berkshire pork belly, which was good. They do have Hamachi Kama on the menu (Yellowtail collar bone grilled) this is a great fish item to get. 

Overall I think it&#39;s god spot. It doesn&#39;t seem as good as back in the day but it is one of the few Japanese restaurants that hasn&#39;t caved in to the American Roll fad. I hate reading reviews of the &#34;Best&#34; Japanese restaurants and it&#39;s all based on the frickin&#39; Philly roll someone had!

I still think that the Sushi Kushi spots are some of the best for fish etc but none of them are in Schaumburg/Hoffman are as Daruma is...

Give Daruma a try, might be a good pick for a real Japanese meal..."

Upon opening sushi gates of heaven, you will be greeted upon delightful waiter/waitress. If you&#39;re worried about space, let me say it is very spacious! Here are some pointers I recommend.

If you love nigri cuts and want one roll to go along with it, you must try: HonMaguro (Bluefin MedFatty), Benitoro (Salmon), Hamachi (Yellow Tail), Unagi (Eel) and Rainbow roll (assorted fish). Please keep in mind, by no means you must order the thicker cuts, but if you never had these kind of cuts, give it a try! The smaller cuts are: Sake (salmon) and the Maguro (tuna) are excellent choices as well!

If you&#39;re more of a roll person, I recommend getting at least two rolls to start and order more if your still hungry. I love their Rainbow (tuna, salmon, white-tuna, avocado, salmon eggs, and crabmeat) and crazy (salmon, tuna, salmon eggs, avocado). Crazy has thicker cuts, but rainbow is more tastier, keep in mind!

If you want something warm on a cold / rainy day, order their ramen and spaghetti! Please, please, please order the ramen on friday or Sunday. You can&#39;t get it on any other days. But the spaghetti will be available throughout the week. What&#39;s different about their ramen is homemade broth with pork belly that melts in your mouth. Their spaghetti is actually made with ketchup and if you feel my review has been decent, give it a try! You won&#39;t regret it!

How much do I love sushi? I LOVE IT. My go to place, ONLY in the suburbs. Enjoy, please eat lots for me!"

I only live a few streets down from this place, and the funny thing is, it&#39;s been here for almost as long as I can remember. I feel like this plaza (which has been here forever) was not built on the CVS, who used to be an Osco, but around Daruma. Here&#39;s the amazing thing, I never knew what this place even was until my boss and I went there for dinner. I tell ya, this is like the hidden-est gem I&#39;ve ever seen! 

It&#39;s legit too! It&#39;s all Japanese run, in fact the sushi chef barely speaks English, the staff is all Japanese, the &#34;real&#34; menu is all in Japanese, and here&#39;s how you know it&#39;s legit, the clientele is mostly Japanese. When you talk about an ethnic joint, that&#39;s a good sign!

Now, I&#39;m not Japanese, so my exposure to the cuisine is pretty much sushi and ramen. I&#39;m sure there are a ton of things on the Japanese menu that are amazing, but when I come here, it&#39;s always about the sushi!

HOUSE SALAD
It comes in a small bowl, but damn if this is isn&#39;t refreshing! It&#39;s always very cold, the veggies are always crisp, and nothing is ever dry. It&#39;s got lettuce, asparagus, tomato, a little carrot shreds, and a couple slices of green pepper (which I brush to the side). It also has some imitation crab meat and this amazing ginger-soy dressing. That dressing is so good, I actually want to drink it out of the bowl when I&#39;m done! It looks freshly made too. The dressing looks like it&#39;s made of pureed ingredients, to give you an idea of texture. Not creamy like some dressings, and not oily like others, it&#39;s got a little bit of sweetness, refreshing ginger essence, nothing overpowering, and the perfect amount of seasoning to make the salad as far from boring as possible! 

SPIDER ROLL
In general, spider rolls are a bit of a risky order for me. Texture&#39;s really important to me, and I love the crisp, but sometimes, the soft shell isn&#39;t cooked quite right, and as your mouth adds moisture to it, it ends up being like a shrimp tail that I have a hard time swallowing. I&#39;m happy to report that theirs is pretty good, no danger of that. It&#39;s so incredibly crispy, and you actually get that soft-shell-air in each bite (kinda like donut air, if you know what I mean?).

SUSHI (IN GENERAL)
While I do like sashimi too in small amounts, I&#39;m more of a nigiri person. The fish is one thing, but you know the rice is so important! You have to mix the ingredients perfectly to give it a hint of sour without being sour, and it&#39;s gotta have seasoning too. An interesting thing I heard is that the best sushi chefs are BORN that way, because their hands actually produce natural oils that season the rice, and some hands are better than others. When they pack that rice in, you&#39;re getting some of that. In any case, whether it&#39;s hand oils or cooking methods, Daruma&#39;s rice is so perfect, which compliments their fish.

The other thing is the size of the pieces. Maybe I haven&#39;t been to too many other fancy sushi places, but the amount of fish you get is crazy! I&#39;d say for a 2 inch log of rice, you get probably 4 inches of fish!

SALMON NIGIRI
The texture of their salmon is unbeatable! It&#39;s so fresh and...slick? It&#39;s almost perfect, but it lacks just a tiny bit of seasoning. I don&#39;t know how to make sushi, so I don&#39;t know how something raw tastes different at different places, but that&#39;s the only thing keeping it from a 10. Believe it or not, the place Sake on Golf &amp; Plum Grove actually wins the sushi nigiri FLAVOR for me, but Daruma definitely wins texture.

MED FATTY TUNA
OMG! I&#39;m in heaven! This ain&#39;t cheap! It&#39;s like $13 per, but if this is medium, I can&#39;t imagine what their Otoro is like! It&#39;s thick too! Take the size I mentioned before and it&#39;s maybe 0.5-0.6 cm thick! Such powerful fishy flavors, and a seasoning that hits you at the tail end instead of the front end (like mackerel). Also a perfect melty-soft texture with a tiny bit of fight in it. I actually think I like the texture of this better than Otoro. Otoro melts in your mouth, but I like to feel like I&#39;m actually eating something. This alone would carry Daruma!

YELLOWTAIL
Make sure if you get Med Fatty tuna to eat yellowtail BEFORE not after. It&#39;s also thick, but has a little more fight, less powerful fishy flavor, but more than most I&#39;ve tried, which makes this the best yellowtail nigiri I&#39;ve ever had! I get this every time I come! Again, seasoning hits you at the tail end more than front, which is what yellowtail is.

BANZAI!
Ok, so, this sushi ain&#39;t cheap! For 3 ppl: 3 salads, 3 miso soups, 2 big maki rolls, 12 nigiris, a veggie tempura, 3 mochi ice creams, and 1 beer + tax and tip cost something like $240! Of course, a lot of that is also based on which maki and nigiris you get (btw, we were STUFFED!) But still, who knew that the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had so far was right in my backyard?! Come to Schaumburg, NOW!"

I always ALWAYS order the Pork Ramen! The noodles taste homemade and not store-bought. The broth is delectable and the pork is soooo tender and flavorful. And it&#39;s only $9.95! 

As for the sushi, the fish is consistently fresh and the texture and flavor of the rice are always on point. The sushi is never rice-heavy and all the ingredients are well-balanced.

They have a wide variety of rolls, but not an incredible amount (I will have to update on the number when I go back, but it&#39;s not as many as other sushi places I&#39;ve gone to, but it&#39;s a good selection).  Even the spicy tuna rolls are actual pieces of tuna instead of ground up tuna with the spicy sauce.  I know some places use the leftover crappy parts of tuna to make the spicy tuna rolls... not this place.

They also serve Ramen on the weekends here and they do make quite a good bowl of ramen.  

Service is also pretty top notch as the waitresses are very nice and very attentive to your needs.

So while there are plenty of places to go for sushi, this is definitely one of the better places to go for raw fish to go along with my soy sauce."

My coworker from Japan insisted on taking me here and fed me a feast. 
We had so many dishes from the menu and saw how fresh the fish was, I was a very happy woman. 
It&#39;s not convenience to go here at all but if you&#39;re ever in the suburbs or this area. Definitely check out Daruma."

My friends and I came here Sunday night around 7pm and were immediately given a table. We opted for a private room with those tables that looks like your sitting on the ground, but the bottom was open where you can put your feet down. It&#39;s essentially a chair without the backing- authentic enough without the numbing legs.

The server was very knowledgeable and supportive to our joking manner throughout our meal. I started out with their aged takoyaki and I must admit it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had. My friend said it&#39;s like the real ones he had in Japan and he was surprised too. It comes out in 6 pieces and unfortunately I offered a piece to everyone even though I was starving haha. I&#39;ll get a double order next time IF I decide to share again. I had the sushi dinner and all the sashimi pieces were very fresh and tender, no fishy taste here. I normally don&#39;t like octopus because it&#39;s a bit chewy, but they had prepared it just right: so it was tender enough to eat without giving out more food. Nothing was given out on my entrée, they have their own foods to eat (again, I was starving).

Side note: my friend had the tuna maki and they used HUGE pieces of tuna. The ratio of fish to rice was strong on the fish: again I was surprised due to the quality of the fish. They carry a full menu from ramen to rice bowls to anything you can think of. Everyone was happy with their meals and said they&#39;d come back. Sorry no pictures here, the takoyaki smelled too good and dove in without realizing what I did, but don&#39;t care, totally worth it.

Daruma was a bit of a far drive for us (35mins), but I can definitely make an excuse to visit someone in the area just to come back."

I honestly had very low expectations, being that we were in the middle of nowhere and away from the city. We were hungry and willing to eat any quality Japanese food. 

We entered and we noticed that everyone was Japanese. So we got excited. This is what I thought of each of the dishes. 

1. Squid tentacles - this was one of the appetizers we ordered. The squid was tender and fried perfectly. The sauce was wonderful: mayo w wasabi and something spicy. Couldn&#39;t get enough. This gets a 3 out of 5 stars because I&#39;ve had calamari more tender than this. I would order this again though. 

2. The spicy salmon wasn&#39;t the typical American looking spicy salmon roll. It was a whole piece of tender salmon w a slice of cucumber and w little rice as it should be. The fish was so fresh my Chinese eyes turned American. This one gets 5 stars. I&#39;m excited to try more sushi next time. 

3. The tonkotsu ramen was good. The broth was authentic. They used black garlic which I loved. The chashu pork was fatty and full of flavor. I picked up the wine they marinated or cooked it in. Amazing how they were able to bring out that flavor. The noodles weren&#39;t homemade but that&#39;s ok. It was chewy and that made it good. I give this dish 4 out of 5 stars. 

4. The hamachi Kama was a triumph. It made me curse. That&#39;s how amazing it was. First of...$10 for a piece this big made me feel awesome. It was cooked perfectly. PERFECTLY. I wish NY had this restaurant (we need this in Westchester County). I&#39;d be back over and over again for this dish. This one gets 5 stars. 6 if it was possible. 

5. I didn&#39;t try the soba, but my sis-in-law loved it. So I can&#39;t really give it a rating. I&#39;m sure the noodles were cooked perfectly though. 

I didn&#39;t order any tempura but from the look of it, as it made its way to some other table, it seemed good. The batter looked light (you could see the shrimp meat through it). I would order this next time. 

They had an octopus wasabi dish. The same one I always order in ippudo. I would like to try that also next time. 

Three of us ate and the damage was something like $50. Not bad at all.  

The chirashi is $25. I will order that the next time I go. Sucks that I go back to NY I&#39;m a couple of days. Would love to go back many more times."

The atmosphere is always nice for either a casual night out with friends or romantic date for two. We like to take a seat at the sushi bar whenever we&#39;re sans our little one too. 

For appetizers we usually like to have the goma-ae or tempura vegetables to start. Both come with delicious dipping sauces but are delightful to eat alone as well. We also tried the homemade pork ramen noodles and it did not disappoint, highly recommended! 

Like I said before, sushi is our main entree of choice but they have a full menu of options to choose from. Soups and salads, meat dishes, hot and cold and don&#39;t forget dessert! Daruma has become one of our favorite restaurants in the neighborhood and it&#39;s right around the corner."

This is a review about take out sushi. The restaurant is authentic, and cozy. It had a nice vibe for it. We ordered take out, which was a little bit of a hectic process. First of all, there isn&#39;t an easy found online menu, and had to rely on pictures of the menu taken by one of my favorite yelpers (thanks, Candice G!) to make our choices. Thankfully, our chosen options were still on the menu, but if their are seasonal items or menu changes, we could&#39;ve been SOL. They told us the wait time for 4 rolls would be 35-40 minutes, which seemed a little steep, but we were willing to do it.

After our wait time was up, we headed to the restaurant. Their small bar area was beyond cramped. People were waiting to be seated, trying to sit at the bar, and the take out order was also waiting there. It felt awkward and chaotic. 

Once home, we delved into our sushi. I ordered the spicy lobster and crazy roll. My friend had the spider roll, and a roll with assorted fish in it.The crazy roll (a shrimp tempura option) was great. The lobster roll wasn&#39;t that spicy or amazing. I tried a piece of the spider roll, and also thought it was good.

Overall, I&#39;ve had more enjoyable sushi elsewhere, but I would come here again, if asked."

I start off with that because I am so scarred from ramen misoya and the terrible terrible tokio pub ramen ( I swear I was gonna have hypertension after) The broth has a rich flavor of the beef. I thought it was a little oily but I mean there was a piece of pork belly so I shouldn&#39;t complain. The ramen was good too. It didn&#39;t taste like packaged and preserved (I wonder if it is handmade/homemade???) The only complain I have is.... One piece of pork belly? Really? Come on. At least put 2 to even things out.

Tempura Udon: this is because of Lent, but this bowl of udon is mehs. There wasn&#39;t anything special that stood out. The broth was decent and that was pretty much it.

Spider: I had not expect it to be that big, I don&#39;t know in my head it wasn&#39;t what it came out to be. But that&#39;s a good thing. There was some soft warm stuff next to the soft shell that I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was lol but as a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Salmon nigiri (sake): DISCLAIMER, I rarely, hardly ever eat raw fish but I tried this because my friend loves the sashimi here. I have this unrealistic expectations of all raw fish to taste like absolute crap, but it wasn&#39;t bad. I was soft and not chewy. It tasted like butter on my taste buds if I had to compare it...okay maybe not butter but it was good.

Yellowtail nigiri: I don&#39;t ever think I&#39;ve ever eaten a yellowtail..cooked. So trying it raw was a bold as hell move. Didn&#39;t like it was much as the salmon. The texture was a little more coarse than the smooth salmon. It tasted fresh though so that&#39;s good. 

*** I want to comment on the rice that came with the nigiri. While I am no sushi expert nor have been to many sushi restaurants, the rice was delicious on the nigiri. I know I know, what is this girl talking about. But some places, the rice is either too sticky/mushy, too vinegary or something. However the rice had such a nice flavor that flowed so well with the fish. OH and I also want to comment on how BIG. B.I.G. the piece of fish was. Usually you get this skimpy, sad of an excuse piece of fish that you&#39;re just like wtf dude. But this, man the fish was hanging off the rice like a snorlax after it ate. Just frailing there on the plate waiting for you to bite off the sides so it can fit the rice. Okay I&#39;m done LOL

Overall, it was a good meal. BUT, this place gets pretty pricey. I&#39;m full, but I&#39;m not overly disgusted with myself for stuffing my face...for the same price I could be disgusted with myself for stuffing my face LOL"

First off, their sushi is better than even some places in the city. Their amaebi (sweet shrimp) is so succulent and sweet and they fry the heads beautifully. Even the standard fish (tuna, salmon) are exceptional and their eel is delicious as they don&#39;t overpower the taste of the grilled eel with an absurd amount of sauce.

But what separates Daruma is their ramen. I believe it&#39;s only available on the weekends but the quality of their broth makes it worth visiting. The savory, meaty taste in a broth is unbelievable.

One note: make sure you make a reservation, especially on the weekends, even if you&#39;re planning on going in 30 minutes. It&#39;s pretty hard to get a table quickly when you just walk in, even at weird hours."

One thing though, most of the time the TV is on the golf channel, once in a while it could be NBA, if there is any good games. If your a golfer you will love to sat at the bar, have some great food and japanese beers there.

Why not? 

For my bi-monthly &#39;take myself out to dinner&#39; night I decided once again on sushi, as it&#39;s something my usual dining partner isn&#39;t a huge fan of and therefore not something I often get to partake in. 

I&#39;d been eyeing Daruma for a few weeks now and wasn&#39;t entirely sure what to expect as I usually like to do a bit of research on a place beforehand- ya know peruse their website, maybe see what&#39;s poppin&#39; on their fb page, the usual--Only Daruma doesn&#39;t have any of that fancy jazz. It&#39;s just a place that exists (despite the apparent opposition to social media) that also happens to have a few dozen people gushing about them in Yelp reviews. 

I was sat in a side room with a few other parties. The room is decorated yet still pretty baren, made to look like a park or strip mall sidewalk based on the outdoor lighting and decorative landscaping rocks inside. It was quiet, it was calm, it was perfect for my purposes. 

My boo spent a fair amount of time in Japan this year and Daruma fits the description of what he said sushi is actually like in Japan. It&#39;s just about a finger&#39;s worth of rice, a bit of wasabi on top of the rice and the raw, cut fish on top. So if you&#39;re looking for classic Japanese style sushi, just keep to the right column of the sushi menu. 

If you&#39;re looking for some basic rolls, typical of most any sushi spot in the US, the left column is your friend. They don&#39;t offer any totally crazy combinations or particularly artful presentation, but the fish will speak for itself. 

I&#39;d read in a few reviews that service can be somewhat spotty to downright poor here, but my servers was outstanding. She busted her buns to refill my green tea no less than 893462396 times while juggling 8935723 other cups for the table next to mine. She helped guide me through what would be a good amount of food for one person so I didn&#39;t end up over-ordering or being surprised when anything I&#39;d ordered off the right side of the menu came out as only one piece, and not a whole roll. 

There wasn&#39;t anything I didn&#39;t enjoy and while I could go into detail and specifics with everything, I&#39;ll just guide toward the photos I uploaded of everything I ate... ya know, cause that&#39;s what you do when you eat alone. You take pics of everything. 

Daruma is separated into a few different rooms and areas so depending on where you&#39;re sat, you can have a totally different experience. There&#39;s the bustling main dining room, the sushi bar, an area with raised floors where you must remove you shoes and sit on the floor-like bench area, the quiet side room where I was and also a somewhat cramped foyer that leads into an indoor koi pond that little kids like to hang out around so they can poke the fish... which I do not condone... though I can&#39;t lie and say that at least half of my frustration with their poking of the fish was based off my selfish instinct to want to poke the fish for myself. But I resisted and instead did the adult thing and ordered more sushi."

1)40 minutes waiting time for food to come
2)appetizer literally came LAST. 5 minutes after our entree were served. It would still be acceptable for me if the entree and the app were served at the same time
3)after serving the bento box and ramen, the server turned around right away-did not ask if we had everything we needed-before I could even ask where our appetizer was. the noise was very high, i did not want to yell or shout to get his attention again
4)no miso soup when it indicated it&#39;s included with the bento box. (Not a biggie but they should be consistent)
5)they could use some air freshener in the inner part of their restaurant- it smelled very fishy in the area.

I understand that it was busy night last night for them. I could tell by the staff running around here and there. Kudos for them cos they&#39;re still warm and nice whenever they checked on you (which was rare based on our experience). 

I&#39;d come back for the ramen and alo try their other dishes."

Food:
Spicy Teba: Japanese style buffalo wings ($6.95) - the sauce that comes with it is spicy..the chicken was good, but for the prize, the portion isn&#39;t great...might as well just order a different dist and grab wings at Hooters or BWW or Gators or other restaurants that specialize in wings..

Customer Service: usually good, no issues

Often.  The people are friendly, food is incredible, and the atmosphere is great too.  You&#39;ll walk in to a boisterous &#34;irashi masae!&#34;, and then be seated.  If you can read japanese and like japanese food a lot, you may want to ask for the japanese menu.  I *think* it might have more selections.  But then again, i can&#39;t read it.  But whichever non-japanese person that orders from that menu in japanese gets bonus points in my book.

Sushi is wonderful, and we get it often - but our main staple is the Niku Udon (beef Udon).  Big noodles, perfectly cooked.  It is salty, but no overly so in my opinon.  My wife who is sensitive to salt enjoys it immensly, and I (who probably like salt too much) also enjoys it just as much.  It&#39;s probably one of the few foods we both crave.

Their appetizers, tempura, and other food is all great too.  we&#39;ve tried a lot of it, but i can&#39;t remember all the names.  Oh!  Agadashi Tofu.  got that after seeing something about it on tv (not from that restaurant).  Got it. Loved It.  Wanted more of it.

Also ,they have fresh made ramen for dine-in only.. but since it&#39;s fresh made once a week.. it only usually lasts a few days.  I think thursday and friday are usually good days to catch it.  I&#39;ve had that twice... the first time i wasn&#39;t too impressed.  But the second time more recently it was FANTASTIC!  It&#39;s soy-based instead of miso-based, and is great.  the pork cuts were tender and flavorful, the noodles were perfect, and the broth was, well, pretty damn tasty.  Call ahead if you want it to see if they have it that day/night.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s on par with Mitsuwa&#39;s ramen house.  ALthough that was 1 out of two times... so... I should rather say when it&#39;s great it&#39;s great.  will try it more often when we dine-in to see if it&#39;s more consistently great."

It&#39;s very close to where I live and food is generally fantastic.

Ambiance: I was actually surprised with how clean and well laid-out the restaurant is, given it&#39;s a location in a modestly sized strip mall.  It&#39;s not particularly huge and I wouldn&#39;t suggest large groups, but it&#39;s not a simple lunch counter nor is it as crammed tightly as other locations I&#39;ve been to (I&#39;m looking at you, House of Sushi &amp; Noodle).  The restaurant is clean if fairly plain, and free of the tchotchkies and &#39;flair&#39; that usually dot an ethnic restaurant.

One of the points that sold me on my first visit was the clientele: most of the diners, whether lunch or dinner, are east Asian (I won&#39;t claim to know what country specifically, though I usually hear a lot of Japanese).  I consider that a point in its favour.

Service: Depending on when you go, Daruma can be lightning fast or sluggish but fair.  Some nights are understaffed; our visit on 5/14 had our server vanish under the work load for about 15 minutes between dropping off drinks and taking any of our entree or appetizer orders.  Once we worked through that, though, the food came quickly.  The staff are courteous, know the menu, and are happy to give suggestions.  I&#39;ve also never run into a language barrier once.

Menu: The menu varies from week to week, and there&#39;s a varying number of specials on-hand any given day.  Daruma&#39;s primary focuses seem to be their sushi menu (a&#39;la carte, no all you can eat) and their soba, udon, and ramen noodles.

On our most recent visit, I had the kurubuta kushiage (pork cheek katsu skewers)  and Drauma natto (a house speciality, blending a soft-fried quail egg, Japanese pickle, natto, spring onion, and tekka, with nori sheets for making sort of hand rolls) appetizers.  The former was fantastic, very flavourful and substantial, with a rich katsu sauce provided.  As for the latter, I must first say I&#39;m a fan of natto and many aren&#39;t; mixed with the soft egg and other bits, the taste of the natto was cut down well and the pickles were delicious.  It looked positively disgusting, but it tasted darn fine.

For entrees, my partner had the Beef Teriyaki Bento Box, which for just under $30 provided a small ginger salad, six Tekka (tuna) rolls or six California rolls (she opted for the tuna), tempura vegetable and prawn, button mushrooms and greens in a smoky sauce I&#39;m not sure of, rice, miso, and a healthy serving of beef teriyaki cooked to order.  I rarely if ever see anyone willing to cook teriyaki to order--it&#39;s always cooked well.  This was very rare, still red in the core and very fresh.  She was more than happy with the results.

Myself, I had the tonkotsu miso ramen, the noodle special.  I&#39;m a big fan of tonkotsu (white pork bone)--it&#39;s different than miso or soy broth and I prefer the flavour.  The portions at Daruma are substantial, very much so, and I felt like they served me a litre of broth with more than enough noodle to fill me up.  Pork and other toppings were included of course, and it was all very hearty, rich, and not exceedingly salty with a solid noodle that stayed firm throughout, though it did cling to itself just a little.

(According to some, the Japanese menu that Daruma has features other items that aren&#39;t on the English menu, under the assumption that the locals wouldn&#39;t be interested.  I have no idea as I don&#39;t read Japanese well, but it makes some sense.)

Daruma provides complimentary hot green as an aperitif; nothing spectacular but a nice way to settle the stomach after eating.

Price: Daruma swings wildly depending on what you order.  The pork cheek appetizer, for instance, was $7 for two skewers.  The bento combination platter, $27.  But the massive tonkotsu ramen was only $10.  If you have a large appetite, come prepared to spend $25-$30 per person if not more, particularly if you order anything from the beer and spirits menu.  The proportions are generally worth the price, though.  I doubt you&#39;ll go home hungry.

Overall: if you accept the cost, you&#39;ll be very happy.  Daruma doesn&#39;t pull punches, doesn&#39;t bother with fusion or avante-guarde style cuisine, and I couldn&#39;t be happier."

The food was excellent, service prompt and courteous as well. Good signs #3 - 5.

We sat at the bar since we didn&#39;t want to wait for a table, not much space there but we were able to fit the sushi plates between us and still be comfortable. I had a Boston, Spicy Salmon, and Spicy Lobster roll. All were excellent with the lobster roll being especially good. The best part about the spicy salmon was that is was chunks of fish with spicy mayo, not the shredded mixture I&#39;ve had at a lot of other places. Tuna in the boston roll was also top notch. I&#39;ll definitely be back."

(*DISCLAIMER*:  The Japanese food my friends were eating (some kind of katsu) looked great, smelled great, and seemed great {Also...I don&#39;t think they were enthralled with the salad and the miso was just GOOD} but this review is really all about the sushi.)

I got my standard judgment rolls:  Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, and Spicy Himachi.  ALL were great.  Nice big chunks of fresh fish with scallions and cucumbers so thin they must&#39;ve been sliced with razor blades (Okay, okay, the cucumber isn&#39;t THAT impressive, but at least it wasn&#39;t a big chunk.)  The rolls actually had SOME spice too so I didn&#39;t have to add too much wasabi either.

I may have found my new go-to when I don&#39;t want to drive all the way to Ju Rin.  Bravo, Daruma, bravo."

I guess since the place was so packed, they didn&#39;t care about getting more people in.

Actually I wouldn&#39;t have discovered Daruma if it wasn&#39;t for my Japanese co-worker at the time.  The regulars here are predominantly Japanese, which is always a good sign.

I&#39;m a big fan of Japanese spaghetti and they make it just right.  The basic spaghetti consists of al dente noodles, tossed with ketchup and butter. If you feel like something different, try the Mentai Spaghetti -  noodles tossed in butter and cod roe,  with some chili spice and topped with some dried seaweed.  Both are delicious.

The Beef Tataki is a great way to start your meal.  The thin slices of beef are swimming in a ponzu sauce with garlic, that&#39;s just bursting with flavor. Last time I was here, the Hamachi and Unagi Nigiri hit the spot!  The eel was sweet, crisp, yet buttery, with just the right amount of rice.  The Hamachi was also solid, very fresh, meaty, and also buttery soft.  So good. 

I snagged a piece of my friend&#39;s Crunch Roll, which was surprisingly really good!   You get the crunch from the freshly fried shrimp tempura in the center.  They fry up their shrimp much better than most places, with crisp airy tempura.

They always hook it up with the complimentary green tea, which is the great way to end a filling meal."

Daruma is located in an interesting looking strip mall that isn&#39;t too busy during the daytime so you can park practically outside the door.

The atmosphere is a little dark but the restaurant is comfortable and decent sized. Their specials are written completely in Japanese and the menu contains the name of lots of Japanese items without pictures. This isn&#39;t a huge issue if you are relatively familiar with Japanese cuisine. The service was alright but could&#39;ve been a little better. Prices were great at under $10 for most of the lunch items and large portions (I took home a bit of both entrees).

As for the food, the tea was a bit light in flavor. I&#39;m not sure if local restaurants aren&#39;t willing to use high grade tea or I&#39;m just too used to drinking premium teas now that I have an unreasonably high expectation for restaurant tea. My guest and I ordered the Hire Katsu Don which came with a salad and bowl of udon and the Morikomi lunch which was a bento box with rice, salad, miso soup, oyakodon, and tonkatsu. The flavors overall were a bit light and on the authentic side.

Oyakodon - Decent flavor, could&#39;ve used a bit better texture since it was hard to even distinguish the texture of the chicken and the egg.
Tonkatsu - Slightly crispy, seems the pork underneath was not marinated, the sauce was okay.
Rice - Slightly dry, could&#39;ve used a bit more premium brand but considering the price of the meal this is understandable.
Miso soup - A bit less salty than most with a good amount of green onion.
Salad - Light but wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the dressing. Seemed like miso vinegar but I didn&#39;t find it particularly appealing.
Udon - Flavor of the broth is pretty good, the noodles seemed to be a bit too soft though.
Hire Katsu Don - I didn&#39;t dislike it but I didn&#39;t like it that much either. The pickled ginger was a little overpowering while the egg was a little underwhelming. The pork under it all wasn&#39;t really crispy although it had a nice soft texture to it. The tenderloin was probably not marinated as well.

So overall, the food wasn&#39;t exactly amazing but it wasn&#39;t bad either. It&#39;s pretty similar to what I would&#39;ve cooked at home if I&#39;d made these dishes (except the hire katsu don). However, since the price is very good and the atmosphere is pleasant, this is a place worth stopping by again for lunch."

I am still mourning this fact.  I have mixed feelings about Daruma.  The service is generally good, but the last time I ate there I got a waitress who was quite inattentive.

Their Tankatsu is consistently good.  I mean really delicious.  But they very recently changed their menu, and now you only get a very small portion of their delicious spaghetti with the tankatsu.  Even more disappointing, you don&#39;t get salad with this entrée any more...  you have to pay extra to have their small dinner salad.... obviously they are trying to save money here, but I think this whole thing is a rip-off.

I think they need to work on their menu....  the tankatsu now comes with a small portion of spaghetti, a small mound of potato salad, soup, and a bowl of rice...  and NO SALAD.  RICE, POTATO SALAD AND SPAGHETTI in one meal.... haven&#39;t these people heard of carb overload???"

I live in the Bay Area and have experienced some great sushi. Daruma did not disappoint my memory of good sushi. We had a spicy tuna roll, a crunchy shrimp tempura roll, a caterpillar roll, and eel sashimi, plus two bowls of miso soup and iced tea for $40. The sushi rice was perfectly cooked, the fish fresh, the service was prompt and courteous. After reading other yelp reviews about wait times, I called ahead and made a reservation (8pm, Sunday night) but it wasn&#39;t actually needed. Recommended without hesitation."

The maki rolls were absolutely amazing and fish tastes very fresh. The spaghetti w/ ketchup... yes doesn&#39;t sound very appetizing, but it was so good, just had to order a second helping.

Sushi was decent. Not the best but definitely better quality then most places. My only gripe was that the spicy rolls were not spicy at all.

I think next time I would come here for strictly the cooked foods. Their tapas menu looks awesome and unfortunately I was only able to try the butter clams and fried potato karoke. Off of the regular menu the spaghetti is a must! It comes on a sizzling plate and tastes very unique. I was too scared to try the spaghetti with the roe but next time for sure I will try it. 

Friendly quick service with good authentic japanese food. Winner."

We arrived earlier than the dinnertime rush, but the crowds quickly poured in while we were eating and even as we were leaving. What I enjoyed most was that the crowd consisted of Japanese locals - they are probably the best critics. 

We ordered a number of dishes to share, and all were incredible! Started with a Beef Tataki dish (I&#39;m still salivating over it now), Bacon-Wrapped Tomatoes, and then a Udon dish, Deluxe Sushi Platter, and finally a Crunch Roll. Each dish was exceptional, from the fresh sushi to the perfectly cooked bacon. 

My favorite dishes, however, are by far - the Beef Tataki and the Crunch Roll. The Beef Tataki is more mind-blowing amazing than... anything! Although it seems like a very normal roll available throughout Chicago, the Crunch Roll really blew me away. I LOVEDDDDD IT.  

Will definitely be visiting again! :)"

Multiple visits here and consistently good, fresh sushi for the right price is what I found. 

Ambiance is relaxed with a touch of class &amp; authentic. 

The restaurant has everything I would ask for in a sushi place....sushi bar, ETOH bar, koi pond, take your shoes off seeting, but the layout of this place is quite odd. Can&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but it seems like it was uprooted from its Japanese home along with its wooden bridge and flopped inside a strip mall. I hope it&#39;s here for good.

But why does it cost extra to sit in the cool floor room if you only have 2 people? The round eyes want to take their shoes off and sit crossed legged too! ;-)


Comparable to high end sushi joints in the city.....highly recommend.

Thanks for existing HERE."

I think that a Japanese restaurant occupied by mostly Japanese customers is on the right side of the skew.  Last time I was here, a guy who closely resembled Steven Speilberg fell asleep at the sushi bar.  Perhaps it was him considering I would believe that Speilberg would do that.

I&#39;m starting from the end of the meal where you get a complimentary cup of tea.  Again, the sushi and rolls are always done well and there are two types of soy sauce to pair with the fish.  The miso soup is okay, nothing special.  If you get the chef&#39;s choice platters, they really do a good job of variety.

Next time I will have one of the noodle bowls I saw at a neighboring table.  I almost wanted to barter a piece of nigiri for a taste of what they had."

A lot of authentic feel to it due to the amount of Japanese people that visit. I love it lol. The food was good. I had soba and it was exactly what I expected--cold and easy to eat--but it wasn&#39;t mind blowing or anything. My friends had the ramen special and some rolls. I definitely want to come back to try the ramen special on a cold day.

I have to say, the service was attentive and friendly.  The prices were also quite reasonable.  I thought the decor inside was nice, and there were some private rooms for larger groups.  We were seated in the back room, and the chairs were very uncomfortable.  

The food was nothing spectacular.  We ordered only sushi, and got the Jennifer roll, spicy tuna roll, spider roll, and harumaki roll.  I found the rolls to all be a bit bland, but with a little extra wasabi they were tasty.

I would give this place a shot if you&#39;re in Schaumburg and hungry for sushi.  It won&#39;t be your best sushi encounter, but for the price you won&#39;t be disappointed."

It&#39;s becoming more and more difficult distinguishing which is authentic Japanese and which restaurant is run by a different Asian/Pacific Islander. The more Japanese customers you see, the better; it means the food is more traditional.

Since the first time I introduced Daruma to my boyfriend, I can&#39;t get him to stop asking about eating here. I&#39;m to the point of becoming sick of sushi and Japanese food. 

Whether we&#39;re here for lunch or dinner, he strictly orders from the sushi menu. His &#34;must haves&#34; are the fresh Octopus and Tuna (Maguro) with Miso soup and Chirashi.

When I&#39;m not ordering nigiri sushi, I order their pork cutlet dish. While I enjoy Tonkatsu and Katsu Don, the name of this entree escapes me! Here&#39;s a helpful tip: you will only find it on their lunch menu. 

I&#39;m happy to report that the servers and Chef Matsuda are quick to try and please me. The Chef will let me order this pork dish as an &#34;off the menu&#34; dinner entree if he has the right cut of pork available. He tends to run out during his lunch rush so I always make sure to have a second choice picked out in the back of my mind.

I&#39;m so glad we went yesterday before my oral surgery appointment. I took the recommendation from our server and ordered the day&#39;s &#34;Special&#34;: a Bento Lunch Box. It included: 2 Karoke (potato patties covered in Panko bread crumbs, deep fried), cabbage w/Japanese mayo, house salad (lettuce w/Japanese dressing) and eel served in the same broth as my favorite pork dish.

It was so delicious! I realized something. I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s the soup that makes my dish a Daruma favorite. You can throw any kind of meat or fish in there and I think I&#39;m going to love it regardless!

The nigiri sushi menu is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Good quality, great tasting, well prepared sushi. Our tab is rarely under $40 thanks for my boyfriend&#39;s appetite. 

They look like they might have Karaoke nights as there is another room with a tv, Karaoke machine and speakers. Honestly, I&#39;m there for the food so you won&#39;t find a review about that here!"

She asked me what I wanted, and I said anything healthy. She then grabbed the menu and asked what I like. I told her I was new to sushi and still learning about it so she was very kind and suggested the Boston rolls for me (delicious!!) and then had the kitchen make it for me even though they were already closed!

I came about past 6:00 during dinner and there wasn&#39;t too much people, which was perfect for me. I ordered a Sprite (which may not go good with sushi but who cares). Delish.

Now here comes the food, I ordered the Kara-age (Japanese Fried Chicken) and it was DEEEElicious, but it could have used a bit more flavor. It came with five-six pieces, and was good for the cost.

Now, I read some posts below and saw that the food took 40 minutes to arrive, which is pretty insane. I&#39;ve never had that happen to me, even when the restaurant was full. I ordered the Sashimi Set which comes with miso soup, rice and fish. Was actually pretty tasty. I loved the tuna and salmon that came with it, but especially the salmon.

For desert, I ordered the Mochi-Ice Strawberry. The outside was chewy and the inside was strawberry heaven and cold.

I absolutely love this place, I would definitely recommend this place to you people that like Japanese Cuisines. I&#39;m going to come back for another time,

Found this place on yelp, and would never have noticed it despite living less than a mile away. 

We sampled the Rainbow, Crunchy, Spicy Tuna, and Spicy Lobster rolls. The Crunch was by far the favorite of the night, but all rolls had FRESH fish, and minimal rice. All rolled really well and held together.

We also have come to love red bean ice cream and now know to ask for it. This place provided some as well as green tea to finish off our meal. 

From a service standpoint, I wouldn&#39;t complain about our service or any of the food arrival times. Our appetizer and the first rolls were brought promptly, and my husband&#39;s soda remained full. 

We went in on a Wednesday night about 9:30pm. There were 2 other parties in the main dining room, and a private group towards the back. Not crowded at all, but definitely felt nice to not be the only couple there. It is also really nice they are open until 10:30. After living in the city for so long, sometimes it is hard to remember most places in the suburbs don&#39;t stay open as late.

Forget the typical katsu chicken, udon noodles, and tempura shrimp! Do you want authentic Japanese food where the Japanese locals eat?  The menu offered just slightly over or under ten &#34;Japanese comfort food dishes&#34; in I thought was smart (assuming the menu changes daily.) Sometimes simplicity is the best way to go and if you enjoy your meal YOU WILL BE BACK FOR MORE - just like a first date! I ordered &#34;today&#39;s Bento special&#34; and let me tell you it was not an ordinary &#34;WESTERN&#34; bento box. Forget the tiny pre sized square spaces on a tray for your blocks of salad, veggies, rice, and main entrée. The bento box was served on a dark wood tray with individual dishes for the sides. My bento box consisted of salad, miso soup, fried crab cakes (double yum) bathing in sauce, and Mackerel fish filleted just perfect. The natural salt off the Mackerel&#39;s skin paired perfectly with the white rice and enriched with the house dark sauce.  
Side note: I also thought it was interesting most Japanese diners ordered more cooked dishes rather than sushi then my eyes 

Atmosphere: Clean. I was extremely surprised to see so many Japanese diners on Monday/ lunch (11:45 am) in the middle of Schaumburg, Illinois. Sushi Schaumburg gem? I think so! Daruma offered private rooms lined with sliding doors demonstrating &#34;how its done in Japan!&#34; You may not care but I thought it was cute each dish was different from one another creating a assortment of delightful dish apparel. 

Service: friendly and knowledgeable. 

Price: $ - my bento dish was only $8.99~"

The place is down homey enough to tolerate kids well; our 2 year old loved munching on beefy potatoes as well as just plain, cold, cubed tofu. The young woman who waited on us was so accommodating about having a child with us. The place was packed with Japanese people of every age, kids and old people included, who were clearly just there to socialize and hang out.

For us (mom and dad), this place was sushi heaven. We love sushi but I&#39;m 8 months pregnant and I&#39;m not allowed to have anything raw (messed up, I know) but their unagi roll was so magnificent I forgot I was sticking to my prenatal diet. My husband went with more of the real deal and he loved each bite. A little plum wine and shochu put him in a great mood! The fish was sparkling fresh and they paid so much attention to form and detail that we forgot about the soy sauce we usually used to disguise the flavor of less-than-flawless fish and just ate the pieces as they were. It was such a great surprise to find this gem in the middle of the Whitest City in America (Schaumberg). Dinner was pricey (about $100 for the three and 8/9ths of us) but we didn&#39;t mind.

While people rave about their Italian beef I have always raved about their chicken sandwich. This past summer they stopped serving said sandwich and posted papers telling customers that it was temporary due to the vendor. I was pretty bummed. Finally after months of withdrawals they brought the sandwich back and I&#39;m sad to say it&#39;s a huge disappointment. The flavor of the chicken is not the same and neither is the quality. I&#39;ve had it 3 times from 3 different locations and it&#39;s been bad every time. Very sad . So now I have to find a new item to love. 
Besides the chicken sandwich my favorites are the crinkly fries, chocolate cake and the chopped salad. Portillos is always a good option for good tasting fast food. You can never go wrong with their hot dogs, well... Unless you go right before closing, they might be sold out by then.

And this location is as good as any.


Have yet to have something I didn&#39;t like in 30 years. 

Go for the 
Italian Beefs
Burgers
Hot Dogs
This location has Barnelli&#39;s which makes GREAT pastas as well.


Everything is good.  Don&#39;t even know why I am reviewing this."

Well last night my whole thoughts and feelings changed and not for the better. Everything on the menu has always been top notch and one of my favorite pastas is The Chicken Siciliano.  It&#39;s pasta with aioli, garlic, onion,pine nuts, broccoli, cheese and chicken.  Last night this dish was brought home for me and when I opened it the smell hit me first. It was LOADED with garlic.  Now I love garlic but this was like eating a jar of minced garlic.  No pine nuts. No cheese. I will never go back. The only thing that tastes good was the bread.  Very disappointing."

The jumbo chili cheese dog is amazing, the fries are incredible, the italian beef is out of this world (as long as its dipped with mozz and hot peppers lol), the salads are incredible, the soups are amazing, the pasta dishes are fresh, the ribs are fall off the bone tender, the chicken sandwich is a winner. 

Although my 2 favorite items are the chocolate cake shake and the burger. I get the cheeseburger with bacon and its chargrilled to perfection, the bun is soft, the bacon is crispy, it&#39;s just a classic burger. 

The chocolate cake shake is a MUST for anyone that has never had it. Please please please try it, you will not be disappointed."

While the food is decent the service is lacking and the time it takes to prepare an order for a family of 3 is often way too long. When I get my food home, the bags are usually ripped open &amp; falling apart because 
they&#39;re using cheap bags. You can&#39;t often read the register receipt because the heat from the food has lightened the ink, again using cheap material. (The bag &amp; receipt problem is something I&#39;ve experienced at every Portillo&#39;s I carried out food from over the years.) I thought the Portillo&#39;s name meant quality. Whatever corporation is running Portillo&#39;s now, needs to step up their game! It&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll visit this Portillo&#39;s again as they are out of chances. Fortunately there is a good Portillo&#39;s in Bloomingdale that is a lil further drive but worth it to get better service."

Like countless other kids growing up in the Chicago burbs with Portillos it is just Heartbreaking to watch this location go down the pooper. I can rate this honestly because we go every single week at various times. The drive thru at every location used to be run like a Swiss watch. Fast, friendly, and orders were accurate. Complete opposite now. The staffers are on some kinda work release program or act the part, it&#39;s all to common to hear &#34;N&#34; this and that, swearing all while your waiting and listening thru the window and your praying the orders right. Order a beef dipped hot with onion rings and coke, you get a chewy beef with stale bread thats been splashed with juice, a bag with three rings and a diet coke WTF... I&#39;ve found myself wondering if it&#39;s because Mr Portillo doesn&#39;t visit and observe locations anymore. I&#39;ve gone to Johnnys in Elmwood Park past couple times cause it&#39;s on my way home and I&#39;m just tired of the people and hit or miss food nowadays at this location. It wasn&#39;t until Mr Portillo sold his hard earned franchise that I realized how hard he worked to ensure the people he hired and food he served was just as high quality as he was.

They have the best American fast food of anyone of course. Their prices are way too high but it doesn&#39;t seem to hurt their business. They are always crowded. I particularly like the fact that there is a Barnelli&#39;s there. So there is a huge variety overall to select from. The food at both places is great. One of my favorites is the chopped salad. I also crave the panini sandwiches they have. Both are good. On the Portillos side everything is good. Their ribs can&#39;t be beat and all the sandwiches are awesome. Service is usually professional and friendly but the food preparation is slow. I am a regular here so I must like it!

I grew up just down the street from the original location on North Ave in Villa Park, which the design of is awful, where this one has a great design, large and plenty of seating. Being paired with a Barnellis gives this location many extra items to choose from. I wish I could give half stars, this would be a 3.5 review.

Atmosphere- very nice, big and expansive, cool theme, comfortable, many tables and many booths, often crowded showing its popularity (stay away on friday nights)
Service- this is by far their fall down, when things are busy I expect things to be not as quick, but in some cases it takes forever, sometimes over 20 minutes and in one instance over a half hour for a hamburger and fries, my shake had completely melted. This isnt however my most common complaint. I could not even keep track of all the times they have messed up an order, busy or not. Cheeseburger with no cheese, missing an order of fries, missing hotdog, missing polish, wrong topping on the hot dog. This is by far the most common problem.
Food- Portillos is Portillos because of the food, the chicago style hot dog and the italian beef are by far the populars and their mainstays, but I must say, their burgers are probably my favorite menu item
Drink- i do not tend to get much to drink as I live close by, but I have never been disappointed by their shakes, the chocolate cake shake being the obvious must try option, yummm
Prices- some things are overpriced and some things are well priced"

I get it extra dipped wet juicy with sweet peppers. I love the Maxwell Street Polish with relish and extra onion. They have some of the best hot dogs ever but I do enjoy redhots as well. Burgers are very good. I love the chicken club sandwich. Ribs are very good but I dont love the sauce and Id prefer ribs from a legit BBQ place anyday but theyre good. Chopped salads are awesome as well as some other salads. I can go on forever. OH! Loves me a vanilla shake from Portillo&#39;s as well!

The jumbo hot dog with everything on it is so filling. If you&#39;re a big appetite kind of person then get two. The onion rings are greasy and crunchy. Not bad for the price you pay. My friends got the burgers and fries. It&#39;s also filling. Unfortunately,  they found some hair in their fries. The chili is good and recommended.

Overall pretty good and affordable. Locals recommend the ribs. I&#39;ll try it out on my next visit."

I liked the design of the building with the 60&#39;s theme.  I first ordered the portillo&#39;s hot dog chicago style, I shared one with my parents and it was so good we downed the hot dog in minutes.  The portillo hot dog has a juicy dog with pickles, tomato, hot pepper.  It was great!

Next, I tried the famous italian beef sandwhich.  The italian beef was dipped in gravy ( must do, so good!) and it came with hot peppers.  When I first saw the italian beef sandwhich and it was greasy, I knew it was going to be good.  The first bite into the dog was juicy, powerful flavor, and all around satisfying.  I could not wait to stuff down the dog, the beef tasted extra flavorful after being dipped in gravy, and hot peppers gave a nice kick to the beef.  The hot peppers were not too spicy, it was more of a medium spice.  If you like a little bit of spice in your food, def. get it.  All in all, I had a great experience in this place and would definitely come back if I am around the area again."

We ate inside because we just purchased a new car and I didn&#39;t want that awesome new car smell to be replaced with whiffs of surprise meat. 

Service inside was mega friendly and fast. My husband and I split a Chicago hot dog, cheese fries and a chopped salad. This is the first time I&#39;ve ordered a salad at Portillo&#39;s, but over the course of a month TWO random patients at my place of employment have asked me if I&#39;ve tried it, so I had too. It&#39;s even more random considering the nearest Portillo&#39;s is over an hour away. Anyway, the chopped salad was awesome with pasta in it and very filling. Hot dog and cheese fries are amazing always.

The set-up is a little screwy, in my opinion. We had to order and pay for the salad at one counter and then order and pay for the hot dog and cheese fries at another. I tried to order coleslaw but was told I had to order it at the other counter but I already made two transactions so decided I didn&#39;t need coleslaw. It was comical when we tried to leave because we had to get drink refills at one counter and then got sent to the other for take-out boxes. In summary, make sure you look at the menus thoroughly so you can order at the appropriate counter."

They questioned me multiple times if someone read my order back to me and I confirmed. Of course I did. They would not take the food back and insisted that my order was right (the total charged to my card wasn&#39;t even the total they gave me at the window!). Not only would they not take the food back that clearly wasn&#39;t mine... they even wanted to charge me for my correct order! Terrible, just terrible. Definitely not the way to treat a customer.

Then yesterday afternoon I started feeling awful. Then really sick. Then I continued to spew up until the wee hours of the morning, when I finally ended up at the ER because things were just getting worse.


Thanks for the crappy sandwich and the hospital bill. I didn&#39;t even get a sponge bath from a hot nurse. It was probably because of the whole &#39; my body is trying to turn itself out through the mouth&#39; thing i had going on. Which reminds me, wasn&#39;t inside out boy on liquid television?

Upon arriving at our friends house to sit down and eat, we noticed that my fruit and poppy salad&#39;s dressing and the chopped salad&#39;s house dressing was nowhere to be found. We also noticed we receive no bread, but DID get four containers of Parmesan cheese. 

I called the restaurant and spoke with an associate who then directed me to Scott, the &#34;manager&#34;. I explained the situation to Scott who lacks customer service skills. He made remarks like &#34;And the meal was ruined because you didn&#39;t get the bread, right?&#34; No, the meal is ruined because there&#39;s no dressing genius. 

He asked if we would be coming back to get the dressings, and I explained we weren&#39;t driving from Bartlett back to Glendale Heights for dressing for a salad. He asked for my address so he could send a voucher for two free salads, which was really nice...except that was three weeks ago and it never came.

Eileen is also another staff member who never fails to say hello and catch up each time she&#39;s working and we are there.  Jason is a manager at Barnelli&#39;s and is always so helpful and kind when ever we are there.  And then there is Sergio, another staff member who always says hello to my kids when we are there and always makes sure to tell our little one to eat her food so she can grow up big and strong.

Not bad, not bad at all. All the toppings work very well together but it becomes more like a sandwich. As an East Coast guy I&#39;ll stick with Texas wieners. With that said, the chili cheese dog was a complete disappointment. The bun was the predominant taste and texture and that shouldn&#39;t be the case. 

The Italian beef sandwich on the other hand is legit. I could eat them all day! And the extra gravy made good, better. An absolutely messy eat, but that just added to the experience. 

In closing, the chocolate cake shake was heaven in a cup!"

Any Portillo&#39;s location that has a Barnelli&#39;s location is always better in my book, because you have so many more options. Do I feel like stuffing my face with a cheeseburger (which, if you haven&#39;t had, you must. They are cooked really well and don&#39;t look like those poor excuses for a hamburger that McD&#39;s tries to pass off.) or maybe a big Italian beef sammich or a dog. Or maybe I&#39;ll be classy and order some baked mostacholi (don&#39;t judge me on my definition of classy). 

They also have some really great salads. I&#39;m not a salad person as I typically don&#39;t think of it as a full meal, but their options really could suffice as such. My mom and I are fans of the strawberry poppy-seed salad with chicken. That&#39;ll fill you up nice and good. It&#39;s really fresh. It&#39;s possible it&#39;s still high on calories, but the way I see it, I&#39;m getting my fill of fruit, so where&#39;s the problem?

There customer service is really good and the dinning environment is well decorated with antique decor.  I seem to find a different antique to catch my attention every time I go.

Everytime I go visit, I stop at Portillo&#39;s for their Italian Beef and Chicago dogs.

The place looks like a chain and it is, but a small one. The buildings are large with lots of seating. At busy times, every seat it filled, but they open quickly. 

They have a variety of options to choose. You walk up to a counter and they write your order on a paper bag, then proceed down to the other end and enjoy the show. 

Most locations have a person at this point who get all the compents of your order together and then yells your numbers. You will usually get a notice like &#34;Number 59, You&#39;re so fine!&#34;. 

This is a great place to go to for a quick bite of two Chicago classics.

Italian Beef - many ways to order. Variety of sizes also. You can go dry, wet (juice poured on), or dipped (dunked in the beef juice). With or without Gardiner (a hot pepper/celery mixture) and cheese (optional). I usually go with a dipped beef, gardiner, mozz . It&#39;s de-lish!

Now onto the dogs,

The Chicago Dog - It&#39;s looks like a crazy cluster f*** of an item but it works! Get one for yourself or to split, but get atleast one before you leave!

If you are one the floor immobilzed from the food, go back for some desert. Their chocolate cake is amazing, Very moist and great icing. If you like shakes, get the chocolate cake shake!"

Not even three hours before this experience I had food from another Portillo&#39;s in Naperville.

I went out to this one with a group of 12 and it was not hard to find seating which surprised me. There was plenty of space and the theme of this particular restaurant was a sort of speakeasy type thing. Since Portillo&#39;s doesn&#39;t necessarily appeal to the vegetarian persuasion there was a pasta place in the same building that my sister and a few cousins tried out. The food was exceptional as always. I wish California&#39;s fast food french fries came with cheese to dip! I got an Italian Sausage and a Chocolate Cake Shake. You cannot find the chocolate cake shake anywhere else so I would recommend it. They put a slice of chocolate cake into a blender and blend it up into the milkshake!

I love that they have a Barnelli&#39;s Pasta Bowl attached but unfortunately, my BF and I didn&#39;t go with the Barnelli&#39;s offering on our trip. 

We went after not being fulfilled at a Vietnamese restaurant across the street and just wanted to grab a quick bite in order to make it to the movies on time. Too bad the drive through was sooo backed up that you could barely turn in from the street. Inside was considerably less crowded and I attribute that to the raining buckets weather. My BF and I ordered. I got cheese fries and a chocolate cake slice, he got a hot dog with Ketchup, Mustard, and sport peppers (he&#39;s not a Chicago style dog guy :( ), fries, and a soda. Anyway, there were 31 employees in the Portillo&#39;s kitchen, which really impressed me with everyone working harmoniously in such close quarters, BUT we saw people who ordered way after us get there food ahead of us over and over as our bag (had our order number on it) sat under the fry heat lamps while my cake and bf&#39;s soda sat on a tray waiting. After 15 minutes of staring, finally, I see the manager yell to put our bag on the tray. We are thankful and race to the car to eat and drive to the movies. 

Sadly, the hot dog my bf got was either made incorrectly or not meant to be his dog and had onions (GROSS!) with no hot peppers. He scarfed it down anyway because we were both hungry and in a hurry. The chocolate cake was good but I think the slice was smaller than other Portillo&#39;s slices but the fries were downright awful. Obviously the fry bin left overs as they were all tiny little scrimpy fries and were so dried out that they were hollow, YES- hollow. I was quite sad. 

So because of this, I can only give this place 3 stars. If I were in the area, I&#39;d go back on a less busy day or just go straight to the Barnelli&#39;s side."

-There&#39;s a Barnelli&#39;s pasta bowl attached, which has a great rigatoni a la vodka. Also, the ceasar salad. I love this salad. So. Much.
-They use real dishes (at Barnelli&#39;s) and give you a small side of bread with pastas and salads. They switched to a quarter loaf, but will usually give you two if you ask.
-The Portillo&#39;s side is delicious also. The best hamburgers and fries ever. Really good.
-I kinda love how crazy the decor is. Love the 20&#39;s theme. When I was a kid, I was really scared of the mannequin in the phone booth. Still weird, but now I miss it when I go to other Portillo&#39;s."

Went here 3/1 later afternoon through evening to visit a friend. All Portillo&#39;s are great meeting places for unrushed casual dining. Anyway, stopped to use restroom on my way out. A young female worker must have been in a hurry since she barely washed her hands. Seriously, maybe 5 seconds of water, no soap on her finder tips and then she patted down her hair. Ewwwwww. Manager - please teach your employees to sing the &#34;ABC&#34; song and use some soap before returning behind the counter. EVEN if she&#39;s a cashier giving our change, well, think about it.

Their chocolate cake is so moist but the frosting is way too sweet, and their strawberry shortcake.....well that was just disappointing. They used watered down strawberry jam....ugh!

But with the amount of staff they have on hand, why do you have to wait over 10 minutes for your food!? To me, it&#39;s just not worth it."

On the plus side Portillo&#39;s uses excellent quality ingredients and doesn&#39;t skimp, their standard recipe are very solid as well. The downside to Portillo&#39;s is that the meal is generally more expensive than most Chicago style fast food places, and perhaps more importantly, because of the large number of employees that work in an average day, things are made slightly differently from person to person.

Moving on to the basics of Portillos, I&#39;m going to go over two items. Their standard Hot Dog and Jumbo hot dog. The stock portillo&#39;s hot dog is thin and has a nice flavor, it generally has all the juices intact after cooking. How they&#39;re prepared varies greatly, I&#39;ve seen hot dogs with just the right amount of mustard, relish and onion. I&#39;ve also seen hot dogs with too much mustard, (or too little), too much relish (or too little) and every combination in-between. This leads to Portilo&#39;s visits often being a gamble if you want a great hot dog. Usually you get a good one, but often times you get one that&#39;s just a little off. I&#39;m also not a fan of the giant pickle slice they include as it unbalances the hot dog flavor just a smidge. The jumbo hot dog suffers similar issues with condiment application, but is quite a bit thicker and the extra beef can balance out an over-saturated with mustard hot dog.

As far as their other menu items their burgers, Maxwell street polish&#39;s and fries are usually good, and have the tendency to be great, but it&#39;s a bit of a gamble.

Portillo&#39;s is a place capable of making five star food, but you don&#39;t get that experience every time. That&#39;s why I rate it four stars."

First time we ordered kung pow chicken, appetizer sampler for two, and the combination fried rice, the second time we got the same thing but with General Tso&#39;s chicken. 
The ingredients were fresh, the veggies were crispy. The only thing I was disappointed about is we got medium spicy kung pow and I felt it wasn&#39;t spicy. So we upped it and went spicy on the General Tso&#39;s and I thought it was perfect. I would like to keep trying different things on their menu , but if I ever get kung pow chicken again. I&#39;ll go spicy instead of medium spicy. 
I definitely recommend this small seemingly hole in the wall location. It looks like a family business which is awesome and they offer online ordering for pick up and delivery. The inside has only a few tables, so unless they aren&#39;t busy plan on getting your order to go."

I &#34;get&#34; the idea of family business and all, but I&#39;m still uncomfortable when an owner&#39;s 10 year old kid runs the registers at these places.  (Because, erm, labor laws?)

Chicken w/Broccoli - 3.5/5
Just okay...kind of bland, but moist enough.

Shrimp Lo Mein - 3/5
Reeeeally dry (though a nuke the next day helped) and a little skimpy on the shrimp. For $9, I expected a few more. The shrimp were relatively large, though, and tail-off.

Egg roll 
Tasted standard - it was fine.

Our total was $20. There&#39;s enough for leftovers.

Overall, it was just OK. While I&#39;m glad I finally tried China Star, there are closer places to my abode that have tastier Chinese fare."

Time will tell how this fares with me. 

Initially I took a shot at this place because it was close and I had a coupon. Also I just tried Mandarin Bistro last week and wanted to switch it up. 

Night and day difference. I&#39;m comparing the cashew chicken in particular. Mandarin Bistro hit it on the head while China star leaves so much to be desired. The devil is in the details and China star like another review mentioned is on par with Panda Express. I feel like the dish from China star was 90% filler and 10% other bland flavors. 

Needless to say I won&#39;t be back here for this &#34;Chinese food&#34;."

Instead driver calls and hangs up on us 4 times because he doesn&#39;t know how to get in our building. I speak to someone at this restaurant after and his response was &#34;I wrote it on the receipt.&#34; He wrote a # on the receipt with no directions. Driver said exactly &#34;I not know what # is?&#34; This is not the first time this has happened either but we believe in giving places multiple chances.

I got the General TSO Chicken (my classic favorite at just about any Chinese restaurant). Flavors were pretty good, wish it had a little more sauce.

They give you the average amount of rice. Condiments are out in the open so they&#39;re not stingy with them as most Chinese restaurants closer to the city. I had a mango smoothie first time I came here which was pretty good.

He had a younger sister there too and she was answering the phone. I appreciate seeing kids being taught to work and being instilled great values at a young age. 

Now on to the food i ordered fried rice, orange chicken and crab rangoon. The rice was good it had large shrimp in it, which you usually dont see in Chinese restaurants but i do think it could have used some egg in it, as there was none.  The order of crab rangoon was larger than typical,  so i liked that however,  i didnt really taste much crab. The orange chicken was good the sauce had a subtle spicy kick which i liked, no complaints there. Overall the food was alright, id come back again."

I ordered shrimp fried rice, crab rangoon and a breaded shrimp thing (don&#39;t remember the name) and most of it was pretty bland. The fried rice needed a bit more seasoning, I thought maybe the soy sauce was in there but more ginger and garlic or something might be a good idea. 

The sauce in the shrimp stuff was standard brown sauce, not mind-blowing, just on par with every other strip mall Chinese place.

Egg rolls - Rather blah. Not bad, just not very tasty either.

Crab Rangoon - Pretty tasty, and each piece was large.

Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken - Not a fan of the flavor of the sauce, plus it was very thin. The chicken was a little over fried as well.

Kung Pao Chicken - Nice flavor; not overly spicy. I enjoyed it even though it had a ton of veggies including mushrooms which I do not care for.

Chicken &amp; Broccoli - The best dish of them all. The chicken was tender, the sauce was tasty, and the broccoli was pretty decent (although I&#39;d like it more if it was cooked slightly longer).

They also included a ton of rice which was nice. And the rice was a nice jasmine sticky variety. It was cooked perfectly."

The order was taken by a child maybe 12 years old. I went to pick up my order and the child was focusing more on his friend that was sitting down at a table. When I got home and unpacked everything my food that I ordered was not there. Being this was the first item I ordered I didn&#39;t understand. I was furious. I called back and talked to a adult. She said I didn&#39;t get charged for that item. She said to come back and she will make my item that was forgotten for a charge. I told her I&#39;m not coming back and plus how can you charge me to come back when you made the mistake. I understand I didn&#39;t get charged but they made the mistake. When I told her she shouldn&#39;t have a child take the orders specially when I experienced him spending more time talking to his friend. She apologized but she still has to charge me. I told her I will not becoming back and she repeated I will still have to charge you. It didn&#39;t faze her. Business 101 when you make a mistake you make it up some how not agitate your customers. I guess the sign on there door about the good reviews on Yelp was all she was concerned about. This has nothing to do with the food it&#39;s the customer service. Hire an adult and let your kids be a kid. Maybe your order taking would improve. A more simpathetic apology  is needed before I would consider coming back.

And there were only 3 tables occupied on the weekend night. Or maybe the service explained it all. 

Walking out of the door, we weren&#39;t so sure if we would come back. But considering the fantastic food here, we were settled with &#34;maybe next time we can try to do a carryout instead of a dine-in.&#34;"

I&#39;ve been here about four or five times. Tonight I had terrible service. Our waiter was so rude. We asked for a table for four people because we were having friends meet us there. Our friends were running about 45 minuets behind so, we decided to order without them. We told the waiter that they might not make it because I thought we were going to be done eating by the time they got there. When we informed her she rolled her eyes and proceeded to remove their water and utensils from the table like it was the BIGGEST inconvenience for her. We also were using the groupon and so were my friends. I understand that the groupon says one per table and I&#39;m not arguing with her. But we were done and paid before they even ordered. She made a point to tell us that she was doing us a favor by accepting it. The tables are all in one long row. What&#39;s the difference if we sat at two different tables next to each other. 

Their food is really delicious but, there service is terrible and I will never go back here."

4 stars for the cleanliness and organization, fast and friendly service, great tasting food and half star for value. 

The dishes were literally good for 1 person (a skinny to average one). The portions are actually for a person counting calories because it&#39;s half of what i would usually eat but then again I&#39;m a big girl in a small to medium frame body. Anywho, although we loved our food, we were not totally full after finishing our dinners. Here are the dishes we had:
PANANG CRISPY NOODLES $12 crispy thick deep fried noodles with PANANG (curry) chicken on top. Delish!!!! 
JADED THAI FRIED RICE $11 curry fried rice with 4 jumbo shrimp and imitation crab meat. Very good dish and a meal on its own. 
RED CURRY THAI CHICKEN $12 I wish the sauce was thicker but it was really good. A perfect amalgam of sweet and spicy in coconut base. Very good!  

I think it&#39;s pretty pricey but the taste was great so I really can&#39;t complain. I&#39;m just so used to eating my face off til I&#39;m full to my neck. This place has the diet portion. Lol."

I&#39;ve been here several times before. Their food is delicious - one of my favorite places to dine. We both enjoyed Penang Curry with Chicken. It was perfect. Even the spicy level - we both like our food spicy, but don&#39;t want to be uncomfortable. Had the perfect amount of heat.

Our waitress/hostess seemed to be really annoyed we were there. We appeared to be the first customers of the evening. We were barely greeted, and seemed completely indifferent that we were there. We thought maybe it was just an off night and tried to brush it off, but then the next group was greeted enthusiastically and with a smile. That was even more off putting.

We will probably try it again - I&#39;ve enjoyed lunch there several times, but we were very disappointed that the service was so off-putting. Otherwise, this would be a favorite.

Side note - they had a lot of gluten-free and dairy-free options and the brown and red ride was delicious."

Overall I felt their menu was lacking in essential Thai items such as papaya salad. I think that&#39;s a staple item any thai restaurant should have. Whatever, so I ordered carryout and was greeted by the less than enthused hostess/cashier.

The most important thing is the food, and i ordered the Lad Nar, and although I didnt expect it to be better than my mother&#39;s homemade version, I found it really lacking in flavor and the gravy was too runny. Even lime and siracha couldnt help. Hubby did enjoy his sweet and sour chicken and comment how they actually used real chicken pieces unlike others.

Since its around 10 mins from me, I would consider it again but it cant be my spot as i need papaya salad when i crave Thai food. I also found it too be a bit pricey compared to others."

I mean &#34;Crab Rangoon,&#34; &#34;Edamame,&#34; &#34;Shumai&#34; on the menu as appetizers?  And no mango with sticky rice option as dessert?? Really strange.

However, the food was pretty good.  My fiancee ordered the Jaded Thai fried rice.  Highly recommended.  The curry powder has great flavor. We could just keep eating more of it.  I ordered the Pad Woonsen, which was really good too, but I asked for them to make it spicy.  There are 4 levels (mild, medium, hot, and extra hot).  I like spicy, so I thought I could handle hot.  My mouth was on fire.  Personally will need to scale it back next time.  So whatever spice they&#39;re using is legit if you&#39;re into spicy foods.

While most of the veggies (broccoli, snap peas, bean sprouts, cucumbers, zucchini) were fresh, I could tell with the fried rice that they use those mixed, chopped corn, green beans, carrots that come frozen.  That was slightly disappointing, but wouldn&#39;t deter me from coming again.

Nice change up for the suburbs."

The location is a little out of the way, but it is worth bumbling around to get to it. Inside is nice decor and it looks very clean and well maintained. The staff is a dream too. So nice, always smiling, and very quick. They also leave you alone so you can actually enjoy your dinner without someone in your face every two seconds; their waitress timing is perfect.

The food was pretty darn good as well. I ordered the pad thai with tofu. It was not too oily or too dry. The flavor was good too. Some places have artificial tasting pad thai but it was not the case here. My husband ordered pad see ew. He said it was the best he has ever had. When I tried it it tasted great.

You know those days when you&#39;re kinda like, yeah...I guess...whatever?  That was me. Headed out for casual dinner with one of my sister&#39;s and I wanted to see and I wanted to eat dinner, but I was just like whatever when it came to the food. 

That all changed when we walked in the door. 

The restaurant was almost full with a wide variety of people (always a good sign!) and I didn&#39;t want to sit near the door - we sat near the door. No worries though, it was cozy warm without being too hot all evening. Nice!  

We chose the combination appetizer which was probably too much for the two of us. My favorite part was the shrimp dumplings. They were lightly fried and absolutely delicious!  The mini eggs rolls had shrimp and were very tasty as well. And the crab Rangoon were crisp, but the filling was more like a smear of cream cheese with some scallions inside. Those crispy nuggets were my only real letdown. 

My water glass was constantly refilled over the course of the evening and the owner was lovely. Just extra nice the entire time. I couldn&#39;t decide (remember, I don&#39;t think I wanted Thai food) so I choose sweet and sour shrimp. Lightly breaded in a knock your socks off sauce with plenty of pineapple. Once I was a bite or two in, then I knew that I wanted Thai food. Oh and that I wanted to come back. Right away. Thanks Yelpers for continuing to lead me in the tastiest directions!"

Then she sat us,  I asked for two high chairs and she walked away (away from the high chairs). She wasn&#39;t busy,  just rude. 

Food was fine, I would prefer to go elsewhere but since it&#39;s the closest to us it feeds the Thai craving. Got the green curry and it was good, their pad see ew is good but again small in portion for the price. Check for a groupon,  they normally have one."

Jaded Thai is a small restaurant in a strip mall but don&#39;t let that fool you.  I came here for lunch for a coworker&#39;s birthday and boy, do they have great lunch specials!  For about $7-$8 you get a small appetizer, soup, and entree.  The appetizer and soup change on a daily basis; the ones I had when I came were spring rolls and wonton soup.  I wouldn&#39;t say the spring rolls were the best but they were decent. They would have been better if they were soaked less in sweet and sour sauce but eh, that&#39;s OK since I still devoured them!  

For my entree, I ordered the chicken Pad Thai (yes, I know that&#39;s boring) and everything about it was very good.  The flavor was spot on as well as the chicken and egg to noodle ratio, which is super important to me (mainly because I&#39;m greedy and love protein heh).  I like that the Pad Thai wasn&#39;t too artificially orange colored or drenched in sauce.  I definitely recommend coming here for the food and service.

June 2015 update:. Jaded Thai has NOW added the kitchen closing a half hour early on their door. It used to just be on their menu and website in very small print. Make no mistake, we did not receive any offer of carryout food or anything resembling Asian Nice in our Door Locked in our face experience, and we talked to them.  
Go one strip mall NW to Ichef where they at least serve alcohol, and is quieter.
--------

I WISH Yelp would bring back the trend review charts, because the trend here is not good. We are pretty sure that they saw us pull in the parking lot because when we drove in, the sign was ON, but when we got out of the car the sign was off.

We went to the door since they obviously saw us and they told us they close the kitchen at 9:00 (and LOCK the door). Now their website AND door SAYS they are open till 9:30 but there is also a small note when you open the website up that says they close the kitchen a half hour earlier. So BEWARE, Jaded Thai closes at 9:00pm on a Saturday night. 
And BEWARE, NObody else was eating here at 9pm on a Saturday night.

COMPLETELY empty and locked out, but fortunately we remembered how good Ichef is in the next mall just NorthWest on Algonquin ( 2 minutes away ;~). 
Open, REALLY open, until 10:00pm on a Saturday night. 
Order off the Chinese menu and you won&#39;t be hungry like you would be at Jaded Thai. Wonderful Song Fish soup for 2, egg rolls, stir fried pork long beans and one of the best cumin lambs in town maybe better than Yu&#39;s, 2 LARGE glasses of an ok enuf $5 Merlot (No alcohol@JadedEarlySatNightClose), $46 plus tip and BIG leftovers. SCORE!

Very disappointing wasted drive to Jaded Thai, but saved by Ichef.
So make a reservation at 8:59 if you want to eat at the 9:30pm &#34;closing&#34;Jaded Thai on a Saturday night, or better yet reconsider your choice because Sir Thai in Palatine is better anyway and MUCH quieter, and even better is the BYOB! Thai Little Home Cafe on Golf in Arlington Heights, 638 E Gold road, just East off Algonquin Rd.

Our waitress came within a few minutes and looked ready to take our order. She was the only one taking orders, ringing up checks for the whole place. There was another lady who would bring out food, but for the most part, I would consider them under-staffed. 

We placed our entire order and the appetizer came out within a few minutes. We started off with chicken satay, which was delightful. They don&#39;t skimp on the peanut sauce, which I respect. 

Our entrees took a while to come out, probably close to 25 minutes after our appetizers. I ordered the pork Pad See Ew. It was great. I think the portion size was good for one person but I&#39;m use to Asian food being way overdone and good enough to share. I wouldn&#39;t consider these sharing plates. 

To end, we got the fried bananas. I definitely wouldn&#39;t order them again. They are missing honey, or something to give a little more flavor. They come with the same pickled cucumbers that came with the chicken satay which threw me off a bit. Not worth it though. 

We had a Groupon (paid $11 for $20 worth of food) and paid an additional $9 plus tip. Not bad, I will definitely be back here for the great entrees!"

We were in the mood for spicy so we went with a couple of hot dishes.  They only reason this wasn&#39;t a five star experience was the fact that there was a real lack of heat.  I understand though, they have to cater to their clientele and heat levels are really relative to the person eating it.

I saw several people I know write excellent reviews for this restaurant and bookmarked it a few weeks ago. It&#39;s not terribly far from home, so I knew I could make my way over one of these days. 

I&#39;ve been home for the past 2 weeks recovering from surgery and tonight was my first adventure out of the house except for work the past two days. My sis and I had plans for dinner tonight but we didn&#39;t know where we were going so after chatting a while and not getting anywhere, I said, lets just go! We&#39;ll find something. I didn&#39;t feel like driving (which like never happens but I have been pretty tired the past few days) so my sis drove tonight. I was the navigator. She said, you tell me which way to go, and I&#39;ll follow your instructions. Yippee!! I get to pick the place! So I tell her to turn right, make a left here, make a right there and before you know it, we&#39;re headed North on Barrington Road, so I pull up some restaurants in this direction and Jaded Thai pops up! Ok, we have a destination! 

We pull in the parking lot on the west end and notice there are several other restaurants in this strip mall, so we drove down the full strip to see what else there might be here for future reference or if we want to change our minds (just like a couple of women might do on a whim), and we end up parking between Jaded Thai and Lily&#39;s Mexican restaurant. Now, I don&#39;t have a particular taste for anything as I haven&#39;t had much of an appetite and my sister doesn&#39;t want to be at fault if she picks either place and it sucks, so she stands by my door as I&#39;m struggling my way out of her car, and waits there so she can follow me to whichever of these two restaurants I walk to. I laughed at her like the goof that she is and said, well, we were heading to Jaded Thai so lets just go there and we walk over. 

As we walk in, I noticed their restaurant is pretty busy. I was nervous for a second that we might have to wait for a table and I&#39;m not much for standing around in my condition, but luckily they have more tables in this place than you would think looking from outside. 

We are seated at a 2-top table right away and I&#39;m thinking I HATE 2-top tables. They are never big enough and were always struggling to fit our drinks, food, side plates and our phones (of course!) but I was happy to find the 2-top was plenty spacious for our dining needs. 

We&#39;re immediately served ice cold water and given our menus. They are not the most extensive menus but they have plenty of options. It&#39;s very simply laid out. For example, they list all your entree options like &#34;garlic, ginger, sweet &amp; sour&#34; and then you can pick if you want tofu, chicken, beef, or shrimp. I love this! Simple yet customizable. Right up my alley! I love ginger like I love chocolate, so I of course select the Ginger Chicken. My sis, well, I&#39;ll let her tell you herself about her meal but she loved it! We also shared their combination appetizer. PERFECT FOR SHARING UP TO 4 PEOPLE!! You receive 4 each: crab Rangoon, mini egg rolls and shrimp dumpling. It was more than enough for the 2 of us and just enough for 4 people to share. Their dipping sauce was wonderful. The egg rolls were wrapped tight and packed with flavor. The shrimp dumpling did not look like something I would normally pick up to taste but were FANTASTIC! And the crab Rangoon was pretty standard. Oh, did I mention the app was only $7?!

My Ginger chicken was very, very good! I was a pain and ordered it without mushrooms, easy onions and extra bell peppers (they did charge me an extra $1 for the extra peppers). The chicken was plentiful. Beautiful white meat pieces of chicken and had plenty of sauce. It was served with some steamed rice to tie it all together. 

What I love about Thai food is that it&#39;s not greasy or heavy like Chinese food. I ate plenty of food for dinner tonight. I only ate about 1/3 or half of my dinner so I have some leftovers for lunch tomorrow and it cost me about $18 out the door. We both skipped the soda and stuck to good ole H2O but do keep in mind they serve soda by the can at $1.50 each: coke, diet coke and sprite only. Personally, I prefer my soda from a can anywhere I go because I know exactly what I&#39;m getting and I&#39;m not concerned that the lines haven&#39;t been cleaned or I&#39;m getting some generic crap soda pop. 

We will definitely be back! I have a feeling now that we like Jaded Thai so much, were unlikely to try any of the other places in the strip mall but anything is possible. 

Ps. They&#39;re closed on Sundays!"

Pad Thai with tofu $7.50- So good! The sauce is perfection and the whole dish is just amazing! Big portion! I like to think of myself as a pad thai specialist and this has the perfect combination of flavor and freshness.

I make special requests and they are really good about accommodating whatever I need. They do it correctly and in a really positive way which makes me not feel so horrible for asking no this and that. The people at Jaded Thai are always very friendly when I go in for my takeout. Honestly, it&#39;s the best thai I&#39;ve had in awhile and worth driving out of my way to swing by."

Let&#39;s start off with what we have tried so far, Pad Se-ew, Pad Thai, Green Curry and Red Curry.  the Pad Se-ew was not good at all, very dry and bland, which is not what any Thai dish should be.  the Pad Thai was not very appetizing either, with them masquerading a ton of cabbage in with the noodles.  almost felt like they were trying to cut back on the noodles and subbing cabbage in as a replacement.  the flavor wasn&#39;t there either and we ended up not eating more than a quarter of the dish.

The good news is that the Green Curry was pretty tasty, but only about 6 quarter sized pieces of pork in the broth.  There was also no option for noodles with the Curry, which is how I grew up eating it.  I had also ordered it spicy, but it wasn&#39;t very spicy at all.  The Red Curry was also pretty good, but as with the Green Curry, the same issues.

Overall, this place is the pretty standard Americanized Thai food menu, along with including chopsticks in the to go bag... (don&#39;t eat Thai food with chopsticks!!!  use a Spoon and Fork!).  If I don&#39;t feel like going too far for Thai food I may order from here again, but at the same time, this place is also somewhat pricey for what they offer."

The unique coconut milk taste is good. Hot chili with chicken is average. A bit to many on the bamboo shoots but the chili sauce is pretty tasty.

The first time I had Thai food I thought I could order a spicy dish but it turns out &#34;fairly spicy&#34; in my world means &#34;not spicy&#34; in the Thai food world.  So this time I went with a non-spicy Rama with chicken which is chicken and broccoli in a peanut sauce.  It was very good and I think next time I could get something a little more spicy.

The only complaint I have is that we had to sit at a table right next to the door and big windows and it was maybe 5 degrees outside.  That made for a very cold dinner.  We had a party of three and when we asked if we could sit at a different table the hostess  wouldn&#39;t let us push two tables of two together even though there were only 2 other groups in the whole restaurant."

Looove the Jaded Thai salad (steamed broccoli, spinach, carrot, tomato, topped with hot peanut sauce). It&#39;s better when you eat in -- way more peanut sauce. I want that goodness totally smothering the green stuff. It&#39;s basically like a mini popeye dish without the protein, and you get a very good portion for only $2.50.

They were willing to make the spring roll without crab meat for me, and it was fantastic! Pad thai was great too. The noodles were a bit firmer than what I prefer, but I still enjoyed it. And at $7.50 for the tofu pad thai, it&#39;s $1.50 cheaper than at most thai restaurants in the area.

One thing: the online ordering system had a lot of issues when I tried to use it a month or two ago, so I&#39;d recommend calling. I couldn&#39;t enter my phone number, and it said it was down for maintenance when I tried to submit. It also had some limitations such as no online payment if you&#39;re picking up the order. Argh! Kind of wish they&#39;d just use GrubHub (although I totally don&#39;t blame them for not using it, as it charges restaurants an insanely high average of 15% off every order).

Note: They sometimes run deals on their FB page."

The interior is less traditional than many you&#39;d find - more upscale looking, like Oiishi Thai. Service was alright but could&#39;ve been a bit faster. Prices are fairly typical for a Thai restaurant, which is cheaper than Japanese but more than Chinese.

The shrimp mangtra was quite good, like the fried shrimp rolls you&#39;d get at a dim sum restaurant. The spinach adds a nice twist to the roll which is enhanced by the sweet and sour sauce.

The shrimp pad thai is alright, neither the best nor the worst I&#39;ve had but pretty enjoyable. I haven&#39;t found too many pad thais that were really that good in the suburbs so this would probably be one of the best you can find locally.

The pad tung tak was a bit disappointing for me. I wasn&#39;t crazy about the seafood selection nor the amount of salt in the dish. Perhaps I&#39;m just spoiled by the excellent noodle dishes at Gumrai Thai.

The mussels delight has a decent broth but uses the standard mussels you&#39;d find in an asian buffet rather then PEI mussels. Oddly, there is a lack of places that serve gourmet mussel or clam dishes in the northwest suburbs (probably because of the lack of French or Belgian restaurants). Even with that scarcity, I&#39;m not sure this dish is worth a special trip here -- maybe Chef Ping&#39;s clam with black bean sauce is worth a trip, but the restaurant is always very busy."

The service here was the slowest I&#39;ve even encountered.  There were only two servers, who were also bussing the tables, answering the phones, making the checks, and paying bills.  For a Fri night, it was ridiculous that they&#39;d only have two people doing everything.  We had to flag one of them down just to get our order taken, after 10 min of waiting.  Another table sent their little girl to go up to one of them as she was refilling our water to say &#34;We&#39;re ready to order now....&#34;   That family was there when we got there, so I have no idea how long they actually waited before sending the little girl.  But when you have to be bothered to try to place an order, you know it&#39;s bad.

Now on to the food.  It was just ok.  My mom was getting over a cold so we ordered some soup and the only way I can describe it is like home-made food where you just leave all the crap in the food that you&#39;re supposed to take out before serving it.  But of us were shocked when we bit into huge chunks of ginger.  They also had some tough, fibrous, ingredient in there.... sort of like I was chewing bark.  The image I&#39;m trying to convey here is akin to when you make chili, but then leave the bay leaves in there and serve it to people.... it&#39;s just not right.  Some things need to be removed after cooking.

My mom ordered Green Curry and I had Panang Curry.  I thought the Green Curry was too sweet for my liking.  The Panang Curry wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t great.  

They need to hire more staff and get their food in check.  Overall, I won&#39;t be back here for dinner.  IF I come back here, it&#39;ll only be for lunch....and for carry-out."

My second visit was today, after enough time had passed between eating their level 5 spiciest possible version Spicy Basil Tofu and feeling confident that I could handle another dose after not blowing my butt hole out the first time around. Yeah, you know what I&#39;m talking about people. Don&#39;t pretend. 


Anyway, I know what you guys are thinking. Thai take-out for your B-Day, Candice? But certainly you must have fabulous b-day plans beyond gauging if your digestive system can handle the heat, a yacht party at the very least? 

No. Not this year. This year I did the unspeakable &#39;adult&#39; thing that I said I&#39;d never do and worked through my birthday. Was it my first choice in birthday celebration options? No, but I also didn&#39;t mind it as much as I had envisioned in year&#39;s past. Sort of an embarrassment of riches when you truly love your J-O-B. Plus, this was the first year in almost a decade that my birthday fell on a weekend... and of course I was kind of sick for it. 

So, this year I opted to stay in, put my time in to the daily grind, pick up a cake, 2 chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of $7.99 wine at Whole Foods,  head to Hoffman Estates for take-out Thai from a place I&#39;ve had bookmarked for about 7 months and then run to Walgreens while I wait so I can grab some cough drops, then head back, eat some Thai, work a little more and toast to not dying last year. 

With the rest of my B-Day activities being pretty low-key, the days outcome pretty much depended on the Thai... and thankfully, it did not disappoint. They made my dream take-out container of spicy basil tofu, extra extra spicy. It was so hot I had to take a break half way through and go back to it- just the way it should be. I soaked an entire paper towel in runny nose drip from the heat and loved every second of it. the perfect size tofu cuts, the perfect rice to tofu to veggies ratio, LOTS of juicy stuff to push the rice around in (this is key), they even had eggplant in the dish! Also, the take-out containers are the nice plastic ones with lids that you can wash and reuse... that have replaced real dining items like plates at my house. Nowadays I almost exclusively eat take-out Thai- or microwave some ish and eat it out of leftover take-out Thai containers. It&#39;s a beautiful life. A beautiful slovenly life. 

In the end my birthday was the best super low-key blast and I owe a big part of that to Jaded Thai&#39;s superior spicy basil tofu dish. I&#39;ll be back agian soon, as if my 2 visits in 3 days didn&#39;t already tell you that."

It&#39;s a very small place, so I can see how it would get packed quickly, however it seemed like most people were getting take-out. It never really got busy or noisy, but there seemed to be a consistent flow of orders.

They have a lot of variety on the menu - if you are vegetarian this is a great place to go! We ordered the Tofu Satay appetizer, Jaded noodles, and the Penang (I have to get that everywhere I go). Everything tasted wonderful - just enough spice and packed full of flavor. The only complaint was that the sauce would be a little more mixed in with the noodles. And it&#39;s super cheap - for 2 of us it ended up being about $11 each! Nice. I would definitely want to come back and try more of the tasty items on the menu!"

Not sure how my Googling stumbled across this Yelp review.... okay it involved typing in &#39;Hoffman Estates&#39; and &#39;Thai Food&#39; in the same text box... anywhooo... these Yelpers knew what the hec they were talking about.

This place is in a goofy strip mall, yeah, but honestly, who cares? The place is nice, and the food is AMAZING. 

I ordered some Beef Pad Sieu (yummy sauce, perfect flavor, not too salty), Crazy Noodles with Chicken (white breast chunks, quality chicken - perfectly sauteed), and the eggrolls and wontons (so good ) are homemade. The shumai, while frozen (yeah - I asked) actually still tasted amazing... looked like and almost tasted like seared scallops.

So... I had planned on sharing the purchase of this appetizer sampler and 2 entrees... but my friend was late, so I nibbled way past the point of hunger, and left only 1/2 of the entrees and 1/2 of the appetizers. **BURP**

I think I will slowly work my way thru this menu in the next month... good thing I had only had oatmeal coffee and popcorn today. I&#39;d be exploding otherwise.

Take the recommendation, and try this place. Honestly the BEST Thai I have had in forever and a day.... seriously ridiculous, and at $8 for an entree, too good to pass up. Seriously.

P.S. There is Wi-Fi but the owner needs to leave the password with the staff. Silly to have and not offer this to customers. I left him a note on my bill telling him so... I could have been doing quite a bit online during the 15m wait for my order."

We started out with three appetizers Baby Egg Rolls (tiny egg rolls filled with shrimp chicken and bean thread noodles) - they were crisp, flavorful and not greasy, Coast Coconut Shrimp (coconut battered fried shrimp) - very crunchy batter, not overly coconutty and the shrimp were still moist and tender, and Fried Tofu - done well - crispy yet the tofu was still soft inside.

For entrees, we all chose different items.  The Pad Thai Tofu was flavorful and the noodles were cooked well.  It wasn&#39;t overly sweet as some places may serve it.  

The Jaded Supreme - I didn&#39;t try this one - but the person eating it said she loved it and finished every last bite.  

Two people had items off of their &#34;Signature entrees&#34; section - Moonlight Chicken (Chicken marinated in yellow curry, pan fried then served on top of spinach and topped with peanut sauce) - it was very tasty, the flavors were reminiscent of chicken satay but with a dinner twist. The other entree from the signature section was Pad Tung Tak (Shrimp, squid and imitation crab, stir fried with wide noodles, onion bean sprouts in a thin sauce) was delicious - the seafood was cooked perfectly - none of it was overcooked, and the squid was extremely tender.

I had Panang Curry Chicken - which was excellent.  The chicken wasn&#39;t overcooked and the sauce had great flavor and consistency.  Some places the sauce is thin and won&#39;t stuck to  the rice, other places make it so thick, it is like eating warm peanut butter - Jaded Thai found the perfect spot - not too thick, not too thin.  

They were very good with matching spice levels to what was ordered.  Both the Jaded Supreme and the Moonlight Chicken were not listed as &#39;spicy&#39; but were ordered as such (medium) and had just a nice kick to it.  I ordered my Panang medium (I always order medium the first time I go to a new place, just to be safe) but when I go back, I will order hot because I like it a little spicier than they served it, but it was definitely &#39;medium&#39; to suburban taste buds.

We will definitely be coming back here again!"

I ventured in on a Friday night around 5:30PM, armed with a Groupon.  One other table in the place and only one more table arrived before I left, though there were a few take out orders. I decided to order soup, appetizer and and entree.

I selected a chicken satay appetizer, tom ka soup and one of the specials of the night, salmon in penang curry, medium spicy. The satay was served with some barely toasted (or maybe somewhat dry) bread triangles, a small cucumber dish and peanut sauce. Four pieces of 2-3 bites each, overall a decent appetizer.

Tom ka was loaded with chicken and vegetables and pretty tasty. One issue that I had was that it took about 10 minutes for the appetizer to come out, then it was immediately followed by the soup, which sat there as I ate my appetizer. It&#39;s a pet peeve of mine when orders are delivered almost simultaneously - especially when the place is slow and something like the timing of soup is so controllable. 

The salmon itself was somewhat of a smaller portion than I expected, but was loaded with vegetables and also included a side of rice. Most of the dish was medium spicy as ordered, but there were one or two bites that blew a lot higher on the Scoville unit scale than was desired. 

Decent value - the whole meal was $21 plus tax and tip; Groupon saved me $10 of that too. All in all, the food was pretty good, but the timing gaffe with the soup and appetizer keeps my rating at three stars."

I ordered the chicken pad thai lunch special which came with two pieces of crab rangoon. I ate the rangoon in the car with the sauce it came with - the sad thing is it needed the sauce. The sauce was good, the rangoon not so much on it&#39;s own. My pad thai was delicious. I ate the whole thing. I was a little thrown off with lots of shredded cabbage on top, no bean sprouts, but it went down all the same. The cabbage added great a great crunch to the dish. I would come here again for sure!

I LOVED my Veggie Pad Thai Noodles (with a side of peanut sauce)...there were veggies in there that I have never seen in Pad Thai noodles and they were DELICIOUS! I had to stop myself so I wouldn&#39;t eat the entire plate! 
My husband wanted to order the beef red-wine dish, but they were out of beef (I guess thats what we get for going out to dinner at 8:00 p.m.!)...so he ordered the chicken version.  He thought his dish was pretty O.K.

Note..they do not sell alcoholic beverages here!  There prices are great! My Pad Thai noodles were 8.50 and the hubby&#39;s chicken dish was about $9.

The location is a bit strange, in a strip mall, and we actually almost missed the restaurant because the sign was hard to see.  Its a small restaurant, but we went late so it wasn&#39;t crowded.

The service was pretty solid...we will definately be visiting again...I do wish they were closer so we could order take out from them! :)"

The staff was attentive and friendly and the décor was acceptable.  I ordered the cashew shrimp and it was pretty bland.  This dish did not have the &#34;hot&#34; symbol next to it on the menu.  Well, one of those unbelievably, incredibly hot peppers made it into my dish.  Unknowingly, I was eating away when suddenly I could barely breath.  It took a full half hour to recover from this.  The waitress did bring a cup of hot water, but that only intensified the burning sensation.  I now have a very Jaded view of this place, which would have gotten an average rating (at best), but after this experience I will NEVER be returning."

I try to stay good by not eating out a lot but I caved this time. On my way to the dog park with my puppy I saw Jaded Thai. It was a sign! I HAD to have Thai. 

Ordered two dishes and two apps for the family when I got home. It was very convienient to order online AND receive a 10% discount. I love discounts!

Food arrived before the 1 hour estimated time. Jaded Thai is earning points for that. 

Apps and dishes were abundant. I mean, LARGE portions. 
Only thing is that everything tasted &#34;just ok&#34;. Nothing special. Pad Thai had no peanuts and no lime...came with lemon. HUH? Lemon is new for me. Either way, it was alright but nothing to rave about. 

Would I order from here again? Probably not. 
Am I going to recommend it to friends? Probably not.
Is it fairly priced? Yes.
Was delivery fast? Yes! Driver was very nice too."

It seems they only have one waitress during peak times but she is super energetic and more than willing to help you out with anything you need. The lighting is a bit darker and the tables are smaller (max is about 4 people) but there is a lot this place can offer.

I ordered some shrimp sumai which came out in a set of 8 with some dipping sauce. They were pretty good (shrimp surrounded by a type of fried wrap). It was well seasoned and tasted fairly fresh. 4 out of 5 stars.

I also got the yellow curry which I thought was fantastic. I&#39;m not typically a fan of curry and even at Jaded Thai, they added coconut milk which is typical of Thai curry. But what I loved most about it was the way they cooked the potatoes and chicken inside the curry. The potatoes were cooked but still firm, the chicken was firm but tender, and they had some onions in there as well which complimented the whole dish. 4 out of 5 stars.

I finished it off with some strawberry mochi ice cream. This was clearly bought from a store and just chopped up, but was still good. 3 out of 5 stars.

The thai iced tea was fantastic, very flavor filled and cold. It&#39;s a refreshing, sugary drink that I think goes well at the end of the meal if you fancy this sort of thing.

Overall, I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere and would be a great place for a date or night out away from the kids. It is a bit pricy as I paid $20 for all the dishes above."

The staff is very friendly and enthusiastic and the food is amazing.  I usually stick to a curry when I go for Thai (the hotter the better) and this place doesn&#39;t disappoint.

Sure, I had my favorites in Chicago but I&#39;m always up for trying to places and Jaded Thai surprised the hell out of me.   The Spicy Crazy noodles are absolutely phenomenal, hands down the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The added eggplant was amazing and an awesome addition to the dish.  My mother tried the Rama with Chicken and while she found it to be a bit too spicy she really liked it and I loved it.  My sister had never tried rama chicken before and enjoyed the heck out of our mothers leftovers.  The satay was great, good thai iced teas.  I&#39;m sad I recently moved to Dallas, I&#39;ll miss this place!

It really has nothing to do with the quantity. Something about the flavors doesn&#39;t taste hearty to me and I feel like it&#39;s a poor cross between Indian food and Chinese food. That said, Jaded Thai was one of the better Thai restaurants I have tried, thanks to the reviews by Cristie B., Danielle S., Candice G., and Sherwin C.

We had the chicken satay to start followed by shrimp Jaded Thai wide rice noodles, and the hot #1 curry with beef. The satay came out beautifully presented with bread triangles, peanut dipping sauce, and pickled cucumbers. Off to a great start so I couldn&#39;t wait for the rest of our order to arrive. I was sorely disappointed by portion size and would&#39;ve been downright hungry if we hadn&#39;t ordered an appetizer. These dishes were ridiculously tiny but presentation was good.  The food tasted fresh and flavors were great. I ordered the curry spicy but wished I had ordered the extra spicy instead. The curry was so mild that even my wife was able to eat it without any problems even though she is sensitive to spicy dishes. Other than that, the flavors were good and my wife, who is a fan of Thai food, loved everything. 

Interior was small yet clean and comfortable. The simple little touches such as the upside down umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and the bookcase towards the rear made it feel cozy. The lone woman working did everything but cook and was very friendly to everyone who came through the door. She was attentive and kind so we had no complaints in the service department.

I left wanting to find something more to eat with a little more sustenance and satisfaction, which is par for the course whenever I eat Thai. I don&#39;t know what it is but I feel like all Thai dishes are like appetizers making my dining experience very anti-climatic. I give this place 3 stars not because we didn&#39;t enjoy the place thoroughly but because I have once again proven to myself that no matter how good Thai food is it will always just be appetizers to me."

Fast forward 2 months, I finally got around to trying Jaded Thai.
I thought the environment was warm and cozy, very inviting. My friends and I really liked our food.  I ordered the green curry with chicken. It totally hit the spot.

We&#39;ve liked everything we&#39;ve tried pretty much.  In particular, we love the baby egg rolls and the Tom Ka soup.  I&#39;ve tried a number of the dishes but my usual favorite is cashew w/ tofu.  The pad Thai really wasn&#39;t my favorite, so if you&#39;re the type that usually gets this, you might want to branch out here - I&#39;ve liked almost everything else I&#39;ve had there better than the pad Thai.

This was a nice find thanks to other yelpers.  

Tried 3 dishes.   

Panang Curry:  Good, nice balance of sweet-hot-sour-spicy.  

Pad Thai:  Ok.  It was sweet lacking balance with salt- sour flavors. 

Jaded Supreme:  Stir fried beef in a brown sauce, with mushrooms, pea pods and baby corn.  This was a little bland.  The black mushrooms were tasty.  A bit of sriracha helped it out, but this dish is not supposed to be spicy.  

Good Thai food.  Reasonable prices.  Portions are sufficient for one person.

sorry still eating .. is it just as rude to type and eat as it is to talk while you eat?? :) 

I wanted to write my review while my thoughts are still in my head. 

This is right by my parents house and work and is now my go to place for Thai for lunch!! 

I ordered the red curry chicken. It&#39;s a little soupier than I would want, but it&#39;s still good and the spiciness of it is perfect. My rice was a bit undercooked, but I am sure it&#39;s just a one time thing. I under cook rice sometimes, so it&#39;s understandable. 

I did take out, so can&#39;t really comment on service, but the atmosphere was really friendly and the restaurant was really nice. Thai restaurants can be pretty decent or complete hole in the walls. Jaded Thai is nice inside and their prices are very reasonable. 

I will definitely be back ... AND they have mochi for dessert!! YAY"

It&#39;s the sad truth, since many of these hidden treasures are often overlooked due to their not-so-appealing locations. Jaded Thai is one of them. 

I met up with the lovely Danielle S. in hopes of discovering yet another Thai restaurant I would grow to love. I seriously think I died and went to Thai heaven. JT is some seriously phenom Thai eats. The menu offers up something for everyone. As a vegetarian I was overwhelmed with their veggie options. Just about all the dishes could be made with veg or tofu in place of the meat or seafood. ((winning!)) We tried the Tofu Satay. I think it was the equivalent of crack ((if crack is as addicting as they say it is...)). The tofu squares were lightly grilled with a touch of curry sauce on top. Crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. It&#39;s enough to make any tofu whore swoon. The peanut sauce it came with had a slight kick to it. We also ordered the Jaded Thai Noodles ((Spinach, rice noodles, veggies, peanut panang curry sauce)) and the Panang Curry with veggies. Both were loaded with fresh ((not frozen or canned)) veggies, including straw mushrooms (my fave). Although both dishes had similar sauces, they were slightly different, and both packed a punch - even for a mild dish. My only complaint was I had hoped the peanut panang sauce would be mixed in the noodles and not dumped on top. Those rice noodles get super sticky and can be hard to separate.  
Also, in hindsight, we probably should have ordered 2 really different dishes, but hey, it was our first time and you can bet your ass I&#39;ll be back.

The service was fantastic. Our server was attentive and friendly. Our dishes came out fast, and our water was always be refilled. And then there&#39;s the prices. Cheap, quality and tasty?!? That sort of thing is unheard of, but the two of us walked out of there spending $13 each - including tax and tip!

The decor was really cute. Trendy and chic with an Asian bistro feel. I was shocked to see that not more people were dining in. I think we were one of 3 tables the entire two hours we were there. However, there was a steady flow of takeout, so I&#39;m happy to see the business is flowing in.

Overall first impression of Jaded Thai? Love at first bite."

1. One of my favorite steaks I&#39;ve ever ordered: Coffee rubbed Filet Mignon. I&#39;m a big fan of flavoring on a steak and this was one of my favorites. Perfect tenderness too. Mmmmm

2. Bread balls and whipped cinnamon honey butter were delicious. Really contemplated asking for some to take home good. 

3. A little room for improvement on the steak doneness. The steaks had nice char on the outside but a little more done than I ordered. Our crab cake were too mayonnaise-y tasting and we wouldn&#39;t order those again. 

Overall would come back again. That coffee filet!"

Was in the area finally and was excited to finally taste what ive beem missing since visiting the GA location. 

I must tell you was unfortunately let down. The service, presentation and food is lwft to be desired. I truly thought.  i was at ponderosa or olive garden...

The plates and drinks came messy and lacked presentation. The food, hush puppies asparagus was greasy and salty. No water was provided for the table and my martini was full of crushed ice. 

I could not understand the standards set for this place. I hope mngt takes heed and up the level. Until then will not be back."

In fact, we&#39;ve done our family holiday meal here for a few years, bringing in people from across the country.

Tonight we decided to celebrate a birthday. Five of us were there for dinner.

What&#39;s changed in 2 months? Customer satisfaction and food quality.

Our waiter said the Prime Rib was a featured item and was so tender you could cut it with a spoon. As you can see in the picture, we could cut it with a spoon, it was 50% fat. And the picture is one serving, not two. That much fat in one cut!

I&#39;m a big fan of this cut of meat and have eaten it everywhere. What a surprise (bad surprise, not good) - the dish that was not really marbled with fat, but marbled with meat. It was EXTREMELY salty. The wife and I were both disappointed and disgusted.

Steak salad was just okay, kind of an odd dish that wasn&#39;t really much of a salad.

Steak &amp; biscuits verdict - one family member loved it, another didn&#39;t.

Three people had fries and weren&#39;t very happy with them at all.

Went from excited about this place to &#34;where else can we, should we, go?&#34;

Not sure what&#39;s going on, saving money on meat?

Started with a Signature Martini. Has a rosemary sprig but it&#39;s just for looks and fragrance, the star were the blue cheese &amp; jalapeño stuffed olives. These make the drink!! Ask for a couple...

The shrimp cocktail was really good. Plenty of horseradish in the cocktail sauce and the shrimp were not overcooked. Might think of adding a bit of tabasco as the sauce could use some tang...

The deviled eggs are pretty good. The sugar comes through on the bacon and sort of overpowers the rest. Needs a little savory in the egg, salt helps but a bit of mustard would be even better... The combination is right but needs a bit more balance...

French onion soup, another item on the sweet side missing the savory part. The onions were super cooked meaning no texture. The cheese &amp; crouton were great and browned perfectly.

I started eating those bread balls... They are like sweet bread doughnuts that you dip in the honey butter!!! Seriously more sweetness?! But I could not stop eating them!!!

At this point I was starting to get full... but continued on...

Had the Ribeye w AuGratin. Finally the savory!! The steak has good flavor, not as tender as I would have thought but this isn&#39;t a dry aged item. I still liked it.

We also had the French Dip... Umm one of the Best!! Now it is made with the prime rib and they mix some onions and horseradish in there which is not a normal French Dip, but it&#39;s really good! It is something to go back for IMO. I love the fries here. Thin, crispy, fresh cut...nice.

It wasn&#39;t busy on a Monday eve and the service was good. 

I&#39;m not big on salty dishes but a few things could have used a bit for balance. I did not salt the steak because it was perfect to me. We had a couple cocktails 3 apps &amp; 2 entrees. I think the cost was fair. These are Choice steaks not Prime so texture will be different than the upper end steakhouses. But it&#39;s a good place that is pricey for some things but doesn&#39;t gouge the wallet."

Amazing lodge like atmosphere with soft lighting (you can still read menu and see your plate tho). Super delicious variety of meals that suit almost every palate. I love the little dough balls that come as your bread basket and the sweet cream butter.

I always get a filet and he always gets the chicken with a huge broccoli spear.

Some of my FAVORITE items include: french onion soup, baby kale salad, NY strip, the button mushrooms and chocolate cake (they serve this when you have a special occasion which is a nice touch)!

The atmosphere is dark but cozy with it&#39;s low lighting, candles, fireplace. They suggest on the menu that you not use your cellphone while dining which I love! I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s a good place for kids but a top date-night spot for sure!"

Came here for dinner date night about two months ago and wasn&#39;t too thrilled.The only thing we actually enjoyed was the bread and onion soup so touche you guys nailed it. As far as the steak...over cooked and your mashed potatoes was well just a little too bland. But the service was excellent and the manager did come by and asked us how were things and gave us his card for the next time we came in to let him know; he would make it up to us. Oddly he didn&#39;t make it up to us then, and therefore, we didn&#39;t come back for date night again
BUT
(and here is why I wrote this)
I believe they are improving because my husband, who happens to attend many business dinners, decided to give it a try when someone yelped &#34;steakhouses&#34; so off they went. 

My husband said it was much better but still, the steak was a little over cooked. They might have the grill or gas turned up to high to get the food out quicker? I am not sure. 

As before the soup was amazing, so amazing he brought me home a bowl! He never did see the manager from that other night, not that he would&#39;ve asked for his complementary steak dinner but oddly, I feel like they should&#39;ve at least sent us home with a brand new one that night. HMMMM and too think I really feel like having some more of that onion soup! 

Get your steaks up to par guys and we will be back :)"

The table bread is great, little balls of awesome! However, the shape of the bread makes it a challenge to spread the butter on.

I have gotten the Filet there many times, it&#39;s always cooked to perfection. My significant other has gotten the Prime Rib rare, and it was perfect.

The only disappointment is the chocolate cake, it was dry, and not very fantastic.

5 stars for great steaks!"

Haven&#39;t been in awhile so last week we had dinner and a few things have changed.  

The Good:  Service very attentive, knowledgeable, quick. Good drink menu, nice bartenders. Love the environment at this restaurant. We sat at a booth in the bar. Wedge salad was great.

The Not so Good:  Prime rib was on special, i ordered the 16oz cut ($33) so i could take some home, but it was so fatty - there would be no leftovers :(.  Tried mashed potatoes w/carmelized onions for the first time and they had a burnt vinegar taste to them, and the potatoes were hard and bland. My date had the 3 filet medallions ($34) and they were very small, overcooked and the horseradish topping tasted like breadcrumbs. 

Normally we&#39;d have dessert but we decided to stop for ice cream :). 

I have had both of these dishes in the past and this was not normal - was very disappointed because it used to be one of our go to steakhouses and for the money, we can&#39;t justify it if this experience is what we can expect."

The family was hungry and my stepson who is 9 saw the word steakhouse and said he wanted to try it. One of the best meals I have had in awhile. We had the Steak Burger, Steak &amp; Biscuits and chicken tenders for the kids meal.  Everything was perfect. The burger my husband ordered was my favorite. It was so juicy and cooked perfectly. My stepson, who is so picky and thinks everything is yucky, just loved the food. His favorite part was to bread at the beginning. He never over eats but he just kept stuffing food in his mouth. Even though we walked in looking like hillbillies ( We had been running around all morning and did not realize how upscale it was. We would have dressed appropriately) the staff was super friendly and accommodating. Our server Dante took good care of us. We live in Downers Grove but definitely will be coming back often. The food and service was great. I just recommend that if the quality of the food and/or service does not meet your expectations then speak up and say something to the staff. This definitely seems like the type of place that will do everything they can to make it right. I was surprised by some yelpers reviews who said they had visited so many times before and if was great but the first time they write a review was when they had a not so good experience. If you don&#39;t have a problem writing a bad review online and expressing yourself to fellow yelpers then just take the time to have a one on one chat with the staff about your experience. The true character of a business is how they handle and resolve customer complaints and issues. Give them an opportunity to do so."

After reading a few Yelp reviews in the area, we decided to try Stoney River.   I was a bit hesitant because a few years ago, we ate there &amp; were not happy.   Unfortunately, I can&#39;t remember what disappointed us about the restaurant.   So I was willing to give them another chance.   

From the beginning, the host/greeters were very welcoming &amp; friendly.   The young lady who took us to our booth complimented me on my unique name &amp; curly hair (I&#39;m glad she noticed I was having a good hair day).  

Our female server was professional, friendly &amp; informative.   Even if I had a silly question, she was not condescending.     

Yelp reviews recommended the Crunchy Ahi Tuna roll, so we had to try it.  OMG -- that was sooooo good.   My only complaint was I wanted more on the plate.    

We were very pleased with our entrées. The steaks were done perfectly and the side dishes were delicious.  

Just when you thought they could not top the experience anymore, we ordered desserts.   I could not decide between the Creme Brûlée or the White Chocolate Cheesecake.   But I noticed the &#34;Chocolate Fudge Blondie,&#34; so I decided to try it out.   WOW!!!!  Every bite was orgasmic.   I&#39;ve never tasted anything like that.  Even when I offered my husband a bite, I was hoping he would take a sliver. 

Obviously, we could not wait to come back to Stoney River.    So for my husband&#39;s Birthday, we went back one month later.    But this time, we invited Steve&#39;s youngest son.   He got to experience all the delicious meals at Stoney River.   This time, our next great server was Chris N -- he had a great sense of humor.   

Of the 10 locations nationwide, Deer Park is the only location in Illinois.   I&#39;m glad, because we would like to make this our &#39;new&#39; favorite spot."

A sincere apology and something to make me feel like they valued my business would have gone a long way.

I get the Homemade Caesar Salad, which is a huge wedge of lettuce, bleu cheese dressing, and bacon pieces. Love it - crunchy, fresh, tangy dressing, and lovely amount of bacon. I always get their 16 oz. NY Sirloin, and yes, when it comes, it is a little shrunk from being on the grill, but the meat is flavorful, juicy, and lovely in your mouth. No complaints. If you go here for anniversaries or birthdays, they give you a chocolate cake on the house. Great service, great ambience, and just a good place for steaks. Yum!

It&#39;s a very nice restaurant aesthetically, but a bit noisy. The French onion soup was excellent and the Caesar salad was enormous, although I found the dressing a little sharp. The croutons were exceptional. The ribeye steak was a generous portion and cooked perfectly. It was tender and flavorful. The loaded baked potato was huge, but was on the cold side and didn&#39;t melt the cheese topping. The wine was an excellent complement to the meal. We had no room for dessert, although I wish I would have tried the carrot cake which looked wonderful. Service was perfect. Very attentive staff without being obtrusive. Dinner for four, with a moderate priced wine and no other alcohol was just over $260, with a 20% tip."

We started with high hopes with ordering the blue cheese potatoe chips which where amazing and the wonderful  brandy old fashion drinks. After the starter it went down hill  the steaks are a lower quality with no flavor but char. I couldn&#39;t even finish due to the amount of time to even chew a small pcs.   In this setting and the amount of money ($38) I was excepting at least a good quality steak which it wasn&#39;t. We ending by ordering the key lime pie that was excellent but  creme brulee was awful and tasted like burnt sugar.  I still am having a hard time understanding how this has been rated as a top place to go. We will never be back. The amount of money spent we could have went down town to a real steakhouse.

My husband and I went on a Thursday evening and there was no wait. The bar seemed decently populated, so that was promising. Neither of us ordered a cocktail, mainly because neither of us felt like drinking. I also wasn&#39;t wanting to pay $12 for a cocktail.

The menu looked promising - steaks, salad, seafood. Not a bad start. Our server was very attentive and friendly, as was everyone working there. We ordered the steak rolls as an appetizer - think of a Philly cheesesteak turned into an egg roll. It was pretty good and decently portioned. The rolls are really good and were by far the best part of our meal. Too bad the free part of the meal was the best.

I ordered a ribeye and my husband ordered sea bass. I&#39;ll be honest: I&#39;ve had better steak at Outback. It was far from tender, and the only redeeming quality of the steak was that it was cooked medium rare like I ordered. I&#39;ll always order medium rare because most places will give me medium when I ask for medium rare. And I won&#39;t eat anything beyond medium, so it&#39;s usually a safe bet. But there was little flavor, and the herb butter placed on top of it added minimal flavor. The steak was also a bit on the cool side, even on the exterior. Not inedible by any means, but if I&#39;m paying almost $30 for a cut of steak, I would expect better meat. The sea bass was mediocre. Tasted like it was previously frozen and it was overcooked. I passed on a potato and instead got broccoli as a side dish. I don&#39;t know how, but even the broccoli lacked discernible flavor. Texture was good though.

The manager brought us out the hash brown for two as a sampler since corporate was apparently trying to push it out in an attempt to get more people to order it. That was good, but nothing I would ever order regularly. It was a bit on the greasy side and again, had no flavor. The crunch on it was amazing, though.

The best part of this place is the service (we had three different people asking us if our food was cooked as we liked it). Our bill for a steak, sea bass, steak rolls, and a hot tea was $85. After tip, this was a $100 lesson to let us know that we won&#39;t be coming back unless we&#39;re in the mood for decent appetizers and good service.

Maybe I&#39;m biased, we usually go to Morton&#39;s in Schaumburg for steak, but Stoney River isn&#39;t somewhere I&#39;ll go again when I&#39;m craving a steak.

Again, I&#39;d give this place 2.5 stars: 1.5 stars for the food (I&#39;d give it a 1, but the rolls really are pretty good), and 1 additional star for the service."

The food is usually quite good.  However, I&#39;m not sure if quality is starting to decline.  For the price, I expect superior steaks, cooked perfectly.  This isn&#39;t Outback where you get what you pay for.  I&#39;m paying nearly $40 on steak, so I expect a well prepared hunk of meat.  I love prime rib, which I ordered last night with a recommendation from our waiter.  I was torn between prime rib and filet Mignon. He said the prime was great.  Well, he must&#39;ve not had any that night because it was tough and chewy.  It was so unappetizing and I contemplated sending it back.  I didn&#39;t because I hate doing that, but probably should have.  I&#39;m so disappointed.  Everything else was good - wedge salad is phenomenal, wine was yummy, carrot cake dessert was to die for.  I just wish the main dish, what they&#39;re known for - would&#39;ve been nearly as good as the rest of the food. I&#39;ll have to stick with Beelows for their prime rib.  I&#39;ve never been disappointed there yet. Stoney River does have awesome bread though...but I&#39;m not into carbs so need to go where I know my steaks will not disappoint."

We had been here a couple times before. Received a gift card for Christmas, and thought we should use it to celebrate - as it turned out, nothing in particular.

We were greeted by a very polite and professional hostess, who though she looked young, was very on top of everything going on in the restaurant. She seemed like she has been in the restaurant business for 5 years. We are always welcomed very professionally and warmly here.

Our server was excellent! He was very welcoming, highly knowledgeable about the foods and wines, and always ready to make sure we had enough rolls on hand. We heard another very professional and competent server at the next table, who would have been fine, and knew our guy (forgot his name) was exceptional!

We&#39;ve tried the burgers, coffee cured filet, and fish in the past. This visit, we tried the Lodge Filet and Filet Medallions with Crab. The cut of meat was high quality, was well prepared, and came as requested - medium rare. Our sides were asparagus and burgundy button mushrooms. Both were outstanding - and fair stand-ins for our beloved fries. We had hoped to order the truffle fries, from previous experiences, but were told they were no longer available. :( 

We passed on dessert since our meal was filling, but have enjoyed the items we&#39;ve ordered in the past.

The good:
- Very good meals, prepared well, and at a good price.
- We have been served by competent to exceptional staff every time, especially this latest visit.
- Decor is fun and inviting. Red Canoe prominently displayed hanging from the ceiling, great fireplace with &#34;our table&#34; which is great on a cold winter evening, and optional seats to watch the chef prepare his creations.

The bad:
- Only negative is that, though the value is good, the price is more than we can indulge in more than every couple months. This makes it more special, and something to look forward to."

The ambiance is great, and candidly our waitress was good (3 out of 5 stars). I ordered wine with the steak and it came half way through my steak.  Even after I asked twice.  

The real reason for the fail: just not impressed.  For what we spent, we could have gotten better quality steak and top shelf service.  

They weren&#39;t rude.  But honestly, places like Coopers Hawk is a better value (and I don&#39;t love them). 

BTW the wine specials: all red wines were out of stock! In a steak place. 

Just need to decide if they are high end or mid level restaurant.  The tweener hurt them."

Disappointing food and poor service. Our server was very pleasant, but didn&#39;t seem very knowledgable about the menu.  My family and I used to eat at Stoney River quite often and liked it a lot.  Then came the menu changes and poor service, so we didn&#39;t go for a long time.  Decided to give it another try on July 3rd. More menu changes, but our favourite steaks still there, so we were hopeful.  My French Onion soup was delicious, but my daughter ordered the wedge salad and found that it was not the creamy Ranch dressing she remembered and did not like the taste.  They said they would take it off the bill. They didn&#39;t.  They didn&#39;t serve those delicious signature rolls until AFTER we had our appetisers and then only because we asked about them. My filet was one of the worst steaks I have ever had even though I specifically asked to make sure it would have all the seasonings I remembered and was told that it would. Instead, it came soaked in some buttery sauce that did nothing for the flavour of the steak.  However, my daughter&#39;s strip came just like I remembered my filet: sizzling in seasoning. All in all, I doubt that we will be returning to Stoney River in the future.  There are plenty of top steakhouses in the area.  BTW, whatever happened to the Red Canoe society?"

Years ago, I found my favorite dessert wine at Stoney River, a sweet German Riesling. With that being said, I have yet to order a wine here since that I&#39;ve truly enjoyed. Even with the servers suggestions, I would rather opt for one of their delicious Bloody Mary&#39;s.

There&#39;s also a level of over-professionalism here that I never thought I&#39;d see. The management and even some of the staff take stiff to a whole other level, you can feel it in they atmosphere.

Better than the last time here when I ordered medium and it came very rare.  Good flavor to the steak but mashed potatoes were warm to cold.  Daughter had same steak and potatoes and both came prepared like mine.  So it least it was consistently average.  Wife and son had steaks and Au gratin potatoes.  Potatoes were served in a square blob but at least they weren&#39;t cold.  Almost inedible compared to the Au gratin potatoes they served years ago when they were carefully prepared, browned to perfection and served hot.  Total bill came to $204 for 4 steak dinners and two glasses of wine.  Way too expensive for what we were served.  On the plus side service was efficient and friendly.

And that&#39;s just the main course. The pre-dinner bread at Stoney is unlike anything you&#39;ve ever had. They&#39;re almost little fried donut holes but not as sweet. They come with an incredible dipping butter that is out of this world. 

Highly highly recommend!

Lobster bisque is quite good as well."

Had the New York steak and my mother had the Rib Eye.  Cooked and seasoned perfectly. The Rolls were good too. . . Waitress was very friendly and attentive. So service was great (5 star). 
Now on to the could do better.
For the price you pay for the meal I wish they would add a soup or salad or even veggies with out having to pay and up charge. .  I get the whole steak and potatoes tradition but for an avg  of $30 a plate. . I think you could add a vegetable at least.

My son had the Mac &amp; Cheese. The parts that weren&#39;t dry tasted pretty good but half of it was dry and you all know how kids can act about having charred food if its not a burger or a hot dog. . . 
Its was a nice place, ambiance for a steak house was good. . They even have complimentary valet. . . But i wouldn&#39;t travel  back . . .  There are other steak houses that give you better side dish options for that amount of money."

My family and I have been to many a steak house and this place was the SNOBBIEST place I have EVER BEEN TOO. Will NEVER return and will let everyone in my circle know to STAY AWAY.

The steaks and seafood have always been fantastic. Brought by VP from Philly one trip 8 years ago and he still asks about this place. Professional staff and wonderful  atmosphere.  The bread &#34;puppies&#34; are a great start too!

Boyfriend and I came here hungry and with high hopes (given the good reviews) in the middle of a snow storm. Surprisingly, the snow didn&#39;t keep many diners away, as we were told the wait would be 35-40 minutes for a table. Too hungry to wait, we opted to eat at the bar.

When Boyfriend and I go out to eat, we like to treat ourselves and this was no exception. We started with a crabcake appetizer. For the price I&#39;d hoped for a LARGE crabcake, but was presented with a meager one, paired with some mango salsa and a creamy mustard sauce garnished with chives. The mango salsa and sauce helped mask the bland crabcake, though I will say its texture was spot on and very moist.

Boyfriend ordered a ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes. For the price and given the smaller size than he&#39;s ordered elsewhere for less, he was expecting something fantastic. The steak was a bit dry and just was not good. The potatoes were just OK. The taste and quality did not live up to the price. Boyfriend has cooked better ribeyes in our tiny apartment kitchen.

I ordered the filet medallion trio, substituting horseradish crust for the bleu cheese crust on one of the medallions. Again, for the price, I was really expecting perfection. I&#39;ve ordered a similar dish from Wildfire, which set my expectations for the size of the medallions. They shouldn&#39;t call them medallions here - call them bites or nibbles. Literally, I was presented with 3 little chunks of filet, which were undercooked, might I add. The horseradish crust was the winner here, and even that was not great compared to horseradish crusted filets I&#39;ve had elsewhere. I ordered caramelized onion mashed potatoes as my side and was disappointed that the onions were a bit past caramelized and on to burnt.

We also ordered a side of asparagus to share. Again, the recurring theme here - not impressed. It was OK, but very bland and boiled.

Not wanting to drop any more cash on this disappointment, we headed home for dessert. We will not be back. A better steak meal (for a better price, to boot) can be found at Jameson&#39;s Charhouse or Wildfire.

One good thing I will say - service was relatively fast and courteous. Just wish the food was better for the price!"

It was not worth the money for the quality of food that was served.  I had a ribeye, and it was mediocre at best.  The drinks were good, but overpriced.  The side dishes and starters were very overpriced, and none of that would have been a bother if they were worth the cost.  The place seems like it wants to be something it is not.  It has a lodge kinda feel to it which is alluring and charming, and the staff was able and nice enough.  The managers are strange and kind of lurking, and this was the reason we didn&#39;t complain.  We wanted to avoid any conversations with them.  Someone else said they wanted to rate 2.5 stars if they could, and I agree."

When we sat down, our waiter greeted us with a basket of very warm, fried, poppy seed bread balls, served a soft maple butter concoction. I don&#39;t have the exact name for these puppies, but man, they were good! My quiet voice kept telling me, &#34;eat just one&#34;, but did I listen?! Noooooooooo...6 puffy balls later, I was stuffed but my entree had already arrived. I was not too bright!

I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad entree. It was good, not great. Would not order it again.

Also stole a bite of the coffee-cured filet mignon...Whooooooooaaaa! It was one of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever had. So tender and flavourful and you don&#39;t taste the coffee. Our waiter explained to us that the tenderloin is prepared with a special brine (coffee, brown sugar and molasses). I highly recommend ordering this dish. It was amazing and yes, I had just &#34;one&#34; bite because my 6 puffy balls were ballooning inside my tummy.

The steak came w/au gratin potatoes and green beans. I truly thought I was done eating, but the potatoes were taunting me and so, I took a bite. They were heavenly! Did not attempt to ask the waiter how they were made because in my state of denial, they were carb-free, fat-free and virtually little or no calories at all, ha! Thought I was done eating but I also tried the green beans (I relapsed, I know,  I know!) and they too were good. Skipped dessert...it was tough, but I just didn&#39;t have the room for it.


I enjoyed my evening here. 
Excellent service and great food!"

The fried lobster tail was unique and quite yummy. The desserts were also very good and the Prosecco cocktail hits the spot.

So many great steak places around!   Made a decision to come here for an occasion and am so very glad I did. Amazingly attentive and friendly service combined with stellar meat (coffee cured filets and prime rib in our case), very good sides which were included with the entree, quite the surprise,  and a phenomenal Cocktail called the Red Canoe Martini were some of the highlights of our Dinner.   We finished with a succulent and creamy creme brulee for dessert which was the perfect ending to a really good meal.

When we arrived today - a party of 11 - we were told another party (of 15) had the Wine Room and they set us up in the main dining room.  Very disappointing.  I assume it was purely a business decision because the other party was larger.  They should have done right by us and they didn&#39;t."

We were warmly greeted by the host staff upon arriving, and quickly seated without a reservation (about 8:30pm on a Saturday night.)  I like the classy/rustic elegance of the décor, the entire restaurant was inviting.

Our server, Cassie, was awesome.  I would definitely recommend her, and we made sure to make mention to the manager when we left.  She was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, had some great recommendations, and let us sample two wines we couldn&#39;t decide between before choosing a bottle.

Onto the food.  Perfection.  Everything was superb.  On our table:

Bottle of Australian Shiraz.  I don&#39;t remember specifically, but I think there was only one on the menu.  I am highly allergic to domestic wines (would&#39;ve had a migraine before dinner was over) so, international choices are a must.  This wine was GOOD, and if we didn&#39;t have somewhere else to be, would&#39;ve probably ordered a second bottle.  :P

Caprese salad appetizer.  The balsamic dressing they use is really tasty, and complimented everything well.  I like that it also came with some onion straws to munch on.

&#34;Legendary&#34; filet with horseradish crust, medium rare.  Came perfectly cooked.  I ditched the crust a few bites in, just because I wanted to enjoy the filet as it was.  Tender, juicy, and flavorful, which I sometimes miss with a filet because they&#39;re so lean.

Mashed sweet potatoes with cinnamon.  Like sweet potato pie.  Creamy and perfectly seasoned.  I couldn&#39;t stop eating them.

&#34;cowboy cut&#34; ribeye, medium rare.  The BF wanted to pick up the bone and gnaw on it, which I don&#39;t blame him for one bit.  This steak was thicker cut than other steakhouses in the area, and for a better price ($33.99 v. $42+ at other places for a thinner steak.)  He let me taste a bite... while the filet was awesome, I regretted not ordering my standard ribeye.

Garlic mashed potatoes.  He loved them... I didn&#39;t try, the one place I *don&#39;t* dig garlic is in my mashed potatoes.  Call me crazy.

We shared the sautéed mushrooms.  The flavor was delicious, but they were super rich, next time I&#39;d opt for a lighter veggie item.

The best part was that the BF had a $20 off dinner for two coupon, which he gets frequently for signing up for their e-mail rewards club.  The prices are reasonable anyway, but this makes it even more enticing to go back!

We both left with full bellies and lots of leftovers.  I can&#39;t wait to return... my mouth is watering after writing this review!"

I&#39;m going to start with my negatives since they&#39;re pretty stupid and mostly my fault and I&#39;ve learned from my mistakes.
1. I HATE round corner booths. This is nobody&#39;s fault but my own. I&#39;m just a weirdo. I&#39;m not docking any stars for the hostess doing her job and seating us in my personal hell. I just wanted you guys to know that round corner booths are the worst. Next time I&#39;ll make a note that I&#39;d rather not sit in the corner.
2. The caramelized onion mashed potatoes were really sweet. Like cloyingly sweet. All the salt and pepper in the world couldn&#39;t save them. Next time I&#39;ll stick with garlic mashed or maybe those bomb homemade chips.
3. The whiskey shrimp on toast appetizer. It tasted like cinnamon or something, and I will never ever order again.
4. Okay, this is the one that wasn&#39;t my fault/personal preference/ whatever. Our server was kind of a huge douchebag. I&#39;m a server. I know what its like to not want to be the closer on a monday night. I also know that someone has to do it and that nobody is too good to close. This guy acted like his sh*t didn&#39;t stink. Like we were privileged to be served by him. He kept making these backhanded server comments that perhaps the average guest would pass off as joking or banter but I saw right through that. He was being rude and trying to rush us through dinner. &#34;I&#39;m here all night&#34; in server speak means &#34;dont keep me here all night.&#34; Ohhh boy did I savor my dinner. Slowly and deliberately.

Now to the positives.
1. The executive chef came out and made the rounds to all the tables asking how everything was and if there was anything else he could get for us. I loved that. It was a nice personal touch, almost to assure us that our food was made with care by a human.
2. BLUE CHEESE POTATO CHIPS. Oh man, thats the stuff right there. All day every day.
3. Everyone&#39;s steaks were cooked correctly. Nothing ruins a meal like an overcooked steak. My prime rib was deliciously medium rare. Pretty much everyone else had a ribeye medium rare, and those were all nicely cooked as well. I&#39;m thinking next time I&#39;ll go for a filet and see how they do. There&#39;s nothing in this world more delicious than a medium rare to rare filet. MMMM.
4. Creme brulee for dessert. Totally lovely. Silky and delicious and not overly sweet.

Good job, Stoney River (but not you, server). I&#39;ll be back!"

Service...excellent.  From &#34;free&#34; valet parking, proper greeting and hostess escorting to the table, a print out for the server with name, number in party and any special comments (birthday, anniversary), name used regularly, excusing when reaching to serve, removal of plates and silverware after every course, etc.  Not often do you see at this level of a restaurant.  The only thing that kept it from five star was that the wait staff remained dedicated to a table without the passing servers noticing a plate to be removed, water to be filled, etc at another table.

Food...good.  The steaks were very good.  Medium-rare did come out rare and had to be sent back.  When returned, it was delivered by the manager and it was not overcooked. It came back correctly.  The flavor was lacking &#34;something.&#34;  Probably the right amount of cracked pepper and sea salt.  My daughter, the Filet Mignon fanatic, even &#34;passed&#34; on finishing hers which never happens.  The lobster bisque and salads were excellent.  The so-so: ribs were dry and tough.  The sauce tried to make up for it but didn&#39;t get there.  Growing up in KC, these would never have made the plate at most places.  The prawn appetizer came with several prawns improperly deveined.  They were also very dry.  The brownie desert was dry/overcooked.  The fudge cake was &#34;awesome&#34; and maybe saved the day for my daughters.

Pricing...the wine list had a moderate choice.  Sadly, markup is about 4X versus standard 2-3X.  Entrees are appropriately priced.  Salads, soups, appetizers are overpriced by 25-30% versus comparable restaurants.

Four star rating given since it does deliver on the service and steaks.  Portions are appropriate.  Too many &#34;misses&#34; on the food hold it back."

Place is on the pricey side since your meat comes with nothing and all sides are extra. We&#39;ve been to this restaurant a few times so far and every time our meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I am taking a star away for following reasons: food presentation - some dishes look perfectly put together while others appeared sloppy and unappetizing; service - felt forgotten quite a few times, no suggestions from our server and her generally &#34;unhappy about being here&#34; look on our last visit; last reason - side dishes - if you are going to charge me $5-7 for a side dish, please make sure it&#39;s worth that money - our Burgundy mushrooms were so-so, lacking in taste and presentation, Garlic mashed potatoes could&#39;ve been a bit creamier. While some would argue that lumpy drier mashed potatoes can stand up to meat texture I personally believe that contrast in textures of the main dish and a side helps accentuate the the taste of both.

The short: 
Phenomenal service
Steaks are outstanding
Pricing is very reasonable

The longer version :
My family and I went for a small family function. At first they sat us next to the bar which was very crowded and noisy so we asked to be moved. We had three people helping us, including the manager! It was above and beyond.
We all knew how we liked our steaks but weren&#39;t sure which to order. Our server gave us perfect recommendations, even my parents who are extremely picky with their food were impressed.  They were always making sure everything was great.  She didn&#39;t know everything about the wine but was quick to ask a manager for recommendations, which I think is fine (as opposed to just pretending to know and giving crappy recommendations).
Dessert was good but we were so full, we were fine with it.

All-in-all, I&#39;d love to come back here and recommend anyone to check this place out.  I&#39;ve been to several steak houses in Chicago but this is one of the best for the overall experience.

The food was as expected.... properly cooked and good portions.  We had seared ahi tuna for an appetizer.  It was served like sushi in rolls with seaweed and rice.  Excellent!  Next I had lobster bisque and my wife had Cesar salad.  Both were again excellent.  For main course, my wife had &#34;Medallions trio&#34; and I had their signature strip steak.

I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with the fam to celebrate my grad school graduation ((that&#39;s right, I have credentials now!!)). I was surprised to see they have the same menu for lunch and dinner. Nevertheless, there were ample choices and I was ready to chow down. 

First let me start by saying, whatever the little poppyseed donut/bread balls with honey butter are - that ish is like crack. I would have been content having a meal of just those alone. The fact that they&#39;re complimentary is just dangerous.

Since I&#39;m not into red meat and fish I went with the roasted free range half chicken with pancetta, rosemary, shallots, garlic and lemon. It came with a couple sides. I opted for mac n&#39;cheese and spinach. The dish was awesome. The chicken was tender, the mac was creamy, and the spinach was cooked perfectly. I also had a cup of French onion soup. That my friends, is highly recommended. They add a touch of cream to give the broth a slightly creamy, velvety texture. The rest of the fam ordered either burgers or fresh fish. I&#39;m assuming both were good based on the fact that each plate was cleared. 

Service was great. Attentive, quirky, helpful. Not to mention, opinionated. When I told the server I wanted the chicken, he tried to convince me there were much better menu options. I explained I didn&#39;t eat seafood or red meat. He laughed and said good choice. After all, I was eating at a place known for steak and seafood. ((Note - vegetarians beware. There&#39;s not much here for you.))

My previous Stoney River experience was about 4 years ago and remember it being very good then. This time wasn&#39;t any different. I&#39;m glad to see they&#39;re still going strong."

It takes an hour to get a steak (medium). What really stands out is poor customer service and lack of refinement. 

Do yourself a favor: go to a real steakhouse if you are looking for a good steak and relaxed service."
stoney-river-steakhouse-and-grill-deer-park,Tim E.,qmhwPmkoWzjXspconrTCZQ,"Round Lake, IL",0,1,0,26,19,_2I79W2XxVJe1_gdaEKtAA,5.0,2012-12-15,"Stoney River continues to deliver a consistent steak house experience time after time. A recent trip to Vegas that featured a few adventures (and miss-adventures) in some of the celebrity chef&#39;s steak houses sent me back to Stoney last night with dear friends to do a comparison. 

I always love my meal at Stoney and we have enjoyed it at least a half a dozen times in the last several years. Our friends are regulars and still endorse the experience exuberantly. 

Last night was an acid test, so to speak, for me though. After coming off a few less than wonderful experiences in high dollar beef houses ( and I mean high $$ ...See my Carnevino / Mario Batali Steakhouse review) in Vegas I wanted to see if  a Stoney meal would still stand up to tough competition. It did and then some! 

The coffee encrusted filet is always served to perfection. The wait staff stands vigil as you cut through your beef to make absolutely sure you are satisfied. This is a big deal if, like me, you have had to chase down a waiter to re-fire an order that was not cooked properly.  No issues with that at Stoney. They ensure your satisfaction before leaving the table ..... Class. 

The quality of the beef is what it is really about at Stoney. A recent foray into dry aged steaks that were left to hang for 10-12 days did not deliver the flavor of my filet last night. I was &#34;fresh off&#34; the Vegas beef versions and Stoney, in little Deer Park IL, delivered the flavor, tenderness and preparation expertise that pricier establishments often whiff on.  

The servers are courteous and &#34;get&#34; the conversation period that always comes with a &#34;friends at dinner&#34; evening. We were never rushed, although the restaurant was packed. 

The wine selection is always excellent and steakhouse sides (always a favorite reason to go to a steakhouse for dinner) do not disappoint. The service was amazing. Now I will give you that our friends are &#34;regulars&#34; and the staff knows them well, which could affect the impartiality of my service perception, but we have been here solo and always received excellent service.

I would go down the value for the price road, because it is truly a value, but that would actually diminish the perception of Stoney as a stand out steakhouse. Stoney is as good, or better, than many pricier steakhouses. 

I began this review with the word consistent, and it bears repeating. We have all been to restaurants that provide a great experience on a first visit but then when you return and expect the same wonderful meal, you are disappointed. Consistency is the most difficult goal for a restaurant to accomplish. Stoney River pulls it off on every visit.

Go ahead and feed your beef craving at Stoney River ...you will not be disappointed. ...Oh,   ...and have a glass of The Prisoner wine ....really adds to the meal!"

We chose the blue cheese potato chips as an appetizer, because all the other aps were so expensive, and they were very good.  Unfortunately that was the only thing we had that we felt was worth it&#39;s price tag.  Totally agree with the other reviewer who compared these steaks to Outback. The service was very good.  The adult beverages are very expensive.  When we feel like spending this much on a steak house, we drive down the road to Beelow&#39;s in Lake Zurich and always feel like we&#39;ve gotten our moneys worth.  Won&#39;t be coming back here."

They started with these fried bread rolls with honey butter. I could eat those all day. I asked for 3 orders with no shame. Even had some for dessert. 

I had the bone in ribeye, medium rare (it&#39;s what REAL women eat!) and it was cooked perfectly and delicious. I really liked how they had you cut into the steak to make sure it was done to your liking. The mashed potatoes were.. well.. mashed potatoes. 

My fiance got the steak and lobster deal that they had going on. UNFORTUNATELY, these guys are not good at cooking lobster. It was very rubbery and over cooked. My fiance wished he did without it and got something else, but his steak was pretty good. 

Would we go there again? Yes. Is it the best steak house I&#39;ve ever been to? No. 

With that being said, I gave the place 4 stars for the over cooked lobster but AWESOME  bread rolls."

I had the legendary petite filet. Perfectly cooked and amazing. I&#39;m gluten free, so I got a potato and veggie mix for my sides. I tried the Gascon Malbec, which turned out to be a great choice!

The waiter did a great job and was sure to double check menu items for gluten and took my dietary restriction seriously. He was also very patient since half of our party was on time and the other half was running really late. 

Great for a date night or celebration, or for whenever you feel like a fancypants steak!"

We arrived early (about 5:30pm) and were seated immediately. Our wait person, a woman, was excellent. Friendly and helpful and totally appropriate. She took good care of us. We each had steaks - my wife the beef tenderloin filet and potatoes au gratin (which she thought were a bit under cooked yet good), I had the NY strip with a baked potato. Each of the steaks were prepared to perfection. The meat is excellent quality as to taste and tenderness. The rolls served with the meal were very good. My wife had a ceasar salad and I had the onion soup au gratin for starters. Both were excellent. We skipped dessert. We had a good experience. We will return."

The fiance loved it, I loved it, had a generally great time. Service was great, the food was all excellent, and it was just a great experience.

What to say? Yelp says that this is a &#34;$$&#34; restaurant, while I would class it as quite expensive. Worth it, but you&#39;re going to be spending money.

The food - top notch, all of it was great. We topped the meal off with tiramisu, which was par for the course and great. Tasted fresh and espresso-y :)

Hm, if I broke the drink list off separate I would give it 4 stars, and maybe this is unfair. The beer list is slated with lousy domestic/macrobrews and a bunch of IPAs. Of course, it&#39;s a white-linen-table-cloth Italian restaurant, you&#39;re here for the wine right? Maybe a funky spirit? Not me, I&#39;m a beer guy through and through, and I like microbrews that are not IPAs. I was SOL, drank an IPA and it was OK. Underwhelmed on that front, but everywhere else Gianni&#39;s delivers :) Would go back in a heartbeat."

Awesome decor, lovely restaurant, complimentary valet, good specials on some nights. However, I really wish the food tasted better or the service was better. Our waitress meant well but sadly was inadequate to serve our big party of 12. I wouldn&#39;t mind giving Gianni&#39;s another try in the future but will definitely have to order something I have not tried- which, I feel like we tried a lot of things off the menu:

Appetizers: grilled calamari was probably the most enjoyed, but the other appetizers we munched on while we waited a while for our orders to even be taken included the fried calamari, bruschetta, and stuffed mushrooms. 

Salmon almondine: I honestly ordered this dish to avoid a saucy entree, but that is exactly what I got. This salmon was swimming in sauce, which ruined the taste for me. My grandma had gotten  the sea bass, which was a lot lighter and tastier in my opinion. 

The desserts were rich and tasty- I especially liked mixing the chocolate cake with the carrot cake. 

Overall, we were treated well, but our dinner took so long because of the extremely slow service and the several mistakes we encountered. If I enjoyed my main entree more, I maybe would have had a better opinion on Gianni&#39;s, but sadly I was disappointed after the recommendations I had gotten to try this place out. Lots of potential though, so maybe next time will be better!"

I had been recommended the place by a dear friend who dines here regularly. We were all really excited because we saw that braciole on the menu. We all ordered it and about 5 minutes into eating, I see my mom having difficulty with the meat. It looked as though she was fighting with some burnt  cheese or bad piece of onion or something. I help her pull it out and it is a HUGE WAD OF SARAN WRAP that had been cooked in her food!!! 

This has never happened anywhere I have dined before. It looked like something straight out of a movie. It was so disgusting that none of us even wanted to finish our meal anymore. We alerted the waitress who was very sincere in apologizing and a fresh one was brought to my mom. However, since they tried to hurry up and cook it, the bottom half of it was burnt. The manager came out and explained that the braciole braises for 4 hours in the morning and then they wrap them with saran wrap to keep them fresh until they are reheated and that the wrap must have gotten stuck and inadvertently ended up on the plate.

The issue was handled promptly and we were not charged for the bad dish. Despite it being handled correctly I would not recommend this place to anyone because of this. Yes, mistakes happen, but this one left everyone feeling very disgusting. And the sad part was that it was supposed to be a nice meal to congratulate my mom and new step dad and instead resulted in disgust, tarnishing the day and gesture."

I &#34;edited&#34; my reservation about 5-6 times because the time and amount of people kept changing. It was done online which was super easy and quick. Then we got to the restaurant and were 10 min late but they had no problem still getting us a table. The food was amazing and fresh. Made to eat omlettes. A few guests of our party said the bacon was comparable to &#34;beggin&#39; strips&#34;. The service however, on the slow side. Our server seemed like she would rather be anywhere but here. It honestly wasn&#39;t that busy so you can&#39;t blame it on that. The $5 unlimited mimosas kept getting more orange after the first glass, so technically you&#39;re getting $5 unlimited orange juice.

This is my Husbands  yearly go to for his birthday. It&#39;s far from us, but he loves it so we go every year. We had a rather large party and our waitress did the best she could with us.  She was very nice. 

Anyway, I told her i needed to eat gluten free and she said no problem. I ordered a gf pasta and asked if the sauce was gf and she said yes. I then picked a salad as my side and she asked what dressing. I remembered from last time that I couldn&#39;t have dressing, so I questioned her and she said let me check. I was correct and could only have oil and vinegar


Our dishes came out and omg. So.  Amazing. This pasta melted in my mouth. It tasted like heaven in a bowl. Cheesy, red peppery, deliciousness.  

So Ali, why the two stars?  That makes no sense. 

10 minutes go by and my friend goes &#39;you don&#39;t look good&#39;. I was hot, my face was insanely red and I was in pain. 

I am usually weird about using public bathrooms, but I rushed into the bathroom and well, my dinner didn&#39;t stay down. 

I&#39;ve never had a reaction like that before. Was it gluten? Was it a bad something in the food?  Idk....but my body wanted it out. 

My husband got mad at me for paying the bill and said I should have said some thing. I didn&#39;t want to embarrass myself or  the party and honestly, I just wanted to get home. I&#39;m not sure if I would give them another chance though. I was so disappointed."

Large portion pastas good for two meals. There are set dishes + create your own pasta section. Everything was solid Italian American cuisine, the only thing I LOVED was their chicken/lemon soup (Avgolemeno-like). There is a little bit of something for everyone. 

There are TVs in the bar, enjoyed the open kitchen layout. Probably due to server sectioning our corner of the restaurant was full and the tables were too close in proximity. The middle of the dining room was empty - not sure if this was in anticipation of later reservations. Spent the entire meal shifting my seat so people at other tables could get past or to let food be served/table be cleared which was distracting. Server was pleasant and flow of meal was fine.

The comment about the hostess&#39; pants was unfair, and for that I apologize. However the rest of my review is accurate.  I appreciate that Gianni&#39;s is a small business.  In fact that is one of the reasons we started going there in the first place.  We had been going to Gianni&#39;s  for years, usually at least once a week.  In fact it was our go to restaurant.   We have probably dined at Gianni&#39;s more than 100 times over the years. I know what it used to be.  The current Gianni&#39;s is a shadow of what it used to be.   While it&#39;s nice to hear that you are using locally sourced and organic ingredients.  What&#39;s done with those ingredients. Is lacking and uninspired.    A builder can use the finest stone and lumber but if he or she doesn&#39;t care or know what they are doing all you&#39;ll end up with is an expensive pile of sticks and stones.  The fact that they serve Tiramisu that was made &#34;a couple of days ago&#34; pretty much sums it up.... We stopped going there approximately  a year ago due to their decline.  While we were hoping they improved,  this last visit confirmed we made the right decision.  We will not be returning.  There are many better options for Italian and Mediterranean food in the area."

The hostess seemed caught off guard. When I walked into the restaurant, I knew why. The place is relatively spacious, and there were only a handful of people in the dining area. 

We were seated promptly, and our waitress was quick to come talk to our table about the specials and the available beer options. They have a decent amount of craft beer options. 

They start you off with bread and oil with grated parmesan. The real parmesan not the cheese dust that you usually get. 

The menu has enough items to give you a good variety without overwhelming you. All the descriptions sound delicious. The orders were varied at our table. The baked shrimp (very garlicky with angel hair pasta, cheese and bread crumbs), tilapia vesuvio, spaghetti with meatballs, and I ordered one of the specials of the day, meatball stuffed chicken parmesan. 

You read that correctly. They took a delicious chicken breast and stuffed it with their meatballs, breaded it and fried it. Then they topped it with marinara and giardiniera on a bed of penne pasta. It was glorious. I only ate half of it. The other half made for an excellent lunch at work on Monday. 

The food was outstanding, the atmosphere was nice (I wonder how it is on busier nights), service was good, and the menu is varied but manageable. I definitely plan on returning."

Recently we took my inlaws to brunch there as the Milrose no longer offers a brunch. The Brunch had an Italian slant to it offering Italian sausage and a few pasta dishes. The two main negative was the seating was very cramped and difficult to navigate to the buffet as well as the omelet my husband received was too oily to eat. We may try again in the future but good to know in Downtown Palatine there is still a place to have brunch.

Was walking by the establishment last week and saw they were advertising a Saturday brunch.  Talk about a SPREAD!!!  Their options were amazing!! Their food quality was amazing!!  Our waitress was friendly and quick to fill up our beverages!  All in all I would say this is the best thing going in palatine for brunch!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

The decor and vibe are nice.  The service was friendly and attentive.  They seemed to to do a lot to make sure every issue was resolved.

The soups choices were a bit uninspired (Pasta Fagiole, Minestrone, Chicken Noodle - meh).  We all just went with salads.

For apps, we got stuffed mushroom caps which the wives enjoyed very much and were very filling.  My buddy and I shared toasted ravioli which was &#34;okay&#34;.

Entrees were much better.  I got the stuffed chicken.  Very good!  The wives had seafood / pasta dishes and commented how generous the portions were and that they really liked the taste of the dishes.  My buddy had the baseball filet.  It was overcooked so he needed to send it back (but he has a habit of doing that).  They corrected the error quickly and without excuses.  

Overall, I would rate Gianni&#39;s very highly on food quality, service, decor and vibe.  Prices were about what you would expect.  

It&#39;s also close (walking distance) to the nightlife in Palatine."

Really glad we all went as the food is fantastic. We all tried almost everything on the buffet that day and the food is great and we all cannot wait to go again. The service was great too. Whatever bacon they use on the buffet is excellent ... what a great flavor. I could not stop eating it. We ate so much from the buffet that we were all too full to try the omlets or the fresh made pasta so maybe next time. We all will definitely be back!

First, the food is good.  Traditional Italian cooking with flair and variety.  Pasta, fish, meats and oysters are on the menu.  From eggplant to shrimp, each meal served and shared at our table received high marks.

Now the strange.  We were seated for an early dinner (5:30) for 7 people and the tables are so close that seating, let alone serving, was a chore.  How can you seat guests at a round table the server can&#39;t even reach or walk around?  Although the place was empty when we arrived, other diners were seated at one end of the restaurant and then packed in like sardines in a can.  Conversations were overheard as other diners are an arm length or less.  Two very large dining areas are underutilized at the detriment of the diners.

One note about the calamari.  It is served fried, grilled or with two spicy seasonings.  We ordered  the milder of the spicy offering and it came out limp and covered with a butter like coating over the fried exterior.  Not spicy in the least.  Made an otherwise exceptional and generous plate of calamari go dead.  We did see many others order the super spicy plate and enjoying the outcome."

Beautiful restaurant, excellent and expansive buffet brunch with made-to-order omelet and pasta stations.  Great value at $17.50 per person.   Only negative was the service was extremely slow.  Took 15 minutes for our party of 10 to have a server come to the table, clearing plates and filling water glasses took long and we waited 20 minutes for our check after our plates were cleared.

We will be back!"

Then I  the filet mignon trio. One of the 3 fillets were cooked correctly at medium rare, was tasty and seasoned well.  The other two were so overcooked they tasted like a burger. The side of broccoli was the star of this dish and delicious. The broccoli florets are enormous and you get 2  pieces. 
My better half had the Chicken Marsala. She enjoyed it. You will probably have some to take home as they give you three chicken breasts. 
The beer selection was very good with a good amount of craft selections. There is also a good wine list and original cocktails.
The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very nice. Our drink glasses were almost always empty before we were checked on and offered another. (in my experience this is usually always the tell tale sign weather you will get good or poor service)
We did enjoy the atmosphere.
Overall it was OK. We will give it another shot as it could have just been an off night."

I&#39;ve only been to Gianni&#39;s once and it was a great experience. The restaurant has a unique atmosphere with an open kitchen. We were seated at a regular table, but, there is also a kitchen side table that looks like it would be fun to watch and eat. I had gnocchi bolognese, the gnocchi was fresh made and just the way the pasta should be. My fiancee had chicken piccata and the chicken was perfectly cooked.

I&#39;m giving five stars because the service was great despite the place being insanely busy given the holiday. They have a really convenient system for making reservations online and even email you a reminder the day prior! The decor and ambiance were cool. I had a linguine dish with clams and tiramisu for dessert which were both delicious. The food is a bit pricey (but worth it) so I probably won&#39;t be coming here often but it&#39;s great for a once in a while/special occasion dinner.

The decor of this place is really beautiful.  My aspiring interior designer girlfriend couldn&#39;t keep her eyes off the sconces, the paintings on the walls, and the elegant Italian decorations.  

She had a glass of sauvignon blanc and I ordered a Peroni.  Our attentive bartender brought us a delicious loaf of crusty bread and freshly grated parmesan, basil, and olive oil spread.  We ordered the bruschetta and the sausage and peppers appetizer.  This is hands down the tastiest, most filling $10 we&#39;ve ever spent.  The tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted like they were just picked off the vine.  The bruschetta bread was perfectly toasted; it had a great balance of crunch and softness.  The sausage and peppers was enormous!  The marinara sauce they use in the dish is so good, I used the remainder of the original loaf of bread to soak up the sauce and shove it down my gullet.

We were legitimately full after the two appetizers.  Apparently, they have an Italian carrot cake, but there was no room to order it.  We will definitely be back!

We were originally seated at a terrible table where two people would have been eating where two uneven tables came together. Then we waited forever for a server and even long for drinks. Very little follow up   Not enough water refills. Typically one does not tip as much for a buffer but we were charged 20% as a gratuity since there were 8 of us.   Absolutely not even close to 20% service and I am a generous tipper. Then I noted this to the hostess who just sort or shrugged.  We won&#39;t be back

First impression was we were way underdressed but got past that and went in.  The dining room looked bigger but the tables were packed in fairly tightly and conversation was challenging since it was quite loud inside.   

The menu was fairly standard italian and the waitress took her time to explain her favorites.    The bus boy brought out a generous portion of bread and oil/cheese/garlic mixture to nosh on while waiting.

Started with the baked clams which were soggy but flavored well.   If they had been broiled harder at the end, they would have been better.   Soup them came out and was minestrone and pasta e fagioli - both were excellent.

For entrees, we had braciole and country rigatoni.   The braciole was set on top of a linguine with marinara - the braciole itself was tender but could have used more flavoring in the middle as it was a   bit flavorless.   It was better when additional sauce was added on top.  The country rigatoni was a nice dish of chicken/sausage and peas in a combined marinara and alfredo sauce.   It tasted good but was better the second day when i added more pasta into the leftover as the dish was very saucy.

Overall, was happy with the place and would consider another trip if in the area."

Did not care for fried ravioli because the breading was overwhelming.  The gnocchi and cavatappi were good, but probably would have been better if they were homemade (waitress said nothing is homemade).  My mom really liked her minestrone and my dad really liked the Italian dressing.  
I wish they would have done something better than a bowl of ice cream for my brother for his birthday.  I talked to the hostess (so it would be a surprise for him), and she told me it would be one thing.  I wish they would have just had me pick something from the menu, because I would have gotten him something different and just paid extra for it.  
Lastly, when we called to make reservation we asked them if it was child friendly and they said yes.  However, I think this is more of a date place.  I also don&#39;t think you can call your restaurant child friendly unless you have a children&#39;s menu.
I wouldn&#39;t NOT go back here, but I have been to better Italian places, and I wouldn&#39;t go back with my 4 yr old."

The food was fine. We had the Sicilian calamari to start. The flavor was nice but the sauce made the breading get soggy very quickly and after five minutes or so all the breading was soggily sliding off the calamari. We didn&#39;t finish it. Next, we shared the chicken francese for our main course. Nice big portion size to share. Good sauce and the chicken was cooked nicely. It was a-ok, but nothing special for the price. We shared the chocolate lava cake for dessert. It was pretty good but not very hot. All in all the meal was fine, but I&#39;d rather dine elsewhere in Palatine."

Needless to say I ate a few bites and was like.... let&#39;s not. But my dinner companion got sick and we are thinking it was the salad. Mainly because the rest of our food was pretty good.

The menu is huge and includes a great variety of things from pasta dishes and salads to fish, chicken and veal.  My favorite meal, the pumpkin ravioli, is only offered in October, but is truly worth a trip in.  The meals come with soup or salad and both are excellent choices.  The desserts are pretty awesome too, especially the carrot cake.  Big enough for four people to share.  

The servers all really know the menu, will offer suggestions and don&#39;t rush you through your meal at all.  

The only down side to this place, and it&#39;s pretty trivial, is that the tables seem pretty close together and I got knocked into a bunch of times, but that&#39;s not a big deal really."

The answer to that question is a table full of loud, drunk, people who had no respect for anyone else dining last night.
But in reality the answer is that it is NEVER okay.
Ignorant people, the world is full of them, and we were &#34;lucky&#34; enough to sit next to a table of them at Gianni&#39;s in downtown Palatine last night.
One would have thought that at some point the manager would have stopped by the &#34;loud&#34; table and asked them to be a little quieter...didn&#39;t happen.
One would have thought that, when we decided to stand up and say this isn&#39;t okay, the manager would have come over to see what was wrong...didn&#39;t happen.
One would have thought that at that point the manager would have asked the &#34;loud&#34; table to leave...didn&#39;t happen. Oh yeah, turns out a couple of the people at the &#34;loud&#34; table were friends of the manager and it was easier for him to cover our bill and apologize (I use that term very loosely) then do the right thing.
I&#39;m not going to go into the details, but I&#39;m proud that we stood up and said this isn&#39;t okay. I wish more people would. I also wish that more people, before opening their mouths and spewing garbage, would think because the comment they are making is about a human being."

It is our Friday night spot in Downtown Palatine. The wait staff know us by name and we always take a seat by the kitchen to watch the chefs work their magic. 

The wine list never disappoints. We usually go for the J Lohr cabernet or a glass of the Ruffalo Chianti. Both are delicious.

The pasta dishes are classic and the flavors are bright and clear. Only about 3 ingredients in each dish so nothing is overwhelming. The daily specials are always impressive. We tried grilled calamari diablo last Friday and it was a spicy treat.  My mother always orders lobster ravioli, even if it&#39;s not on the menu. It is a great dish (the appetizer portion is more than enough for a full entree). They&#39;re very accomodating with non-menu orders like that.

I always have leftovers for a day or two! The portions are huge. Basically, we are big fans of Gianni&#39;s and will keep going there as long as the quality stays at the level it is now!

The reason I have stayed away for a year-plus is that I just didn&#39;t feel the food warranted the prices they charge.  
For the money we would spend at Gianni&#39;s I felt we had better food, better wait staff and an overall better dining experience at other places in Palatine like Artistic Cuisine, Amore Mio or Agio.

Our most recent excursion to Gianni&#39;s was in line with what we&#39;ve experienced in the past, with a surprise the next morning.

As it was a bit late, we decided to split a salad and entree.
We had 2 glasses of wine, the Gorgonzola salad and the special entree, veal ravioli on a bed of spinach.

While the Gorgonzola salad was not bad, it was not particularly memorable either.  It was essentially a chopped salad with what appeared to be a couple tablespoons of crumbled Gorgonzola cheese and pecans or walnuts sprinkled in.
It was an utterly forgettable start to our meal.
I suppose I was disappointed because I was expecting something more like the Mista salad at Artistic Cuisine, which is excellent and a great way to start.

The &#34;special&#34; entree left a lot to be desired as well.  We each ended up with about 3 of the veal ravioli pillows.  Remember, we split a single order.
The spinach was sauteed but completely flavorless.
More concerning was that the veal raviolis had an odd flavor to them.
My girlfriend had trouble getting past the texture of the ground veal (way too coarse), but she also felt there was something off in the flavor, and therefore only ate 1 of the 3.
I, on the other hand, powered through and poked down all three, attributing the flavor to a really odd spice that I couldn&#39;t put my finger on.

The best thing about this meal was the bread and olive oil on the table.

So, to refresh, 2 glasses of wine, 1 Gorgonzola salad (shared), 1 veal ravioli entree (shared)... Price $58 and change.
We spent about the same during a recent trip to Amore Mio and the food was perfect!

But wait, there&#39;s more.
In addition to the poor excuse for a salad and entree, the rather inattentive service and the absurd price, we both woke early with another surprise.
A bit of gastro-intestinal distress.
Had it only been one of us, I would not bring it up, but since this was the only meal we shared during the day and it was later in the day, the timing works out right.
In addition, my girlfriend apparently only had the problem the following morning while I endured the fruits of my gluttony for &#34;cleaning&#34; my plate, several times during the day.

Bottom line:
Overpriced, mediocre food and inattentive servers coupled with the potential for food poisoning will leave Gianni&#39;s off our list for the foreseeable future."

The restaurant was so awesome in accommodating our group and in making sure we had everything we needed to have a wonderful party!!  The service was excellent and the food was really good!!  The brunch had shrimp cocktail, nice cold salads, hot breakfast items such as bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, French Toast, Eggs Benedict, and diced potatoes...as well as an omelet station.  The mini meatballs were outstanding.  There were also sausage and peppers, lemon chicken, cheese ravioli and other pasta too.  There were some sweets too, but I didn&#39;t pay much attention since we brought in our own bakery cake for my Mom&#39;s birthday celebration.  They were also helpful in slicing and serving the cake for us as well.  The price of the brunch is a steal for what you get.  In conclusion, we were thrilled with our decision to have the party here and will definitely be back!  I highly recommend this restaurant!!"

Busy Bar, crowded restaurant, exposed kitchen! really enjoyed the food...and wine! Service was just average, server never introduced herself, and was very quick to leave our table. Servers nowadays should do more than just serve, they should make sure your leaving happy. Overall, I would definitely return to this restaurant!"

I ended up adding grilled chicken and tomatoes in mine. I was disappointed to see when they came out that there did not appear to be any extra tomatoes than the others at my table&#39;s meals.  A bit ridiculous for the amount they up charge you for it.  If I hadn&#39;t been in a party with 3 friends I don&#39;t see very often, I probably would have asked to have them added but being in a group I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it.

None the less, the sauce had excellent flavor and large portion sizes."

The appetizer was served with no plates, even though it was clear that we would be splitting it.  Then, a waitress spilled a whole tray of drinks on my girlfriend.  So there she is, sitting there with various beverages dumped on her, SOAKING WET and all we got was &#34;sorry&#34; and off the waitress went.   

No manager came by to apologize....no break was made on the tab to pay for drycleaning....NOTHING.  I understand accidents happen, but this was not handled in an appropriate manner for a quality restaurant.

This put a huge damper on the evening.  We finished quickly and just wanted to get out of there, so we decided to take our food to go.  They didn&#39;t even provide a bag for us to take home the wrapped up food.  

The seating is VERY cramped in this establishment.    This is what caused the spill.  Another accident almost happened as they set a tray down, right behind a man who was backing out of his seat.

I won&#39;t ever go back there."

Since we try to taste different brunches in a 50 mile radius, 4 times a year is high on our attendance. And due to my work schedule, we can only go every other Sunday. This means only 26 Sundays are available.
This time I brought my son and his girlfriend. They loved it.
This is a very cozy restaurant. The tables are no closer together than at most restaurants.
The food choices are wonderful...
Calamari, pasta, omelet and pasta station, bacon, sausage, giant broccoli florets, ravioli, eggs Benedict, french toast, and it doesn&#39;t stop there. Delicious dessert table. My son loved the chocolate cake. I&#39;m a cannoli and carrot cake girl myself. I wanted to shove some of the cannoli in my purse for later. :)
We were so lucky to have Mary as our server today. The brunch closes at 2, and we got there at 1:15. Mary was so friendly. Not overbearing, and knew just when to come and fill our $5 bottomless Mimosa&#39;s. And with 45 minutes remaining, she did not chase us out. Since the servers attitude is at least 30% of the experience, if not more, I find it very important to mention this. 
It&#39;s a great place to make your own."

Our service was very good the whole evening. Bread and the olive oil mix is good but a little strong for starters. Grilled calamari &amp; vegetables was very good. Antipasto plate was average, 2 deli meats (no prosciutto or salami), two cheeses (nothing special, seemed like they were really to mix in other things). Drinks were good. Linguini &amp; Clams was good but pasta was overcooked. I got Carbonara on linguini w/ shrimp. Shrimp were very good added into the dish. Pasta was overcooked and it comes out so hot it just keeps cooking. The big issue I have is there was WAY to much sauce as with most American Italian spots. I couldn&#39;t eat it because it was to overpowering. The sauce was good but there was just too much of it. They did add more pasta to it before I took it home but I still added double the pasta after the fact. It was still crazy flavorful! Desert = Carrot Cake (Italian carrot cake?) It was one of the best I&#39;ve had!

Overall remind them al dente and easy sauce if your sensitive to that sort of thing. I personally love pasta and don&#39;t want it to just be a sauce carrier!! These guys do have a good selection of sauces which is a bonus, anything from mild to full flavored. I will go back."

Reminds me a lot of Maggiano&#39;s, except it&#39;s smaller and feels more quaint. The service was good as we never had to wait too long on refills or any of our drinks orders. We were there slightly later, around 9pm, so the restaurant was quieting down so can&#39;t speak to how service would be during peak hours.

The house salad starters were just okay. I made the mistake of not getting my dressing on the side and they kind of just glob in on there, so be sure you ask for it on the side unless you enjoy soggy lettuce. The entrees were absolutely delicious and the portion sizes are huge. Per recommendation for our waitress, I tried the Country Rigatoni which I loved. My GF had their Gnoochi which she seemed to really enjoy as well. 

The prices are a bit higher than typical Italian restaurants, but not outrageously so at all. Plus you are basically guaranteed left overs so that&#39;s always nice. 

Would definitely go back if I&#39;m in the Palatine area again."

The tables are very close together, the room is loud and the service left something to be desired.

Our ALL time fave dish here is the Tortellini Con Prosciutto. The chocolate layer cake is the best ever! And the portion given is HUGE!!!

Today was my son&#39;s (who is home alone for a week , because he has to work) birthday, so being a thoughtful father, I took him to dinner at Gianni&#39;s.  His favorite type of food is Italian.

We arrived at about 7:30 pm and were seated promptly.  Our wait-person arrived at our table just after a bus-person placed some bread and olive oil dip and water on the table.  

We had pretty much decided on what we would order, so she took our order immediately and brought our drinks.  

We split an order of bruschetta for an appetizer.  It was very good.  It tasted like there was just a bit of anchovy in the topping, which gave it a  nice flavor.

My son ordered linguine with whole clams in white sauce, which he said was outstanding.  I ordered the braciole flank steak, which was listed as a house speciality, and  because of Lisa D&#39;s rave review.

I have never had that dish before, so it is hard to make a comparison, but I thought that the meat was over-done, (maybe that&#39;s the way it is supposed to be).  I also could not taste any cheese in it.  I&#39;m not saying it was bad, but I would not order it again.

We were so full, that there was no room left for dessert.

The service was excellent, but then it was a Thursday night, and the place was not too crowded.

I will definitely return, but next time I will order the Veal ala Parmesan.  That dish is my measure for the quality of the food.  If the V ala P is as good as it should be,  I&#39;ll upgrade my review of Gianni&#39;s"

Or maybe change the sauce they use to something else. They do have some good grilled calamari though, I recommend it with their spicy tomato sauce instead of the usually.  Also, if you like mussels this is the place for you. It&#39;s probably my favorite thing on the menu - this is of course not counting their tiramisu. 

Everything on the dessert menu is great, especially the tiramisu and chocolate cake."

I went here for a mother&#39;s day dinner on the Saturday before mother&#39;s day.  I ordered the Lake Superior whitefish special (fish in a white wine, lemon, and caper sauce over a bed of sauteed spinach).  I was up sick late into the night afterwards.  The food tasted ok, the portions were huge, but definitely not worth the food poisoning!  I guess at least it was me and not my mother-in-law who got sick...

Also, the decor of this place is a carbon copy of Biaggi&#39;s, which I thought was a little weird."

Pros:  Good food and kitchen staff who are willing to accommodate dietary restrictions.

Cons:  Terrible service and over-priced for Italian food.  The hostess didn&#39;t even acknowledge us as we walked through the empty foyer to leave.  

At the end of the day, if you have a few hours to spare for a meal and you don&#39;t mind inept wait staff, go ahead and give it a try."

She then suggested a few of her favorite dishes to us and explained to us that we could order half size orders of the pasta dishes which was perfect.  I went with the alfredo sauce which was the best alfredo sauce I&#39;ve had!!  My boyfriend had the suprema sauce which was delicious too!

I tried to give some ideas for substitutions going as far to suggest a few cut up cucumbers that could have come out of the salad my husband ordered.  I was accused of asking for free food.

I had the grilled calamari for an appetizer.  This was probably the best part of my meal.  The house salad was very average as was my entree, meat ravioli.  The ravioli were SO THICK (the dough, not the meat), that after a few pieces, I lost my appetite.  I also had a pineapple-infused vodka, and I believe it had to have been watered down.  I&#39;ve had the pineapple-infused vodka at Morton&#39;s, and Gianni&#39;s tasted like water.  I guess that&#39;s the difference between a 5-star restaurant and a place like Gianni&#39;s.  My friend ordered the cheesecake, and ended up sending it back because of the poor quality.  It was clearly store-bought.  I feel this restaurant is way over-priced for its very average atmosphere and food.  Ti Amo is far above in quality and taste if you want Italian food.  Was my first and last time at Gianni&#39;s.

Got seated immediately upon arrival. Looking around, there was indeed a large crowd, mostly folks in their 50s and up and a few large tables of family reunions with multi generations enjoying a good Italian meal. So a good Italian meal with efficient service at a good pace so you can carry a conversation is what you come for and is what you get.
The highlights of our evening: 
- professional service
- the grilled calamari as apetizer was excellent. It melted in the mouth came prepared with asparagus and sun dried tomato.
- the main dishes: the halibut and the shrimp risotto were excellent as well. We were advised of the &#34;richness&#34; of the risotto and they were not kidding. So stay away from that dish is you are watching your waist line or can&#39;t digest fat heavy stuff. In contrast the halibut was good and a much healthier preparation. Slightly breaded it didn&#39;t feel oily at all and came with a small spinach salad as a side dish. Just perfect. Note, it was a bit on the sweet side with some rum flavor notes.
- the true highlight of the meal: Tiramisu. Worth saving space for it. It was just perfect, not overwhelming sweet and so moist.
To sump up: solid Italian food with good service for a perfect evening. So why not 5 stars: well a bit too &#34;Americanized&#34; when it comes to the dishes. Would love to see Pana Cotta on the dessert menu for example."

They give you a nice dish of olive oil, fresh parmesan cheese and basil for dipping the wonderful warm, flaky crust Italian bread.  The tri-colored Cheese tortellini in a cream sauce with prosciutto, peas, and mushrooms was very good, although the prosciutto was a little saltier than usual.  The Bolognese meat sauce on the manicotti was fabulous, one of the best sauces I&#39;ve ever had.  Ambience is very nice.
 
Only reason I didn&#39;t rate this as 4 stars was the inconsistent service.  The staff was very efficient and professional.  On the plus side service was quick, the kids split the tortellini and they automatically divided it between 2 plates without asking, they quickly corrected a salad error and kept the water glasses full.  On the minus side they didn&#39;t ask if we wanted second glasses of wine and didn&#39;t refill the ice tea.  We also mentioned that our daughter choose the restaurant for her birthday to both the hostess and the waitress, neither acknowledged her and neither offered anything special for the birthday girl."

Tried the Bulls, blue pointe, California, Philadelphia, spicy salmon and a roll with fried leeks on it (don&#39;t recall the name). Everything was amazing. Prices are about average for a good sushi place. By good I mean you are getting nice quality sushi. 

Went back 2 days later because I just had to get more of the Bulls and blue pointe sushi rolls. They were so damn good. 

Place is pretty small so it gets packed quickly. Your best bet is to park in the parking garage below the shopping center. 

We will be going back and telling others about this place."

Pros: Nice place; Fantastic service; Great sushi; Indoor Parking (so convenient during winter);

Cons: It&#39;s not a cheap place, but you get what you pay for :).

Tips: You have to try their Miso!!! Use underground parking during winter.

Details: I was planning for Valentine&#39;s and my fiance loves sushi. Combine the fact that Wildfish is the best sushi place around and no-brainer I made a reservation and we ended up there. I was so happy that we didn&#39;t have to drive to Chicago, this year it was a snowy Valentine&#39;s Day.

We parked our car underground (tons of parking); stopped by Star Cinema Grill to check show times and still came to Wildfish 20 min earlier than reservation. They were supper nice and gave us a table. We had 50 min before movie, which is not that much at all taking into consideration that restaurant was packed.

Wildfish is always nice, clean and gives you feeling of luxury. This time they added beautiful Valentine&#39;s balloons on the walls and special candles to keep the atmosphere romantic.

We shared our time concerns with waitress and she was SUPPER!!! Everything was prepared and served quickly. Without too much thinking, at least from my side, we ordered: House Cucumber Roll Salad; Green Dragon; Scottish Salmon.

Their Miso was amazing! It was rich in flavor and content. House Cucumber Roll Salad was magnificently refreshing. I am not a salad guy, but I have to admit, it was a very nice appetizer.

Green Dragon and Scottish Salmon were delicious!!! All in my alley - sweet and tender :). Another thing that I wanted to point out: their decoration of dishes is astonishing!!! Every dish is aesthetically beautiful - such a pleasure!!!

We finished our dinner right on time to watch a movie at the Star Cinema Grill. It was a good experience as well. However, for that you will need to read my next review :)."

We had 7pm reservations on this Tuesday night.  We were seated at 7:10 and ordered at 7:20.  Our salad and miso soup arrived at 8:05 and the waitress used the excuse that they made a fresh batch of miso.  But if that is true why didn&#39;t they bring the salad right away.  When we asked the other waitress where our food was she said our waitress had a lot of tables!  Not our problem.....Then my wife&#39;s Scottish salmon arrived cold an hour 55 minutes after we ordered.  The blue point roll was good but after all the delay I&#39;m pretty sure I would have been happy with anything. The waitress never stopped by to ask how everything was and we tried a number of times to flag her down to no avail.  There was obviously also no one in charge.  This restaurant has a long way to go before we would spend another $74 there again-ridiculous.  Also, very apathetic once we did tell our waitress how unhappy we were about the poor service"

This place is a little hard to find if you&#39;re not familiar with the area but worth the hunt. They offer a variety of fresh sushi and sashimi as well as other Japanese dishes. My wife and I enjoy sitting at the sushi bar to watch all the different items being prepared by the chefs. it is always interesting to view their knife skills. They can get pretty busy on weekends so I suggest you get there early if you don&#39;t have a reservation.

The sashimi appetizer platter was super amazingly delicious. The sauce on the fish is impeccable and the fish melted in your mouth. As for the rolls, we had the tried and true Philly role which also included avocado in addition to the cucumber which it often doesn&#39;t at other places. Also, the side salad came in a super tasty wonton bowl for added crunch. Yum yum. Lastly we tried a special roll which I can&#39;t recall which one but it was super tasty.

We got an appetizer and 3 rolls to share between 2 people and we were stuffed! I would say the cost is on the higher end for sushi but for the size and quality of the rolls makes it worth it.  There is occasionally a Groupon, so check that out before going. 

Getting seated was a little bit of an issue to start.  The hostess seemed overwhelmed (it was 7:00 on a Friday night) as there were a lot of couples  coming in as well as a larger party. After a little confusion and a short wait we were able to get a table.  We then had a bit of a wait for our server to come over after being seated but after that, the service was great.  In the future I&#39;ll make a reservation!

The street parking situation around the restaurant is a pain; I recommend just going to the underground parking garage, from there the stairs lead right up to the restaurant."

Don&#39;t even think of making a reservation using OpenTable (which they signed up for) and Groupon (which they signed up for) on the same visit! They ask you to cancel your OpenTable reservation when you arrive (cheating OpenTable so they don&#39;t have to pay) and cheating you out of your OpenTable points.

I ordered a couple of vegetarian rolls, one being with cream cheese and jalapeño with soybean paper. When my order came out, they didn&#39;t use soybean paper. I asked for it to be corrected which they did.  We could see my food sitting on the counter for 15 minutes after they re-made it since we were sitting right in front of the sushi bar. No one bothered to bring me my food and of course we couldn&#39;t find our waitress either. 

Once I finally got my food again, they didn&#39;t have any jalapeños inside like I had requested. Instead of addressing the problem our waitress just walked off when I told her about it and avoided us until my husband finally asked her for our bill.

Initially, when she bought the bill, she said she didn&#39;t charge us for cream cheese/jalapeño roll. However, she did charge us for it. Upon asking, she said &#34;I told you I wasn&#39;t going to charge for soybean paper.&#34; Seriously, what the heck? She straight up lied to us and never once did she apologize or tried to recover the damage. Very disappointed with the rudeness.

This isn&#39;t ordinary sushi...it is hand crafted by a sushi master.  Have been here a handful of times and tried many, many nigiri and maki rolls. I always start with the Dynamite sushi appetizer, rice paper wrapped fresh salmon with a nice mint leaf (this is truly dynamite and the mint takes this to another level).  The White Sox (another favorite, the sushi that is :) Wild Volcano, Crunchy Muffy is more untraditional, but still delicious.  Love their specialty rolls and they are large as well.  Stuffed Mushroom app was delish too...everything I&#39;ve had here was fresh and completely satisfying.  In addition, they make GREAT cocktails!!  Cosmo&#39;s always hit the spot &amp; they do not skimp on the alcohol :)

Dining area is definitely cozy but I always make reservations prior to going and have never had an issue getting a table.  Staff is super friendly, in fact on one occasion I wanted to try the Uni special.  Within a few minutes the manager approached me stating the Uni was not fresh that night and she was going to comp something else in place of the Uni.  I was so impressed with the fact that she was honest and straightforward rather then just sending this out...(I&#39;m grateful to have avoided food poisoning that night).

Meh service, making minimal points of contact, and unaccommodating. 

Surprised to eat sushi that was average. Skimping on the seafood, the rolls we ate were bulked up with a lot of rice and vegetables, and the rice was of an old consistency, as opposed to tasting fresh. Definitely not worth the high end prices. There&#39;s a clear quality break during peak dining times.

Not worth the money or hassle. 

-Staff were rude. Hostess &amp; Waitress.
-Sushi fish was poor quality. Rubbery, thinly sliced, rice fell apart, and tiny bites. 
-Stated allergies and still received pieces with allergens on it. (Avocado, shellfish, &amp; iodine). Waitress argued with customers regarding what fish, seafood, &amp; decorations people could be allergic too. 
-No green tea available. 
-Miso soup came cold and in small container 1/2 filled.

I&#39;m a very lucky girl, with amazingly incredible friends, who bring me out and help me truly experience sushi, unlike ever before.
The three of us were seated and started with spicy tuna seaweed salad and steak tartar.
Both incredible, fresh and flavorful. Perfectly plated.
Next came uni shots! (Apparently this is one of the few places that actually serves uni)
Uni shots with quail eggs, unlike anything I&#39;ve ever tried- and quite a delicacy!
We were just getting started...
My girlfriends boyfriend is from Japan, this made our sushi experience unlike any other. We let him make all the decisions.
Next came a plate of sashimi with tempura shrimp heads, and sweet shrimp sashimi, tuna, salmon, sea bass, and squid. 
We decided that wasn&#39;t enough, ordered a second bottle of sake and dove into some nigiri.
Toro, super white tuna, sea bass and uni.
Toro was ridiculous. Unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had! Very well plated, fresh and delightful.
Miso soup to end the dinner, and green tea icecream as a close.
The waitress just seemed annoyed by us-with a fake smile. We waited quite a bit in between orders, and ordering. It didn&#39;t ruin the Neal, but that would have made it perfect.

I ordered a Tuna Gone Wild roll that was suppose to have 4 types of tuna but I was hard pressed to find any tuna.  The honey-wasabi and ponzu was great but overall the roll was disappointing because of the lack of tuna.  The Green Turtle was amazing.  Nice presentation and good sushi experience."

We started with the Dragon Fire for a light appetizer and it was served with a quick fire from barcadi-151, which was a cool way to start the dinner. The food itself was good, a little too fishy tasting for me (I think the eel was the culprit of that) but I&#39;m sure someone else might really enjoy this dish.

For main course sushi we ordered salmon &amp; avocado (average at best), crunch mama (a seasonal special) and crispy spicy tuna (excellent). The crunch mama had decent crab, avocado, cream cheese all deep fried with unagi sauce and wasabi mayo. The cream cheese added an interesting layer to the otherwise unspectacular roll. Finally, the crispy spicy tuna was a traditional spicy tuna roll only with rice fried to crisp on the outside. The nice crunch from the rice really elevated the dish to a whole &#39;nother level.

One last thing-- our service was below average. It took about 10 minutes for us to even get water! Athough we were kind of secluded behind a wall, we both expected better service than we received. I would have given 4 stars if the service was what you would expect from a relatively expensive restaurant like Wildfish. I hope to get better service when I return.

All in all, the food was very decent and I would have no problem coming back here for a local, convenient sushi lunch/dinner."

The restaurant was very crowded (it was a weekend so understandable), but we were seated fairly quickly, server was attentive and informed, sat at the counter and it is always a treat to see the sushi being professionally prepared like this.

It has been a while but I believe the first time I went I had something like the &#34;Chicago Bears&#34; roll, which was delicious, but extremely heavy and filling. I have also had the spicy tuna, sexy dragon, wild volcano, and ocean drive. I have found their sushi tasty, but have only been here a couple of times and will likely not be returning too enthusiastically any time soon. I think that while the sushi is good, it isn&#39;t very outstanding in comparison to experiences I have had elsewhere.

I made a reservation for Wildfish in Arlington Heights on 2/22 through Open table. I received an email today, 2/23 that the reservation was cancelled. I was at the restaurant and used my Groupon (first time at Wildfish). This morning I left a review that wasn&#39;t too favorable on open table only due to what we felt was poor service having waited 20 minutes for someone to approach us for drink orders. Don&#39;t get me wrong the sushi wasn&#39;t terrible but it wasn&#39;t the best either. This evening at 5:15PM I received the cancellation of my reservation (1 day after I ate here) with no point credits most likely due to my review. It is funny how my groupon was immediately redeemed by the restaurant  on 2/22 at 8:51PM and how my credit card was charged in the amount of $61.00. This restaurant was not a good first experience which to me is shocking you would think they want your business and go above and beyond to serve first time diners.

Quality is still there, but being patron for mant years, I observed decrease in service and food consistency. Yesterday we had to send back our favorite rainbow roll. It wasnt done right at all. Service is a bit slow and chaotic. However, we come there for food, and it rarely disappoints. Better than Wildfish in Deerfield. We recommend kiss of fire, rainbow, gren dragon rolls, combination sunomono. Nigiri abd sashimi are also high quality. Trust me, most of the other sushi places in North/ Northwest suburbs are noticeably behind Wildfish."

I am a local and have dined here for lunch and dinner many times over the years.  We also regularly order carry-out.  I have always been impressed by the quality of the fish here.  That is the foundation of all kinds of sushi, and without great fish, the dish is sunk.  I have eaten pretty much everything on the sushi kitchen side of the menu.  The sashimi is served with good portions and lovely presentation.  The nigiri is similarly well-cut and plated in a lovely fashion.  The chefs go all out to design lovely rolls.  The seasonal rolls are usually both creative and outstanding.  They are cute about the names--many have a Chicago sports team theme.  I am hard pressed to pick a favorite--but any of the spicy ones are great.  Tuna Gone WIld, Triple Threat, Spicy Salmon Maniac, and many more.  We have always loved the asparagus beef appetizer.  They have a nice sake menu.  I&#39;ve always felt that the tea could be brought up a notch.  Serving tea bags?  Not up to par!  The service here over the years has usually been fine.  I feel they have a fair amount of turnover in the waitstaff, I remember servers from years ago that I haven&#39;t seen there in a long time.  I would highly recommend trying buffet night to get a chance to survey many of the their offerings so that you know what you want on a return visit.  I also love the bento lunch boxes--the generous portions of sushi usually have me bringing some home.  The decor of this one is based on bold green and red.  Their door is near the movie theater, and conveniently right across the way from the parking garage door.  Really handy in the winter!  (They have no customer access from Arlington Heights Road).  There is ample parking in the underground garage."

Then we ordered another roll with crab tempura and it was cold and stale as well... we will not be returning.

Service is also consistently great. If you can be seated in their unique booths, go for it. The rolls can get pricey but as some reviewers suggested, you can try it out with a Groupon/buffet night (last Wed of the month). Warning: you may be hooked and more than willing to pay full price after that!

Favorites: Soft Shell Crab app, Spicy Salmon Maniac roll and Ocean Drive roll. Kiss of Fire is pretty cool--literally comes to you in flames!"

They have very large rolls and more unusual rolls than I&#39;m accustomed to seeing.  A little on the expensive side, but not too bad.  About $100 for two of us.  

Service on the other hand was only fair at best, and seating was crowded and we were continually getting bumped into.  Try to get a table not in the middle of the room, which might be difficult for just two.  I would also have preferred the more traditional means of ordering where you simply fill out a sheet with what you want."

I remember a hip vibe with dark lighting, good music and a packed restuarant.  Went out with my husband on a Thursday night and it was pretty dead, bright lighting, menu looked sad and outdated, and the music was literally like I was sitting in my dentist office listening to light FM.  What???  The only thing that hadn&#39;t changed was the prices.
  
Big dissapointment with them as far as being able to accomodate someone with an allergy -- I am required to be on a gluten free diet.  All over the internet it says this restuarant has a gluten free menu (rare for a sushi place), and I called ahead to confirm this.  The person I spoke with on the phone said they did and that the server would be very knowledgable and able to help.  When we arrived they did not have a gluten free menu, the hostess only said to tell our waiter and there would be an extra charge for gluten free soy sauce.  What??  On top of that, our waitress didn&#39;t know what I was talking about and couldn&#39;t really recommend anything for me. I ordered simple rolls that didn&#39;t say anything in the description about having sauce or tempura breading.  After ordering, I was asked if &#34;cream cheese&#34; was okay in my Philadelphia?  I had to inform her again that I didn&#39;t have a dairy allergy, I just needed to avoid any breading or regular soy sauce in all of their sauces, yet she delivered a roll that was covered in tempura crumbs and spicy mayo.  It was a plain, jalapeno tuna roll.  I had to send it back, but it certainly didn&#39;t help my confidence with what I was eating.

Spent over $100 dollars there for mediocre sushi that could possibly have had massive cross contamination and listened to Barbara Streisand the whole time.  We won&#39;t be returning."

I met a friend for dinner around 5:30pm mid week.  We did not have reservations but we were promptly seated at a table for two near the window.  Not to many people at this time and our waiter also mentioned that they had a sushi dinner buffet, but we opted to order off the menu.  The food was awesome!  Some of the best sushi I have had.  Ordered the dirty old man, based off of someones yelp review, thank you for that, the caterpillar roll and a tried but true California roll. It was all delicious and the presentation was beautiful!  We also had a pineapple jalapeno margarita which sounded great but I was a little disappointed when we received a frozen &#34;martini&#34;, which was not what I was expecting.  It tasted alright though. Dessert consisted of a chocolate truffle mousse, which was very rich and enough for the both of us to share. Our server was a little shy but friendly enough and was very accommodating.  We had a great first experience and although a bit expensive, I will be back in the future."

They used to dole out incredibly fresh and inventive rolls in a fun, vibrant environment. And while you can still find some solid sushi here, the luster has definitely worn off. 

I get a little wound up when I dine at a restaurant that showcases an inverse relationship between quality and price. And that&#39;s just what I found the other day. I&#39;ve dined at Wildfish many a time, but I didn&#39;t have the time or interest in a sit down meal, so I choose to phone in an order for pick up. Per usual, I went with my two (previously) favorite rolls: Crispy Spicy Tuna and Ocean Drive. 20 minutes later I strolled in to pick up my sushi and was happily greeted by the hostess. 

And here&#39;s where things went a little downhill. My bill was $38 for two rolls. Listen, I get that fresh fish can be pricey. And that&#39;s fine as long as the roll is up to par...but unfortunately these were just ok. The ocean drive wasn&#39;t nearly as fresh as it was in the past and cilantro not as bright. The crisped rice on the crispy spicy tuna was chewy rather than light and the sauce drizzled on top suffocated the usually mouth watering spicy tuna. 

Wildfish used to be one of my faves, but now it&#39;s definitely middle of the pack at best when it comes to taste and value."

It used to be so good now it&#39;s just complete garbage. Terrible food and even worse service. The fish does not taste fresh and the rolls have WAY too much rice. Separately, I wish I have read other reviews about Groupon users before I bought and came here. They never said anything about not being able to combine Groupon with any other offers, I even told the hostess that I have a Groupon, made a reservation as instructed, yet the server let me order without letting me ahead of time. I love how they said &#34;oh just use it next time.&#34; As if I will ever come back! Now I know why there&#39;s no one at the restaurant. DO NOT waste your time and come here!!!"

The quality is great but $15 for one roll is excessive in my book.  They have both specialty rolls and regular rolls which are hidden on the back page of the menu.  

The service is great and the I think this atmosphere is good for a date night or a small group.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place for a large group because they don&#39;t have a ton of seating.  If you want to dine on the weekend, I would recommend calling ahead for a reservation because I was quote a 2+ hour wait on a Saturday night once (we went somewhere else that night).

I&#39;ve only gone here when I&#39;ve had a deal from one of the deal websites and they seem to be on there fairly often, so if you are looking to try it out, look for a deal!"

I saw a Groupon and snagged it figuring if it were a bust, then I at least didn&#39;t pay full price.  I cannot decide how I feel about Wildfish.  The drinks were strong and delicious.  The sushi was yummy, but not the best I have ever had.  The Kiss of Fire that camoe out with a fire was my favorite.  I thought it was definitely overpriced for what you get.  Even with the Groupon, I felt like it was overpriced.  The restaurant is cute and all, but this isn&#39;t the city or a trendy little spot.  Probably a good spot for a first date."

Beyond that, they have about 10 or so Japanese entrees. The preparation is along the lines of what a fancy French restaurant would do with some sauces, decorated plate, and focus on portions that exude quality not quantity. 

We tried this because of a Groupon; yet now go back regularly for any occasion where we need an excuse. It is great for adults and older children. The atmosphere isn&#39;t overly romantic; but not family restaurant either - in-between. 

If you come in singly; you can sit at the sushi bar and watch your dinner being made - or at least if you&#39;re not in a group. 

Service has always been quick - no matter how full the place is."

Make sure you make a reservation ahead of time, it can get busy especially on a Friday night. 

We had the Stuffed Mushroom appetizer, King Dragon roll, and the spicy Salmon roll.

Definitely recommend the Stuffed Mushroom and the Spicy Salmon roll (with cream cheese).

Our food was delayed and they gave us a free octopus snack on the house as we waited. Service was a bit slow, but really friendly and the snack made up for it I guess..

Ambiance was great, sushi is a bit overpriced, but the quality of the sushi is above average! 

Wouldn&#39;t really come here unless there&#39;s another groupon, but my expectations for sushi are high coming from Southern California."
wildfish-arlington-heights,Victoria H.,cRt0608EYB1iuKxbTg8h0A,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,571,6,07_AlLbmx4lV_ODF9yMmmg,4.0,2013-06-25,"My girlfriends and I chose Wildfish for my birthday one year.  At the end of our meal, our server took a picture of us.  He returned minutes later with the picture printed out and framed for me.  It was a nice touch, and a great picture that I still have out on display to this day.  Aside for that small touch that keeps me coming back, my food is always fresh and top quality.  The presentation is beautiful.  I don&#39;t know what is up with the handful of negative reviews I&#39;ve seen on here.  I consider myself a regular at Wildfish and I have never had a bad experience.  I will admit the service is a bit slow at times (which along with the pricing would be the only reasons to remove a star).  

Some of the sashimi type appetizers are very tasty, but a bit on the skimpy side.  I recommend saving the sashimi and sushi options for your dinner.  For starters, we enjoy the Wild Tartar ($10), which is 4 round crispy tortilla chips that are topped off with spicy tuna and salmon tartar.  They feature a Lobster Rangoon that&#39;s pretty scrumptious in my opinion.   I also like their Gyoza ($6) steamed or fried.

I feel the dinner options for sushi and sashimi are a better bang for your buck.  Wildfish is not known for being a cheap meal, but you pay for what you get.  I feel as though a specialty roll is enough for ones meal, whereas other places you may need to order a couple, or even a few rolls to fill your belly.  So although you may spend $15-20 for a single specialty roll, they are large enough to be your entree.  

Tuna Gone Wild ($17) is a delicious go-to roll.  It is a spicy tuna roll, with avocado and cucumber.  The roll is topped off four different types of tuna, slices of jalapeno, and a honey wasabi sauce.

I love Ocean Drive ($18) for a fresh taste.  Soybean paper wraps around rice filled with Yellowtail, Tuna and cilantro, drizzled with a bit of chili oil and lime.

The Kiss of Fire ($19) is one of their more popular rolls, mainly because it comes on out fire!  So it&#39;s worth ordering for the presentation alone.  It has Alaskan King Crab and white fish with a spicy mayo.  It is topped off with scallion and masago and drizzled with some more spicy mayo with a sweet soy sauce.
 
If you ever see the Sin City roll on special, order it.  It is one of my faves and I believe it needs to be on menu permanently.  Lobster, scallops, and topped off with a dollop of egg custard.

Side note: The New Orleans and the Blue Point both sound better than they taste.  I would pass on these two rolls.  I&#39;ve never tried the Dirty Old Man (mozzarella, cream cheese, salmon tempura), but it sounds pretty barf-tastic, although it may tickle someones fancy.

If you&#39;re not in the mood for sushi, Wildfish has other entrees that are delicious and all come with miso soup and a salad.  Sea bass.  Salmon.  Halibut.  Steak.  Lobster.  My boyfriend usually orders the Seared Tuna ($21), which is a seared filet of tuna (duh), topped with a garlic butter and teriyaki sauce.  It comes with sauteed vegetables and wildfish-style mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes are a must with any entree you choose.  If it doesn&#39;t come with them, then substitute. 

I have yet to go for the buffet night they do, which is supposedly the last Wednesday of every month for $35.  Eventually, I&#39;ll give it try and let you know.  I do know they feature Groupon deals once in awhile, and a lot of times you can find gift certificates on Restaurant.com if your looking to be a little nicer on your wallet.  Ignore the atrocious negative reviews some of these Yelpers have written and get into Wildfish for some beautiful fresh sushi!  Request a booth if you can."

I am definitely a sushi snob, particularly in the burbs, and Wildfish set the bar that no other sushi place quite meets. Their menu is VAST, and they always have new, fresh, seasonally appropriate specials keeping the trips frequent and worth-while!

I personally prefer picking special rolls, but everything on the menu is incredible- it&#39;s one of those places that you really can&#39;t strike out at.  Anything you pick is going to be good! So be adventurous!

Favorite roll is FOR SURE the dirty old man- it comes warm with melt-in-your-mouth mozerella that is to DIE for. 

Another thing that makes this place so special is their cocktails! Every handcrafted drink is delish and complimentary, including their extensive sake menu.

The ginger dressing is also VERY fresh and unique - because there&#39;s ACTUALLY ginger in it. I&#39;m so tired of places taking mayo and thousand island and calling it ginger dressing. This is the real deal. Enjoy!

The green tea ice cream is AMAZING! Very refreshing after a great dinner.



The only negatives (but remedy-able negatives) are:

- price. YES, this place is more expensive than a lot of sushi places. BUT for the quality you&#39;re getting it is ABSOLUTELY Worth it- think wouldn&#39;t you rather pay a little extra for a GREAT dinner over saving $20 and eating something regrettable? Or just so-so? FURTHER there&#39;s usually a groupon or a restaurant.com coupon floating around out there, so snag it! 

- service. this SEEMS to have improved in my years of going here.  Recently it feels like they&#39;ve staffed a little more, but I&#39;ve definitely waited a while for my food.  I grew accustomed to carving out 2 hours for drinks/apps/dinner/dessert here which isn&#39;t terrible! But not ideal...but recently they&#39;re picking it up and are a lot quicker about getting everything out faster! 


To me the most important thing is that the food is perfect, the drinks are great, and the atmosphere is clean and inviting- Wildfish NAILS it with all these categories.

A MUST GO! AND GO AGAIN!"

All I&#39;ve been hearing was amazing reviews from friends that have been here, so when a livingsocial deal popped up I figure it was the perfect opportunity for me to finally check this place out.

The location is cute, the tables are a bit close, but that&#39;s alright. I reallllyy liked the booths that they have, but you can only get it if you are with a group of people.

The food... Miso soup wasn&#39;t that impressive. It was tasty, not salty, but I feel like the tofu was missing something.. I am a miso soup lover, and this was not the best miso I&#39;ve had.

Sushi:

Green Dragon (Snow Crab, Shrimp, Asparagus, Avocado, Eels and Wasabi Tobiko)... it was a mooshy and good...not amazing.

Tuna Gone Wild (Spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber inside w/ jalapeno and ikura on top of four different types of tuna, drizzled w/honey wasabi, ponzu and lime juice) ... I could not handle this roll very well.. I did take the jalapeno off, but the inside was still very spicy. My bf said that he really enjoyed it, but me being a person that can&#39;t handle very spicy food, this crossed the limits. Do get it if you like spicy.

Crunchy Muffy (Shrimp Tempura, Tempura Crunch &amp; Cream Cheese, baked with mozzarella cheese melted on top)... the roll seems overly loaded but it was DELICIOUS. I usually really dislike cheese, but I could have had a whole meal with just these rolls! It was warm, mooshy, flavorful, and everything I love in sushi

We also ordered eel pieces, salmon and tuna. The eel was very disappointing to me... I am used to eel that has been marinated and then served with eel sauce on it... yes probably the American way, but this eel was more fried and more fishy than what I&#39;ve had before, it also had absolutely no sauce on it.. don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s fresh, it just doesn&#39;t taste that good.. the salmon and the tuna were very good, fresh.

I did ask for a ginger-ale during dinner and they do not serve it, so I was a little disappointed, but it&#39;s okay.

Our server was extremely nice and was there just enough, not overwhelming us. I really enjoyed her.

Would I go back? I honestly don&#39;t know. I think that for the flavors that I experienced it was EXTREMELY overpriced... sorry, I really hoped to love it here, but I just did not."

We got four different speciality rolls and they were all SO GOOD. I picked the crunchy tuna roll (not exact name, im guessing) the bottom of the rice was pan fried and it brought the right amount of crunchiness to the sushi.

I would recommend reservations if you do after 7pm, because when we were leaving at 830 the place was starting to get quite crowded!

I also recommend the shitake mushroom sushi roll if you like veggies!  Also, the stuffed mushroomi appetizer was pretty right on as well!"

Manager blamed us for not telling them we had to be out of there in AN HOUR and said they would have rushed it. SURE! I thought they were backed up.

You have to mess up a LOT for me to give a 1-star review.  Wildfish did that and more.  If zero stars were an option, I *might* have even chosen that.  Sorry to get all melodramatic on you, but this was a really bad dining experience.

My friend and I were looking for somewhere to eat on a Monday night in the Arlington Heights area.  She said this or Mago.  (I really, really, really wish with all of my heart we had chose Mago).  Even after reading the wishy-washy Yelp reviews on here, I still went in with an open mind!

I bought a restaurant.com GC for here and presented it to the waitress after ordering our drinks.

**Please take a moment to note, our cokes were the only things to come out in a normal amount of time**

OUR
WAITRESS
WAS
AWFUL.

I have had some terrible ones in my day, but she probably takes the cake!!!

The food was ok--the sushi wasn&#39;t knock-me-off-my-feet fantastic (I save my good sushi reviews for places that deserve it like Sushi Ai) but it was decent.  The stuffed mushrooms were good.  The Fried Jalapeno appetizer was good, too (it was a special with jalapenos, cream cheese, wrapped in bacon, and then fried--yum!)  But the Crazy Dragon roll...meh.  The spicy tuna, meh.  The California rolls--they were ok.  They&#39;re hard to mess up.

But the SERVICE.  UGH!  I am still dwelling on how awful it was.

#1) When you are eating spicy food, its customary to be offered some kind of beverage refill, yes?  Here, I guess not.

#2) Like I said before, everything took a reeeeeally long time.

#3) I don&#39;t like eel, so we exchanged the eel for spicy tuna.  There is an upcharge here, so be aware.

#4) The waitress never brought my soup, OR salad, OR rice that was supposed to come with my food.  After trying to flag her down for over 30 minutes (solid eye contact was made, and nods exchanged three times) to get it, I finally asked her to just adjust the bill to make up for that.  She sat there and argued with me, and finally took a WHOLE DOLLAR off of the bill.  Ummmm, thanks for NOTHING.  That is really the only reason we ordered one of the samplers was for the soup, salad, and rice.  Otherwise we would have gotten something different.

#5) We had to flag her down for the bill after a 40 minute wait.  When she finally brought it, she didn&#39;t use the restaurant.com certificate.  We had to notice on the bill. And bring it to her attention.  Sneaky, sneaky.

#6) Gratutity is already added, GOOD THING FOR HER.  And it was 20% gratuity added.  Are you KIDDING ME?!?!  She didn&#39;t even come CLOSE to earning that.  


So definitely come here at your own risk.  I, for one, will never be back!"

My reviews mostly cover sushi restaurants since I take sushi very seriously. I needed somewhere that had amazing food, a great ambiance (especially important this year with how nasty this winter has been and his birthday being on a Tuesday, knowing restaurants are very uninviting when they are slow... not a birthday treat!), great service and just a little something extra special to send the experience over the edge.

I normally critique at the end but it seems important to mention for those who aren&#39;t from the area... the GPS will direct you there just fine, but does not mention you need to park elsewhere. You will drive right past it, turn around, pass it again... Just look for the closest parking garage right before you reach the GPS finish line! The entrance will not be the doors off the street, rather on the shopping center side. 

I made reservations and told them it was for a birthday. We arrived on time and were seated immediately. I was very happy to a decent crowd of people despite the freezing temperatures outside and it being a Tuesday. The decor was inviting, and tasteful. It went very well with their modern and slightly nontraditional menu. 

My boyfriend was very impressed with the menu and was so excited to continue reading each item on it. I can&#39;t blame him... it is a total sushi food porn menu. Listen here... if you a sushi snob like me... if you&#39;re always looking for your ultimate favorite sushi experience... for the place that even surprises you... the person who&#39;s tried it all... GET YOUR TUSH OVER HERE!!!!!!! 

HANDS DOWN- BEST SUSHI I&#39;VE EVER HAD. 

I will get this review notarized I&#39;m so serious about how good it was! 

We ordered 5 rolls between the three of us. We had the Tuna Gone Wild, Kiss of Fire, Ocean Drive (squeeze the lime on it!!!), Triple Threat, and The Dirty Old Man. Omfgggg... so good.  We also had the bacon rapper after that. I was already in a food coma with my food baby and this fried, spicy, bacon combo kicked my butt. I was so sure I was dead. Naw- Just cloud 9.

Our server was quiet, but friendly. Food was prompt and perfect. Drinks were never empty. They brought him ice cream in a fried bowl of some sort (garnish but yummy!!). If that wasn&#39;t enough- she took a picture of us and brought it back in a very pretty black frame. Way better than Tsukasa&#39;s little paper folder that you end up tossing somewhere and becomes lost forever. =] 

My only comment on Wildfish is the price. Suburban sushi is overpriced as is and to most these rolls may seem unjustifiably over priced. I will testify that the sushi is well worth the price if you pay attention to the craft of sushi. Sushi focuses on texture, and how they play with each other. You can have sushi that&#39;s very fresh and tastes good, but it is this component that brings the food up a level. I am giving Wildfish 5 start because the quality was exceptional. 

Even already reserved for next week&#39;s all you can eat $35 sushi"

This past Friday while eating with my wife we both noticed a distinct odor of seafood that was past it&#39;s prime. We ordered the Crunchy Muffy maki roll and the Tuna Tartare. The maki was sub par and the tuna tasted spoiled. We both got very sick the following day and will never be back.

Yes, I am a Snobby McSnobberson when it comes to sushi, but really?  This place was just above average.   I only came here because of yet another suggestion from a friend that this is &#34;THE BEST SUSHI EVER!&#34; and because I scored a sweet LivingSocial deal.  Now I shall break it down for you like a true sushi snob would...  

A) This place is EXPENSIVE.  For 6 regular maki rolls and two iced teas (BONUS that they were Republic of Tea teas, but still...) our dinner was $60.   
B) They put only the fancy rolls on the menu...you need to ask for the paper sushi menu with the maki listed on it to get the regular maki rolls.  Tricksy, Wildfish...VERY tricksy.  All of the fancier maki are $14 or more.  
C) The rolls were good, but there was just SOMETHING about them that was off.  I got the Spicy Scallop, Spicy Tuna, and the Spicy Salmon.  Only the Spicy Tuna was actually SPICY.  Also?  The salmon was creamy.  CREAMY, I tell you!  It was odd.  Everything was good, but it just wasn&#39;t &#34;right&#34;.  I don&#39;t know.  The fish is just so chopped up and mashed with mayo and who knows what else that you are just trying to figure out what exactly is in them the whole time.

Meh.  I probably wouldn&#39;t come back."

Their vegetable fried rice tastes very fresh, unlike what you would get at a typical Asian restaurant. I also always get the special spicy tuna roll-it is amazing! Another great roll is the spicy salmon manic. If you are looking an upscale sushi place, Wildfish is always a good option. They also usually have a Groupon that really helps offset the cost."

My mom, the bf, and I each ordered a sake flight, which I was less than impressed with.

We each ordered something unique to try:  White Sox roll, lobster roll (on special), kiss of fire, wild volcano, and green dragon.  I was less than impressed with all of them.  Maybe it was a different chef (I&#39;d never eaten at this location before, but my parents had and loved it,) or maybe it was because it was valentine&#39;s day and they were busy... but the quality just seemed to lack.  I also ordered one piece of ikura (my favorite) and never got it.  We weren&#39;t charged, but still.

Now the bad: The pieces are fish were extremely slim in the rolls. The restaurant was EMPTY on a Saturday night but it still took quite a while to get the rolls. The servers stand around in groups giggling while my glass of water sits empty. Lastly, this is by far the most expensive sushi I&#39;ve ever had. Definitely not worth the price! $90 for three plates of sushi was entirely too much especially since no one drank alcohol. 

I wish I would have read the reviews before we decided to stop in.. lesson learned. Overall, it wasn&#39;t a terrible experience just not one that&#39;s worth the money. But really thinking about it, even if the bill had been half of what we paid I still wouldn&#39;t go back."

It was a relatively slow night with only half the place filled but I had a bad feeling from the moment I told our waitress we had a Groupon before placing my order.  The waitress&#39;s whole attitude was instantly frosty.  (I don&#39;t understand that reaction at all btw, but whatever, maybe a Groupon customer had been a crummy tipper or rude to her? Not my problem).

I&#39;m allergic to spicy food and the waitress looked at me like I committed a terrible mistake in asking if they could at least substitute regular mayo for spicy on the sushi rolls.  Then we watched our food sit on a rack for nearly 20 minutes while the smiling chefs joked with each other behind their counter and the waitress checked on other tables multiple times without even looking at us.  We&#39;re pretty laidback so at first we assumed they were waiting with some kind of good reason or maybe she was the only person on duty while the other two waitresses were on break.  Nope. The tables around us got their food first including the lady next to us who had copied my sushi order because it sounded good to her when she heard me order (they had arrived and ordered after us!)  

By the time we got our meal the sushi wasn&#39;t even properly cold anymore but we were too hungry to care by then.  Complaining politely yielded zero result.  To say I was pretty disappointed after reading so many nice reviews before picking up the Groupon would be an understatement. I guess I got what I paid for."

First point of instant happiness: Numi green tea!!!! Sure, usually green tea is served in a pot and not in a bag, but who knows what&#39;s in those pots.... and it was the toasted rice type..my favorite!!

As for sushi, we ordered the Tuna Gone Wild, which is delicious, but the jalapenos on top overpowered the rest of the flowers, I think half the amount of seeds would be sufficient. I think the other roll was Jazz Spring - delicious flavors and not as heavy as most other rolls."

I should have turned away when I ordered yellowtail nigiri and they told me something was wrong with the fish - a &#34;bad batch.&#34;  But unfortunately, blinded by hunger, I forged ahead. I honestly don&#39;t even remember what rolls we got but none of them were good.  One tasted fishy, as though it had gone bad, and so we ate no more than a piece from that one.

The entier experience of eating here is awesome. There is plenty of underground parking, no need to expose yourself to the elements of nature in the quest for good Sushi. The ambience is very stylish and tasteful.I always get the U-10 Scallop roll, followed by miscellaenous sushi pieces. 

The last time I was here with a friend we order appetizers! We got the Avacado salad and Crispy calamari. The appetizers were excellent and filling. I had already ordered the Scallop roll, and was extremely worried I wouldnt enjoy it. In hindsight, we should have ordered just one appetizer, 2 is a bit much, the portions are huge. 

The U-10 roll is a beauty! I just love it, I know it is a cooked roll and not in the true sense what a sushi afficianado would even label it sushi...WHO CARES, it is so good. I will eat it as many times as I possibly can. Definitely a good spot for a date or to catch up with friends."

The only thing that keeps it from getting a four star is that I think it is a little bit too pricey. Yes you mat get filet sized pieces but I prefer quality over quantity and the quantity is average to slightly average. 

Decor: Nice setting and perfect for a first time date. Ambiance is nice and relaxing and kind of hidden even in downtown Arlington Heights. 

Service: Service is fast and friendly. This is for a sure a 5 star service. From being seated to having your bill handed to you, you feel very welcomed into there establishment. I wanted to write home, that is how warm the staff are to you. After writing this I decided to bump there rating up a star to a 4. That is how much I enjoyed the service. 

Sushi: Good. Nothing that separates it from another sushi place. The nigari portions are larger than most places that I have been too if not the largest. My friend called them filets because they are large. The rolls are good and are not overloaded with rice. Nice blend of just enough rice. 

Overall: I will keep going back. I recommend them to my friends and other Yelpers."

For starters we got the Tuna Rangoon, ick! Don&#39;t recommend it, just think hot tuna and lemon. For sushi we got the Kamikaze and California Sunset both mediocre and I have had way better sushi at other places. Those 3 things our bill was $50! Luckily I had that $40 groupon.

This sushi restaurant is as good as it gets according to my tastebuds.
While using the usual classics such as spicy tuna, dragon, california, and shrimp tempora rolls, Wildfish has mixed things up adding fresh and fiery new ingredients.  Spring comes to sushi in the Jazz Spring roll featuring overtones of fresh mint.
The dragon comes to life on your table as its set alight and resembles real Dragon Fire with a kick of chili oil to match.
Chicago Bears welcomes eager sushi consumers to the area with a tasty topping of pico de gallo.
The prices on the rolls vary from 6 to 18 dollars depending on the size of the roll and the pricey-ness of the ingredients.
If you&#39;re looking for a great deal, try them on for a bento!  Or keep your eyes on Groupon which hosts a half price deal every few months.
Want to sake taste on a budget?  Try their three sake flight for only $12!

The sushi is all fresh, very tasty, and the service is fantastic! The location is great, there is a ton of underground parking (people who say there is no parking must not have seen this underground parking...the stairs lead right up to the front of Wildfish) and the ambiance is intimate and very classy. Definitely make reservations though!

I went yesterday because the last Wednesday night of each month they have an all you can eat event for $32. This includes a ton of appetizers, rolls and nigiri...it is a great deal! A lot of really good rolls are included on the Wednesday night menu.  Of course you can order off of the regular menu, too, but the all you can eat sushi is a much better deal.

For appetizers, we had Wild Tartar (Spicy tuna &amp; salmon served on crispy tortilla chips...very good but eat it before it soaks into the chip making it soggy!), Edamame, Vegetable Tempura, &amp; Gyoza (Pan fried pork dumplings). For our feast we had 3 Philadelphia Rolls (standard fare of cream cheese, salmon, avocado &amp; cucumber... I think they make my FAVORITE Philly roll here), Crispy Spicy Tuna (Sushi rice pan fried with spicy tuna...this is actually an interesting looking roll...reminds me more of cake pieces then sushi pieces), 2 Super White Tuna pieces (amazing), 2 Yellow Tail  pieces (also yummy), 2 Red Snapper pieces (surprisingly good), Crazy Dragon Roll (snow crab meat with seared spicy tuna &amp; tempura crumbs,  Indiana Jones (Shrimp &amp; asparagus tempura, unagi, egg, wasabi mayo, black rice)  and then we tried pieces of some various rolls...I cant remember the names of them all. They have about 6 different rolls you can grab pieces of in a buffet style and the rest can be ordered off the menu. Most of the appetizers you go up and get buffet style, as well, except we ordered ours off of the menu.

So to summarize price wise, we got (Wild Tartar 10, Edamame 4, Vegetable Tempura 8, Gyoza 6, Philly Rolls 30, Crispy Spicy Tuna 17, 2 Super White Tuna pieces 6, 2 Yellow Tail pieces 6, 2 Red Snapper pieces 6, Crazy Dragon Roll 17, Random other roll pieces, 3 Green Tea Ice Creams 9,  Indiana Jones roll 18) $137 would have been the retail price not counting the random rolls pieces we tried (and we both tried at least 6 different pieces) and we paid $64 for the two of us.

The whole staff was great. The servers were very attentive to our needs and our water glasses never went below half filled.

There was so much more we wanted to try, but we just got SO full! :) Next month we will definitely going back to this all you can eat event.

They have some of the most creative rolls at Wildfish. A lot of newer sushi places actually had chefs that started at Wildfish and &#39;borrowed&#39; some of their roll ideas I&#39;ve heard. Wildfish truly is the original sushi place for some of these creative rolls.

They have some great desserts here, too! The green tea ice cream is the perfect way to end your dinner. They also have these fruit ice creams that come in half of a frozen real fruit piece~refreshing and light and yummy!"

Sad but true. The sushi is good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but at the same time, it&#39;s not so good that I&#39;m willing to pay top dollar for it.

The ambiance is nice and a little trendy (for the suburbs, anyway), definitely perfect for a fancy date night. The cocktail list is fun, too - on my first visit, I tried a peach martini that was really fresh and fruity-tasting; I think it contained peach puree. The fried shumai were very good.

Of course I can&#39;t remember any of the names of the signature maki we got except for the Green Turtle, which was adorably served in the shape of a turtle (but it took them a looooooooong time to make it, which seemed appropriate given the name). Everything I&#39;ve had there has been good, but I haven&#39;t been wowed.

If you&#39;re looking for a sexy date night or chic girls&#39; night out spot (&#34;Girls Gone Wildfish&#34;?) and are willing to drop some dough, Wildfish might be the place for you. But if you&#39;re just looking for some yummy sushi, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that can satisfy you for a lot less money."

If I was going to spend this much money on sushi I would want it to be as quality as coast or torro sushi. It&#39;s great for lunch though!

I used a groupon here and I&#39;m glad I did because it is definitely pricey but wow it was good. The best piece of sushi I&#39;ve ever eaten, the Indiana Jones roll. The perfect combination of sweet and savory in a piece of sushi! We also really enjoyed the caterpillar, spicy lobster, and spicy octopus. Really good but look for a groupon or something if you&#39;re really hungry."

The sushi was good quality.  The selection was huge...I think 30+ rolls and nigiri. 

I suppose this should have been enjoyable, but really, it wasn&#39;t.  Maybe it was the $80 bill for dinner on a Wednesday.  Maybe I didn&#39;t eat enough to put them out of business like I though (think 90&#39;s John Pinette &#34;you go now&#34; chinese restaurant bit).

I think the biggest thing for me is that I don&#39;t like fancy rolls.  Sunset rolls are about a hyped up as I get.  So for the 4 rolls plus 4 nigiri I ate, I got my money&#39;s worth, but wouldn&#39;t have spent as much as I did and could have left with my pants buttoned up.

Looking at the menu, the prices aren&#39;t great.  There are too many other great sushi places around to be good quality at a bad price.  

Would go to other places around many times over coming back to Wildfish, and it is right across the street from my house.  

Maybe good to take a date and &#34;accidentally&#34; show her the bill so she knows you&#39;re rich?"

This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Over the past year or so the entire experience has declined. We went there last Friday night. The place was packed. The service was horrible. Multiple tables including our had to flag down to order, refill, and to pay. The waitress apologized for the delay in our order, and included a free roll. This would have been a nice gesture if it was good. The taste of the food has gone down significantly. In addition, one of the rolls was not what we ordered. I was willing to accept the loud and crowded atmosphere. I am not willing to pay for poor food and service. We will not be going to Wildfish again. So sorry to see another downtown Arlington Heights business poorly run. It&#39;s no wonder the businesses keep failing."

The sushi is good- and I eat a lot of sushi.

The reason this place didn&#39;t get more is because 1, for a suburban place with a limited menu the prices are steep. and 2, EDM (electronic dance music) is not the vibe I want when all the decor is straight up Japanese..... I want the feel of that- not the club downtown."

The location is in a small downtown arlington heights area. Its a small cozy hidden gem of a restaurant. Has such a comfy warm atmosphere. Not too many tables and booths, yet not lacking. Its just right. against the wall up close to the tables is the sushi bar where one can sit up front watching the sushi chefs and their artistic abilities at work. The servers are genuine and friendly attending to all your needs making sure your satisfied throughout your visit. I remember on two visits already, I had my server bring me an appetizer &#34;on the house&#34; due to our order taking longer than usual. I had no complaints on time and didnt feel it was taking long at all, but they did. 
   The sushi and rolls all come out on nice plates with with a fun and presentable look. One of my favorites is the green turtle. Its and eel and avacado roll with a sweet eel sauce. It actually comes out in the shape of a turtle. The head of the turtle is a wad of wasabi and they put little eyes on it. Kiss of fire is another roll that I never forget. Very tasty roll that comes out in a fire flame. Everytime I go, I try a new roll and have yet to be dissatisfied. 
   What I love most about this place is that you can go to start a fun night out with friends or to go on a nice date. Very nice, classy, cozy and moderately priced."

+ Great ambiance
+ Friendly staff (We were greeted by the sushi chefs as soon as we walked in)
+ Service was prompt and efficient (plates cleared ASAP, food delivered after appropriate wait time, waitress checked on us during the meal).  I was a bit intimidated by an older Asian gentleman who stood near our table, monitoring the restaurant floor.  However, I have to commend him for his efficiency.  He helped any waiter/waitress with delivering dishes to tables and clearing dishes off tables.
+ At the beginning of the meal, we told our waitress we had a Groupon and she still remained friendly and maintained the great customer service.  I saw some Yelpers&#39; reviews that mentioned bad service after they presented their Groupon so either we got lucky or management has seen the Yelp reviews and have notified staff to keep up good service even to Groupon users.
+ ONE OF THE BEST SUSHI WE EVER HAD!  We had the crunch muffy ($16), king dragon ($16), philadelpha roll ($10), edamame ($4), tea ($2.50), and soda ($3.25). Total: $51.75 + tax + tip.  Sushi was so good, my husband and I kept talking about it 2 days later!
+ Clean restaurant
+ Clean bathrooms

- Very expensive.  We had a Groupon so it made this experience a bit affordable.  I would only come back here if I had a Groupon or if a rich friend paid for me. (Wassup, Mark Zuckerberg!)"

Excellent service! I wish we were seated inside those cute little cabana type seating areas which looked so cozy! They had cushions too! 

I would say the sushi here is more like gourmet. Sushi isn&#39;t wrapped in seaweed, but soybean paper! How cool is that? The portions were great and reasonably priced, however, some dishes were a little expensive.

The ambiance is semi casual, not something to celebrate an anniversary or a special day. But a great place to let your hair down and enjoy some good food."

They&#39;ve got these orange half-chair things that are on benches... that makes no sense when I read it. Let&#39;s just say they&#39;re a blend of artsy and traditional and I&#39;m not sure what vibe I got between the decor and the music, but it was nice and intimate.

I&#39;m going to give you a head start and tell you that the filo-wrapped Crunchy Shrimp appetizer are kabobs... just in case you spend 5 minutes trying to cut through said appetizer and no one is telling you you&#39;re an idiot. :) They are delicious though messy--little filo shrapnel drove one of the servers crazy because she seemed a little type A and kept coming back to angle things, replace candles, and pick up anything possible.

We also had the tuna sampler--great quality, and such an artistic presentation. Let me tell you my theory on food presentation, after having watched plenty of Iron Chef: It&#39;s all about the plate. Get the biggest plate possible, then organize your food items so it looks like you&#39;re staging a scene in a forest, or get the craziest plate/bowl you can find so that your guests have to stop and think before trying it. 

Overall great! Between the two of us we had two appetizers and one maki and we could barely finish it, so that balanced out the price a bit. The sports theme rolls may or may not have any relevance to their names. I think they just swap out the team name based on the season and keep the roll the same... but maybe I&#39;ll have to go again to confirm. ;)"

We were not disappointed: their pizza is so good. Normally I&#39;m better with descriptions, but &#34;so good&#34; is simple and perfect and everything you need to know. We&#39;ve since ordered a few times and it&#39;s our go-to for when we have a group of friends over that we need to feed. Their prices are fair (the deal days are the best!) and it&#39;s nice to know I can get quality food without paying an arm and a leg. 

I tried their famous mozzarella sticks and wasn&#39;t a fan of them. It was too much cheese for me, but that&#39;s no reason for a four star review. Definitely check out Frato&#39;s if you&#39;re in Schaumburg looking for a real pizza place."

The burger was delicious served with lettuce, tomato, onion, mustard and ketchup on a nice bun.  It came with a small mountain of waffle fries.  The &#34;little&#34; burger was about the size of a Whopper but that&#39;s where the comparison ends.  In terms of quality, it was a nice flavorful burger.

I love Valentine&#39;s Day &amp; heart shaped pizzas, and while its no excuse to go hog wild on pizza, that&#39;s exactly what I did. Unfortunately, while I had my heart set on a heart pizza, plans changed as they only offered a 16&#34; with no half &amp; half on specialty toppings.

And THAT was the whole reason I was here.  I&#39;ve been waiting and waiting to try this Mac &amp; Cheese pizza.  The one with non stop glowing reviews and famous pics waiving hello to me every single time I peeked in.
I like Mac &amp; Cheese.  I love pizza.  The two together is....pure gluttony, period.  Hey sometimes, you just gotta live on the wild side of pizza life...

And then suddenly... I locked eyes with the Garlic Gyros pizza.
I like gyros. I love pizza. The two combined, Oh holy mother of sinful pizzas...

When you want to taste 2 specialty pizzas, here&#39;s what you do.  You get the Mini Mac &amp; Cheese and order whatever size you need on the next.  Brilliant, I know. The only mini specialty they offer is M&amp;C (fyi). My lil studs wanted some wings, so I got an order of 6. Half Parmesan Garlic / Half Whiskey Bbq, came w/a side of blue cheese or ranch.

Even though it was a snowy, slushy wintery day, I found the will to trek out to Frato&#39;s. Easy to locate in a small strip with ample parking.  Small casual spot with a diner look. Walking in, it was dead.  No patron&#39;s inside.  The weather did suck.  They were however banging out orders for take-out and delivery per my conversation with the guy working.
I was even given a 45 min. wait time after calling....Wowzers, lots of pizza lovers in the world *smiles*.  $35 later (using my 10% off check-in), I grabbed my order.  

Let me tell you about this Mac &amp; Cheese pizza first.  It was the &#39;stick to your ribs&#39; type of mac. Nothing gourmet about it.  A heavy hand slathered on a very sturdy, crisp yet tender thin crust.  It was as if this crust was made for M&amp;C. No other sauce, topped with a healthy layer of melted cheese.  That was it.  And if you feel glutinous just reading this, imagine what a few bites feels like.  YES, it was ultra filling and heavy, and tastes exactly how it sounds. Comfort, cholesterol clogging food at its finest.  Thick cheese sauce was tucked away in every elbow noodle nook &amp; cranny.
I could only eat half a slice and these were big slices. A mini gives you a total of 4 large triangle slices. My nephews thought it was ok.  I thought Frato&#39;s totally delivered on this concept.  Bravo Frato&#39;s.

To my surprise, the Gyros pizza absolutely took the trophy.  It was too damn tasty for my own good.  Perfect amount of thick sliced gyro meat and fresh spinach leaves sitting in a white cream sauce and covered with gooey good quality mozz cheese.  It comes with fresh garlic and tomatoes, but I ordered without.  WOW...this REALLY tasted like a gyros on crust.  Make no mistake about it.  The white sauce perfectly complimented the zesty meat, leaving a hint of cool sour cream.  Gyro meat was good, little salty but NOT dry at all.  My nephews really enjoyed this and so did I...simply put, it just works. Crave worthy.

Bone-in Jumbo Wings weren&#39;t as &#34;jumbo&#34; as I expected based on reviews, but were decent as far as meaty goes. What I LOVED about these wings was how flavorful they were.  It tasted as if the sauce was baked into the wings. Lightly coated, cooked just right with great balance of sauce.  Garlic Parm was my fave and so addicting, I could of had 6 all to myself....Whiskey bbq had mild heat and was yummy too.  They were probably the TASTIEST wings I&#39;ve ever had. Not that I eat wings often, but they left quite an impression on me..so much so, that if I&#39;m ever craving wings, no doubt I will think of Frato&#39;s.  10 different sauces to choose from.  Even Ghost pepper for you fun loving masochists.. 

I have to give this place major props for the specialty pizza&#39;s.  They executed them without a hitch.  From the sauce, to the perfect crust and balance of cheese &amp; fresh toppings...
Every single bite tasted like the first time..It&#39;s a pizza experience everyone should have, if only just ONCE. 

Now that I&#39;ve had it, I can honestly say I don&#39;t plan on doing this again anytime in the near future Frato&#39;s....sorry, but sometimes, all you need is a ONE night pizza stand...and you were &#34;that&#34; kind of pizza for me.  I can guarantee, I&#39;ll never forget how scrumptious you were - - until next time. (I may see you for wings &amp; a slice though).

An insane selection of bacon/beef ground burgers, homemade pizza puffs &amp; mozz sticks, tater tots and 1 lb. pizza slices ($4.99 w/drink).  Sweets too.  I think I gained 5 lbs just writing this review...When your craving all things fattening, Frato&#39;s has you covered.."

But I can&#39;t believe this restaurant was ever on Chicago&#39;s best!  We stopped in for lunch last week, and the place was empty - which should have been a sign to us.   We also noticed that their fountain drinks had RC - that should have been our second sign to leave and not eat there.

We ordered the Garlic Dippers w/ marinara sauce, a slice of their supreme pizza and a gyro frato puff.  None of the items were good.  The Garlic dippers had barely any garlic taste and were just puffs of dough.  The pizza was so thick with crust/breading that you could barely taste the toppings.  The gyro puff did have lamb/gyro meat inside, but then had lots of cheese and marinara sauce.  I guess I was thinking it would contain ingredients of a gyro and not just lamb meat pizza.  All of items were a carb lovers dream b/c each of them contained so much dough/crust.  We literally left half the food.

As for atmosphere / ordering - it was not great.  There are lots of items listed on the wall when you come in - so I thought that was the full menu, but there were several other items you could have ordered - not that I think they would have been better.  But when you look at the menu online, you see all these burgers or different pizzas - not really stressed in the restaurant.  And if you recall how I said it was dead in the place when we were there?  Well - it took over 10 minutes for them to get us the three items of food we ordered.

There was really no redeeming quality about Frato&#39;s and I certainly wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone."

This diner-esque restaurant with all things delicious is a fun place to hang out at. They have an abundance of comfort food options like wings, pizza, burgers, hot dogs, and more.

I met up with some fellow Yelpers here over the summer for a fun UYE. I brought my sister along for dinner and we had a hard time choosing what to order because everything sounded so good! We finally narrowed it down to pizza which was a step in the right direction, but they have SO many options for pizza so we then had to tackle that. A simple solution? Two pizzas = more options.

I knew Frato&#39;s is famous for their adult mac and cheese pizza (which was featured on Chicago&#39;s Best), so we had to order that. This masterpiece includes grilled chicken, penne pasta, applewood-smoked bacon, grilled onions, cheddar and mozzarella cheese, with a special pizza sauce that you can get either spicy mild, spicy medium, or very hot inferno. I like hot stuff, but my sister is a bit on the mild side, so to play it save we went with the spicy mild sauce.

I&#39;m really glad we tried this pizza and it was definitely unique, but not sure it is something I would order on the regular. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s very good, but there&#39;s something about having pasta on top of my already carbo-lific pizza that just doesn&#39;t sit right with me. Plus with the chicken and spice also happening, to me it was just way too many flavors on one slice. Definitely give this fan favorite a try, but I would suggest getting a small size pizza because it will fill you up! The spicy mild sauce was also no joke, so unless you can take the heat I would stick with that.

For our second pizza we decided to create our own. They give you the option to choose everything from your crust to sauce to cheese and toppings. Our pizza was made up of their standard thin crust, creamy garlic white sauce, spinach, onion, and a mozzarella and aged parmesan cheese blend. This combo was amazing!! We absolutely loved it. I highly suggest the white sauce.

We of course took tons of pizza home since we ordered for an army, but that was fine with us! The pizza (like most) reheated beautifully. To top this experience off, they offer craft beer and alcoholic root beer - yum! The staff is super awesome and friendly. They also have a TV which is great when there&#39;s a game on.

Tip: Check in on your Yelp app! They offer 10% off pizza, burgers, and wings."

I&#39;d had my eye on them for awhile now, and was pretty excited to give it a shot.  The set up is pretty nice, seat yourself at a booth or table, and belly up to the counter when you&#39;re ready to order.  
     There are plenty of options here, you can order by the slice, build your own pizza, or try one of there specialty pizzas.  They&#39;ve got plenty of sides to choose from as well.  To start with, we ordered the adult Mac and cheese.  You can get it with bacon or grilled chicken, but we chose neither.   We weren&#39;t disappointed, it was creamy and tasty just like Mac and cheese should be.  A word of caution though, this is some seriously spicy Mac and cheese!  For dinner, we ordered the gyro pizza, which consisted spinach, sausage,  tomato, and garlic.  I have to say, I tend to go for the more plain options when it comes to pizza, and I&#39;m not usually fond of spinach, but this was delicious.  Some places go a bit overboard on the spinach, but here I felt it was just right!
     I would definitely recommend Frato&#39;s.  Especially as a lunch option, since they offer pizza by the slice.  Enjoy!"

I have one of those in my hometown, so I completely understand. However, my late Friday night visit was mildly underwhelming, to say the least. Coming from someone completely new to the area, I wasn&#39;t sure whether to look at the big menu board on the left hand side which had no prices or information, look at the folded paper menus on the counter, grab one of the laminated menus that people were holding, look at the handwritten signs that are difficult to read because people stand in front of it... No clue what to do. I tried to eavesdrop on the gentleman ordering in front of me, and that did not bode well for me either because the heavy-set bald gentleman taking his order was quite rude to him. So, I was scared to ask him questions. I wanted to do a single slice of pizza, but apparently later in the evening they do not offer that.

Settled on the buffalo chicken pizza, which came out with big sticks of celery baked into it. It was also very greasy and about 4000 degrees. The guy making the pizza was nice if we preferred squares or slices, so that was cool. Also, the small guy with the buzz cut and the beard who spent our entire visit cleaning, high five to you. You work your tail off and I noticed.

I could go into lots of detail about the decor, with the black and white checkered tile everywhere... But that&#39;s just the seating area. The walls are obnoxiously neon green, there&#39;s old school Italian throwback murals on the wall by the pizza oven, and the bathrooms are done in a James Dean/Marilyn Monroe fashion. There&#39;s a quiet little wii over in on one side of the dining area, and sports playing on a couple other TVs. None of the decor seems to mesh together well or give a true Italian feel to this place.

But, then again, I&#39;ve eaten Mexican food out of people&#39;s trunks and the 5 second rule doesn&#39;t really apply to me... So I don&#39;t really care what the place looks like if the food is good and the people are nice. That&#39;s where we run into a bit of an issue."

With that being said, I still love-hate Why Did I Get Married? And he made a valid point about The 80/20 Rule for Relationships. Basically, humans (though the finger was strongly pointed at men in this one) expect to get 100% from a relationship, but you&#39;re lucky if you get 80%. Sadly, 80% doesn&#39;t seem to be enough to satisfy and you&#39;ll wander to fulfill your desire for the additional 20%. At the end of the day, you sacrificed a really good thing to get a little more because you were greedy.

What&#39;s my point with all of this? If you&#39;re gonna cheat, at least go from 20% to 80%. Not that I endorse cheating... But I have to admit that I am a cheater. I&#39;m by no means a clean eater, but I&#39;ve been trying to be healthier. Still, I went to Frato&#39;s on my &#34;Cheat Day&#34; for Angela P&#39;s UYE. It was totally worth it!

I love mac and cheese and I love pizza, so I&#39;m always pretty excited when I see there&#39;s a mac and cheese pizza option. Frato&#39;s got 2 of them! There&#39;s an Adult Mac &amp; Cheese Pizza. It&#39;s kinda like a spicy chicken pasta pizza. And then there&#39;s the Aged Cheddar Mac &amp; Cheese Pizza, which is the one I got. It&#39;s fantastic! So many mac and cheese pizzas have let me down and only been at 20%. This one is easily a 90%+, so it&#39;s no wonder that they were rated #5 Best Pizzeria in the Chicago area by Chicago&#39;s Best. The cheese is abundant and has a really good flavor! It&#39;s not at all dry.

My dining companions were pretty happy with their pizzas, but I got the feeling they wanted to wander on over to mine. I can&#39;t blame them. Though CM Jacqueline B and her sister built their own pizza and it looked like a contender.

Sarah S ordered a hot dog combo and it seems standard. She said the fries aren&#39;t the best but they looked good enough. Angela P and Dominic P got the garlic Parmesan fries, which I did try. Those were tasty but a bit too salty. There&#39;s no way I could have eaten a whole order of them and I only ate half of my 8&#34; mini pizza. They don&#39;t skimp on toppings here, so you&#39;re guaranteed to leave full!

Service was fast and casual but went above and beyond. You order at the register (don&#39;t forget the 10% discount with Yelp check-in!) and they bring the food to your table. Everyone was very nice and one of the employees even brought me a complimentary cup for the pop machine after I finished my bottled Sprecher Hard Root Beer."

As the big chain pizza parlors moved in, most of the small family owned pizza parlors disappeared, except one. I have to take a bit of a drive to get a Frato&#39;s pizza, but it&#39;s well work it.

I picked up their 14&#34; Mediterranean gyro pizza and it is so delicious. It&#39;s topped with lamb gyro, tomatoes, black olives, onion, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese and oregano. You would have to go to Naples Italy to find a comparable pizza.

The staff was very friendly."

I saw on the Yelp site that they had truffle fries which are no longer on the menu so that was disappointing . If the slices were a little thinner with more cheese and cooked a little bit more I would have loved it but that is not the case . I will try this place again to see if the pizza is better when I order a whole thin crust pizza ."

I think they changed locations to this place sometime during my high school years. I always had a soft spot for their hotdogs. They know how to top them off right. I was recently introduced to their whiskey burger and it was fantastic, the grilled onions swimming in that sauce were out of this world (they should be sold as a side order...whiskey onions please) but the downfall of Fratos is their pizza and prices. First, their pizza was soooooo average and just too doughy. They had a few sausage slices in their hot box, but no cheese or any other flavors and it was only 2pm. The waffle fries are not the soft fresh kind but more like the dry, string fry kind. I&#39;m sure some prefer them this way, maybe? My hot dog (with fries and drink) was over 8 bucks (WHAT?), a burger was 11 bucks and large pizza slice was about 5 ( probably the only thing fairly priced). So our meal came to almost 30 bucks. Hmmm...not too cool for a burger/hotdog joint in Schaumburg. Hot dog should be about 4 bucks and burger around 6 or 7, no? Anyway, the whiskey burger makes me want to come back to this place, well and the close proximity to my folks. I do like their large flavor selection of wings and will update this review once I try some of them. Oh, and the counter girl was very sweet and RC is their fountain drink of choice, extra star there."

It was not a very good experience. Pizza slice was mediocre and close to cold. Wings were above BWW&#39;s but not legendary. What hurt the most was the service. Not exactly friendly and I walked out feeling that I was more of burden than a paying patron. I wasn&#39;t high maintenance either. Maybe the sour look from the cash-man that I wanted a glass of water over a cup of soda? A simple order of wings and a slice and felt it was painful for them to serve me on a lowly Wednesday lunch. Didn&#39;t mean to bother them with making a special stop to sample what I thought was going to be great lunch visit. Can&#39;t say I would go back, or recommend, because walking out I felt the sunshine by media outlets made them feel more important than they are. Too many competitors out there that makes an easy &#34;no-go&#34; again opinion. HUGE disappointment."

I even talked to a non-yelping friend that I knew had been here who would give an honest review. I did my research before this experience!

My opportunity for the experience finally came when I was sent to Schaumburg for a work conference. I skipped lunch so I could save room to eat as much pizza as humanly possible! I ordered my aged cheddar Mac n cheese pizza through their website at 4:48 pm. It projected delivery to my hotel at 5:51. At 5:30, a piping hot pizza arrived to my hotel room. 

PRO TIP: Order delivery through their website and it&#39;s free with no minimum. When I looked at grub hub, I saw a delivery charge and a minimum requirement. 

First, free delivery is really hard to come by. The hotel was 2.5 miles from Frato&#39;s. Still free. Amazing! The only free delivery I get in the near west burbs is from Sarpino&#39;s so for a local small business to offer it really says something.

Now the important part - my pizza! Ehrmagawd! It was unbelievable. I really wish my stomach was a bottomless pit and I could just keep eating it and eating it. It was the most amazing platter of comfort and ooze in one. The crust had a nice crisp to it but the real winner was the cheddar sauce. It just meshed perfectly with the cheese on top. The flavor of it was absolutely out of this world. 

So, Frato&#39;s, if you&#39;re ever thinking of opening a second location, I encourage the North Riverside area. I order food every day. I would be ordering every day!"

I quite literally have never spoken to such rude staff members in my life either. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt and blame it on being tired or in a bad mood that day, but I gave it multiple tries and every time the lady on the phone was so rude and unhelpful that I never finished my order. In my first experience, I tried to place an order through grub hub and it didn&#39;t work. I figured it might&#39;ve just been down, so I used their online ordering through the Fratos website. It said it went through, so I called to double check, especially after now an hour of trying to make this order go through. The lady on the receiving end told me she didn&#39;t get the order, so I decided just to go right to the source and place it with her. Before I even started the order, she asked me &#34;We&#39;re busy. It&#39;s going to be over 45 minutes. You know that right?&#34; After all the online malfunctions I didn&#39;t mind and just decided to place it anyways. After the end of my order, she informed me that they were now closed and she couldn&#39;t take my order. I kindly explained I&#39;ve spend over an hour trying to place it online, and it was really frustrating that she wasn&#39;t even willing to take my order after just having gone through it all. She rudely said &#34;Sorry, we&#39;re closed.&#34; And hung up on me. When I called back, she said the same thing and hung up on me again.

He even got lost after the hotel front desk gave him a highlighted map to our room.  I could hear his blasting radio going back and forth down the parking lot in front of our room for many minutes.  He finally found us.  He handed us our bag of food.  No 2 liter bottle of diet RC that we ordered and paid for.  Oh, well.  Tap water it is.  The burger (posted a photo) was swimming in mustard.  It was inedible.  The onion rings were fine, even though they were room temperature.  The truffle Parmesan fries had absolutely no truffle flavor and were underdone and soggy.  Never again!

*UPDATE* My review is fair and accurate.  Management&#39;s choice to personally attack my character, because of its displeasure over a one star review, indicates a corporate culture that would rather bash critics, than learn from them.  His attempt to have me removed from Yelp reminds me of a spoiled child who runs to mommy to demand that a schoolmate be excluded from his birthday party, because he picked him last for the dodgeball team.

As for abusing your staff over the phone, you&#39;ve been lied to.  I called and a guy identifying himself as chef so and so (can&#39;t remember his name) answered.  He said, &#34;We will call GrubHub and issue a refund.&#34;  I said, &#34;Great.&#34;  Right after I hung up, your driver finally found me and knocked on the door.  I accepted the food, because I felt sorry for him.  I then called back to let you know that I got my food, but no pop and the chef told me you could cook it again.  I didn&#39;t want them to go to that trouble as it was quite late, so I declined.  The refund was issued, which I noted in my original review.  At all times I was polite and congenial.

The moral of the story is, before you make yourself look belligerent by slamming someone for a one star review, perhaps you should note the big picture of your reviews here, complaints about bad food and rude staff.  Or, you can just ignore it, bash reviewers, and drive your business into the ground.

READ THE REVIEWS, FOLKS, AND YOU WILL SEE THAT MY REVIEW IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HE HAS ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE.  YOU WILL SEE OTHERS.  IT MAKES YOU WONDER HOW MANY BAD REVIEWS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED. IT SEEMS FRATO&#39;S ONLY WANTS FIVE STAR REVIEWS ON ITS YELP PAGE.  WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO HIDE?"

On the other hand I believe I wasn&#39;t ordering some of their famous menu items and it was a mistake on my part.  Tonight I ordered their Chicago Style Italian Beef specialty pizza and it was excellent.  Huge slices of pizza with a perfect amount of toppings, cheese and sauce.  One thing i&#39;ve always enjoyed is the different dipping sauces they create. Tonight I tried the Sweet Pineapple Habenero sauce and it was out of this world.

&#34;Styles Available: Crispy Paperthin, Regular Thin, Cheesy Thick&#34;.

Tell  em how you want it and you&#39;ll get it that way. 

Ok, &#34;some&#34; city people may not feel entirely comfortable with the free parking and quicker service, but don&#39;t expect fast food here, good food takes time. 
Good news is your car won&#39;t be either gone or up on blocks when you roll out. I like a place I can watch my car from my window booth.

Last time I stopped in, Ed let me sample some drinks I had never heard of (not old enuf) Green River Soda? And made me a Chicken Cobb salad we ate on for days, and yes it took some time to make, the bacon and the eggs, and the chicken, seriously FRESH, not out of a cooler.

Ed just won the local WINGS competition, WELL deserved, and a big deal.

I apologize for being SO delinquent on this review after eating here so many times. Frato&#39;s supports local schools and teams, has one of those fun checkerboard floors I love, wall graphics, PLUS clean and friendly. 
I shouldn&#39;t have to get motivated by an old Chicagoan dissing the suburbs to finish this, but I did.
Enjoy. Tell em Jacob sent you."

When you&#39;re about to indulge in enough calories for 2 days in one meal, I guess it does make sense that you might want to get that metabolism going, right?  Work up a little sweat jumping hurdles, or something.  Well, you can do that at Frato&#39;s.  It might even make you feel a little less guilty about indulging in the aforementioned calories.  I walked around Ikea for 3 hours and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond for at least an hour, so I could have cared less about calories.  I wanted food before I became cranky and said things I didn&#39;t mean.

The second visit here is what made me think Frato&#39;s is kind of, sort of worth driving to Schaumburg for.  I will happily drive to Ikea or Woodfield if it means a trip to Frato&#39;s!  The first time around I had some wings and the Italian Beef pizza.  The wings had great flavor, but weren&#39;t necessarily my favorite.  The pizza, while good, didn&#39;t have much flavor.  The giardiniera was tasteless, which made no sense to me.  Those little garlic bite things were interesting, but kind of weird.  I wasn&#39;t sure how I felt about them.

This time around though, things were different.  I wanted everything.  Pizza, wings and a burger.  Naturally, I demanded someone&#39;s wings and a bite or 4 of their pizza in exchange for some of my burger.  Best deal ever.  I recommend you don&#39;t dine alone here, this way you can do the same.  At the very last minute I decided to order the burger of the week, which is apparently in honor of whatever team the Bears are playing.  Lucky for me, it was St. Louis and that was possibly the greasiest, juiciest and best burger I have had in quite some time.  Total hangover burger.  I kind of glanced at the ingredients, but the tempura battered bun was genius.  GENIUS!!  

The burger of the week comes with fried and a beer if you make it a meal, which I did.  I appreciated that someone came around (the cook?) and straight up told me the beer wasn&#39;t as cold as it should be, and he&#39;d let me choose anything else I wanted.  I stuck with the beer it comes with, and I can see why he warned me.  While good, it would have been perfect if it was just slightly colder.  

The beer menu improved, the beer they brew is actually good (and cheap!) and the staff is friendly.  I&#39;ll be back, eventually."

It did not disappoint. 

Super casual in its retro 50s diner style decor, and xbox kinect games, we quickly perused the menu and decided on the cheeseburger combo to share which included fries and a drink for $6, plus got a slice of the highly regarded pizza. We spent about $13 total (thanks Yelp check-in deal) and went home with leftovers!

If you are hungry, you won&#39;t go wrong here. Nothing we had was small. The small fries could easily be shared with 3 people. The cheeseburger was not only delicious, it was pretty generous in size as well, and really hit the &#34;I need a chargrilled, juicy burger&#34; mark for me. And that is probably one of the largest (non stuffed or deep dish) slices of pizza I&#39;ve encountered. Very tasty, super hearty thick crust and the toppings and cheese were just right.

Future visits will include truffle oil fries and a full on pie of one of their more unusual varieties. And wings. Oh lord, too many yummy things to try! Can&#39;t wait to go back! :-)"

First of all the delivery driver forgot my salad, which wasn&#39;t that big of issue as they had it sent out right away and gave us free fries and a chocolate cake for the mistake.  

So here&#39;s the rundown on taste.  Our pizza burger was so soggy and greasy we had to replace the bread.  It was still so disgusting my fiance was not able to stomach eating it.  The container it came in was so greasy it left a spot on my chair, with only being placed there for a moment.  The wings and buffalo chicken on my salad tasted old and freezer burnt?  I&#39;m not sure but the chicken was bad!  The breading just fell off when I picked it up to eat it.  The only thing on my salad that was fresh was the lettuce.  I ate some of that.  The rest I threw away.  

The free fries were undercooked and limp and the chocolate cake was the worst of all.  Cardboard consistency, obviously OLD, and no taste whatsoever.  Really, judging by this meal I am scared to see what the kitchen looks like and how my food was prepared.  I didn&#39;t call to complain, because frankly I was not interested in any gift certificates, etc.  SOOO Gross!!"

The food is good, and that the only reason you&#39;re getting 3 stars.    I called ahead to order two gyro meals.  
I was told it would take 30 minutes to pick up.  
I arrived and the bill was 27.00.    
For two gyros guys?  
I&#39;ll miss it, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be back."
fratos-pizza-schaumburg-5,Sarah S.,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,3545,37,9Qvbo7hP8u8tVWMQzscsig,5.0,2013-07-10,"What do you after a 10 mile bike ride? You go to Frato&#39;s to binge eat and negate all your hard work! At least that&#39;s what my buddy and I did. 

I was first introduced to the goodness that is Frato&#39;s in reviews from my friends Candice G. and Pari P. Then the stars aligned and a Yelp event took place here. Shima C. was my plus one and has been dying to go back since the event! Finally her time came this past Sunday.

Before going we both looked over the menu and it&#39;s completely overwhelming. There are so many delicious choices and we both have an issue with ordering everything we want even if we can&#39;t actually eat it all. I always say my eyes are bigger than my belly.

I ordered the Pizza Special which is a phenomenal deal - $4.99 for a slice of their specialty pizza and a drink. Now when I say a slice, I use the term loosely because truly it&#39;s a huge honkin&#39; gigantic quarter of a pizza! The piece alone could give me lunch &amp; dinner...but I was ravenous and gobbled it down! The special changes every day but on Sunday it was Broccoli and Cheese and so friggin yummy.

I also ordered a Breakfast Burger to go so I could eat that for dinner. The burger is $7.50 with egg, bacon and cheese on a cheddar bagel. I didn&#39;t read the bagel part so when I opened it up I was like HOLY JEEBUS! This is amazing. And the great thing? It tasted even better than it looked. Oh yesh, I would get it again in a second.

Now my tiny, drop dead gorgeous friend ordered twice her body weight in food and was kind enough to share the goods with me to taste. She ordered 6 jumbo boneless wings, large basket of parmesan truffle fries and a full size Vegetarian Goat specialty pizza (which she first tried at the event and loved) and she was THIS close to ordering herself a pizza puff to top it all off. And yes, we both got ice cream for dessert. Stop judging us! 
The wangs were some of  the best I&#39;ve ever had! So juicy and the various flavors are da bomb. Parmesan garlic was my absolute favorite! The parmesan truffle fries were not too truffley and had there not been a mention of truffle I would have loved them. However, they left something to be desired due to the lack of truffle flavor. Their gourmet ice cream is amazing! I loved the Tahitian vanilla...so rich and flavorful.

It&#39;s so hard to pick what my favorite thing about Frato&#39;s is. Is it their extensive craft beer list? Is it the fact that they have constantly changing burgers of the week and constantly changing daily specialty pizzas? Or is it the amazing price I can try those specialty pizzas at? Is it because they have giant TVs I can watch games on while chilling out in a super relaxed environment in a comfy old school booth? Perhaps it&#39;s that jolly chef who I met at the Elite event who won my heart when he told me I looked 17. Or maybe it&#39;s just that their food is friggin good! Hard to pick.

I was really happy to see Frato&#39;s have a few other tables sat on a Sunday about 130pm. This is such a great establishment - I&#39;m now determined to make going here a regular thing...and bring some coworkers, too!

Pro-Tip: Yelp check-in offer gives you 10% off!

Edit:7/21- Phill C. and I told our company all about how great Frato&#39;s is and convinced our company to try them for our Friday Beer O Clock a couple of weeks ago. I&#39;m happy to say our coworkers loved Frato&#39;s as much as we do and it&#39;s now added into our Beer O Clock rotation.I know that this past Friday they gave us a free order of Smores even though we were a bit under their $200 requirement. Thanks, Frato&#39;s! Our whole office was grateful! 

Since getting this delivery, I was able to try their pizza puffs and Smores Puffs - both are great. Loved the pizza puffs and the smores puffs are such a decadent dessert, reminds me of a rich donut. Plus everyone loved the Seasonal Caprese Salad - I think they would have liked it a bit more if their weren&#39;t tomatoes...they thought it was strange to have in a fruit salad. Then this caused a big discussion of whether tomatoes are truly a fruit or veggie. :P"

THREE words, Pizza, Wings &amp; Burgers.... well actually EVERYTHING here is good! Lets just say if one family member wants a burger, the other wants wings, someone else wants pizza and your sister wants a chocolate shake... Frato&#39;s is your one stop shop. The owner is beyond sweet and truly loves his customers and business. I love chatting with him about his business and how much love he puts into what his team does. The employees are fantastic and it is always a fun time to come here. Also, Frato&#39;s just one the award for BEST WINGS at Wing Fest! So I mean, they have awards to back it up. I have a feeling Frato&#39;s will become the Portillo&#39;s of wings (among everything else ;) )

Other times, I find a place I love and come back the next day, and possibly a week after that. Oh and a few days later. Frato&#39;s falls in the latter category. After an awesome Yelp event here recently, I needed to come back and experience Frato&#39;s again as a plain ol&#39; customer. In fact, my husband and I have actually returned here a couple times since the event AND had pizza delivered to us! We&#39;re in love. (With Frato&#39;s.... of course we&#39;re in love with each other. Right? Yeah.)

Frato&#39;s is this hip and adorable pizza establishment in an unsuspecting strip mall off Roselle Road in Schaumburg. I&#39;m in love with the restaurant&#39;s retro look -- black and white checkered floors, black and red booths and tables/chairs, decor of cars and Hollywood Icons, etc. Classic. The people who work here are very sweet and we&#39;ve always has pleasant interactions with the other customers -- aka some of the sweetest, nicest bikers you&#39;ll ever meet (YAY).

Let&#39;s talk about the food. I&#39;ve tried:

- Frato&#39;s craft-brewed caramel ale
- Frato&#39;s craft-brewed wheat summer ale
- the arrabbiata pasta with broccoli
- regular thin-crust cheese pizza
- vegetarian goat pizza
- their french fries

Beers are excellent. Pizzas are drool-worthy (I swear the vegetarian goat pizza was made just for me -- it&#39;s heaven on pizza). The arrabbiata pasta is deliciously spicy (an unexpected kick, I admit). I know also know that Frato&#39;s apparently has amazing (and spicy) sauce, but I&#39;m not a sauce person so I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve tried it. My husband has also ordered the wings and they were huge! He couldn&#39;t finish them when paired with the fries, which are hard to stop eating!

One of Frato&#39;s awesome specials for June is a free ice cream with a whole pizza order. I&#39;ve had both of this month&#39;s options: vanilla and apple pie. The vanilla is yummy in my tummy. And the apple pie ice cream? Surprisingly delicious! Who knew that apple pie could be a great ice cream flavor? Cool.

I&#39;m SO glad I found out about Frato&#39;s; just goes to show you that you can&#39;t overlook strip mall establishments and judge a book by its cover.This is the kind of place that becomes a classic establishment in a town. I hope they&#39;re around for years to come."

It used to be the place that you could score a greasy slice or a hot dog complete with a bag of fries. Well, I&#39;ve grown up (figuratively, not literally - I&#39;m the same height) and so has Frato&#39;s! 

Inside Frato&#39;s has been cleaned up considerably and now reflects a 50s throwback. Red vinyl booths, hand drawn illustrations on the wall, black and white (gleaming) checkered floor and 12 (yes, 12) James Dean photos in the ladies restroom. 

The food has most certainly received a facelift as well. Chef Ed (a super nice guy) revamped the menu and expanded the offerings to include creative pizzas (paper thin, thin and thick crust options), burgers, salads, tots, plenty o&#39; sides, a special brew made just for Frato&#39;s (carmel ale which is so smooth and fantastic) and more. Todd &amp; I ordered up the coffee burger, an adult mac &#39;n cheese pizza and a side of garlic tots. Hey - it was my birthday - don&#39;t judge on the ordering...we didn&#39;t finish it all! 

Garlic tots - Crispy, tender tots lightly tossed with a bit of butter, oil and a delightful sprinkling of herbs. 

Coffee burger - The patties were juicy and flavorful, however, the burger&#39;s delightful coffee finish (and additional toppings) were dwarfed by the doughy pretzel bun. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love a pretzel bun, but I found myself de-carbing the burger to enjoy the flavors. 

Fries - I could do without. They were fine - hot, fresh and brown - but nothing to write home about. I prefer a crispy fry and these were a tad limp. 

Adult Mac &#39;n Cheese Pizza - Penne and cheese covered the surface of our pie and nestled the grilled chicken and bacon. It&#39;s no low cal pizza but it was bursting with flavor. Extra props to Ed for recommending the habanero garlic sauce. Said sauce had just enough kick to keep the flavors in tact while still encouraging me to sip my water quite frequently. 

The pizza and tots completely won me over, so next time I&#39;m craving some very not good for me delectables, I&#39;m beelining it to Frato&#39;s."

After discovering Frato&#39;s yesterday, I want to officially go on record as saying that 2013 will NOT be the year of a bikini-ready body for moi. Nope. Not this girl. Not after paper-thin crust pizza this perfect. 

I repeat: Mozzarella. Moo-moos. Merriment. Me.

Okay, let&#39;s be real - I don&#39;t actually plan on getting obese off Frato&#39;s thin crust pizza. That&#39;d be sad... because then I&#39;d missing out on the fresh-cut fries and the craft beer they *just* started serving last week. I plan on getting girthy on all of the above. 

My first visit was today and I&#39;d be comfortable calling it a fruitful one. I found them through a fellow yelper only yesterday, but apparently been here for over 30 years and somehow I managed to never notice... and if you happen to be one of those who had noticed Frato&#39;s in the past, I&#39;d recommend revisiting now that ownership changed and Chef Ed has been put behind the kitchen helm. The menu is different, the recipes are different and from the looks of things (weekly specials, ever-changing craft beer list, burger of the week, video game tourneys, etc), they&#39;ve got lots up their sleeve as far ad reinventing goes when it comes to this elder eatery. 

My first thoughts while walking in were that it was much more &#39;alive&#39; in here than other places that try to do what Frato&#39;s does. I&#39;m tempted to call it fast food, but they make you order up on the spot and if you&#39;ve got a pizza you should expect around a 20-minute wait, which will be the most enjoyable 20-minutes of waiting ever because they&#39;ve got a Nintendo Wii set up in the dining area so you bowl your heart out before you eat your heart out. LOVED this. 

You order at the counter and there&#39;s around ten 4-top tables and 3 booths to wait in the meantime. There&#39;s a soda fountain and a few TVs set to sports, though I&#39;m sure they&#39;d put on whatever you want if there isn&#39;t a game on. Chef Ed took my order and while I&#39;ll say that he was pretty cocky about the excellence of his eats, he wasn&#39;t wrong. I got a bit of assistance on my order and the items I got pretty much made my day go from mundane to most excellent. 

***** I got a bottle of Lagunitas Lil Sumpin&#39; Sumpin which I pretty much shotgunned in record time, got pretty buzzed, and then ended up walking up the strip mall lot and around the corner to Quake Collectibles and bought a somewhat-pricey, nearly 2-foot tall statue of Han Solo riding a Tauntaun that I likely would not have purchased on a more sober whim. 

***** 12-inch pizza with a mozzarella and pepperjack cheese blend, black olives and mushrooms, with red sauce on their paper-thin crust, but I&#39;m a thin-crust kind of gal. It was out of this world good. Like, a fight ensued with my partner and I over who got the last pieces.

**** An order of fresh cut fries with cheese, which I also devoured in record time. I&#39;m a person who lives for soggy fries. I know most people like &#39;em crispy, but I&#39;m all about the limp, soggy, shiny, fresh-cut kind, just like my childhood favorites from Steve&#39;s Gyros in Villa Park, and they totally won me with these. The cheese was okay, I&#39;d rather it be that nacho cheese stuff with the fake jalapeno flavor, but I guess just cheddar is cool too. Most people probably prefer that anyway. 

*** An order of the vegetarian chili. I wasn&#39;t in love with this. To me it was too much tomato, but it was also my first time having veggie chili that didn&#39;t have some sort of meat substitute in it, so maybe that&#39;s where my expectations were off. Also, the way the cheddar sat on top didn&#39;t make for the best presentation, shredded cheese would&#39;ve gone over much better, but that&#39;s okay. It&#39;s almost summer and chili isn&#39;t really ever my first choice anyway. 

**** Adult Mac &amp; Cheese -- penne pasta with alfredo sauce blended with buffalo sauce. I chose their ghost pepper inferno sauce instead of their standard buffalo and yes, my butt paid the price tonight, but I&#39;m glad I tried it. It was good, but I think next time I&#39;ll do the standard buffalo sauce with the pasta, and get a side of the inferno sauce to dip my pizza in. I should also note that my partner ate two noodles of this dish and thought he was going to die... the inferno, or anything with the ghost peppers, isn&#39;t for the faint of heart. It&#39;s a creeper, and it WILL sneak up on your ass... and your tongue... and your stomach lining... and then back to your ass again. You have to be ready to appreciate the burn.

***** Chef Ed also let me try out a new hot sauce he&#39;s been working on with one of their fresh-roasted garlic breadsticks. The sauce tastes like a really hot churro (so good), sweet, spicy and savory at the same time. He said it&#39;s made with apples -- more specifically 6 gallons of cider, reduced to one one gallon, then he adds cinnamon and again ghost peppers. 

Frato&#39;s: You rocked my f*cking world!"

That&#39;s what happened to me after eating Frato&#39;s Adult Mac and Cheese Pizza with Inferno Sauce. The notorious Candice G&#39;s review brought me here. 

Shame on me for not trying this place after living within walking distance of Frato&#39;s for the past seven years. For the record, I got my @&amp;$ kicked by the Inferno sauce. It was flavored with the ghost chili and I was only able to eat five pieces before my ears started ringing. For a moment, I thought I was going to hallucinate and start seeing a talking coyote like when Homer ate that pepper in The Simpsons. It had me calling out my safe word in submission. 

Talk about adult, the sauce is XXX rated and shouldn&#39;t be anywhere near children. I didn&#39;t even dare touching my baby after having sauce on my fingers. The flavors were full and bold but wow was it spicy. It was the first time that I had to drink two cups of milk after eating a pizza. 

For those who are looking for intense spice or are masochistic in nature, Frato&#39;s has several items on the menu to make your lips and @#$ burn. With free Kinect play, video game tournaments, and other naughty items on the menu, I&#39;ll definitely be back."

That is not meant to be a bad statement, as they do offer alot of variety which makes it a great place to go to when you have a bunch of people who cannot decide what to get to eat.  I have never had anything that is bad there, but I also haven&#39;t experienced any can&#39;t miss meals.  Their service is above average, the one time I had an issue with a delivery they went above and beyond to take care of me, and that says alot about a business in my opinion.  They also often call you later in the evening after deliveries to ensure everything was good with your order.  I have ordered many different things here from gyros, hamburgers, fries, wings, and of course pizza!  My favorite thing about Frato&#39;s is that they have Green River on tap!

I got the Bears week special double topped with mac n cheese, avocado and chorizo, it was fantastic.  One of the best tasting burgers I&#39;ve had in a long time.  The mac n cheese was outstanding. Excellent flavor.  They get a big nod from me for that.  Thankfully we ate there though because I can&#39;t imagine that burger would travel well at all.  It was pretty greasy probably thanks to the chorizo.  

Sadly, despite the fantastic taste I can&#39;t really give this place more than 3 stars.

The problem in our experience is that the value just isn&#39;t there.  Way too expensive IMO.  My weekly special was a double but the patties are small.  Burger alone was **$9.49*** plus tax (Schaumburg has very high prepared food tax, over 10%).  Truthfully from the menu I expected a monster so when it showed up I was suprised to see it was quite small for a gourmet chef&#39;s burger.  I could have eaten two of them if I passed on the tater tots, and I&#39;m not that big an eater despite being a bit of a foodie.  I rarely can say that after eating a burger at a restaurant.  My wife got a single hamburger, it was almost $5 and it was very small.  She said it was also excellent.  $4 for the garlic herb tater tots (20 tots?) which were tasty but yes, bathing in oil.  Oil should enhance, not overwhelm.  Not crunchy like tater tots should be.  

Now keep in mind this place is a pizzeria, with ten or so 50s retro diner booths and tables.   It&#39;s NOT fancy, so to me there&#39;s no good reason to have prices so far out of line with competitors in the area.  Suburban Chicago, not ritzy suburban Chicago either, things are a lot cheaper than this on the whole.  I get they use quality ingredients.  Lots of places do though, and keep prices in check.  It&#39;s how you get repeat business.

Truthfully, we left not feeling good about spending $25 for 2 &#34;small&#34; burgers, I side and 1 drink (with $2 tip for the counter people).  We could have gone for an excellent handmade pub burger of similar quality at one of a number of places around for that, or less cosidering what we had.  Village Tavern and The Assembly out that way, and Draft Picks closer to home, all come to mind.

So that&#39;s where I leave it.  If you like burgers I do encourage you to try it, but know you&#39;ll leave with a much lighter wallet.

Who knows though, maybe I&#39;ll try the pizza some time when we&#39;re out that way.  Looks like pie prices are more in line with other places.  And the service was very good.  Counter people were helpful and patient as we perused the menu."

They don&#39;t deliver to my mom&#39;s place so we had to pick it up. We got thin crust and a double crust. The double crust was very nice and they give you sooo many topping that you can tell are clearly fresh. But the thin crust was the best. It really was some of the greatest pizza I had in the burbs. My whole family really enjoyed it and we will be ordering from there again. My only gripe is the prices are pretty steep. If they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be 5 stars."

I seriously had one of the best burgers ever when he made me the burger in my picture, it was mouth-wateringly delicious!

Ed is so personable and a cool guy to just sit and talk with!  He truly cares about his customer&#39;s service!

So their food is deliciously yummy, their staff is kind and happy to assist their customers, and the place is pretty sweet too!

In the warmer weather, they cater to big groups on certain nights when Road &amp; Track Riders of Chicago want to do a bike night meet up, and he let&#39;s us all park right out front so we can keep an eye on our bikes.

The place inside has a decent amount of seating, some TVs if you want to watch the game or what not, and even a game console..perhaps the Wii for Wii bowling?  Is there an Xbox there too? Not sure, this is a pretty sweet place to grab some delish grub, and meet up with some friends to just chillax!  

 I would definitely much rather give my business to this local yummy high quality place, than just going to Domino&#39;s or Pizza Slut (where my husband has gotten violently ill from... yeeesh)

So if you&#39;re craving a delish pizza pie, pop on down to Frato&#39;s, they&#39;re awesome!!!

::EDIT::Update!:: 
I have shamelessly gone to Frato&#39;s twice in three days, and successfully eaten Frato&#39;s each of those days (yummy left-over pizzaaa!)

My buddy &amp; I ordered an 18&#34; Vegetarian Goat Pizza with the &#34;thick&#34; crust, aaaaand it is now my new favorite pizza.  
*I&#39;m a sucker for goat cheeeeese!*
The &#34;thick&#34; crust was perfect though, it wasn&#39;t crazy thick like a deep-dish or anything, it was more similar to what I would describe as hand-tossed, or &#34;regular&#34; at other pizza joints.  It was perfect...  Two pieces (square cut, they must do this unless you specify triangles) and I was full... so there were leftovers...for the next two days... which was fine by me, even though we split the pizza 50-50, I still had food for the next two days and I got to enjoy my new favorite pizza again &amp; again!
Then tonight, the hubbs was home, so I thought I would take him for his first time EVER!  We were both actually feeing burgers/sandwiches, and wanted to eat-in.  I think for him, I had hyped it up too much because he was let down, and it wasn&#39;t everything he was hoping for :&#39;(.
We walked in, and who I think was &#34;Jessica&#34; turned to look at us as I smiled, but neglected to extend a warm welcome greeting, and she just walked to the register. :(
I showed hubbs that I think when eating in, we just walk to the register, stand there awkwardly &amp; read the menu.  When we walked in though, I saw the &#34;Specials&#34; foldy-chalkboard with Chef Ed&#39;s latest burger creation, &#34;The Minnesota Maple&#34; and being a Minnesota-native, this girl just had to give it a go...and it sounded amazing  (see my pics for description and photos of it!) so we gave Jessica our order: that MN burger, his triple cheeseburger with tomato, grilled mushrooms &amp; onions, and split an order of the &#34;Chef&#39;s Salted Black Truffle Parmesan Fries&#34;...we paid over $20 for our order, which the hubbs thought was a bit excessive, since what was to follow left him disappointed and tummy hurt.
We sat down in one of the booths, and he popped in to use the restroom to wash up for dindins.  When he came out, his hands were dripping wet, and he was upset because there were no paper towels stocked, and the dining room was dirty.  I told him to give it a chance and be in good spirits &amp; optimistic when we got our food. 
We thought when we dined-in, Jessica or someone would bring us our order, but hubbs went up to grab it &amp; our ketchup.
As we dived into our mouth-watering-looking burgers, I was happily impressed with Chef Ed&#39;s newest burger creation, while my husband&#39;s bun was folding in half, trying to break &amp; escape his burger, and chomping on very chewy &#34;grilled&#34; onions, increasingly gaining sadness on his Frato&#39;s experience, whereas my tasebuds were having a happy-mouth-party...
When all of a sudden another employee came over to gossip/bicker/scold/argue with Jessica while she was cleaning near the trash cans loud enough for us to hear... I don&#39;t think this was the appropriate thing to do directly in front of your customers... then it continued behind the counter near the pizza-making-station...now including more employees... We just looked at each other awkwardly feeling awkward at what was happening &amp; again deteriorating at hubbs&#39; first time experience...
Not sure if Nina sensed it, or if she just wanted to pop by, but she came to our table to check on us, and tell me she remembered me :) &amp; to let us know if we ever have any problems or anything to just let her know...then she offered us some ice cream samples! WHAA? Frato&#39;s has ice cream!? Who knew... Thanks to Nina, the kind and ever to sweet Nina, I think our experience was salvaged a bit, she is so genuine &amp; awesome, absolutely great customer service... hubbs says if he ever came back, it&#39;d be because of her.
Better luck next time? :-/"

The only positive from my experience was that the manager Nina, who seemed very sincere, offered us a sample of their ice cream, after checking in with us, which was pretty good.

I did like the interior, 1950s vibe.  The place was a little dirty when I got there, the bathroom was dirty, and there were no paper towels either.  I wasn&#39;t greeted when I walked, or walked up to the counter.  I also wasn&#39;t offered any suggestions while browsing the menu.  The lady operating the register seemed like she had a million other places that she would rather be, and this was reinforced when she was complaining about working to a co-worker while they were cleaning near our table.

The truffle fries were adequate but just not for me.

I love burgers, they are my weak spot no matter how healthy I&#39;m trying to eat.  I ordered a burger thinking it would be superb after going through the reviews.  I was left with a soggy, floppy bun, chewy fried onions, and a burger that was mediocre at best.  The burger by itself was ok in flavor and the fried mushrooms were good.  This burger flatlined.

I may have caught them on a bad night, but I&#39;m glad Nina stopped by with a free sample otherwise this would have been a total bust."

1. I love their sauces. Yes, some are too spicy for me, but I like what they&#39;re doing. 
2. Everyone who I&#39;ve brought to Frato&#39;s has been pleasantly surprised at the quality, selection and service. 
3. They added craft beer to their menu this year. This means hard cider for me, an IPA for the hubby and dinner at Frato&#39;s with smiles on our faces. 
4. It&#39;s always clean in here!
5. The staff is sooooo nice!  Everyone is courteous and helpful. They make suggestions and lead me down new roads...like the apple pie milkshake road. Uh huh baby!
6. The owners and their staff are Good Eggs. They regularly make donations to charitable organizations. And I personally am working on an ongoing project with them for Sack Lunch Sunday, so I know just how amazing and generous they are. 
7. Their customers rock too!  People have anonymously donated additional pizzas to Sack Lunch Sunday through them which means that more people experiencing homelessness are getting fed. Hugs to you, Anonymous Donors!!!
8. They have a burger of the week. It&#39;s inventive and makes me want to step outside of my food comfort zone. And that&#39;s hard to do with me!  
9. They hosted a Yelp event. That was my first time trying their chicken wings. Those were some mighty tasty wings!  Their staff made each guest feel special. I thought it was a very successful introduction of the &#34;new&#34; Frato&#39;s to the Yelpers of the community. 
10. They have online ordering. I haven&#39;t tried this yet, but I know friends who have. I just love knowing that they have options in case I&#39;m feeling crabby and don&#39;t want to talk with anyone that day. 

So there you have it. My fifth star reasoning. Like them on Facebook. Eat the food. Feel happy. You&#39;re welcome. ;-)"

no one in the suburbs makes thin crust like this. It&#39;s definitely my favorite. You can get a simple topping like pepperoni or one of the specialties and it&#39;s still just as delicious. 

My favorite is the Schaumburg garbage pizza.  It has everything but the crust is so thin you don&#39;t get that bloated feeling at the end. 

The aesthetics are definitely dated but don&#39;t let that stop you from trying their pizza. You won&#39;t even care that you&#39;re sitting on a ripped booth cushion once you try their pizza."

The burgers were good, great then.  I cannot testify to the pizza or fried foods, but who really makes BAD pizza.  I&#39;ve never had bad pizza, unless it came wrapped in plastic or a cardboard box.

What I did have...the burger of the week (New Orleans) is tasteless and definitely NOT like how the picture is displayed on Frato&#39;s website.  I think the gumbo used was just tomato soup/paste &amp; celery (unless I&#39;m incorrect, I thought gumbo had items like shrimp, sausage, okra, etc) that was mostly absorbed by the bun.  Grits never coated the patty.  Meat itself was unseasoned and flavorless.  Absolutely the best part of this burger was the kale (I love kale, btw, but this was really good- not soggy &amp; had a bite to it).

You might be thinking...you get what you pay for...a &#34;gourmet&#34; burger (term used very loosely) from a local place in the burbs won&#39;t be that good anyways, as compared to Kuma&#39;s Corner or District&#39;s (back in the day before closing), but Frato&#39;s charged me $10.53.  And that&#39;s without any fries, a side, or drink.  So I do kind of expect something GOOD and delicious, at the least.

Don&#39;t be fooled by the picture online.  If you want a good burger, SOOOO many other better establishments than Frato&#39;s, whether in the city or suburbs.  Especially if you are looking to spend $10 or more on just the burger."

I was excited to give them a try, after seeing them on Chicago&#39;s Best TV and seeing all the great reviews here. Wish I would have had the opportunity to come for the recent car show but had already made previous plans.

 I settled on my go-to item, paper thin crust, pepperoni. It&#39;s what I like and easy to compare to others. There is so much uniqueness going on here that I look forward to many return visits when out this way. 

Owner couldn&#39;t have been nicer, after I contacted him on facebook with a question I had. Prompt, friendly response says a lot about a business.

I was thankful for the three free boneless wings, for mentioning I saw them on CB TV. I went with the habanero/garlic and was blown away at the new experience. I tend to go plain on bone in wings, boring I know but I like to taste the chicken.

There&#39;s some definite talent here and certainly far from being like the place you&#39;re used to getting a pizza, burger or hot dog at. I was there at off peak times and just got the pizza par baked, so we could enjoy it once I got home... had one other stop to make in the area and it&#39;s about a 40 min. drive for me.

Love following them on facebook and twitter, as they&#39;re active and certainly get your taste buds a fluttering. So what are you waiting for? Get in here and enjoy some fresh made items... maybe not so fast you&#39;ll freak but all good things come to those that are patient and find the wait well worth it."

In this case I decided to go back to Frato&#39;s Pizza and try the Pizza rather than the hot dog from my previous visit.

Rather than cut and paste my entire earlier review (it should be listed below this one anyway). I&#39;ll just go over the specifics of Frato&#39;s Pizza visit #2. I came in and looked over the slices they had in the rotating pizza heater, I went with a slice of sausage and a cup for getting Green River from the soda fountain. 

The slice was a thick crust pizza. The dough was a little on the crisp side but had a good consistency. The sauce was a little runny and a little watery for my liking but a decent flavor shined through. The cheese on the pizza might be the biggest problem, having spent so much time in the rotating pizza display the cheese no longer had much of a soft consistency but was instead like hardened paste over the top of the pizza. The sausage used was nice and flavorful.

Overall this wasn&#39;t a bad slice of Pizza, and was in fact better than the hot dog and fries I had here. I&#39;ll raise the overall review score from two to three stars for Frato&#39;s Pizza. And at some point I intend to come back and try one of their unique burgers and perhaps the score will change again then."

Somehow I must actually visit Frato&#39;s because all of my visits have been their delivery drivers making house calls. And thanks for finally joining Grub Hub so I can have all my food choices in one spot.

Frato&#39;s is great and has amazing service. Their food is well worth the wait...30 minutes seems like an eternity knowing what kind of food I&#39;m getting. I would walk 5 miles without shoes to get a pizza puff."

I drove my this place my accident. My husband needed something from autozone and we were hungry. I saw the wgn sign about beer and saw the pictures of the jumbo wings and thought to myself wow this place looks amazing. Walked in and it was absolutely dead. The girl register wasn&#39;t friendly pleasant or even inviting. But I still decided to eat there. 

Well I ordered 16 wings for $12 and a large fry and one pizza puff my total was somewhere  around $22 and no drinks. 

Well I saw that if I ordered jumbo wings (which were not jumbo) I could get a large drink for a $1 so I decided I would add that. Well I was going to pay for it she decided she would give it to me for free which was nice but it was more so she could sit and talk to people at the booth. I believe her child was playing wij also. 

Wouldn&#39;t recommend this place to anyone. I&#39;ve been a resident of Schaumburg for 8 years. I&#39;ve never heard of this place. Did some prom make up and asked the girls if they&#39;ve ever ate there. They had nothing but bad things to say. 

My recommendations are to give great customer service and take pride in what you cook and sell. 

The wings were so bland and the pizza puff was just a mass deep fried. My favorite was the French fries to say the least. 

This post was intended for change for the future. The place has potential but needs a overhaul."

I get in there, the place smells like it needs a cleaning, a bad burnt smell hit me in the face, I shrugged it off, its a fast food place. 

I went to order a Hot Dog combo and ordered my dog like I do everywhere, Mustard, Onion, Relish, I then get insulted for not wanting ketchup on my dog, the I was shocked, Lady you&#39;re in the Chicagoland area, most of us don&#39;t like ketchup. Then I get my hot dog and it actually has ketchup and the lady who took my order proceeds to laugh at me like she enjoyed it or actually messed my order on purposed.

I stumbled upon this joint while searching for cheap lunches in Schaumburg. Price wise, it was pretty cheap but the food wasn&#39;t all that wonderful. I got the slice of pepperoni and the little sausage empanadas. The pizza was dry and coin. Temperature wise, it wasn&#39;t even warm. Felt like something I could get from a freezer but the size was like a Sbarro slice. The sausage empanada was very meh. It was on the cold size as I bit into it. On the menu, they state that this puffs are never frozen so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s somewhere in between being as cold was. Another 30 seconds in the fryer wouldn&#39;t have hurt. 

The decor is very odd and confusing. Initially, it&#39;s like a diner but they have these old flat screen TVs. Plus there&#39;s craft beer sold here. The weirdest thing was that they had one of those Xbox Kinects. There were a lot of original packaged items as well, making the &#34;homemade&#34; feel less authentic.

Chicago. Style. Italian. Beef. Pizza.

I&#39;ve had a similar pizza from other places before, but it was always underwhelming.

The crust was awesome. Crispy, and light, and filled with goodness. The giardinera was still crisp and moist, not dried out husks like i&#39;ve had from other places. Cheese was gooey and melted in your mouth. One of the best pizzas i&#39;ve ever had, and I am a picky bastard. 

For you hotheads, the inferno mustard sauce is fantastic and the very definition of creeper heat. It sneaks up on you, punches you in the face, and then runs out back and slaps your mama, because that&#39;s just how it rolls. I dipped my pizza in a little bit, but my husband was much more adventurous with it. I wanted to be able to taste everything else we were trying, but when we go back i&#39;m going to get it again. 

There were some things I wasn&#39;t a fan of, but my husband thought they were awesome, so I just chalked it up to pregnancy tastebuds being weird. I&#39;ll try them again when i&#39;m no longer cooking our second little monster.

Which brings me to &#39; how soon, is too soon?&#39;
We were just there last night, and I already want to go back today. And tomorrow.
If i bring enough disguises, do you think it&#39;ll work? it&#39;ll work, right?

So glad we checked this place out. You know a place is a keeper when you want specific things off their menu, and no other place will do."

I walk-in and BAM! The Orange Crush chilling in a booth of her own as if she was the pizza commissioner waiting for her entourage. Well no need to wait any longer cause this guy is about to grub it up.

While my dining diva says no to anything once living than cooked. My side of the thin crust pie had a Mediterranean Grecian-Style Chicken, tomatoes, olives, feta, mozzarella cheese and onions; her side had Mozzarella, Cheddar &amp; Pepper Jack Cheese Blend with Jalapenos. Everyone was happy and Candice influenced me to order the 6PC Jumbo Wings tossed in Habanero Garlic and a side of fresh cut fries. She is dangerous I tell ya.

I had tons of left overs and the apple cinnamon spicy sauce kicked my @ss. Lucky for me I was downing a cold Lagunitas IPA.

On the real, this is some serious eats with serious flavor. So bring your foodie game and give these guys a try.

Same name, new owners, new business. Get off your couch and step in."

So I&#39;ve been a fan of Frato&#39;s for awhile now. You can probably tell that from the fact that my checkins now number in the double digits...and that&#39;s not counting times I&#39;ve been there and my phone has freaked out, so I couldn&#39;t check in. 

Today, though, was my second delivery experience. 

The Burger of the Week is a special veggie burger made with mushrooms and barley, served with red onion, tomato, lettuce, mayo, and brown mustard on a delightful pretzel bun. They grill the bun, too, so it&#39;s nice and toasty and warm and slightly crispy and good. 

OMG. SERIOUSLY. 

I&#39;m not a vegetarian, although I do love my veggies. My SO feels the same way. We really wanted to try this Burger of the Week before it went away (Sunday is the last day for it; new BotW starts Monday every week), but we were also a bit busy, so we took advantage of their FREE delivery. 

This is seriously the best veggie burger I&#39;ve ever had. I would gladly order it very often if it was on the menu full-time. Vegetarians: if this burger shows up again, you owe it to yourselves to try it. Too often, vegetarian stuff is just boring or an afterthought, or as Natalie Portman once put it, &#34;a collection of sides.&#34; This isn&#39;t any of that. It&#39;s flavorful, well seasoned, filling, and perfectly balanced. 

(It can be a bit messy, though, so be careful. My SO ate his neatly, but I ended up with a huge mess on my hands while eating mine. I will say that it&#39;s worth it, however!)"

The burger didn&#39;t have much going for it.

The pizza slice was like a big piece of bread, with a little sauce and a little cheese.  Not much flavor, but filling."

The 50 &#39;s theme was kind of nice. There is a small TV in the corner with sportscenter on. They have a nice big screen hooked up to an Xbox. 

I ordered a peperoni pizza. It was great. There was some confusion on my order, whether they served individual slices. I ordered a whole pizza but really only wanted a slice. When the owner became aware of this he came over to my table and gave me a slice of a Macaroni and cheese pizza with a side of habanero dipping sauce. 

I&#39;m from out of town. I&#39;ve been in Chicago three days and have eaten pizza three times. In other words, I like pizza.  Simply put, this is the best slice of pizza I&#39;ve ever had."

I called to make sure and they were able to deliver. If you&#39;re close to the delivery area that shows online, you may want to call. Yesterday was my first time trying this pizza. I placed the order over the phone. The person that took my order was very friendly, and professional. I payed over the phone and waited for my pizza to arrive. The pizza got there and it was very tasty. Upon finishing my pizza, I got a phone call from the restaurant. To my surprise, asking how everything was and wanted to make sure that we had a good pizza and an enjoyable experience. This type of service and customer care is exactly what you want but never get anywhere else. I recommend the pizza, and you&#39;re going to love the service. They also don&#39;t skimp out on toppings! I had a veggie pizza and am going to regret all those jalapeños later but was it good!

After my initial review, we received a lengthy email from the owner of Frato&#39;s apologizing and taking blame for the delivery mess-up situation.  Whoa.  

You can tell this place really cares about their customers and keeping their customers happy.  This is a nice change of pace from some of the other customer service that&#39;s around nowadays!

Frato&#39;s management MORE than made it right with our family.  They really went out of their way to make sure we knew they were really sorry.  

Furthermore (as if that wasn&#39;t enough!) last night, we ordered delivery from here again.  I ordered online, as I did before, but this time I forgot to enter in the coupon for the 5% off for ordering online.  

Halfway through our meal, a very nice woman called to check in on how everything was and to say that she credited us 5% for not entering in the coupon.  Whaaaa?  That&#39;s AMAZING!!!

Not to mention, the food is AWESOME!!  

They definitely have my vote!!!"

This time was an Italian beef with provolone at this joint located in a strip mall in Elk Grove, land of industrial parks.  The general manager of the location we were visiting visits this place so much, theya pretty much know him by name, so he gave us rave reviews on their food.  And he was definitely right, though I rarely doubt the locals when it comes to the best places to grab a bite on their home turf.

You wouldn&#39;t expect to find an upscale restaurant in an area that definitely skews blue collar, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t get amazing food.  Some of the best meals I have had are in places that could be considered dives.  It&#39;s hale and hearty and will sometimes put you into a food coma.

The sandwich was everything I hoped it would be.  Salty beef splashed with a ladle of au jus, provolone cheese that gets all melty.  Add a bag of Voodoo chips from Zapp&#39;s and it was the perfect lunch.  I barely finished it all, but I took one for the team and managed to polish it off.  Sometimes on business trips, I prefer for the location to order food in so that we can work while we eat.  However, this time a trip away (especially after a ridiculously early flight) to stretch our legs and check out the local culinary scene ended up being one of my most favorite meals on my recent travels.  Almost considered going here the next day, but had to reserve some time to visit Portillo&#39;s."

I found this place when I moved to Schaumburg which is near Elk Grove. I was shocked and finally came in. I spoke with someone at the Elk Grove store and he told me the Dekalb location, where NIU is located, had trouble during the summer when everyone went home so that is why they shut it down. I am not surprised because college towns will get hit hard during the summer. 

Im glad this location is still opened. It&#39;s theme is catered to the local light industry location surrounding it. But it&#39;s not what you expect. It&#39;s like retro industrial style shop and very clean. The ceiling fan is huge! Lol.

The food is awesome. Oven baked break and lots and lots of choices. I spent around 10.00 for my sub, chips, and drink. Not bad. Homemade lemonade, some sort of red juice which is sort of like lemonade, and homemade tea along with your normal fountain drinks. Plus bottles of drinks. Also tons of chips! They carry several brands...more choices then the sub shops I have been too. I love sub sandwich places and I frequent them normally. This is by far the best I have been too. 

FYI they close at 4 pm Mon thru Fri. Sat they close at 3. I guess they cater towards the businesses around the shop which is heavy in light industry.

1. Get there before the lunch rush.  The line is usually out the door at noon.
2. Take some time to review the menu because it&#39;s extensive and there&#39;s something for everyone.
3. The italian beef is AMAZING.  If you are hungry, get one of the sandwiches with the beef on it.  There are a couple of combination sandwiches that have traditional meats combined with the italian beef.
4. Bring your friends.  They have larger tables to accommodate larger parties but get there early!
5. The Horseradish mayo is really good.

It&#39;s a little easy to drive past the first time you try to find it (and what happened to the trees in this part of town, anyway?). But once you find the right strip mall and head inside, you&#39;re welcomed with a lot of choices, and sandwich makers with opinions if you ask for them.

I got the Rammy&#39;s Radical Italian Beef. I was advised that this should be taken with white bread (which has a clear crease) and with pesto, onions, tomato and a little bit of chipotle sauce. Because they are the experts, I took them up on this idea.

The beef was really excellent. Moist, beefy, held together well, and so much of it in the sandwich. Cheese was melty, and the pesto-chipotle sauce idea is top notch. I took it with baked chips and a peach-flavored Arnold Palmer, and that&#39;s when I decided that Rammy&#39;s is far better than any other sandwich place I&#39;ve tried in the greater Chicagoland region.

Friendly service with a smile is also emphasized, which made everything right. Rammy&#39;s might be tucked away in an inconvenient place, but it&#39;s 100% worth the drive."

They have a variety of chips to choose from too which is a good idea. Don&#39;t forget the other breads like pretzel bread or special subs they have. The special subs are often hand printed on cardboard on the counter or written on another chalkboard on the wall. Some of these are really good too. However the milkshakes are what is most awesome here. The banana milkshake is my favorite!!

Overall, it&#39;s pretty good. Sandwiches are a bit more then Subway or other similar places with prices at about $7 but then they are a bit better, and then again they are a bit smaller. I&#39;m torn! 

I&#39;ve tried the Chicken with Bacon and Mayo and the Hammer &amp; Cheese. Both were good, the chicken was super moist but both could have used a bit more mayo, could barely taste it. I guess I need to say a lot of mayo! 

The shakes are awesome! I got a chocolate shake and it was realllly good! Highly recommended. But that friggin huge straw will not go in the hole - Get your mind out of the gutter! I understand using a huge straw but then again I don&#39;t.

Also, the Tahitian Punch is amazing! Soooo good!

And Hey, Subway- hit the bricks!! Rammy&#39;s is the place to get your sub for lunch. Perhaps, that&#39;s why the line is always out the door and if you have a 1/2 hour lunch you need to call ahead. But, lemme, tell you, it&#39;s worth the wait. You can&#39;t get subs like this just anywhere. Well, maybe at Grandpa&#39;s house, because they are like homemade goodness! You will be addicted if you try it once. 

To be honest, I have never actually eaten in the restaurant so I can&#39;t really say anything about the atmosphere because I always run in and take out. Their prices are reasonable and the sandwiches actually taste different from the others, unlike some other establishments that shall remain nameless (see above- it rhymes with &#34;Cubway&#34;). 

If they had another store in Schaumburg (*wink*wink*) and were open in the evenings, we would eat from there regularly, but they are open for lunchtime only, folks. You have to try it. It&#39;s worth taking a vacation day if your office is not close! :)"

I actually haven&#39;t been here in a while and on my last trip I was happy to see they now serve pretzel buns!  All their subs are packed with meats &amp; cheeses, especially the 9-meat Megastructure.  I like the Two by Four and the Sawhorse, but you really can&#39;t go wrong with any of their subs.  

On top of the 20+ sub choices, they also have really good shakes, my favorite being the chocolate banana. The subs here won&#39;t disappoint and you&#39;ll definitely leave on a full stomach."

They have a number of tasty sandwiches.   The Sawhorse is a good combination of roast beef, cheddar cheese, and bacon along with a horseradish sauce and I top mine with onions and lettuce. Very tasty. The 2 by 4 is their version of an italian grinder which is another good choice. They make their own meatballs for the wrecking ball sandwich (meatballs, marinara, and cheese)--messy but good. I have to mention the radical Italian beef which includes a pesto and garlic spread, provolone cheese along with their Italian beef. Sure in the Chicago area there are many places where you can find an Italian Beef, but that garlic and pesto spread makes this sandwich better than most.

I&#39;ve tried 10 different sandwiches so far and I haven&#39;t been disappointed. Some sandwiches are larger than others. Some are smaller.  They also have a number of respectable sides in their cooler (coleslaw, potato salad, and a pasta salad) as well as some decent brownies to round out a meal if needed.  

They also have special sandwiches that change from time to time. Oh yes, and they toast their subs so the bread comes out with a nice crunchy outside and with melted cheese. 

You may have noticed that the place continues the construction theme found in its name to some of the menu items I&#39;ve mentioned as well as to the decor. Where you walk up to place your order, there are crescent wrenches used to support the glass divider near the food prep area, as one example.  This is definitely a lunchtime sandwich spot with a personality.  With the good food, good decor, and friendly staff I recommended it."

I just started working in the neighborhood and my boss was raving about the place.  Before heading out, I took a look on Yelp for some reviews on the place.  It seems like most of the reviews I saw were very positive.  The menu looked great and I was very optimistic.

Sadly, my first impression with Rammy&#39;s was not a good one.  I ordered the Reuben on marbled rye.  When I got my order there were, literally, three very thin slices of corned beef on my sandwich.  The food tasted fine, but there was so little meat I thought there might have been a mistake.  I showed the sandwich to the lady at the counter, and she said &#34;all the meat is weighed out, so that is a correct portion&#34;.  Many of the reviews I read were focused on the size of the sandwich and how it may even be too much.  That certainly wasn&#39;t the case for me.

Having said that, the service was very good.  They were doing a ton of business, so they&#39;re doing something right.  I may or not go back.  I don&#39;t like to write-off a place after one visit, but a first impression is a lasting impression.  There are tons of places to buy $7.00 sandwich in the area."

I&#39;m probably the only person who will complain about too much meat on my sandwich, but I couldn&#39;t fit my mouth around it! Things got a little messy. I really didn&#39;t mind too much, that&#39;s what napkins are for.

I also grabbed a cookie for desert, if you are conscientious about your calories, don&#39;t look at the nutritional facts...I&#39;ll be running a few miles to work that off later today.

 Split a couple of sandwiches. We had a Reuben and also a Sawhorse.

The sandwiches were not huge, but were big enough. However, once wrapped, they were a bit welded together with the ingredients even though they only traveled for less than 5 minutes. I am sure they would have been better if they were eaten on site.

As for the taste, they were OK. I just did not find them as spectacular as the other Yelpers who reviewed them. 

Would I go back? Maybe if I was in the neighborhood. I would not make a special trip to go there.

3 stars is my bottom line for this place which is A-OK on Yelp.

It&#39;s also convenient that you can print the order form and fax it to them and have your subs ready for pick up. It&#39;s awesome! 

The food speaks for itself at this place. Best subs hands down... better than Subway, Quizno&#39;s, Potbelly&#39;s or anywhere else! 

My favorite is &#34;Rammy&#39;s Reuben.&#34; It&#39;s loaded with Corn Beef and Saurkraut and cheese and their own home made Thousand Island dressing is delicious. Can&#39;t go wrong with this if you are a reuben fan, and great price at only $5.35! 

I&#39;ve also tried and enjoyed the Skyscraper, which is just any man&#39;s sandwhich, filled with meat (Ham, Turkey, Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Salami, Pepperoni, Cappicola), what else could you ask for?? Another great choice. 

Their subs are all moderatley priced and great value for the prices (all sandwhiches between $5-$7. I&#39;d recommend this place to anybody.

If you&#39;re company is paying (like mine often is), then I indulge on the thick milkshakes they have. So good.

Downsides: Don&#39;t go here if you&#39;re looking for something light, and I think it&#39;s only open for lunch. Order ahead because otherwise the line is out the door."

What drew me in was the fact that their sandwiches are toasted - always a plus for me.  The strip mall where it&#39;s located looks a little run down, but plenty of parking.  The decor was unique with a construction site motif.   I liked it.  

I tried the &#34;two by four&#34; sandwich.  It was 8&#34; with a decent amount of 2 cheeses of my choice and 4 different meats (hence 2x4).  Additional items available were cleverly displayed from the ceiling on the far side of the toaster.

The service was efficient and I took my lunch out.  There was no line at 11:45.  Overall, it was a good lunch.  I would have liked it to have been toasted just a bit more, but no real issue.  The balance of meat &amp; cheese was good and resulted in a very satisfying eat.

I&#39;ll go back again.  Rammy&#39;s is comparable to Quiznos, but I have to give a nod to the small business rather than the chain.  Try it and enjoy."

I took off one star because the food doesn&#39;t &#34;save well&#34;. If you thought you were lucky to have gotten full off half, think again. Might as well make the effort and finish it because in a couple hours that wonderful sub will be a soggy mess."

Really just a cross between Quizno&#39;s and Subway. Size of sandwich is fine. I think they really only gave me one slice of turkey/ham/roast beef on my tri-level. Whether this is enough for you depends on your stomach size and health inclinations. Personally it was enough for me. But you can tell that&#39;s where they get some margin. They could easily fix everyone&#39;s complaints by lowering the price of the regular sub a bit and then offering a double meat upsell for an extra $1. But what do I know. Wheat bread was good. Small selection of topping but they have the essentials. Add on a drink and chips (more margin) and you won&#39;t get out of there for under $10-$11. Which is really too expensive for a sandwich meal. It knocks it down to a once in a while treat from an easy 2 or 3 times a week thing. If you are worried about the price just carryout a sandwich and use your own chips and drink. Good stuff. Place could be a little cleaner and spiffed up a little.

Check the daily special blackboard.  I had a muffaletta the other day that was pretty outstanding.  Can&#39;t go wrong with the Skyscraper or the 2X4 either.  Offer a variety of extra sauces to add to your sub; chipotle mayo usually wins.  The variety of bread is always fresh and they now have pretzel rolls...which is pretty sweet.  They have chips, drinks and some cold sides in the cooler.  Pasta salad was pretty tasty.  House made giardiniera was hot but not overpowering...good bite.   Beef sandwich was pretty good, but the star was the garlic pesto aioli.  Will ask for xtra next time.  Think they close early, like 3pm.  And may be cash only, not sure.

I&#39;ve tried only the 2 x 4 and the Wrecking Ball.  I&#39;m a Wrecking Ball regular because it is easily the best meatball sub I&#39;ve had.  The meatballs are bigger than bite size but not too big that you can&#39;t bite them.  Plus they&#39;re delicious by themselves, but Rammy&#39;s likes to go further by layering cheese on top along with spices.  The bread is even different than places such as Subway, Jimmy John&#39;s, Quizno&#39;s, or even Potbelly&#39;s.  After it&#39;s toasted, its crusty but soft.  So mouth watering.  What I top it off with now is the Big Ass shake (oh and the extra wide straw helps with their thicker shakes).  They&#39;ve had this shake size for awhile now.  A Wrecking Ball + vanilla Big Ass shake = Heaven."

I found Sozai Banzai after doing a quick search on Yelp. It had some pretty good reviews, so we went ahead and tried it out. 

We went around 8pm on a Saturday. It definitely is tucked away but wasn&#39;t hard to find. There were a few people seated already, but there were still a good amount of tables open. As mentioned, this was our first time here. The woman taking our order was very helpful as she walked us through the menu, made recommendations, and answered any questions we had. 

I absolutely love spicy anything, so I ordered the Taiwanese ramen with a slice of pork (doesn&#39;t come with it but can add for $1), My boyfriend ordered the Garlic Ramen. We also ordered the gyoza and chicken karaage as add ons-- so glad we did! The woman also included a bottle of hot chili oil since we kept saying we like our food spicy. 

We got our food fairly quickly. Pretty large portions when comparing prices to Santouka. We loved the ramen, both were very rich in flavor and came with a good amount of noodles as well as toppings. I recommend both! The gyoza was very good. It had a light crunch and came with a light sauce. Like everyone else raved about in their reviews, the chicken karaage was delicous! Crunchy, yet juicy. Both sides complimented with the ramen. 

I&#39;m definitely a fan, and will be back soon!"

Per recommendation of a friend, we went on a Sunday night a little after 6pm for dinner. Not gonna lie, Sozai Banzai is in this dimly lit little strip mall that looks like the perfect crime scene. No cameras? Check. Minimal witnesses? Check check.

We walked in and immediately you notice the size of the place. It&#39;s a relatively small restaurant, but it has a very home-y vibe. I ordered the Negi Chashu Miso Ramen. The description said &#34;two types of scallions.&#34; Wait, what? There&#39;s more than one type of scallion? We ordered and sat down at our table, hungry.

They brought the three ramens out, and first thing to try was the broth. Not too salty and very flavorful. As we chowed down, there were a couple notable things. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the chashu was soft and delicious. The broth was flavorful without being overpoweringly salty (hard to achieve).

This place is extremely unassuming, but well worth it with a great price and great food. A little sketchy, but felt safe with the delicious food inside. I&#39;ll be back!"

I thought it was a solid showing of ramen and it&#39;s nice that you can combo with gyoza or chicken karaage and it is still cheaper than most ramen places. Ramen is also a bit smaller than what we see in Chicago but is actually the perfect amount to fill you up and they have so many side dish options that I want to come back and try. If you like ramen and you are in the area (ikea or wood field shopping or Ramen Misoya has a 2 hour wait then come here to enjoy some ramen and even a few alcoholic beverages.

We were headed to the suburbs to do some shopping and my wife said she was hungry and to just drive and she would tell me where we were eating when we get there. Exciting right?!?! Inquiring minds want to know. We arrived to this random strip mall to this very unassuming Japanese restaurant. When we got inside, the place had a few diners but not busy and we proceeded to the counter to look over the menu, order and pay first. We settled on the miso chashu ramen and made it a combo with rice and small chicken karaage (about 7 pieces) and a spicy tang tang ramen. There were so many choices for sides and ramen I wanted to try them all but I would just be ramen them all in my mouth. :p 

We got some water ourselves in little cups and sat down waiting for the food. The food came out at a reasonable normal timing for ramen and we proceeded to begin with the broth. The tang tang was moderately spicy with some slight kick but nothing insane. The miso flavor was very present but not as rich as I usually like it but still very delicious. The ramen itself was smaller than most ramen places but it seemed like the perfect amount and is a bit cheaper than other ramen spots. 

The chicken karaage was really really good! Almost stealing the show because it was so juicy and crispy. I would definitely go back for more."

We then turned around, parked our vehicle in the strip-mall lot, and then headed inside...with a suspicious mind and an empty stomach.

Obviously, &#34;Sozai Banzai&#34; is the official name for this place.  This little eatery serves home-style Japanese dishes, ranging from ramen to many well-known side dishes that one can see on a typical Japanese family&#39;s dinner table.  I saw many Japanese hanging out there, so it proved that there was a certain degree of authenticity involved.  

Everyone works there seems to be a &#34;jack of all trades.&#34;  The young man who took our order was primarily in charge of the dining room and the front-line responsibilities.  All orders are taken at the register.  All directions are clearly written in both English and Japanese.  

After we put our orders in: butter corn miso ramen and spicy stamina ramen, we helped ourselves with water.  By the way, there&#39;s a minimum $10 requirement for using a debit or credit card.  One (1) bowl of ramen with a choice of side dish, or a bottle of Premium Black Asahi will do.  Yes, they do serve wine and beer.  Getting a business liquor license is much more affordable in the suburbs.  

My spicy stamina ramen was delicious!  It could have been a great belly-warmer, except the temperature still remains high 70s in late September here in the Midwest.  Hence, it was sweating the entire time slurping my bowl.  That really wasn&#39;t a complaint though!  

Hubby enjoyed this sweet corn miso ramen as well.  He finished it in a lightening speed, so you knew that he liked it.  

The other table with three (3) Japanese gentlemen seemed to have a blast with their choices of entrees, because they weren&#39;t commenting negatively about the food, but the family of four (4) behind them in Japanese.  Hey, that&#39;s the power of knowing a second language.  I often do that, too, so I&#39;m no saint, people!  

With Miki Imai&#39;s soothing, womanly voice playing in the background, the ramen was steadily transported to our stomachs.  I have to say &#34;Sozai Banzai&#34; is truly a hidden gem in Arlington Heights, yet Yelp helps unearth it."

Ramen is such a great comfort food and a great way to warm up. Their menu is simple and their ramen is to die for.

Plus that day, it was raining cats and dogs out. But I definitely would come back to try the rest of the ramen on their menu lol

Chashu Ramen: got this because they didn&#39;t have the miso chashu that day. The broth is great. I have a fear of ramen broth being too salty from prior bad experiences (misoya and Tokyo pub). The broth is rich and not as oily as the one from Daruma. There&#39;s 3 pieces of pork!! (Yasssssss!) The cut is a decent size, not too thin but not heavy thick either. Ramen has a nice bite to it, nice texture to the ramen. Overall 4/5

Spicy stamina Ramen: I thought it would be spicer by the color of it, but it wasn&#39;t THAT spicy. It has a nice kick if you&#39;re a mild spicy eater. The broth is a little on the oily side. The mince pork makes it seem like there&#39;s nothing in there because it&#39;s all at the bottom. Overall this one is like a 2.5/5

Karaage don: first bite was a little salty, but once you mix the rice and egg around it alleviated the saltiness a little. The chicken is salty though if you eat it alone. Overall, this dish is too mushy for me. Everything just blended in all weird. 

Croquette: nice crunch on the outside. Personally, I&#39;d rather have a smaller piece and have more crunch and less potato per bite. They should make mini size croquette!"

I ordered the Butter Corn Ramen and added 3 pieces of chashu for an additional $1.50 (so worth it!) and a White Peach JPop sparkling cocktail.  The bottled drink tasted like a wine cooler.  Next time I&#39;ll order an Asahi beer.  The ramen had thinner, curly noodles, a thin slap of butter, lots of corn, two pieces of seaweed, a few bamboo shoots, and lots of thinly sliced green onion.  The brother wasn&#39;t incredibly complex or savory, but it wasn&#39;t bad.  It&#39;s definitely better than eating the packets of instant ramen at home (...even Shin Ramen Black!)  For around $11 (this is including the chashu I added) it was a perfect fix for my ramen craving.  Plus, I didn&#39;t have to wait an hour like at some of the trendier ramen places.  I&#39;ll definitely be returning again!

Bottom line:  t&#39;s a great place to come in for a quick ramen fix, but it&#39;s not the highest quality ramen."

Sozai Banzai was the next stop on my ramen tour. It&#39;s a small place in the middle of a quiet strip mall, and they don&#39;t even have their name out front...instead it just says Sushi and Grill on the outside. It has more of a casual food court style atmosphere where you order at the counter and just find a seat yourself, which makes it super convenient for a quick meal since you don&#39;t have to deal with servers. 

Even though I&#39;ve been eating a ridiculous amount of ramen lately, I&#39;m still not tired of it because each place has something slightly different about their bowl of ramen. At Sozai Banzai, there were a couple different kinds of ramen, but as I was scanning the menu my eyes came across the magic word: garlic. Bingo, no need to look any further. For me, garlic is a game changer. It just makes everything better. 

The Garlic Ramen here was just great. While I&#39;ve had some garlic flavored ramens at other places, none were as garlicky as here. I wouldn&#39;t consider the broth to be very thick in terms of texture, but it was a nice dark broth that had a very deep and intense garlic taste. I can&#39;t really describe it in any other way without saying garlic over and over again. Let&#39;s just say if you&#39;re a garlic lover, you won&#39;t be disappointed. The noodles were just average and honestly tasted like generic instant ramen noodles, but I didn&#39;t really care since the broth is usually my main focus. The pork was actually really good too. It was fatty and tender, but the problem was the bowl only came with one piece. I&#39;m definitely gonna order extra meat the next time around. The egg was more fully boiled than I&#39;d like, but whatever, still better than no egg at all. The total cost was under $10, so it was a nice change from the $15 bowls in the city.

Overall, just a solid bowl of ramen. Sozai Banzai may not be too fancy but it gets the job done. It&#39;s tasty, fast, and the price is right. I&#39;ll definitely come back whenever I need a quick ramen fix."

Their dessert menu is lackluster though, so i&#39;d just stay away. Tried the cream animatsu and it&#39;s a 3/10.

They have a television and music playing in the background.  They offer drinks out of an open freezer and even alcoholic beverages.  

I had the spicy ramen and the gyoza and both were on point.  The ramen serving size was large but good for me and the four pieces of gyoza were excellent.

Nevertheless, once you step inside, it&#39;s a homey, clean, and inviting feeling.

First off, I hate to say this, but the ramen at Sozai Banzai is not that good, probably not even average. The noodles, broth, and meat really just miss the mark, and the portions are small. HOWEVER, EVERYTHING ELSE, literally, EVERYTHING ELSE served at Sozai Banzai is legit and delicious. Udon, donburi, appetizers, hamburg steak, katsu... you name it.

My favorite dishes have to be the curry and the ramen. I know it&#39;s super easy to make curry at home but there&#39;s something different about the way it&#39;s prepared here. It tastes SO MUCH better!! And you can order it with thinly sliced beef or a porkchop! Win! Both ramen dishes I&#39;ve tried have been delicious as well (way better than Santouka at Mitsuwa). 

Many people may come here for the bento boxes (which you need to pre-order) but I definitely prefer the other dishes instead. I wasn&#39;t impressed with the large bento box I ordered. For $25, I was definitely expecting a lot more food. Stick with the curry rice and/or ramen, and you can thank me later."

- Chicken karaage: Nicely fried with tender chicken inside
- Tonkatsu: A little fatter than most (which I like) and very crispy with a nice sauce
- Buta shogayaki: Very nice strong flavor of ginger with the pork, delicious!

Had the hardest time ordering since so many things looked good (curry! ramen! small plates!). Ended up trying the Taiwanese Tonkatsu Ramen (which has a place on their helpful Top 5 Ramen list despite not appearing on the menu) and the chicken karaage. Ramen was great with flavorful broth and very good (but not quite amazing) noodles and toppings. Karaage was very good, but still falls a little short of Misoya&#39;s (curry powder!) and Ramen Takeya. For ramen, Misoya is better overall (can&#39;t beat their grilled pork) and Santouka is probably as good, but you can avoid the insane crowds at those two places on the weekend. Also, they have a huge variety, I can&#39;t wait to go back to try the chashu, dan dan, dipping noodle ramen, and all the small plates. 

Friendly staff, simple, but very clean environment, and no lines, what&#39;s not to like? Only thing giving this 4 vs 5 stars is that Misoya ramen is better."

I feel like it&#39;d be at least 11 times more popular with a catchy name like that... but I realize it&#39;s not my place to name so I&#39;ll let it go and just hope they&#39;ll reconsider if the opportunity for a name change presents itself in the future. 

I&#39;ve never been to Japan so I really can&#39;t speak to it&#39;s authenticity, but I can say that I was the only non-Japanese-speaking person in the place and while many of the menu items made me confused as hell, the woman working behind the counter helped my unilingual ass out tremendously. 

I had a sinking feeling that most everything on the menu probably contained beef and/or pork in some way, though I guess that&#39;s all mere speculation since I couldn&#39;t read most of what was on the menu and the place was pretty busy with only only 1 person working both the counter and table service so I stuck to the small sushi menu in order to avoid bogging down service with my many questions... I would like to note that kimchi katsu don on the little 8 1/2x11&#34; wall print outs was mega tempting though. 

It seemed like everyone else there came for the large soup bowls, which looked nothing short of fantastical.  

My sushi order consisted of the first thing on the menu, the Tuna Lover combo. It&#39;s a spicy tuna roll, 6 tuna nigiri, and miso soup for $12.99. 

You order at the counter and when your stuff is ready the counter staff brings it out on a super cute tray with all the fixins you&#39;ll need. The miso was aight, the spicy tuna wasn&#39;t spicy and all in all was pretty middle of the road, but the tuna nigiri.... MY WORD!. So good. I&#39;ve never had nigiri this good before. In fact, before Sozai Bonzai I&#39;d never actually had nigiri that I thought was of any quality. This changed my mind. Bright, beautiful, thick cuts of tuna served atop perfectly packed sushi rice. If I&#39;d order this amount/quality of tuna as sashimi anywhere else, I know I&#39;d have paid upwards of $20 for just those cuts of fish alone, so this was for a deal. 

Service was super attentive, music was tres Sailor Moon, and overall I really loved the place. I&#39;ll be back in a heartbeat."

Each time, we would make a promise of never to return. Typically we end up here because we&#39;ve run out of places to eat. It&#39;s not that the food is bad, but really, it does seem that this restaurant is in the business of heating up store bought groceries. For example, the chicken karaage, yakisoba, and ramen are all bought from the asian grocery store. This place then fries, boils, or grills the food to make it seem like they made them from scratch. They have no recipe or any particular thing that they are good at. They just heat up packaged foods for their customers to eat. I feel confident in saying that no Japanese person would say that this is good food. In fact, anyone that reviews the restaurant&#39;s food positively, would be a person that knows very little about Japanese food. Reviewing that this place has good japanese food is like saying that Arby&#39;s is great roast beef, that Taco Bell is excellent Mexican, and IKEA is fine furniture. We went there last night and the owner came out and started to talk to some male customers. For next 20 minutes, it was a constant stream of some of the most obnoxious laughing that has ever come out of a woman&#39;s mouth.  We could barely hear ourselves talk as this woman&#39;s laughter gave me a migrane and later, a nightmare. Eventually, I told my girlfriend to just ignore the hair that was in her miso soup and we decided to leave this place as quickly as possible.

We got the chashu ramen, katsu curry, gyoza and karaage.  Chashu ramen was very good, not as good as Santouka, but still good in its own right.  Katsu Curry was good, tonkatsu was nice and crispy and the curry was sweet with a nice kick at the end.  Gyoza was decent, but the karaage was very good.

Not only was the portion smaller, but because we did not enjoy the ramen, this was the first time both of us were unable to finish all of the noodles in the bowl.  

The broth is not even comparable to what we have experienced at these other ramen places in Chicago.  The noodles are hard and just did not have that bite to it that a good bowl of ramen noodles should have.  I gave this place an extra star for not being too pricey and did not take a long time for our food to get to our table.  But I guess this is a pretty good example of you get what you pay for.

Oddly, I had a bento the first time I went here, rather than any donburimono (bowls of things). Still quite happy with it! The point of this place is, after all the sozai (small side dishes). I was fascinated that you can get a bento with whatever main item(s) you specify, and it comes with rice and a bunch of random sozai. How many sozai you get depends on what size bento you order. And croquettes! I do love Japanese-style croquettes. Mmm. :9 I had a regular bento with mains of chicken karaage (mmmmmmmmmm) and sake shioyaki (salt-grilled salmon). 

They have a water cooler up front with cups next to it, so you can serve yourself some ice water. They also sell a number of both American and Japanese soft drinks in a case up front. You can purchase tea bags for hot tea at $.50 each, and a carafe of hot water sits near the ice water so you can make yourself a cup of tea. 

It&#39;s a quiet little place, and you go to the register to place your order. When it&#39;s ready, the person behind the counter brings it out to you on a little tray. It&#39;s a small place, but very neat. The ramen and bowls some other people had looked fantastic. Can&#39;t wait to try it next time. 

Ambiance was relaxed. Lots of different music played at a comfortable level...some L&#39;Arc en Ciel, and some piano inventions on the Totoro theme were just a couple of the things that played. Good place; I&#39;ll be back and will bring my SO and friends. :)"

Its literally hidden from the street in a tiny strip mall. The sign on the side of the mall doesn&#39;t have the place&#39;s name on it and even the restaurant itself doesn&#39;t have the name Sozai Banzai. The restaurant sign actually says &#34;Sushi and Grill&#34; which is very generic. 

The best way to describe it is a casual hole-in the wall type eatery with real everyday casual Japanese home cooking. Don&#39;t expect a sushi master with a 2000 dollar knife hand cutting and carving fresh fish for your sushi here. Japanese cuisine is more than just raw fish and teriyaki. 

The menu is pretty extensive and hardly &#34;Americanized&#34; 

I ordered the Garlic Ramen (8.95): Very very good, I can&#39;t really compare it to Santouka because its different and good in its own way. I guess it depends on how you prefer your ramen. I&#39;ll note a few differences: (See picture)

The soup: A dark rich broth thicker and more earthy than Santouka&#39;s. 

The noodle: slightly more chew than Santouka. I find this to be very pleasant. 

The pork: really good but not as fatty as I like it. 

The toppings: bamboo shoots, green onion, and half a perfectly soft boiled egg. 

I also think the portions are bigger here for the price you pay. 

I highly recommend you check this place out (if you can find it). It offers a real taste of everyday Japanese home cooking."

I am half-Japanese, mom from Kyushu, Japan, etc etc. Been on a ramen adventure lately. There aren&#39;t that many places for ramen in the NW burbs, and even fewer places that are decent.

Had the negi chashu miso ramen and a side of gyoza - classic, right? So my rating is strictly for the ramen, however the rest of the menu looked good. Japanese comfort home cooking type food. I&#39;ll be back to try some of the other things for sure and give another score. 

As for the ramen, first impression was a small portion. In an udon bowl maybe?
For lunch though, it was the perfect size. Served simply with a piece of nori, bamboo, soft boiled egg and chashu (and negi). The noodles were ok to me, average. Broth was decent, and although I&#39;m a huge fan of Tonkotsu with miso my least favorite of ramens, the miso broth was enjoyable during eating and after. It left a pleasant aftertaste. And very important for me, it wasn&#39;t laden with sodium. The egg was slightly chilled in the center, so it was obviously premade, and just not given enough time to warm up in the broth. Chashu was actually chashu and not a glop of pork fat. It was tender and complimented the ramen nicely. 

(They did offer a tonkotsu ramen here as well, but seeing all the shoyu and miso ramen on the menu, I decided to go that route. Tonkotsu is a bit different to prepare and prepare well.)  

The gyoza was decent, and better than some I&#39;ve recently had. Though there was a flavor in the meat that I couldn&#39;t recognize. Almost like a hint of the tan tan men flavor, but it was subtle enough that it was fine once dipped. A bit odd, but not bad, and not bad enough for me to dislike it. 

Ramen was about $9, and gyoza about $3. So, you essentially get a ramen gyoza set for about $12. It is bordering on being a bit pricey for ramen, but about average for the area. Though, I would be more willing to give Sozai my money than some of the other places around. It hit the spot without any adverse side effects.  

If you were a ramen nazi, would you like it? No. 
Would it be a sole ramen destnation? No. 
Would I eat ramen again if I were to go with the family or friends? Maybe. Though I do want to try the Tan Tan Men.
Do I want to try other menu items? Definitely.

Why did I give it 3 stars? Maybe I rounded up slightly, but it was because of the overall experience, I found it decent for what it was - very casual Japanese food. The AC was working and inside was comfortable. I didn&#39;t leave feeling very thirsty with a greasy film in my mouth. Service was friendly.

My ramen search continues..."

My boyfriend has had the katsudon and the curry which he thought were good.  The chicken karaage was dark meat and not exactly what we prefer but it was good.  I like that the owners are so nice and welcoming, the place is clean, and there are always a good number of people eating in here.  They even prepare food to go very nicely (Ramen noodles are separate from the broth so they don&#39;t overcook).  We will be coming back for sure.  

Note this place is in a mostly empty strip mall except for Chinese Munch-Inn which isn&#39;t very good.  I wish they would change the sign from Sushi &amp; Grill to Sozai Banzai because Sushi &amp; Grill is way to general - I would have come here way sooner (I have lived in the area for 5 years)."

It is a small cheerful place. Christopher had tonkatsu and I had the garlic ramen noodle soup. Both were okay, though I must admit that garlic was seriously the only flavor in the ramen. I found it to be kind of bland, except for the over powering flavor of garlic. I don&#39;t think I would  order that again.

Christopher enjoyed his tonkatsu. It was flavorful and the portion was nice.

If I am in the area, I&#39;d stop in to try other items, but I would not make it a destination from Chicago."

sozai-banzai-arlington-heights,Mark C.,-6SiOP8dcgkS4eqe0OOMLw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,8,211,vGrvK2oNxDXUTWUHgsCXRw,4.0,2014-01-23,"Sozai Bonzai  has a typical strip mall setting and is hard to find, since the overhand just says &#34;Sushi &amp; Grill&#34; (look closer for the actual sign in the window).   Not much more impressive when you walk inside...but I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re going for.  Service was friendly and food came out reasonably quick.

However, the first plus sign is that the menu is also in Japanese, a pretty good sign the place is legit authentic.   The setup&#39;s pretty simple - a handful of tables, a beverage cooler next to the register, and some pretty low quality laminated menus.

Menu is all good Japanese comfort food - bentos, ramen, rice bowls, and some good apps.   Just what we needed on another snowy day (is this winter freeze *ever* going to end?  Man, I&#39;ll tell you, though, when it&#39;s flurrying out and 10 degrees, nothing hits the spot like a bowl of good ramen (well, maybe a glass of single malt, but hey, it was 1 in the afternoon)

Started off with a bite of chicken karaage - the Japanese version of Chicken nuggets.   These are not your typical McNuggets - karaage are small fried bites of chicken thigh marinated in soy sauce and garlic with a nice smooth crisp.  This version was solid - great flavor, well fried - squeeze a bit of lemon on it for some nice balance - perfect size for a starter, or you can get the Karaage set - essentially the same dish surrounding by a good supporting cast of vegetables to round out the fried chicken - A tamago like omelet, a simple salad, and a few small plates of different types of seawood.  Not a bad addition for an extra couple of bucks.

Next, I ordered the Negi Chashu ramen - negi refers to the thinly sliced Japanese onion/leeks on top, the Chashu refers to the deeply flavorful pork base for the soup.  Served with a couple slices of pork (belly?  cheek?  not sure), a partially boiled egg, some bamboo shoots, and a single piece of nori as a backdrop, this dish was solid from start to finish.  First off, the portion size was perfect.   The negi and bamboo added a good balance of textures, and the boiled egg complimented it well, although it probably could have used another minute or so cooking.  The broth itself had great flavor without being overwhelmingly rich. The pork was sliced perfectly, very tender, but had just a bit too much fat on it.  All that aside, though, everything worked very well with this bowl of noodles, and was quite slurpworthy.

Sozai Banzai was awesome and worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area.  We&#39;ll almost definitely be back in the future.   It doesn&#39;t quite get my &#34;worth a trip out to the burbs by itself&#34; recommendation, but in reality there&#39;s only one restaurant that I can immediately think of that definitely gets that nod....

You go up to the front, order what you want, and (in our case, when there is only one other party in the room), the food is served at your table.

Finding the place is a little difficult.  It&#39;s in a strip mall where the main sign doesn&#39;t give any clue of it, and the neon sign above it merely says sushi and grill.  The clue is the large white sign draped across the front window.

The portion sizes are quite small, but the price is commensurately small.  The price:quality ratio is incredible, and makes this place worthwhile.

They have several kinds of ramen and noodles:  tan tan men (noodles in a  peanut-ey broth topped with spicy ground pork and chili oil) and chashu men (house-made broth ramen topped with Japanese style roasted pork).  The tantanmen was rich and complex, while the chashumen was deeply bone-ey with a nice homey flavor. 

Some other things we got:
-tonkatsu, pork cutlet (solid, well prepared - moist on the inside, crispy on the outside, and not too oily)
-kara age, fried chicken pieces (moist and flavorful, crisp, perhaps a bit fatty.  2nd best I&#39;ve had in Chicago, out of 7 or so places)
-niku-jaga, beef with potatoes (tender, but not overcooked)

The thing that really did it for me though, was the buta kaku ni.  Chunks of pork belly braised in a sweetened soy-based sauce.  The fat is melting and rich, and the meat was tender and completely immersed with the flavor of the sauce.  The last time I had it this good was during my homestay in Japan, by my 80-year-old homestay mother in Tokyo.  Seriously.  That good.  

As mentioned, the prices and portions are fairly small, so you can have a party where each person orders 3 things, and that way try a majority of the menu.  That&#39;s how we did it.

They also have a fridge with some beer, sake, and shochu, including some grapefruit-flavored booze.  Make a party of it.

The place feels very home-y, and the staff is friendly.  

Do iiiiiiiiit"

As a rule, I only buy gift certificates for places I cross-check on Yelp, but it had been a while and I hadn&#39;t remembered what I had read that others suggested was good.

We were the only people there at 4pm on Saturday, though shortly thereafter another patron came in to wait on his carryout order.

We decided to keep it simple and both ordered sushi to share: the Tuna Lover, the Salmon Lover, and the Spicy Salmon Roll.  It took 40 minutes for our food to arrive, though the nice host/server apologized for that at the end of the meal.  I think perhaps they don&#39;t do too much sushi and that contributed to the delay.  A few families came in from Mitsuwa (clear by the garb their kiddos were in) and received their orders rather quickly by comparison.  I didn&#39;t spy any sushi on their table. :)

Miso soup came out with our sushi and was good.  Though the rice was cooked well, the sushi was mediocre at best.  The spicy tuna had an off-putting flavor in part of it that I caught in a few bites.  My +1 thought it tasted canned. 

The pieces of fish on the tuna sushi was cut fine, but the salmon was cut oddly and inconsistently.  The end of the salmon was discolored (tannish), but it ended up tasting okay, though all of the fish was warm.  The wasabi was dry and gritty. 

After dropping another $20 on top of the GC, we were both still hungry, and ended up satiating ourselves with vendor food back at Mitsuwa.

Long story short:  This is NOT a place to go for sushi.  It seems Sozai Banzai has a lot of authentic Japanese offerings, so venture out and try something else."

After moving from Seattle I was disappointed with a lot if the seafood in the Midwest. 

     I have been here with my boyfriend on several occasions and have loved everything I have ordered thus far. The beef is cooked perfectly and the ramen is killer. The prices are fair and I always feel good after eating here. The miso is not too watered down either which is always my concern. I&#39;ve only had their pudding for dessert and found it to be a light sweet treat! Everything is always fresh and tastes fresh!

The tonkatsu was nicely prepared, while both the ramen dishes were extremely tasty, though I preferred the pork broth for its very deep flavors. You can taste the fact that they cook it over three days.

The chicken karaage was the delightfully delicious: super crisp, juicy, and just enough fat to make it extra savory. Yummm. Same goes with the buta kakuni, which actually reminds me of a Taiwanese dish...

To be thorough, I ordered a couple of salmon nigiri to test their fish quality. It was pretty good, but I don&#39;t think I would come here for the sushi.

The service was solid and the food was fast, though it was rather empty when we visited. Prices are pretty inexpensive as well, and the portions are very sharable if you are into that. The owner seems really nice and I hope they do get more business.

I&#39;m giving it four stars until it gets its act together and puts up a real sign over the restaurant, and puts their name up on the mall sign. Seriously, you can&#39;t get business unless you make it obvious where you are!"

bento came with a few side dishes, chicken karaage and i chose tonkatsu for main.
everything was tasty!

curry katsu was well, curry katsu! potatos and veggies, especially perfectly blended onions!

if there was any down side to it, it is the location (hidden in forest of residence buildings in strip mall) but for around $10, i think quality of food they served was well worth the trip.

We were hungry and decided to try Yelp&#39;s nearby function, as we&#39;ve discovered wonderful, local restaurants at the &#34;last minute&#34; previously with that strategy.

And that&#39;s how we ended up at Sozai Banzai and Yelp is now 3 for 3.

We tried the kara age, croquets, salmon teriyaki, soba, udon, and 2 of the ramens.  Our impression is that the ramen is more of a northern style and incredibly rich, but we could be wrong.  Each were flavorful and satisfying.  I must agree with a previous review, that this is Japanese comfort food.  I&#39;ll add, &#34;done right.&#34;

We don&#39;t get to Arlington Heights as often as we&#39;d like, but we will be back and encourage everyone to give them a try.

The sauces that come with really compliment the lamb. The red sauce is really spicy. The portion is really big too. I can never finish it. Always have leftovers for later.

Used to absolutely love all of their food, but it&#39;s took a turn for the worst. The casheir was incredibly rude when I went in to pay. He told me to wait while he casually chatted with another customer as my food sat there on the counter. I got home and found my food was cold. The rice was incredibly greasy, it left a residue on my plate. The meat and pita was so dried out it was inedible. I had to throw all of the food i purchased away. Very disappointed, will not return..."

It comes with shwarma, shish kabob, kefta kabob, falafel, rice, salad, and pita bread. For a dollar more, you can get chicken kabob added to your Mediterranean feast. The amount of food can easily feed a small village or one person with an absurd appetite. 

In this economy where most places are giving you smaller portions, it&#39;s great to see a restaurant that doesn&#39;t hold back on the serving size. The tradeoff is that the meat can be kind of dry and overcooked. You really need both the red and white sauce to keep the meal from being too dry. Not bad if you are looking for cheap eats with a lot of bang for your buck."

The name didn&#39;t ring a bell but I immediately recognized it driving in...

To the best of my recollection, last time I ate at Pita House, it was pretty good.. so although it had been eons since I&#39;d been, my friend and I decided to stay..we were hungry campers..

All I can say is - what the hell happened to Pita House?  Seems its taken on a whole new meaning to &#34;Flavor&#34;...

We missed the lunch special arriving around 4:00 with no one here except us. Interior was just as I remembered...older...even more so now, same décor and in need of TLC...
A few tables and chairs needed to be cleaned off.  Lots of clutter along windows, shelves...trophy&#39;s, knick knacks....didn&#39;t bother me, just an observation...if your looking for an ultra casual spot, you&#39;ve hit it..
If your looking to impress someone, knock this off your list.

We went with two app&#39;s: Baba Ghannouj and 4 Falafels to share. I had the Combination Feast (Shawarma, Beef &amp; Kefta kababs) served with rice, salad and a pita.  Friend had the Combination beef and chicken kebab. 

I said no thanks to the shredded lettuce with a few tomatoes (aka Salad) and gave it to my friend.  Shredded lettuce just looked so sad....friend barely touched it.
Tabouleh would of been a much better side option...

We received two small bowls of what we were told was Tahini and a spicy sauce.
TAHINI MY FOOT!  At first my friend thought it was the dressing for her shredded lettuce...
I tasted it..and perplexed, I couldn&#39;t figure out what the hell this was. 
Friend said it looked like some milk and flour mixture..it was WHITE, THIN and liquidy..
Better served in a glass. It was as tasteless as tasteless could be and served absolutely no purpose for our food. I&#39;ve had plenty Tahini and this wasn&#39;t even close to being a knock-off.
A waste of good milk and flour if you ask me...

My plate came abundantly filled with Shawarma.  More shawarma than Kebabs.  While it was mostly tender with some dry pieces thrown in for good measure, it was really salty. The few pieces of beef kabab were nicely grilled and while some bites were tender, others were a little tough, yet I&#39;ve had worse...trust me.  Beef was just not flavorful and needed something more.
You could say the Shawarma stole the salt from the beef...
I didn&#39;t bother using any of the spicy sauce, just didn&#39;t look appetizing as it sat next to our bowl of milk.  It was way to spicy for my friend, but she&#39;s a lightweight anyway...

Kefta WAS flavorful, but DRY...and I love Kefta....

This was a MAJOR bummer as I would have used my Tahini imposter on my meat and falafel.....

I tasted her chicken which was perfectly cooked and charred...but lacked flavor.  She agreed it was bland.  Lemon does wonders!  And at most Middle Eastern joints, lemon is a key ingredient in marinating chicken.  Didn&#39;t taste any here...She said her beef was nothing to write home about..

We are huge fans of Baba Ghannouj but this Baba was just blasé..overpowered by parsley and mint, and no eggplant flavor to be found...we ate it with our hard pitas (not soft and fresh) unenthusiastically...and finally threw in the towel....the one Falafel I tasted was a falafel travesty.....Savorless....

The only plus I can give Pita House is portions are generous &amp; its cheap...Plenty of rice and meat....but when you don&#39;t enjoy the food, does that even matter? No..no it does not especially when you wind up eating only half....

The theme throughout the meal - - where&#39;s the flavor??

There are SO many good local Middle Eastern joints I&#39;ve been to, maybe not in this area, but I&#39;d sure drive out of my way to return to them....and I recommend you keep driving too..."

While waiting for my food order and wanting to wash my hands. I was waiting for at least 5 minutes for the restroom to become available. Said food preparer exited and it was apparent from the smell he had defeated but the soap and sink were dry."

For a drink, I got tamarind juice. This, by the way, was fantastic; tamarind is very sour, and I&#39;m sure they cranked up the sugar in a big way, but the drink struck just the right balance of sweet, sour, and floral.

The lamb kefta was all right. It came on a rice pilaf that was pretty average, under a giant pita. The lamb itself was tender but not with as much spice as I&#39;ve had elsewhere.

Of the two sauces provided, one was super hot but good, and the tahini was decent."

There is a no frills dining room and you can carry out.  During lunch time you can get a pretty sweet deal.  $5.95 or $6.95 for the lunch platters.  They have meat, rice, some salad, a falafel, and bread.

I always get either the mango or tamarind juice they have in the fountain.  That stuff is great.  I could probably suck down the whole fountain, if they let me.

I have never been to this location for dinner...but if it is like the Lombard one it is probably good.

If you come during lunch time, be prepared to wait a while for your food.  They cook it fresh when you order!"

What a complete &amp; utter disappointment this place was.  I was looking for some good Mediterranean food so I pulled out my trusty Yelp App &amp; found this place.  I pulled up the menu that they had on Yelp &amp; the selection &amp; prices seemed good, but I sure was mistaken.  I ordered two Super Combinations &amp; a combination plate for pick up.  I was not given a total on the phone I was just told that it would be ready in fifteen minutes.  

When I arrived to this restaurant in a plaza that was terribly plowed from the recent snow storm I pulled up to the door &amp; my father ran in to get the food.  He came back &amp; told me the total seemed higher than it should have been.  I walked in &amp; showed the worker the prices they had on Yelp.  He proceeded to tell me that this was not his website &amp; would not honor the prices.  He was very hostile &amp; rude towards us.  When I told him I would be leaving him a bad review he told me he would give me the $2 out of his pocket because I must need it.  The difference in price was more than $2 &amp; based on the cheap decor &amp; that they lease the building &amp; do not own it I gladly told the manager to keep the two dollars.  

I would never come back here."

I had the appetizer sampler platter with four pieces of falafel.  The falafel pieces were the perfect size and non greasy.  Quite a bit of food for a little over seven dollars.  Great food, and reasonable prices.  I wouldn&#39;t rate it as my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in the 
Chicagoland area, but I would come again.  They have a pretty big menu, so there are more items I would like to try."

The chicken is very tender, i prefer it to the other meats because it&#39;s not as salty. The hummus and pita are very good, so is the baba ganoush. Everything is very reasonably priced. 
I bring my young kids here and the staff is always so nice, helping me find a table with appropriate seating, talking and joking with the boys while we wait for our food, giving us extra cups of mango juice &#34;because they are sweet boys&#34;."

With each bite of sauce, I feel a couple sweat beads breaking out of my forehead. At the end of the shawarma plate a small face towel to wipe away any excess perspiration; but then you want even more of that hot sauce. You can taste the fresh ingredients and freshly diced peppers and spices, it&#39;s like no other hot sauce I&#39;ve ever eaten. If they sold the pita house hot sauce brand in stores I would buy it regularly without a doubt."

i normally order the falafel or the chicken shwarma sandwich. you can&#39;t go wrong with either of those and they have been consistently good.

We had a large party come in on a Friday night and were able to find seating together which was really unexpected. The food did not take long to be made and looked fresh. Falafels, ganoush, and chicken shawarma were the dishes we ordered. I particularly liked the Mama Ganoush made from Zucchini as opposed to Baba Ganoush made from eggplant. Both were delicious, but Mama had a new flavor that I enjoyed. We also ordered the dessert that starts with a K. It had some orange colored topping over a cheese-like base. I am not a big cheese fan, so I was not the biggest fan of the dish; however, my cousin loved it. The portions for all dishes were generous and we had plenty of leftovers. I want to add how kind the busboy was. He was all smiles and shared some nice words with us on the way out. This place is great for satisfying that Mediterranean craving!"

Turns out the reviews were spot on and this restaurant turns out fantastic food. I was especially impressed with the value: two of us split a super combination and a vegetable combination and still had plenty of leftovers. Pitas were extremely fresh and the sauces are delicious. 

In addition to the food, the staff is exceptionally friendly and were very honest about the amount of food that comes in the combination and dissuaded us from over ordering... Which is a rarity for most restaurants that would gladly just sell another item. Definitely check this restaurant out if in the area."

- A small plastic lid was in my Mama Ghannouj
- Sauces left out of the order bag
- Hummus tasted EXTREMELY metallic (IDK what was wrong with it but it was horrible)

IT USED TO BE AMAZING (as my review was written over a year ago), but now, I take back all the wonderful things I said. My family has been eating here since we have lived in Schaumburg for over 13-15 years.

Recently, we ordered take out. Got a dozen (TWELVE) falafels, extra pitas, rice, and their baklava. Usually, people have common sense and would give the RIGHT amount of sauces (tahini and the red spicy sauce). I even had to request an extra sauce because the guy only put one sauce. Really? You expect me and my family with A DOZEN FALAFELS to only eat with 2 sauces of each??? I think I paid enough money to get a few extra sauces. And the food was dry, cold, and not tasty at all. 

I WILL NOT be returning here ever again. Even though its right down the street, I rather drive to PITA INN, all the way in Skokie/Niles. PITA INN is wonderful and amazing!"

They have a system in place that gets orders out relatively quick. You can see kabobs and shawarmas being grilled in the back while you order. I ordered a combination during dinner time. The rice was a pilaf and it was not bad. The hummos I got was the real MVP, but I truly came for the meat and well it was pretty dry apart from the Shawarma.

After a day or running errands, working in the garage and yard and generally just being too tired to don real pants, hubs, daughter and I strolled in for a quick dinner. We overordered, per usual, but here are a few things worth noting:

-Shawarma entree: Shards of tender and marinated beef over rice, shredded lettuce, and tomato with a side of pita bread.

-Falafel: Crispy and flavorful! Plus, you can score a dozen (yes, 12) for less than $5. I wasn&#39;t bowled over by any of their sauces, though. They were quite thin and lacking in the flavor department.

-Sides: High five for creamy hummus, bright tabbouleh and soft pita. 

-Drinks: Pepsi soda fountain behind the counter, but be prepared to pay for refills. A bit odd, IMO.

Overall, Pita House gets my vote for local Mediterranean and Middle Eastern fare!"

The place is attached to a strip mall. It&#39;s a corner spot close to the main road. They played Mediterranean music over the intercom while we were eating. A lot of people had &#34;take out&#34; food for dinner. 

The food was served hot and a lot of food for your price. 
The chicken kabobs are made of chicken tenders grilled that has a lemon taste to it. 

Beef Shawarma was ok, some soft pieces and others a bit dry and tough. 

Loved the falafel. Not dry, perfect size pieces just the two of us we ate 5 pieces each! 

Hummus was good and creamy. 

The rice is your typical Mediterranean Rice Pilaf.  It was kind of al dente not sticky.  It&#39;s better hot and fresh, leftovers wasn&#39;t my favorite and I LOVE RICE dishes!
 
We had to bring half of our food home, did I mentioned that they gave us a lot of food. 

They didn&#39;t have the heater on inside.  It was pretty cold dinning in that we ended up putting on our jackets. 

The staff are friendly. If I&#39;m in the area, I think I would come back and try their other dishes off the menu (look over the other Yelpers suggestions to order), but for sure I would get the falafel again!"

The food came out fairly quickly, in about 5 minutes.  The lentil soup is delicious and hearty, perfect for this chilly weather.  The stuffed grape leaves are very good, and filling!  I had to take some home.  The shish kabab, shawarma, and kefta kabab were just okay; I thought they tasted a little dry.  The chicken kababs were outstanding!  Moist and flavorful, and something I will definitely order again!  The falafel was pretty good, too.  I enjoyed the pita bread, as well: warm and moist.  The rice was so-so, and the salad consists of iceberg lettuce and tomato, which went well with the meats.

I liked it here, and I&#39;ll likely come back for a lunch special, especially for the grape leaves and chicken kababs.  :-)"

SHAWARMA!!! I can&#39;t get that out of my mind as my brother found that word amusing and used it afterwards. I have been to this location multiple times when I have a craving for Mediterranean food. Ultimately I end up with the super combo plate: A combination of Shish Kabab, Shawarma, and Kefta Kabab, Chicken Kabab, Falafel, served with salad, rice pilaf, and hot Pita bread which is usually amazing, however for some weird reason the meat was quite dry even with the tahini sauce which was disappointing. The flavors are there but not that strong either. After you order you are given a ticket number and you have to wait to be called which takes a while. All and all a average experience compared to my previous visits.

Pro- large selection of Mediterranean food

Con- slow service, dry meats

If I dont eat at home....I feel so comfortable eating at this place since it always so packed and everyone is always having a really good time.  

Everything from there hummus, pita bread, rice, chicken and baklava is a MUST to try.  Their dolma is also very well done especially when you dip it into their hummus or yogurt sauce.  Their appetizer platter is also excellent.

Everyone needs to go to their lunch specials where you can get a super combination platter for less than $6!  Cannot beat that at all!

Appetizer Combo ($4.95) : comes with 2 different salads, hummus, eggplant (made like hummus) with pita bread - I would have to agree with fellow yelper Sarah S. that the pita was VERY VERY VERY dry....the hummus tasted ok....the rest of the food on the combo... I didn&#39;t enjoy because it was too milky saucy watery......

Beef Combo (forgot which one was ordered, comes with all beef): comes with beef, rice, tomato, and pita bread...I tried some of the meat from my friend&#39;s plate and it was VERY dry as well....

Service: wasn&#39;t that great.

And since it was my first time here I obviously had to try EVERYTHING.  I ordered the combination entree for less than $10 and it came with beef shish kabab, lamb shawarma, kefta kabab, chicken kabab, falafel, &#34;salad&#34; (aka shredded lettuce with a couple of tomatoes thrown in), rice pilaf, and a basket of pita bread.  And for good measure I added on a small side of hummus for a couple of dollars too (and was able to steal some of my friend&#39;s mama ganoush too!).  Needless to say, I had PLENTY of food.  I agree with other yelpers that some of the food is a little dry but there is enough awesome on that menu to have you forget all about the less than stellar items.  Out of my ridiculous combination, I must say that the shawarma, kefta, and falafel were my favorites.  And I would probably get them as sandwich and some sides instead of wasting a plate full of shredded lettuce and rice I don&#39;t really touch.  The hummus and mama ganoush were really good too.  Especially with some of that hot sauce poured over it.  Mmmmmmmm.  I pretty much aim to set my mouth (and subsequently my butthole) on fire whenever I eat and Pita House was able to accomplish this for me.  Thanks, PH!

The restaurant is actually much bigger than it looks and has plenty of seating.  There is even seating outdoors for those of you who like stare at the parking lot/street and brave the elements whilst eating.  Not my bag, but a plus for some. 

P.S.  One thing you absolutely must stay away from is the iced tea.  I don&#39;t know if they don&#39;t clean the brewer or if it was old, but it smelled and tasted like mildew.  Maybe I&#39;m sensitive to that kind of thing, maybe I&#39;m an iced tea snob, or maybe I just saved your life.  Either way, you&#39;re welcome."

After trying other Mediterranean food, I have determined that the primary reason for my love of Pita House is my love of Mediterranean Food in general.  Second, is proximity to my home.  While Pita House does not do anything poorly, I don&#39;t feel they do anything spectacular.

Their Turkey Shwarma is excellent on most occasions.  There is lots of flavor, and it is slightly healthier.  However it has been overcooked a couple of times, and that unfortunately results in an unpleasant experience.

Their Grape Leaves are not my favorite.  There is way too much rice and wrapper in them.  And while I like those, proportionally it does not work out well for me.

Their prices are fair, not cheap, not expensive for what you get.  Lunch specials sound like a great deal, but I have never been able to take advantage of them yet.

The service does take a long time as they are often busy.  Understandable since they&#39;re busy, but it just doesn&#39;t seem to move at a great pace and there are lots of call-in orders.  Recommended to call-in if you are getting takeout.

Sauces are excellent.  Ask for a special &#34;Garlic&#34; sauce that they have.  It is very tasty.  I just wish there was more, and the price for additional sauce is fairly steep.

They also have a good selection of flavored Waters (or they might be juices).  The Mango Water is excellent in my opinion.

Pita House receives a mild recommendation from me if you are in the area."

I truly have learned to love Mediterranean food. It&#39;s different than the standard burger or sandwich, its a pita with chicken or beef. 

They cook with a lot of seasonings so everything is very well flavored. I typically get the Kefta Kabob meal and skip the salad and get extra rice (which I NEVER finish). My hubby is a fan of the Chicken Schwarma. He loves it here and that is basically all he will eat when we go to Mediterranean restaurants and Pita House is responsible for that. They did pop his Mediterranean cherry, after all!

I love that they cook right in front of you and you can watch your food prepared. The cooks are very kind and they obviously take pride in the food they send out. 

The portions are generous and you can easily make two meals out of one dinner. Share it or save half for lunch tomorrow. 

My one and only compliant is their pitas are not homemade. They are fine but they are not great. I seem to always wish they were fresher. I must never go on the right day. I should ask what day they get their &#34;pita shipment&#34; in next time I&#39;m there!

They are consistent in their food. They have photos of their food which def helps you make your decision! Especially if you have no idea what you&#39;re ordering! (Which I totally get because the first time I went, I was lost, too!)

Take a chance and try a new place! They are absolute fave place in the Schaumburg area for some Mediterranean food!"

Enter: Pita House. A locally owned Middle Eastern eatery that&#39;s held it&#39;s own with 2 locations in the suburbs of Chicago for 2 decades.  

I grew up not far from Pita House&#39;s Lombard location. The stand alone hut located off of busy Roosevelt Rd was the area&#39;s only digs to offer approachable and well marketed Middle Eastern fare at the time, and was a quiet kind of a living legend among the locals and always a place I kept on my long list of &#39;To Do&#39; dining spots, but for one reason or another, I never managed to make it it (I blame Steve&#39;s Gyros).

Had I tried Pita House back in my meat eating days, or even just a couple of years ago before getting a taste of recent local competitors, Naf Naf Grill and the already established Mediterranean monster house, Pita Inn, I may have rated them a bit differently, but unfortunately for the timing of events, Pita House was last on my local pita pit stop list and just didn&#39;t measure up.

Maybe I&#39;m just spoiled having the perfect freshly made pillowy pitas of Naf Naf so close to home, or the convenience of getting  the savory and flavorful falafel of Pita Inn whenever I&#39;m working in the northern &#39;burbs area but I was a bit disappointed and felt a little misled that a place call &#39;Pita House&#39; doesn&#39;t make their own pitas. Call me crazy, right? They&#39;re just the same store-bought kind my BF buys at the local grocery. And I might be able to forgive that if the falafel were a bit more consistent but it seemed like a mixed bag as far as my falafel platter was concerned. Some were decent (at best) but most were just too dry and grainy for my taste. Same deal with the hummus- very grainy and not the smooth texture most would prefer. 

I did really enjoy their rice, yogurt and hot sauce. All mixed together, that was a perfect combo and defo worth giving a try as a non-meat eater. Also worth mentioning were the grape leaves, which I have never been a fan of anywhere, but after trying Pita House&#39;s take on them (from my date&#39;s plate) I have to reconsider. They know how to make &#39;em! 

For dessert, their baklava is simply divine. They don&#39;t skimp on the honey and it was just pure flaky perfection as far as my date and I were concerned. Defo worth fighting over the last bite, but better if you just plan ahead and order up AT LEAST one order for each of your dining partners. They also have mango and tamarind juice that mixes well together if you don&#39;t mind your beverages on the sweeter side. 

Another item worth noting is that it did take quite a while longer than I thought it would for our food to become ready, and even then we were still missing an item. Not a big deal, but it is something to think about if you&#39;re going for the lunch crunch and maybe need to sacrifice freshness for promptness."

Unfortunately, it just wasn&#39;t as good this time around. The hummus is still some of the best I have had, along with the pitas. But beyond that, the rest of the food was not very good.

The rice was mushy and tasted almost like plastic (we barely touched it), the falafel was dry, the meat was overcooked, and one person complained that her schwarma was very greasy. We all just poked around at our food, hoping it would get better...but it didn&#39;t.

I still think you get quite a bit of food for cheap, but I think I may venture out to some new places to see if I can find something better!"

Pita House, what happened?!

The quality just isn&#39;t there anymore. Sadface.

The last couple of times I&#39;ve been in, I&#39;ve noticed dry rice, over cooked meat, and massive amounts of shredded lettuce in everything. ((Don&#39;t get me started on my shredded lettuce pet peeve)).

The last trip was the icing on the cake. I ordered a turkey schwarma sandwich. The meat was bits and pieces that were either fatty and greasy or burned. Disgusting. I tried to man up and eat it but after the second bite, I was thoroughly grossed out. Luckily, they were kind enough to swap it with a chicken sandwich. 

So what else happened you ask? The falafel were overcooked (and not piping hot), the rice was dry and mushy (if that makes sense), and the sandwich I had ordered wasn&#39;t made properly.

Overall - it just wasn&#39;t the same. It hasn&#39;t been in a while. I left sad and disappointed. Pita House would no longer be part of my usual rotation.

Note: They still get major points for friendly service and an amazing vegetarian platter."

Maybe I misordered?  Maybe Middle Eastern food just isn&#39;t my cup of tea?  I don&#39;t really know.  I didn&#39;t leave hungry by any means, but I wasn&#39;t wow-ed either.

I met a group of ladies here around 6 pm on a Wednesday night.  The dining room was about half full, and there was no wait to order (Although when we left around 7:30, there was a line about three deep).

The staff was friendly and efficient, I will give them that.  I walked up to order, and you get a number and whatever drinks you might have ordered.  They call your number over the intercom system (sounds annoying, but it didn&#39;t bother the dining experience at all).  You go up and grab your food, and then you are good to go!

I ordered the Chicken Kebab Sandwich and the falafel plate as well as a pepsi.  My total was $13 something--it seemed fair for pretty much two meals.  and it WAS a lot of food.

The other ladies at the table ordered schwarma, turkey shwarma sandwiches, hummus, and some kind of salad in their tahini sauce.

My falafel was good, I really enjoyed it.  When they say it comes with &#34;salad&#34;, they mean it comes with shredded lettuce w/ a couple tomatoes on top.  This does NOT a salad-make, but I digress.  The rice was really dry (which I was told was not usual for this restaurant, so maybe it was an off night).  My chicken kebab sandwich was just alright.  It had this &#34;yellowing&#34; which I was told was new/changed since the last time my dining companions were there.  

The tahini sauce was good, and the red sauce was WAY too spicy for me (this is NOTHING against the restaurant at all--I&#39;m weak when it comes to spice).  It had a great flavor, though!

One of my friends actually didn&#39;t enjoy her pile-of-grease-turkey-schwarma-sandwich so much that she asked them to remake it into a chicken sandwich (totally understandable!!).  They were surprised, but they did it.

The hummus was really good and creamy, and the pitas were soft and piping hot.  I give that appetizer a big thumbs up!!

Overall, I would go back to try some different things, but I don&#39;t think Pita House will be making it onto my regular rotation!"

It&#39;s kind of a letdown.  There is a pretty big seating area inside, but honestly the lack of chicken shwarma kinda annoys me. 

The quality of food is kinda meh.  It&#39;s tasty but sometimes it comes out very dry.  

I gotta stick with some of the newer chains now like Naf Naf, I dream of Falafel, Pinched, etc.  I would think more competition would drive up quality but I guess the proximity of the competition is so few and far between there is no real push to do better."

I had the Lamp Kebab Sandwich which comes in a pita with red and white sauces in small bowls. The red was very hot and very very very flavorful. I need to find out what it&#39;s called and how to make it at home. Pita House is my new favorite place to go for lunch. I&#39;ve always meant to try it and now I am glad that today I did. :0)

Hummus was okay, but I prefer the hummus I make at home.  The falafel was mushy but flavorful, and the chicken was just chicken.  It didn&#39;t wow my pants off.  They forgot to give me my baklava too. 

Not the best or worst.  I&#39;m going to keep searching for my holy grail Mediterranean place. 

My favorite go to places for Mediterranean are Naf Naf and Pita house."

I got the Chicken Schwarma lunch deal. It was a ton of food so I was pretty excited to dive in! Sadly, the chicken was dry and had no flavor to it. I&#39;ve had much better hummus and the pita was very, very dry much like the chicken. The rice that came with it was also quite bland.

I went with a friend for lunch and he told me Pita Inn is much better, so I&#39;ll be trying there next time. I wish this place was better as I&#39;m always right there. Sadly, I don&#39;t think I will ever be back for their too highly priced medicore food."

I sayd u guys forgot to give me pita bread with my to go. And he says to me that I didn&#39;t have any pita bread incuded I had a lifts kobob platter, it always comes with a side of pita bread.

The only Middle Eastern food I&#39;ve had was the staples...pita, hummus, falafel, and baklava. 

I ordered the Shwarma plate and I honestly really enjoyed it, especially with the warm pita bread. It was like I had a comfort food kind of lunch because it really hit the spot. 

If you are sharing pita with a friend though, you may want to consider asking for extras, because you won&#39;t clear off your plate with two pita a person. 

My only lack of star was my friend and I were definitely outnumbered as far as men vs. women ratio in attendance and it felt awkward. But I really love the food and will totally come back."

LOVE the Jerusalem salad and the mama ghanoush (made with zucchini instead of eggplant).

The falafel could be more flavorful. While the inner texture is great, the outside is crunchy and almost kinda grainy instead of the nice crispiness I prefer. If you order it as a side, it includes a dozen for $4.55.

Their baba ghanouj seems overwhelmed by mint. Still decent, but it&#39;s a little strange to barely detect the standard smokey eggplant taste.

The mango drink was awful, and I can&#39;t explain why exactly--too sweet, or too artificial? Odd vegetable-like flavor?

Btw, don&#39;t order the small size for the hummus, ghanoush, etc -- it&#39;s tiny! Like, in a cup normally reserved for sauce."

Revision of yesterday&#39;s review.

Although the review I posted yesterday was not terribly harsh I did feel it was accurate and mirrored my frustration.

However today when I opened my email and found the owner of the restaurant contacted me directly I had to revisit this post.

The email from the owner was genuine and very sincere and I truly appreciate simply being acknowledged with the complaint I had regarding the food I ordered.

It was nice too have him offer a gift certificate for the value for  the food I ordered last night. But I found that it was far more important to Simply feel as though my complaint was acknowledged and not simply discarded as another difficult customer.

In order to be as Fair as possible, I will say that the burnt crust on the pizza was not the worst thing I&#39;ve ever encountered. The pizza itself was phenomenal. I was simply a little grizzled that the crust was singed as I love that part of the pizza.

Something that has defined my experience as a consumer in the passing years has been the desire to have considerate customer service. I have told many places of business that they earn my loyalty even if they falter at times and yes even if I find the price is higher with similar businesses.

A big hats off to mr. Marino, the owner of the restaurant for taking the time to address my complaint and personally emailing me. That is truly something that is lacking these days.

I will however send back food to the kitchen if I find it&#39;s burnt. ... and I doubt I will storm out of the restaurant with tears streaming down my eyes. LOL.

The food is good. I&#39;ll give this place another shot.

I really don&#39;t want to be a complainer, but I&#39;ve ordered twice from Marino&#39;s and I&#39;ve been disappointed both times.

The first time I ordered a pizza and they delivered  the twice pizza the wrong ingredients.

I ordered a pizza tonight and the crust with burnt. What really irritates me is that the person who pulled it out of the oven saw that it was burnt but still boxed it up and send it for delivery. I&#39;ll give a little leeway and say that it was overly cooked and partially burned. But burned crust is burnt crust.

I called Marino&#39;s and told them about it and they said that they would give me a $10 credit off my next order, or they would just go ahead and send out another Pizza.  I&#39;m at work so waiting another hour for a pizza just does nothing for me..

I&#39;m sure that it is a busy Saturday night.... But come on, only two times I&#39;ve ordered from there, and I stuck with a pizza I don&#39;t want. Again."

I got there and waited for about 15 minutes for the girls up front to figure out that my pizzas were actually done but they were sitting in different warmers.... OKEEE SO I get home and the pizza is not thin crust  and they aren&#39;t very warm probably due to sitting in the warmers for awhile. 
I didn&#39;t call because I honestly don&#39;t have time for them to make another pizza. 
I absolutely don&#39;t like thicker crust pizza so I didn&#39;t like it. The woodfire one was good not great I&#39;ve def had better. 
The price point is a little high I could go to any of my favorite places and get larger pizzas for a better price and taste. 
I live right across the street so I&#39;ll probably be back but I will try something other then pizza. 

I also tried the fried dough EH large portion but tree guys fried dough is so much better. &amp;&amp; their cheesecake was fantastic.

 I simply called and asked if they had changed cooks or ingredients and complained of the dough being too doughy, after reviewing my order she realized they made a mistake and made a regular crust instead of extra thin crust pizza that I have always previously ordered in my long history of previous deliveries. She OFFERED to send a new one and I agreed. Forgive me Maria my teenage boys already ate a few slices before I realized it was different. You asked that we return the uneaten rest of the pizza to the driver while waiting another entire hour for another one to be delivered (totaling 2 hours) 9 pm in the evening! 

I am appalled at the way she handled my experience and falsely accused me (a long time customer whom has never once complained) of scamming her out of a $30 pizza. Buisness may be thriving today but word of mouth and sharp tongues like yours will never prosper. 


Not ONCE did she ever apologies for the error but instead accused me of SCAMMING them out of a pizza I never asked for in the first place, I simply asked if they changed ingredients or cooks. Maria the manager who left me a very nasty voicemail on my personal cell phone # and who by the way also knows where I live and has my credit card information, you win.

The only downfall is the restaurant is super small so there was nowhere to sit during lunch. Super busy restaurant and that is definitely for a reason.

My parents were in town, I was moving, and we were hungry. My Dad wanted to try Marino&#39;s. I ordered a pizza for delivery, and it was delicious! The delivery was fast (they said it would be an hour but it was about half of that), the crust was great (we got the traditional), and there were plenty of toppings. You can only get the wood fired pizza in the 12&#34; size, not any bigger. That was disappointing, but we survived with the brick oven.

I think they are a little pricey, but it seems like most pizza places are. An 18&#34; pizza was $30 before tip. Hence the reason why I don&#39;t order pizza often. But, it was good and I would return if I ever needed pizza again."

I was anxious to finally taste their wood oven pizza only to be extremely disappointed. I ordered the margherita pizza and it had a literal pool of grease in the center of the pizza. The cheese was not cooked all the way and slid right off the piece as I picked it up. It was one ball of mess. The pizza was only cut into 4 pieces, leaving me to cut it into 8 slices with a butter knife. I only had a few pieces and didn&#39;t even want to take the rest home.  I was sadly disappointed and will not be returning."

Marino Wood Fire Pizza is like a diamond in the rough.  Great little Italian pizza joint with phenomenal menu items.  You wouldn&#39;t expect to find such a great place in this area but don&#39;t be fooled.  If you don&#39;t get here at the right time for lunch it will most certainly be busy.  It is in between your regular pizza by the slice place and a fancy Italian restaurant.  You should come here for a good lunch, nothing too high class but also not fast food.

They have an extensive Italian menu with pasta dishes, sandwiches, pizzas, and flatbreads.  

I had a prosciutto sandwich that was really good.  Not only was it tasty and a filling portion size it was also served like one of those dishes on those cooking shows.  Plating was quite apparent.  Clean white plates with colorful food strategically placed.  

Lastly, I had the hot fries which were amazing.  They list it under the side &amp; appetizer menu but this is definitely an appetizer only option.  The fries are doused in a hot wing sauce and they sprinkle blue cheese chunks on top.  Really really good."

Since you have to look at a menu on a board, that is somewhat difficult to navigate....some guidance would be appreciated.
We told the girl at the counter that this was our first time there.  
She showed no friendliness or helpfulness whatsoever-total lack of interest!  
We had a wood fire pizza (okay, not great) and also a pasta dish (very good).
We were not aware that they also have homemade pastas available.
Also, there are 2 types of pizzas - brick oven and wood fire.  
It would have been nice to have the difference explained.
I liked it here, but would definitely order differently if I return."

a couple of days ago, i decided to order a chopped salad for delivery. Ive done this a couple of times where ive paid extra for delivery since my location is out of area and they have agreed every time EXCEPT a couple of days ago!  NOT SURE what the issue was but per Caroline (elk grove location) who also stated she was the manager.... (which i believe this was a lie) she told me it was not possible and whoever accepted that before should have not done so.... ????!!!!!  I told her ive done this many times before and i was willing to pay the extra delivery fee but she wouldnt budge. AGAIN. NOT SURE what the issue was since ive done this before. 

I got so frustrated that i decided to call the wooddale location to complain. I spoke with Dino, who did really nothing for me and basically told me &#34;i&#39;ll give you the salad for free but you would have to come in and pick it up&#34; WTF.... are we serious????? i decided that this was just so ridiculous, i didnt want it anymore. 

Absolutely, no customer service what so ever and dont even bother... go to Avanti&#39;s instead."

I&#39;ll start by saying that the previous reviews are highly misleading and are likely a product of those who haven&#39;t strayed far from this &#34;village&#34;. I&#39;m giving this place two stars for two reasons:1)it was clean 2)it was quick. However, I cannot lend a star to the taste or experience as they were both sub-par. I am Italian and would say that describing Marino&#39;s as Italian food is quite a stretch. This is basic food with an Italian label. Do not be fooled. 

On another note, there is no where else to go, so you may find yourself sitting at a table in Marino&#39;s just like I did....defeated, disappointed, and confused. You aren&#39;t alone."

Sadly before they moved to the new location they were a 4/5 destination.  Food is consistently good tasting, and the new location is much nicer and cleaner.  Unfortunately it seems that serving sizes and customer service has dropped a bunch.  I have had them prepare the wrong pasta order for me several times and when I asked about it before paying they just gave me a blank stare and offered to resolution.  I don&#39;t like being forced into a situation of having to purchase the wrong order, or wait 20 minutes for them to fix it with no apology.  What used to be a weekly destination is now only an occasional one.  

But I do want to state again, the food taste and quality is good (above average) for a casual italian food spot.  It is definitely worth giving a try if you are in the area."

Love the redo of the interior, and happy that this place might make it longer term than previous tenants. 

Had a few slices of the Quatro Stagioni which turned out to be heavenly. Prosciutto, black olives (the good kind, not the bland yucky squishy ones), mushrooms, and artichokes on top of fresh mozzarella baked on a thin crispy crust, slightly darkened in a few spots on bottom, but cooked perfectly!  The only possible problem was a few of my olives kept trying to escape before entering my pie hole. Never fear...I caught them. 

I also had a slice of my coworkers Margherita, which we both found ok, but not as good as the Quatro. It only had olive oil and basil with the mozzarella. It wasn&#39;t bad, just not super. Most Margherita pizzas also have thin slices of tomatoes on them, but they were absent here. 

Looking forward to many happy return visits....hopefully!!!"

I got an Italiano and Hot and Spicy Fries, and my boyfriend had plain fries and plain chicken tenders. I brought him lunch at work and he texted me several times to tell me how delicious the tenders and the BBQ sauce they gave us were. (Best Girlfriend Achievement Unlocked)

The Italiano, though it looks small, was filling when paired with the fries and I was only able to eat half. It was seasoned really well, was very light and the salami was so high quality--tender and flavorful.

My only complaint is that it&#39;s on the pricey side, but since we rarely eat out for lunch, it was definitely worth the $25 for two meals. I also got a fountain drink so it was just about $10 per person for good quality food plus leftovers. Not a bad deal."

That was what I was able to rattle off, order wise, while perusing the expansive menu at Marino&#39;s, with a toddler in tow. And just minutes later, our food came flying out of the kitchen...good thing as little kiddos do not fully understand the concept of &#34;waiting.&#34; 

With plenty of tables and incredibly friendly and helpful staff, Marino&#39;s serves up a great dinner or lunch lineup for just about anyone. As mentioned, the menu is diverse with plenty of sandwiches, salads, pastas, entrees, and wood fired pizzas. The margherita pizza was flavorful with a nicely textured crust, the meatballs were a huge hit with my daughter, and the caprese salad was large and full of (lots of) cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and an abundance of red onion.

I&#39;ve brought a number of vendors here and they&#39;re always impressed with the food.  The only downside to this restaurant is the seating arrangements.  I&#39;ve only been to this location for lunch so I don&#39;t know what the dinner situation looks like, but in the afternoon it&#39;s open seating.  This is a popular place, so if you have more than two people it&#39;s a gamble whether or not you will be able to sit together.  The food is certainly worth the risk and any wait, though!

I got to refer back to Tom C&#39;s previous review.  The pizza is meh- if you like cracker-esque and that Californian style pizza, then all I can say is, &#34;to each his own.&#34;

But I can&#39;t stand bad service.  I ordered to-go &#39;jumbo&#39; wings *sarcasm* (wish that I could change the font for jumbo to an Arial 3.5 size), a salad, and fries.  I ordered the fries after my initial order of wings and salad on a separate check...harbinger...many already know what&#39;s going to happen.  So when my order is ready; I get ONE bag.  I politely ask the girl, if my fries have been added since I ordered after the first order.  Of course, I get a &#34;it should be.&#34;  My gut is insisting that it is not.  I take her word for it and return to the car.  Where my wife asks, &#34;why did it take so long?&#34;  &#34;IDK,&#34; my reply.  She opens the bag to snack on the fries, but low and behold...NONE.

I jet back into Marinos and alert another girl, again politely, that my fries were not in the bag.  Ok different check- a little difficulty tying the two orders together.  That&#39;s fine.  I get my fries and leave.

At home, I realized that the jumbo wings (HOT) and my salad (COLD) were stacked together in the same bag.  So I now have a nice warmed up salad with warm dressing.  Then the jumbo wings are no &#39;jumbo-er&#39; than the wing dings at Jewel.  And I couldn&#39;t tell if the wings tasted more like fries or the fries tasted more like chicken wings.  I had to make a game of it with my kids- almost like the Pepsi / Coke challenge.

But the straw...it was that Marino&#39;s (I think its a Chicago owned restaurant) was playing a Green Bay Packers&#39; game, when the Hawks were on.  Maybe Marino&#39;s doesn&#39;t have cable?  IDK.  But it sure did look like employees were enjoying the game.  And it doesn&#39;t bother me to eat at a Packers bar or restaurant, I&#39;ll sit down with my Michael Jordan Mitchell &amp; Ness jersey with a Bears C hat in ANY PART OF Wisconsin, Indiana, etc.  I just didn&#39;t know those places existed in my own neighborhood.

Just so you&#39;re aware, I loved Marino&#39;s when it was a small establishment on Biesterfield/Rohlwing.  It&#39;s a shame that wood and some fire could change it so much."

We ordered a ton of food, including a regular pepperoni pizza with regular crust, the Rucola wood fire pizza, barbecue wings, and the chicken vesuvio special (I currently can&#39;t get around much and wanted a meal for the next day ;)).

The food came sooner than expected and was piping hot.  The gentleman who delivered the pizza was extremely polite...he spent the extra .5 seconds to smile at us and wish us a good night.  

The pizzas were both delicious.  The taste combination of the Rucola pizza was fantastic...exactly what I was craving.  The pizza stayed together when you bit into it, and the saltiness of the prosciutto paired perfectly with the arugula and tomatoes.  Yummmm.  The pepperoni pizza was also fantastic, although I think next time we will go with their thin crust as the regular crust is a bit thick for my and my guest&#39;s taste.  Still delicious, perfect texture and consistency, not too much sauce, and tasty cheese.

The wings were also surprisingly good.  The barbecue sauce was thick and smoky, just how I like it.  We polished off all of them even though we had much pizza. Wow.

I was compelled to write this review, however, after I just heated up the chicken vesuvio for lunch.  Marino&#39;s chicken vesuvio warmed up was better than some chicken vesuvios I&#39;ve had in restaurants.  I highly, highly recommend it.

I was very happy with all the food and the service, and I will definitely be ordering from Marino&#39;s again."

By no means am I even going to compare city pizza and suburban pizza and no one should. There is most certainly an overabundance of pizza places in the area especially since you can see 3 others from the Marino parking lot. 

With all that said, we&#39;ve decided to make Marino Pizza our go to place in the area for thin crust and Italian Style Wood Fire pizzas. We usually get just the regular thin crust and we&#39;ve always been happy across the board with all the combinations. Except the night I got pepperoni on just my side of the pizza, I ate more than I should have that night because it was so good. The Wood Fire pizzas are solid too, they are definitely different than regular pizza so understand that if you&#39;ve never had them before (and spare me the &#34;it doesn&#39;t taste like they do in Italy!&#34; You know what, nothing does so get over it!) 

We&#39;ve tried a few of the pastas and those too are pretty good, they have a great variety and are open to making it the way you like and I appreciate that. The portions are very good and can me enough for lunch the next day. 

Now the salads, they too are very good but the Chopped is hands down my favorite. They have a great house dressing and I order it alone on many occasions especially with the fresh bacon in it and chicken too. When I mix things up I will get the Mela Salad which is a winner as well! 

When dinning in the restaurant is pretty simple, you order at the counter and they bring to your table (Note: they do have a liquor license). The place is relatively small and I hope they set up a patio or something when it warms up. Just a side note, if one of the young girls gets your order wrong, give them a break people...this isn&#39;t Mastro&#39;s! 

All in all, I say this is my #1 pizza place for Elk Grove Village (Lou Malnati&#39;s is a different category). My only feedback on the place is I&#39;ve called maybe one time and gotten through on the first try. Most times I have to call 2-4 times till someone answers, so don&#39;t worry, they are open! It&#39;s like calling into a radio station, just keep at it."

Picked up the pizzas on time and they were ready, but when I got home I realized we received a cheese and the Quatro Stagioni. Although the receipt had my order correct, the order was sadly incorrect. Even more sad...we don&#39;t eat ham. That left a family of four to share a smallish cheese pizza.

Rather than trying to resolve on a Friday night, I contacted them via their website explaining we were given the wrong food.  THEY NEVER RESPONDED. No apology, no move to resolve.  Since our business wasn&#39;t appreciated, we are happy to take it elsewhere."

The current corner has been a turnstile of drive thru places and so I was nervous for them here. I won&#39;t worry about them now. First, this isn&#39;t order at the table-you order at the counter and they&#39;ll give you a number; they&#39;ll bring the food out to you when it&#39;s ready.  Don&#39;t worry-you won&#39;t have to wait long. I think we only waited 10 minutes. I ordered the fried cauliflower to start. I&#39;m a huge cauliflower fan. It was crunchy on the outside and tender in the inside. Just right. We then ordered two types of pizza-the wood fired pizza and a thin crust. The wood fired pizza was the Quatro Stagioni: San Marzano tomatos, prosciutto cotto, kalamata olives, mushrooms, artichokes, and mozzarella. It was delicious. The crust was crunchy and toothsome with wonderful blisters from the oven. The thin crust was their meat lovers with sausage, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, and regular bacon. All of the meats were very flavorful and the cheese was fresh and wonderful. The little bit of corn meal on the bottom really added to the crunch of the crust. The crust wasn&#39;t soggy at all with all the toppings on it. And their sauce was excellent-not too sweet and not to salty. The ingredients all worked together in harmony. We saw a few people with pasta dishes that we will certainly come back and try."

Got a chopped salad with chicken for lunch one day which was good but a tad pricy (around $9). For that price I wish it came with more chicken (came with smaller chunks), a full breast or strips. Also came with a nice dinner roll &amp; butter.

Dined here for dinner the other night, we got Diavola pizza (San Marzano tomatoes, spicy salami, chili flakes, fresh basil and mozzarella cheese) and boneless BBQ wings. The pizza was amazing!! If you ever have stuffed sinuses, get this pizza...it will clear it right up! Very spicy but not too strong. The crust had that nice wood fire cooked consistency, chewy with a bit of flakiness. The wings were also very good. They were more like boneless chicken tenders because they were huge. We thought they would be just small wings that you get at most places...we ended up taking half of them home. The pizza, wings and 2 soft drinks was $33.

We finished off with a Penne Vodka and a Chicken Limone which were all prepared perfectly.  Portions seemed perfect for the price.

No hours on the door or a &#34;open&#34; sign on.  I was told by a very nice girl to take a menu and have a seat.   We did and looked over the menu and saw they have ground beef as a topping for pizza.  I asked if it was fresh or precooked.   I was told &#34; precooked&#34;.  I prefer for it to be fresh and then cook on the pizza.   I ordered it anyway.   I also asked for bacon, extra bbq sauce., easy cheese.   I received the pizza and tried to find the bacon, but didn&#39;t really find any.  I took a piece,  it was dry and crunchy.   I also tasted something that was &#34;off&#34;.  Not hamburger, but meatball.  I went back to the counter and tried to clarify that they used meatball on my pizza and how unhappy I was.  That got me nowhere as no one offered to make me a new pizza or give me my money back.   So we spent $40 for a 14 inch pizza that we didn&#39;t eat, chicken tenders and a salad.   We went home very unhappy."

Everyone is very helpful, it&#39;s hard not to feel like home.

Cleanliness:
Restaurant is very clean, and feels like a good BBQ joint should.

Food:
The food is excellent. The brisket is some of the best in the area. The pulled pork and sides are all fresh and flavorful. The portion sizes are all great--two people can comfortably split the two meat entree with two sides, and leave spending less than $20. The beer specials are almost too good to be true. $2 16oz domestic beers every day? That&#39;s without a doubt the best beer special I&#39;ve ever seen.

Overall:
Five stars. If you&#39;re in the Bartlett / West Chicago area and want barbecue, you must give it a try."

The sauces are delicious, and the portions are plenty.  My only gripe (and it is a preference) is that the corn muffin not have any corn chunks in it.  I love the turkey and chicken.  Brisket is decent, and the pulled pork is good as well.  

My wife loves the ribs and corn.  

The other nice part is that everyone who works for Smokin&#39; Pit is personable and friendly."

I had the 1 Meat Platter with Chicken, Cornbread, Coleslaw and Onion Rings. The wife had the Smokin&#39; Club with  Smoked Turkey, Hickory Smoked Ham, Smoked Applewood Bacon, American Cheese, Lettuce and Tomato, with a side of coleslaw. 

I give the Smokin&#39; Club an A+. It was delicious and my wife could barely finish it. With my 1 Meat Platter, I give the Chicken an A+. It had a nice smokey flavor, plus you get 1/2 pound The Cornbread a B, it was a little dry, The Coleslaw and Onion Rings a C. The Coleslaw was pretty soggy, I think it came out of a carton, rather than homemade and the Onion Rings were soft, so I would guess they are frozen, not home made. The Coleslaw and Onion Rings prevented a 5 star rating, so I gave it 4 stars.

I am a fan and would return again"

Beef brisket was tender and fell apart, but very dry. Chicken was tender and juicy. Sauces were uninspired and probably made by some huge factory. Bland. The corn bread was dry and tastless. 

It was $14.97 for a two meat two side meal with water. Over priced for the quality. I may give them another chance if i am newrby and desperate but there ate options like Steamboat in Glen Ellyn. Why waste the effort?"

I tried tried the pulled pork and turkey.  What you note first is they use a warmer, which isn&#39;t keeping anything warm.  Probably from opening it often.  

The meat is pretty good, but their sauces are average at best.  

For sides I tried the Mac and cheese &amp; beans.  The mac was good, but the beans tasted like I could buy  at the store.  Last it came with a dry on the cornbread muffin.  I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re not keeping them in a bread box or bag, but tastes ok

I think this place could quality control and it could be much better.  Will keep an eye on reviews to see if they learn from reviews."

We wanted to go when it opened but the reviews were not the best so we waited...We went on 11/10 at 6.35 PM. The counter guys were very friendly and helpful to explain the various things.  I ordered the Sliced Brisket, with Mac N Cheese, Skin on Fries, a small corn bread ($11.99) a side of ham ($2.99) and a fountain drink ($2.25),  (Pepsi products) total cost $18.44. I will say the meats and fries were very good. The Mac N Cheese I wouldn&#39;t order again, cold corn bread wasn&#39;t special (Boston Market is actually better and warm) My friend had the brisket and a side of ribs, fries and onion rings we both liked the brisket and the ribs fell right off the bone and had a very good flavor, the onion rings had a good light batter.  As for the BBQ they were good and I recommend you add your own or try it before....

We went to check out the deserts and ended up with the brownie and a cookie. The cookie was highly recommended by the counter guy. They were ok but not really special or worth it. They did have peach cobbler which sounded good but it was kept on the steam table so wasn&#39;t sure it would be all that. 

I would suggest they do the following for the dinning area;
1. Move the table back from the soda machine way to close and people can&#39;t pass without bumping or people moving out of the way. 
2. Invest in air filtration (we smelt like BBQ when we left). 
3. When time allows I would recommend that they touch base with the people dinning in. They had a decent crowd coming through 

All in all it was good for the meats may have to work on trying some of the other sides...Cost was a bit high for a cafeteria style place."

This place is bringing in pretty righteous BBQ. Love the concept, feels like a real BBQ joint in the south. The smell of smoked meats in the air instantly when you walk in that takes me back to my first &#34;real&#34; BBQ experience in Texas. 

The food is great, 2 plate meat done by weight again the way it should be. You tell the staff lean or moist, even though it&#39;s obvious to always order moist but some don&#39;t care for the flavor or look of fat. I love it!  Anyways went with brisket and turkey and both were smoked perfectly. The bark, smoke rings I can go on!  The sauces were good, my fav was spicy and out of the sides the beans were full of rocking flavor.

FYI....this blows away the other BBQ place in Bartlett!

When you order to go they charge you extra. Then I ordered two baked potatoes and a salad there are no sides that come with the special. The ribs were dry and meatless not impressed at all. The salad which cost me $8 had wilted lettuce when I got it home 20 minutes later. And 2 baked potatoes with sour cream cost me almost $12 absolutely ridiculous. Piatonza Italian restaurant in Bartlett at Army Trail and 59 has full slab ribs for 17.99 with sides and plenty of meat on the bones.

The place itself is very clean, lots of silver and steel accents. We were immediately greeted and ordered our food cafeteria style. I opted for brisket and pulled pork. I was asked if I wanted my brisket on the lean side or with a little fat, which I thought was awesome. Never been asked that before, and I do prefer less fat. The brisket was juicy and delicious, as was the pulled pork. There are three sauces to choose from, and I chose the tangy. I think next time I&#39;m going to go with the sweet. The tangy was not bad at all, just not quite what I wanted. For my sides I had corn and fries. The fries are made to order, and just your average thick cut fries. I think next time I&#39;ll go with the sweet potato mash, or something else. The corn wasn&#39;t very sweet, but still not bad. I definitely was more interested in the amazing meats than sides! However, don&#39;t skip the cornbread because it&#39;s awesome!
I&#39;ll definitely be back to try some of the other smoked meats, and have some more brisket!"

That being said, here is where Smokin&#39; Pit can improve on their establishment: price, and side items.

Their Mac &amp; Cheese tastes like something I could easily concoct at home, and even more so , their corn. If I can make both taste better cooking them in my own kitchen, then I&#39;m not paying someone else to make them taste more bland for me. Thoroughly disappointed. Cornbread was dry.

The brisket was good, but the sauces need to be improved on greatly. The tangy was quite watery, but the sweet was better and not nearly as thin. 

This was not worth $35 for two adults to eat dinner, and I would not return. 

For people concerned about atmosphere and cleanliness, I would give Smokin Pit a 9 on a 10 scale. I was impressed by that, but for me, unfortunately the food has to all be quite good for me to spend that kind of money more than once. Hell, I used to eat at a BBQ place connected to a gas station for God&#39;s sake and it was absolutely the best BBQ in in Texas and probably the U.S..

Nonetheless, the place is nearby and I love exploring all things BBQ...been to Memphis, KC, and Texas for BBQ trips before...so here it goes.

Went here twice over the past few weeks. The only good thing I can say is that the meats ARE smoky. Love the smell of the place, but sadly the rest of the experience is, in fact, a bust for any BBQ aficionado.

Had the ribs, which were moist and had the perfect amount of juiciness. However, the sauces are not good. The tangy sauce is just not a pleasant flavor, and the sweet sauce had an thick texture/flavor that was not appealing. The server drenched my ribs in sauce without first asking...the ribs looked pretty good sauce-free. Get the sauce on the side. Did not try the hot sauce.

Beyond that, things went downhill. I tried most every side, all of them were nothin special. The cole slaw and potato salad could have come from any grocery store standard recipe, the corn had no spices whatsoever (I could make corn with butter at home), and the biggest disappointment was the mashed sweet potatoes &#34;with spices&#34;. I could not taste any spices in the sweet potatoes. In fact, they tasted literally like plain potatoes with nothing added. The corn bread muffin, also, was nothing special. Standard issue. I skipped the beans, as they looked to be  Texas-style (not to my liking).

I really wanted to like this place, but, frankly, it&#39;s nothing special and the recipes for their sides are commonplace. Come on, guys! Put some effort into those recipes. Put the same amount of effort into the recipes that you put into the decor!"

And I still stand by the fact, that the best thing on the menu is the Smoked Turkey, Smoked Ham and Pulled Chicken.  Shame, when it should be the Ribs, Brisket and Pulled Pork.  Guess I&#39;ll just have to stop by more during dinner time.  Or just not stop by at all???"

My recommendations: chopped brisket with sweet sauce and a little of the hot bbq sauce. Chili (it&#39;s made with brisket!). Cole slaw (this is the only Cole slaw I have found that I like in all my 30 years on this earth). Fries. Onion rings.

In the restaurant business you will waste food. That is the nature of the beast. However in doing so you will never run the risk of turning customers away!! That is THE biggest sin. 

When you know that for the past few days that the demand is high, why in the hell wouldn&#39;t you plan for it. It is ridiculous that the owners here can&#39;t see the simple writing on the wall that says: &#34;we&#39;re busy, let&#39;s make more food.&#34; If your smokers are running 12 hours a day make sure they&#39;re running 24 hours.

We love to support our local businesses.

Disclaimer 2: we are experienced BBQ consumers as well as BBQ fans who love to cook it as well - both Memphis Style as well as Texas. Our last visit outside the state where we had some great BBQ was actually in Dallas this year. 

Disclaimer 3: the reviews on this place are either 5 stars or less than 2 stars. It&#39;s a pretty extreme difference. Top that with an owner who tells people their own experiences were not interpreted right. Honest reviews aren&#39;t personal attacks - they are opportunities for feedback that can be valuable. So take that for what&#39;s it worth.

We got word that this place had opened so after work we headed over to eat it. The menu looked fabulous. The atmosphere welcoming. The employees friendly.

I got the rib dinner, which is St. Louis ribs, 2 sides (I picked chili and sweet potato mash) and cornbread. Cost around $20.

The sauce options were sweet or tangy. Both were watered down and flavorless. The ribs were ok, but not very meaty which St. Louis ribs are known for. The chili I liked, it was very good. The sweet potato mash was ice cold, though quickly replaced when I said something. The cornbread was missing something...maybe salt. It was bland.

Husband got Three Meat platter with brisket, shredded chicken, pulled pork, chili, potato salad, cornbread. $17 or so I think.

Husband states the same about the sauce. The brisket was dry, the chicken and pulled pork was ok, however all were cold. He did not try the cornbread. Unlike me, he did not complain about the temp of the food. He should have so they could have fixed it.

Kids got chicken strips (daughter says they were dry, she didn&#39;t eat them) and pulled pork (son says it was cold).

So when I state that we are regulars at the other two BBQ places, it&#39;s because that&#39;s what we are comparing Smokin&#39; Pit to. 

I was most disappointed in the sauce, not only because there were only two options, but the consistency was way too watery and just so bland. I could deal with the watery (after all, vinegar based is my favorite) if the flavor was strong but again, maybe it was just opening day issues.

Initially I&#39;d hoped that after a few months the kinks were worked out so we could try it again because I absolutely saw the potential - but just reading the owner&#39;s responses on here and Facebook when anyone says anything other than how perfect it was, is a turn off.

For anyone to say this is better than BBQ in Texas itself?! Sorry. Not in my opinion. But if you have a craving - well try it for yourself and see what you think. Everyone&#39;s different."

 The food, I ordered Pulled Pork dinner plate. Includes corn biscuit, two side orders of your choice (mac&amp;cheese, and fries) and about a half a pound or less of pulled pork. 
The Pulled Pork, now that was some delicious stuff right there. It&#39;s cooked so well, it melts right in your mouth. No need for constant chewing or separating. Has an amazing faint smoky after taste as well. Delicious!!

Still have to try out the rest of the menus but so far, I&#39;m liking it."

The service is cafeteria style as you pick your protein first and subsequently push your tray ever so slowly towards the cashier. This is a potential &#34;Log Jam&#34; waiting for people asking too many questions and making choices, many of which have no idea what they want in the first place. This takes time and lots of it.

The Brisket sandwich has some nice bark and entertained a subtle smoke flavor with questionable moisture, but remained tender...&#34;good enough&#34;. Very stingy with the BBQ sauce.

They&#39;ll get over it. Anyway, my first time in your shop tonight, gotta say, my wife and I really enjoyed it. We&#39;ve had a lot of BBQ in our day, and a lot of it from Texas BBQ shops, Black&#39;s, Cooper&#39;s, Rudy&#39;s, etc.  And some great local shops, South Moon, Que, Texan, etc.  YOU have very good tasting smoked meats. We both had the brisket and really enjoyed it. 
As far as the sauce haters, it&#39;s not about the sauce, at least for me.  It&#39;s about great tasting tender smoked meat.  And that&#39;s what we got at Smokin Pit. The sauce was good. I don&#39;t want a sauce that takes away from the taste of the meat. I get my sauce on the side. I also had a taste of the ribs.  Very good also. On our next visit I will definitely get a slab.  My sides were the chili and sweet taters. Enjoyed both. Sweet taters not too sugary with the right amount of kick. Red pepper I&#39;m guessing.  Chili was very good. Enjoyed the corn muffin. Again, not to sweet. Corn meal and real corn, the way it should be.  I like to break mine up and put in my chili. 
O.K. here comes the negative shit. O.K. not really, but I will say my only disappointment was in the beer selection. I&#39;m not a Miller fan, or what their distributors distribute. When I&#39;m eatin Texas style BBQ, I like a Texas beer, specifically Shiner, or a Lone Star.  Bud or PBR would even be better than those designer pop IPAs.

I didn&#39;t read any of the other reviews until now and it&#39;s telling when a majority of complaints repeat a lot of the same adjectives to describe the food and the owner lashes out in denial.

I&#39;ve waiting almost three weeks for the follow up and this owner is clearly hyper-sensitive about any critique of his food and is clearly confused about proper customer service; which, is why he lashes out on yelp over bad reviews."

The pulled pork was even dryer and had a funky taste.  I didn&#39;t even finish it.  I can&#39;t pinpoint what it was but it almost tasted like green stale smoke wood.  I also got the mac and cheese.  it was creamy but with little taste.  Sauces were just okay.

Notice how the food wasn&#39;t on the list?

I&#39;ve tried authentic BBQ from all over, and happen to be more of a Carolina-style girl. However, I&#39;m a fan of all sorts of BBQ and believe a Chicago suburban restaurant can execute Texas style successfully. Unfortunately, Smokin&#39; Pit does not.  My sister ordered the beef brisket with mac n&#39; cheese and potato salad. I ordered the pulled chicken with mac n&#39; cheese, coleslaw and a taste of smoked turkey (with 2 drinks was a whopping $30ish.. I think $32?). The sides are pretty basic, made with that &#39;simple is better&#39; mentality which I can appreciate.. definitely couldn&#39;t hate on the cornbread.. but let&#39;s talk meat. The brisket was pretty good, dry but seemed to have a nice smoke ring. The real issue was the pulled chicken- without being dramatic, they must add some type of sodium or brine to it, because it was so salty my tongue burned! I ate half of the serving before throwing in the towel due to the burning between my tongue and tummy. Of course pulled chicken should be juicy, but this seemed to secrete a pool of mystery liquid. Infact, the chicken was so liquidy that it drowned my entire tray (no exaggeration). When we went to toss out the trash later, I tilted the tray so we could watch it all drain off.

The only saving grace for our experience was the absolutely hilarious super sweet African American woman working at the front counter.. Oh, and the super cool futuristic utensil dispensers. Let&#39;s be honest though, you shouldn&#39;t leave a restaurant with that as your only positive lasting impression. Overall- save yourself some $$$, tastebuds, time and skip out on Smokin&#39; Pit.. unless you&#39;re into futuristic restaurant gadgets of course."

Some good, some bad, but a lot of complainers and supposed experts in BBQ. I&#39;d love to know how many of these folks are either from the South or lived in Texas.

First I should point out that I know the owners, but if I didn&#39;t like their food I just wouldn&#39;t write a review. 

I lived in the South and tried all the different types of BBQ and have also eaten BBQ in Texas, but I&#39;m not going to say which is better. No need to start a BBQ war here. Just know that there are more different types of sauces than tomato based. I&#39;m a big fan of the mustard based sauces after living in the Carolinas. 

In my non-professional, love my BBQ, opinion Smokin&#39; Pit has some of the best BBQ out here in the burbs. I went with a couple friends and we all loved it. 

Our favorite sauce was the sweet BBQ sauce. The tangy was just too tangy for my taste although I was asked if I would want to mix the sweet and tangy sauces together. I may try that out next time. If you are not sure about which sauce you want, just ask for a sample.

I went with the three meat plate and got the brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken. I would vote the brisket as the best. After all, Texans love their brisket and have a true art to cooking it. It was so moist and tender it practically melted in my mouth. I was given the option of how I would like it served. Chopped or sliced and I got both. My second choice is the chicken and third was the pork. I&#39;ll try the other meats on my next visit. If you want the sauce on top, just ask, or you can get it on the side to dip.

The sides were really good. The mashed sweet potatoes has a little kick to them. Nothing&#39;s wrong with a little spicy afterkick. The cole slaw was probably my favorite. I don&#39;t know exactly what was in it, but there was something &#34;extra&#34; that gave it some really good flavor. The chili was exceptional as well. Just the right amount of beans and meat. We had the peppers which were good and the corn bread too. The peppers were just the way I like them, and I only had two small bites of the cornbread since I&#39;ve cut back the carbs.

All in all, I loved this place. The only thing that worries me is the fact that the place was half full when we got there and a line out the door by the time we sat down. I&#39;d hate to go and get food and then find I don&#39;t have a spot to sit down.

I know there were problems with running out of food in the beginning and that is something you don&#39;t usually see happen, but I&#39;ve also never seen a restaurant attract so many visitors when opening. I didn&#39;t think there were that many BBQ fans up here. 

Here&#39;s the thing, this is Texas BBQ. You&#39;re entitled to your own opinions (as am I), but remember that BBQ is subjective, especially if you were born and raised in Illinois. Most ppl here still think BBQ is grilling hot dogs and hamburgers. The sauce is not what most of us grew up with so be open to trying something new.

If you didn&#39;t have a good experience before, I would urge you to give it one more try unless you just don&#39;t like Texas BBQ. Either way, I hope your experience is as good, and delicious, as my first one was."

We&#39;ve dined in and carried out and so far we have thoroughly enjoyed both experiences. 

During our first visit, I was a little overwhelmed. I stood in line at dinner time looking over the menu.  Ultimately, we spent more money on that visit than we should have, but that was 100% our fault as we completely over ordered. Oops!!  Soooo, I didn&#39;t know what I wanted and the first person I encountered at the counter helped me narrow things down a bit. I wanted a two meat dinner, knew I wanted the smoked turkey but I was torn between beef brisket and pulled pork. This gentleman turned around and gave me a generous taste of the pulled pork. It was awesome!  Then, he cut off a nice bite of the beef brisket for me. I liked this even more!  Within moments, I already knew this was going to be a stellar visit!  The smokiness of the meat was just right for me.  I had the corn, onion rings and cornbread. My husband ordered a slab of ribs, chili, Mac n cheese, corn bread and something else I can&#39;t remember. 

So let me explain how I see it...the smoked meats are stored in the &#34;wall&#34; behind the counter at the beginning of the line. They cut my meat when I ordered it and it was served by weight. I like these things because the meat stays moist if it isn&#39;t presliced and there&#39;s no guesswork in the serving size if they&#39;re weighing the meat. 

This brings me to my next point...the portions are substantial!  My husband and I almost always over order. We know better...  So we did better on the second visit with limiting our choices. 

The whole setup is nice. Think Chipotle style line/counter with the meats stored out of initial view, but brought out to be sliced when you order. The side dishes are replenished on the line and you can see them as you make your decisions. They will &#34;sauce&#34; your meats on the line or you can get a side of sauce near the area where you fill your drink.  

During our first dine in visit, I was confused about where to find the silverware. Keep your eyes open and you will notice dispensers mounted to the wall. I really liked this...none of the other patrons are touching my fork while getting their own. Good choice, SPBBQ!  

We tried both BBQ sauce options. Yes, they&#39;re thiner sauces. So what?  Most of the meat doesn&#39;t NEED the BBQ sauce.  The flavor of each sauce is good. I don&#39;t need a sauce to be thick to be able to taste it when I put it on the meat. I prefer the spicier sauce, but used very little because I enjoyed the taste of the meat so much. I think I&#39;m loving the smoked turkey and beef brisket most so far...I am highly considering another visit ASAP to get my hands on both before the weekend is over. 

For my carryout dinner, I tried the slider trio. This was awesome!!  The rolls were soft and fresh, the meat just as good as the first time and the portion on this was perfect. Perfect portion with a perfect price = I&#39;ll order this again!  Add a taste portion of any meat if you want to bulk up your meal without overdoing it. 

My husband was a huge fan of all of the sides!  The chili is at the top of that list. The onion rings are really good too!  Even the corn had a slight twist due to a unique spice used. 

So still on my must try list, are the Texas hot links, dessert and the fries. I don&#39;t know that I will ever leave enough room for dessert. I absolutely WILL try the hot sausage links. And the fries should be sampled everywhere...SPBBQ is no exception. 

I&#39;m excited to have a unique, independently owned restaurant in Bartlett that doesn&#39;t include pizza or Chinese food. I am grateful for actual smoked meats that are treated with such TLC before they hit my plate.  SPBBQ is a welcome addition to our hometown!"

I understand that Bartlett has a lot of pizza places, but I live in St. Charles and I would drive to Nicodino&#39;s for pizza because it was way better than what is offered in STC. 

We went opening day when it was pouring out and as soon as I got in the door another customer told me that they were out of food. It was just 5 PM. We considered staying and ordering sides but my husband was pretty upset that they were out of food and we had to hear it from another customer. Neither owner was at the door to greet people and let them know what was going on. 

I followed the restaurant on Facebook for months anticipating the opening, I was really excited. I was so sad when it finally opened and there was no food. It was definitely a huge let down. I don&#39;t understand why other diners were getting so defensive when they ran out stating the food was so good that&#39;s why they ran out or stating that good bbq places always run out of food. If this were good bbq they would still be running out of food. Clearly they are not. It was just the rush of people wanting to check it out during the grand opening. So for that I think the owners should have been better prepared, after all, they hyped it up so much on social media. 

I dined here for lunch the other day and I was not really happy with my meal.
For starters, the prices are very high. For two one meat plates we paid nearly $25 (with no added drinks). 

I had the pulled pork plate, cole slaw and sweet corn. The pulled pork was okay, I think that the kind I make at home in my smoker is better. I will say it had minimal fat which made me happy. I hate when I order pulled pork and it is majority fat. They also do not pre-dress the pork with sauce. They let you choose sweet or tangy and they dress it for you. I&#39;m not a big fan of the &#34;cafeteria&#34; style they have set up. By the time I sat down with my meal all of my food was cold. 

The cole slaw, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s made in house, my serving was mostly liquid. It was okay, it wasn&#39;t gross, it just wasn&#39;t amazing.

The sweet corn, totally gross. I don&#39;t know what they put in it to make it sweet, but it was not sweet at all. It tasted like it had been sitting for quite a while. It was also cold. 

The corn muffin, it was okay. Again cold, I&#39;d prefer it were served hot. Maybe I missed it, but it could have used some butter. 

The staff was very friendly, the menu is a bit overwhelming and they were very nice and asked if we wanted to try anything and handed us turkey, chicken and brisket. The check out cashier was very nice. The restaurant is clean (Nicodinos was too) and it&#39;s very nice inside. 

I might try again, I might not. I don&#39;t know. I wasn&#39;t impressed. I understand that smoking meats take time, yada yada yada. I understand that opening and running a restaurant is not an easy task and it&#39;s hard to please everyone. I don&#39;t understand why two Italian guys opened up a bbq joint in Illinois. Maybe can put a BBQ pizza on the menu? I bet they make a great one!"

Ive traveled all over the US for work &amp; when out I like to sample regional bbq. (Texas, Missouri, Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, even California) Plus I have a 400lbs gravity feed smoker in my backyard where a couple times a month year round we are smoking something. 

We&#39;ve been waiting for this place to open for  months now! Tried getting in there last week Saturday &amp; the line was out the door, a good sign. We decided to try again last night. The staff was very friendly. My wife &amp; son had the ribs, I had a two meat plate (brisket &amp; sausage), daughter had a loaded baked potato.

The ribs were very dry almost to the point of being brittle. I also noticed that they didnt remove the back membrane of the ribs before smoking which can cause the brittleness. The brisket was moist &amp; tender but didnt really see a smoke ring on my particular cut. I did notice a ring on another diners brisket though. The sausage was extremely dry, not moist at all. The side dishes I thought were really really good. Coleslaw was awesome, fries &amp; onion rings crisp &amp; tasty. Cornbread had a just like Mom made taste. My daughters loaded baked potato was great. I will most likely go back there just for this. 

Now for the sauces: They really need to do something about this. I really think they are watered down to the point of having no flavor. 

The place is gorgeous, the staff was friendly &amp; I really hope they succeed. We will try again in another month or so after things calm down."

The Turkey was good, but the brisket and the pulled pork were both really dry and the brisket was very low quality meat.  I always complain that it is hard to find good BBQ meat in the grocery store because the restaurants get the good cuts.  I think they bought their brisket from Walmart.  Brisket is a very low end piece of meat that can become a fantastic, flavorful piece when smoked properly. This was not done properly at all.  It did not even taste smoked, it tasted like it was steamed in a crock pot.  Pulled pork was really, really dry and the sauces are average.

Will not be back."

We were heartbroken, but optimistic because a new BBQ place was going to open with the same owner. I have to say, I&#39;ve tried Smokin Pit a few times and maybe it&#39;s because I used to live downtown and had good BBQ readily available, but this place is mediocre at best.

Pulled pork was dry.

Creamy coleslaw was meh. Looked like it was from a bag.
Corn bread was very good. Best I&#39;ve had in the area BBQ joints.
Sweet BBQ sauce is not a sweet BBQ sauce. Not sure what it is. And the Tangy sauce is....weird. That&#39;s your only two choices.

I would say that these were the worst ribs that I had in the Chicago area yet.  The ribs are the fall off the bone type.  But they were so overcooked that I needed a spoon do get them off the plate.  It was a mess.  The cole slaw tasted exactly like Jewel cole slaw, so nothing special there.  When I first entered, I asked for the rib special to dine in.  The cook placed a premade order in a plastic container on a server tray and marched it to the cashier.  I told the lady I wanted it for here and charged me $18 for the ribs and cole slaw.  I questioned her how she got that amount and then changed the amount 2 seconds later.  I&#39;m not sure if the ribs are supposed to be smoked here or not but there was NO smoked flavor of any sort.  The interior is cute but when I went there, the pop machine was leaking something all over the floor and it was a mess.  Overall, there are MUCH better choices in the area and if you like smoked meats, I would look towards Chucks Southern, Baby Black Blues or Firewater BBQ in Crest Hill (really good)."

This is owned/ran by Nico from Nicodino&#39;s and that place was just as bad.  This place won&#39;t be in business for that long either, not with their high prices, small portions and dry, cold food.

He has a true passion for sharing his love of authentic Texas BBQ. By the way, don&#39;t forget to try the link sausage...outstanding!"

Went to get extra sauce still couldn&#39;t help. The corn bread was equally dry, maybe stuff was on warmers too    Long?  

Suggest getting some spicy BBQ sauce, the tangy or sweet sauce just wasn&#39;t doing it. Maybe work on reducing the pricing, 20$ for what I got was not worth it."

Upon entering the restaurant my nose was immediately hit with the smell of meat in the smoker. The staff was friendly, productive and helpful. 
First visit: 
I had the pulled chicken and brisket. Both excelled and surpassed my expectations. The pulled chicken was so tender I thought it would melt right there in my mouth. (I can&#39;t even imagine what it tastes like in their sandwich!) The brisket had a perfect smoke ring with the just right amount of a &#34;smokey&#34; taste. For my two sides I chose the sweet potato mashed and Tex-Mex rice. To say the least.. They did not last very long on my tray. 

I got a lot of food for the price I paid. I took the leftovers home for my dad to try....Unfortunately for him it was gone before he got home that night.

Second visit: 
I had the ribs. The meat was unbelievably tender.. The meat fell right off the bone. I was able to choose between either a sweet or tangy sauce to go with it. I couldn&#39;t help but ask for both. It definitely is not your average, sugary thick BBQ sauce. I personally LOVED the unique and different taste (especially the sweet sauce). This time for my sides, I chose Mac and cheese and potato salad. Both were above average. To finish the meal off I bought one of their homemade cookies. All I can say is DO NOT leave without trying! 

The wait for them to open their doors was completely worth it. If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. You can really taste all the effort that is put into their food in every bite. I can&#39;t wait to go this coming Friday with a group of friends from work. Keep it up, can&#39;t wait to try everything else on the menu!"

Everyone was super nice. It was a busy Saturday night. We ordered the nachos with brisket. The brisket was all fat and char. We also got the ribs tips which were WONDERFUL best TIPS ever. Happy they didn&#39;t put any sauce on them.... SIDES we tried the cornbread muffin not bad. Coleslaw not your normal creamy slaw. I didn&#39;t like it but my date did. The mac and cheese needed  salt. Awesome meaty chunky chili. The bbq sauce they have two kinds tangy and sweet we did not like either both are heated and both lacked flavor. That&#39;s why I was happy they didn&#39;t put it on my meat. I was going to give more stars but with the inconsistencies I had to give 3. Now to add a few words the sandwiches that we saw others eating looked so good and we will go back for the cold ones. They also have wine and beer which is a little bonus.

With a drink it came to $16. Not a bad price for all that was given. The Mac and cheese, mashed sweet potato and corn bread were all pretty good. The brisket was fatty and bland. And had absolutely no smoke taste.  In fact there was no bark on the meat like a good smoke brisket should have. A great brisket should stand on its own but this one needed sauce to give it some flavor. Too bad. I would like a great bbq place near by."

The drink island cuts the room in half so no one can navigate around it to get to seating or the bathrooms from seats if anyone is getting a drink. 

The sides were good, I had Potato salad and cold slaw and my kids had Mac n cheese. My husband got fries that were just ok since they are cooked ahead and kept in a warming bin.

Lots of people seem to love the pulled chicken so I got it. It was incredibly juicy but I prefer more of a BBQ chicken so I wouldn&#39;t  order it again. Others with me had brisket which was really good. They were out of pulled pork, so we didn&#39;t get to try. 

If they just took down the industrial pipe that herds people along the order counter the layout would be better and it would alleviate the connection at the drink station where everyone has to pass to get in and out of the seating area. 

Maybe the video gaming nook brings in or will bring in a ton of money but to me they could make the dine-in experience much better by sticking to being a restaurant and use the gaming space for more seating.

We&#39;ll try it again as take out but the hassle of navigating the space discourages me from wanting to dine-in."

Like many area residents, I&#39;ve been patiently awaiting the opening of this restaurant in hopes of having a truly good local BBQ experience.  As a background, I do consider myself a BBQ snob - but I am accepting of any valid BBQ offering; even if it&#39;s outside of my taste preference.

My daughter and I visited for dinner last evening around 6 p.m. and overall we were very disappointed and don&#39;t plan on returning anytime soon.

First the positives -
When we walked in, the restaurant wasn&#39;t too crowded, had a pleasant atmosphere, and a pleasant smell of bbq smoke in the air.  Service was prompt and they prepared the plates in front of you as you ordered.

The reason for the 1-star is squarely due to the quality of food.  My daughter ordered the pull pork sliders and I had a 2-meat dinner consisting of pulled pork, beef brisket and sides of baked beans and potato salad.

The pork had a hint of smoke - but not much flavor.  The real problem was it was extremely dry (both on my dinner and daughter&#39;s sandwich).  If I were to guess, the pork shoulder was smoked earlier in the day and shredded early in the afternoon.  The moisture had since left and the meat was luke warm at best.  Of course this could be helped with the sauce...but not a true fix.  A suggestion would be to leave your shoulders whole until right before serving...it will maintain heat/moisture better.  (Some folks will add some type of sauce after shredding...but that is more of a regional flare)

The brisket....well it was just an embarrassment.  Perhaps it was just an off night.  Clearly it was an entire brisket that was cooked with the fat cap on.  Unfortunately it was not cooked/bbq very well.  There was a smoke ring - but the fat had not rendered out and the brisket had not &#34;tightened up&#34;.  The pieces that I served were probably 75% fat and 25% meat.  This is not quality bbq brisket in any part of the country I know about.  My guess is the pit master tried a speed version of cooking the brisket and just didn&#39;t give it enough time.  The brisket was moist...but really just greasy with that amount of fat.  The sauce couldn&#39;t help it.

Baked beans were very disappointing.  The flavor profile was more of a Texas/chilli  baked bean which isn&#39;t my favorite...but the real problem was I was given almost completely sauce and no beans.  This was just a mistake by the server I&#39;m sure.

I do compliment the potato salad.  Not sure if it is made fresh or purchased...but liked it nonetheless.

I&#39;m not a fan of the plastic cups for drinks, or the utensil dispensers mounted to the wall..but I get it that the owners are probably expecting mass volumes and wanted to be able to move people through.

Last suggestion - get yourself some sweet tea.   

Actually, my more constructive criticism is to focus on quality of your BBQ.  You have a good location, nice restaurant design, and the timing is right for a good BBQ restaurant in the area.  However, diners around here are pretty finicky and are not going to pay top $ for low quality BBQ."

First of all, I think the brisket has improved dramatically. It&#39;s a *lot* more juicy and flavorful. I don&#39;t know if they changed the recipe, but it is markedly better (and it was pretty good before!) The pulled pork had a lot more flavor as well. Overall, I think this is a great addition to Bartlett. They also added a third sauce option--&#34;spicy&#34;--and it&#39;s very good."

My husband got the ribs. Chewy and somehow overcooked and undercooked at the same time. He ordered a full slab. Over half went in the garbage. He only ate that much cause he didn&#39;t wanna throw an entire meal he paid for away. 
I got the bbq brisket sandwich. It&#39;s hard to say how the brisket was, cause my sandwich was over half fat chunks. Nothing more appealing than dissecting your dinner before eating it to try to make half an edible sandwich. 
Sadly, our order was a to go order, so we discovered all of this once we were home. If eating at the establishment I would have promptly returned my fat sandwich to the counter. 
The mac &amp; cheese? Your basic boxed stuff from the grocery store? Corn bread? Pretty sure that came from the 3/$1 mix you can but with some corn thrown in. I so wanted this place to be good. I eagerly was waiting for the coming soon signs that I drove by daily to say open now. What a disappointment. Save your money folks."

Upfront I will say I was very disappointed overall and am unlikely to go back based on food taste alone.  I had a combo with sliced brisket, sausage, and pulled pork.  The sides I had were corn bread, chili, and mac &amp; cheese.

Let&#39;s start with the good, their sausage was actually very flavorful with crispy casing.  The corn bread is good but a little dense and the chili/mac &amp; cheese both were good, though nothing special and made with basic flavors.  Now the bad, the brisket which is a measure I benchmark all BBQ joints was awful.  It was very dry and had little to no seasoning.  It also has no smoke flavor whatsoever and basically tasted like overlooked pot roast.  The pulled pork was moist which is good, but literally had no seasoning and again, no smoke flavor.

The last good thing was their sauce.  Unfortunately for them, Riverside BBQ opened in St Charles which is much closer to me and the food was far superior."

Initially I ordered brisket and sausage but was told they were out of sausage. (at 1100AM??)  So I ordered the pulled chicken.  Brisket was good, chicken was....OK.  I wouldn&#39;t get it again.  Tangy sauce looks like water as the server doused the meat and tasted like nothing really.  Corn muffin was soggy so I only ate the top half.  Mac and cheese didn&#39;t taste homemade, but processed. Onion rings (awesome fried rings but you only get three!?!?)  Yep, three.  

Service was great and restaurant seating looks cool.  Overall, I think they need to see the feedback from their customers and fine tune some things.  OK food but too expensive to bring the family of 5.  

Good luck BBQPIT."

The brisket wsas good, not quite as tender as I&#39;ve had other places, but great smokey flavor, great smoke ring, and seasoned well. The pulled chicken however was a surprise! It was recommended by one of the employees and it was juicy, tasty, smokey, and just amazing. The pulled pork was missing something. The bark was nice with a decent smokey flavor, but the flavor just wasn&#39;t mixed throughout. Only suggestion is how they serve it. It seems that they leave the pork butt/shoulder whole and pull chunks as they serve it. I think it would be better if they shredded it and let it mix together in the juices and bark and let all that exterior flavor meld together with the inner meat. Either way, GREAT BBQ joint in the Bartlett area finally and I will definitely be coming back."

I arrived at 4:45 pm to beat the dinner crowd as I expected to find them quite busy. The order line moved slowly but that wasn&#39;t terrible as I needed time to scan the menu. When the customer two spots ahead of me got to order he was told that they&#39;d run out of beef brisket. Really? Four hours after they opened their doors? Ok. When the customer in front if me placed his order he was told they were out of ribs and that it would be at least an hour before more were ready. Well, so much for my order! I had to come up with a plan B pretty quick. I ordered a pulled chicken sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. They seemed pretty small for an $8 item that only came with potato chips. Not to mention that I didn&#39;t receive any chips with my order. Both sandwiches were good. I tried both of their BBQ sauces. The Tangy was ok and the Sweet was not ok and both were kind of thin and watery. I ordered two sides with my sandwiches; fries and onion rings. As I walked down their production line toward the register I told no less than three people about my side orders as it seemed to me that they were made to order. The cashier (very nice) rang me up as a second cashier bagged my food. As the cashier hands me my change and bag of food at no time have I seen the fries and rings emerge from the kitchen. I checked the bag to be sure. When I asked the cashiers about the fries and rings they just looked at each other like, huh? After telling 4 different people about the side orders, were they all under the impression they would magically materialize in my bag? 

We can chalk up the missing brisket and ribs to the opening day surge of excited customers - maybe. 

We can chalk up the missing chips to I don&#39;t know what. 

We can chalk up the forgotten sides orders to an operational miscommunication - or an opening day wrinkle to be ironed out. 

I will try again for the ribs in the near future. 

Three Stars - rough around the edges for opening day."

as I said chili was just ok. It seemed to lack flavor but after all this is not a chili house, so that&#39;s fine. as far as their sauces go I would have to say they were rather mediocre. they have the traditional hot, medium and sweet sauce that most barbecue places have, but none of them really jump out at you. at best I would say they&#39;re just OK. I know this is quite personal and just a matter of taste that varies from person to person so of course this is just IMHO. but beyond the quality of the meat the reason I go to a barbecue place is primarily because I like their sauce, that&#39;s what makes a barbecue place special in my opinion. this area needs some work. so all in all I think the quality of their food is pretty good although I did not try the beef just a chicken, however if I went back again I think I might have to bring my own sauce to avoid mediocrity. and yes, I understand the difference between a Texas sauce and say st. Louis or Memphis style .  I love a good vinegar based sauce , but in my opinion their sauce is the weakest point of review here and definitely need some work.

also, this time around, I found the staff to be much more attentive and they seem to understand English a little better. have to believe that&#39;s the work of a conscientious manager recognizing the short coming."

Very cozy place awesome service and to me I&#39;ve been back twice and both times I&#39;ve tried the pulled chicken and absolutely loved it.  These guys take pride in there food and service and I think as local patrons we need to fully support them.  We need small businesses in Bartlett to survive and they have a good concept.  The sweet potato mash was very good and not commercialized tasting if that makes sense to you. The grilled vegetables are perfect.  Both sauces are perfect.  My 4 year old son even loves there pulled pork which is a huge plus.  The owners have spend a pretty penny in this place and I hope we all can rally and mark them successful .

To our surprise this place was delicious. Our group tried the brisket..very good, the pulled pork with tangy sauce great. We also tried some sides: corn bread is ok it  needs a bit more interest... maybe a fancy maple butter?? Coleslaw creamy ( excellent) French fries nice crunch.They do offer soda and beer, nice selection. VERY friendly staff and clean !! Awesome new find in our area :-)"

I&#39;m averaging mine &amp; hubbys rating. Place is beautiful and spotless! Great decor upgrade to fit the theme. Nicodinos always had good food but was too slow to fit into a quick 40 minutes. 

Husband had the brisket and was head over heels! I thought the taste was good but it was too dry for my liking. Sides of corn, potato salad, cole slaw, cornbread. Nothing special about them but good. 

I had the pulled pork. Huge portions, but also really clever serving platters. $34 for us both with drinks so it&#39;s not exactly cheap but where else is there BBQ this close?

The sauces are what disappointed me. Don&#39;t mind the thin ones but they didn&#39;t pack much punch. I like my pulled pork braised in the sauce. I didn&#39;t care for the tangy and the sweet tasted a lot like lime. I would love to see a more hickory/tomato based, heavier sloppy, get all over your face sauce. 

Overall a good experience but I would stick to the sandwiches instead of the monster portions. Agree with previous reviews that many of the items come off as dry. Looking forward to trying some of the other meats!

Made a mental note to myself to pay a visit and glad I got around to it. 

First off, let me tell you how beautiful this fast casual restaurant is. Country music as you enter and the seating area is wonderfully themed. Once again, the aroma of smoked meats fills the air. 

I ordered the sliced brisket with beans and mashed sweet potatoes and a corn bread muffin. Brisket is phenomenal, almost comparable to the Weber Grill. As mentioned in a previous post, the sides a very minimalistic. Not a bad thing at all, just perhaps not as sweet (i.e, sweet potatoes) as one might imagine. Beans were also more on the spicy? side, the the sweet kind that one might prepare at home. The corn bread was absolutely phenomenal, best I&#39;ve had in a while. 

Overall, SPBBQ provided a delicious lunch in a wonderfully themed setting with friendly staff and great portions. Granted you might have to pay a few extra bucks compared to other restaurants, but it is definitely worth it."

If I had my way, the world would be vegan!  Every restaurant would be vegan.  No meat anywhere!  Alas, my utopia simply does not exist.  I live in the real world where friends and others want to eat at places of their choosing so that is how I ended up at Michael&#39;s Dawg House.  No need to panic people,  Vegans be quite crafty and make do!  At least this one does!  I have now been to Michael&#39;s THREE times, and here is why...

Walked up to the counter, Mike himself was there taking orders.  I immediately told him of my dietary needs and he was not quite sure what to offer.  But being a &#34;professional&#34; vegan I knew what to ask for.  I told him I wanted a hot dog bun with everything on it but the hot dog.  What?  No odd looks?  No comments about me not knowing what I am missing?  Ahhh, I loved this place already.  Mike was a true gem, instructed his staff to make what I asked for and was not offended when I asked if the FRESH CUT french fries were fried in lard or vegetable oil.  He truly was concerned about my needs and made sure that even a vegan would leave satisfied at a hot dog place!  The Unhot dog was just as I liked, delicious.  But the star of the food basket was my fresh cut french fries.  YUMMMMMMM!!!!!!!

Fast forward a few weeks, I was back in the area and I walked in and there was Mike at the register taking orders again.  Without hesitation he said, &#34;hey its the vegan&#34;.  Now that is what I call customer service.  

Go to Michael&#39;s Dawg House is you want good food.  Go if you want good service.  Go if you want to support a local small business.  Whatever the reason, just GO!"

The Merkt&#39;s cheddar was awesome as usual and was especially great as the cheese on their cheddar charburger. The burger reminded me of something between the first Whopper I ever had and the burgers we used to be able to get at Hot Dog Richie&#39;s- thick flame grilled burger patty with plenty of tomato, onion, and mayo to round it out. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the bun as it didn&#39;t quite hold together to the last bite, but it was close enough.

My buddy said the gyro was solid as well and liked the crispy edges they were able to cook into the edges but there could have been a bit more onion and tomato added to the platter- I&#39;m sure I just had to ask and they would have given more.

Price was as expected but the fry and gyro platter portions seemed a bit smaller than you&#39;d expect. All in all, it was a pleasant first trip with good, quick, cooked to order food and friendly staff. I&#39;ll definitely be back again for another Merkt&#39;s fix soon!"

Tried Michael&#39;s for the first time today- went with my husband.  He got two dogs and a large fry, I got the Char Polish with mustard and onions.  Husband, who is notoriously picky, loved the dogs and the fries, I refused to stay OUT of his fries they were that good, and I can&#39;t think of one restaurant other than this one where I&#39;ve ordered a Polish, and actually FINISHED it! Normally, I&#39;ve had about enough after 1/2 a sandwich or so from other restaurants, but not here.  Perfect char, perfect onion and mustard ratio - bun was perfect - best lunch we&#39;ve had in ages!!

It&#39;s a cryin&#39; shame that they are located so close to my house and that I&#39;m lucky enough to work from home - before long, they&#39;re going to be SO SICK of seeing us all the time!   I hope they&#39;re here FOREVER or as close to it as possible!!

Restaurant: 

The place is small and parking is not clear, but there is plenty of places to park and I was getting carry out so it wasn&#39;t a big deal. When I went in there was one table with people at it and no line no waiting at the counter. 

The restaurant itself is quaint and inviting, the decor reminds you of a Hot Dog place and you can smell the beef hot dogs that have been or are being cooked (This is a good thing, I love that smell). 

The Menu is really high up and too close to the counter so as a 6&#39;00&#34; guy, I have to arch my neck and stand against the back wall to read the menu. There are a couple of items that I was unsure what they were but the staff was friendly and eager to assist. 

Staff:
The guy who ran the register was a high school kid who was fast, friendly, and personable. He efficiently took my order and passed it along and then correctly gave me change (which considering the register didn&#39;t just tell him how much to give back was good to see). as my food cooked he made small talk until another customer came in. 

Michael himself was making my food which was nice to see an owner taking interest. He too was very personable and made small talk while things cooked. 

The Third cook, didn&#39;t look like he knew the menu or how to make items which may have caused issues with product consistency. There were a lot of questions being asked, which seemed odd considering they have been open a few weeks. 

Food:
We ordered a Gyro Sandwich, an Italian Beef with Cheese/ side Jus, Three Layer Fries, and a Pizza Puff. This is where the most improvement needed to come. 

My Wife had the Gyro and she said that it tasted like what she expected but nothing over the top. The sandwich was sloppily put together and over dressed. 

The Pizza Puff, is one puff and is basically a Deep Fried Hot Pocket. it came out really greasy but crisp. I wasn&#39;t a fan, but if you like deep friend hot pockets Im sure you will like this. 

The Italian beef was tasty, it was juicy and a nice sized portion. It did have a couple of spots that had concentrated seasoning which made them very spicy bites but overall the sandwich was ok.

The three layer fries we not a good choice for traveling. The sour cream was not portioned correctly which made for soggy spots, the cheese tasted very gritty, and the fries themselves were very soggy. (My wife said under seasoned, but I thought they were plenty salty). The bacon was very good. Next time I go, i will pass on this. 

Value:
We paid about $20 for all of that food. So not terrible, but not super cheap either. 

Overall:
The one thing this place has going for it is a good location for me. it is pretty close. But it is in some crazy competition in the immediate area that it will need to overcome to be successful. Photo&#39;s Hotdogs, Brandt&#39;s Burgers, Kosta&#39;s Gyros, Tore and Luke&#39;s Beef Sandwiches... they are all really close and not that far off in price. 

I really hope this place succeeds because it is super close, and the people are very friendly. I like this business, but the food quality has to go up and the prices might need to come down a smidge."

Soda machine is the traditional type. They haven&#39;t upgraded to the new &#34;make your own drink&#34; machines that you&#39;re starting to see in more places. You should give this place a try.

But, if you aren&#39;t too lazy to go in you will be  paid back for your effort with the best fries in the suburbs! Fresh cut, skin on, best tasting fries ever! They remind me of my favorite beef place in Chicago. Now I don&#39;t have to drive all the way there to have them. So, get out and get to this place...you wont be disappointed!"

The cheddar burger was almost as good as Paradise Pup and I would give it a 4/5, but the reason my overall rating is a 5/5 is because of the fresh cut french fries.

Received food at 8:30, two hours it took and we live less then one mile away. You can tell the food sat there for an hour till it was delivered at least. I never have been so disgusted with the food delivered to us from any place and the lack of service offered. I called at 8pm to inform them that I placed an order at 6:28pm was curious on the status. To be told that the driver didn&#39;t take the order originally when it was supposed to be delivered and left. Still patient cause I understand things happen I accepted the answer and still was looking forward to trying this place. I open the cheese fries the cheese was disgusting and hardened from sitting there. Hamburgers cold. The chilli cheese dog was a disaster as the cheese had pretty much soaked into the entire bun leaving it soggy and cheese was also cold. Shakes where liquid. Onion rings hard. pizza pockets over cooked. Unfortunately what a let down to my family and I. I am beyond disgusted. If you knew that food was sitting for how long be a good owner toss the food do the right thing and start over. It&#39;s only fair we spent almost 60 bucks and guess what we tossed everything out. Ruined our evening as a family because unfortunately a night we took to order in was ruined and money wasted."

I did like that all 3 were included with take out (not every place does that).

Had lunch here for my mom&#39;s birthday. I&#39;m really not sure why she wanted to come here when I offered several other nice places. Hell, even Royal Buffet or Chef Pings would have made more sense! I think she just wanted good Korean Restaurant food, but oh well. 

This place confused the crap out of me. It runs like the food court at Assi or H-Mart. You go up there, look at the pictures of food, order what you want, pay right away, and then wait for them to call your number to go pick up food at the window. Then when you&#39;re done, you put it back. 

Now, I see why this works at a food court, but this is a freaking standalone restaurant! It&#39;s like they think the food court style of serving is a real seller or something! Am I too old to appreciate this? You know, in Korea, in the markets, there&#39;re tiny little tent restaurants all over the place with like 2-3 tables. They don&#39;t have any space, so they all specialize in something. One tent does tteokbokki, and pretty much only serves that with a couple sides. One tent does ho-tteok, etc. Sure, they run food court style too, but people don&#39;t go there because they want to listen for their name and go get their food. They do it because, for some reason, the food there is AWESOME, and they&#39;ll deal with any inconveniences to get the food...well, at least for tourists like me it&#39;s awesome. 

TTEOKBOKKI
The tteok is very soft and easy to split by squeezing with your chopstick. The sauce has a little kick, but it&#39;s also a bit sweet. I actually got Rabokki, which is the same thing, but add ramen noodles. That was my favorite part, back in the Kokiri Mandu days! The kick, though, wasn&#39;t something that you tasted throughout, but more it sorta hit on its way out. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of that, but nothing wrong. It&#39;s not bad, but not anything special either.

JJOLMYEON
Ever since Senoya left, Chicago has had a void where their jjolmyeon used to be. Jjolmyeon isn&#39;t something I&#39;d order for myself. Even back in the Kokiri days, someone used to order it for the purpose of sharing, while we&#39;d eat other entrees. I thought maybe, we found a place that could fill the void, but nope. Their jjolmyeon has all the right ingredients, but something about isn&#39;t prepared quite right. Sure, you have to mix it yourself, but it wasn&#39;t cold enough and flavors weren&#39;t quite infused enough. Some bites just tasted like plain noodle.

CHUL PAN JAE YOOK
I&#39;ve never heard it said this way, but it&#39;s basically thinly sliced marinated pork. It tasted pretty good! I actually got some pretty good pork flavors in the meat, and the marinade was pretty spot on. It was spicy, salty, maybe even a little sweet, but also savory! That went so well with the rice! For the price, this is a pretty good deal, because I got a decent serving!

MOOL NENGMYUN
I&#39;m not sure if they pre-vinegared it but I didn&#39;t have to add any! That worries me a bit, because not everyone likes the same amount of vinegar. It also tasted like it wasn&#39;t just straight vinegar, and it was maybe some apple vinegar or one of those weird things. It tasted ok, just that there was a barely noticeable fruity persuasion in it. Also, this should be served ICE cold, like...with ice! It was cold, but just not enough to fully enjoy it. Again, this wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t anything special either. 

BIBIMBAP
I&#39;m not sure how you can really make bad bibimbap. You get rice, vegetables, cook some bulgogi, add gochujang and sesame oil, voila! The things that make it is what you decide goes in it, and the quality of those veggies. Well, uh,, everything here was just standard, and tasted fine.

DON&#39;T GO GOOMA
Even though it got 3 stars, the whole experience was more of a 2. None of the food was impressive, but that&#39;s what I expect at Korean food courts in Chicago. Just like food courts, you don&#39;t get any banchan either, except 1 - kakdoogi. I&#39;d rather go to Assi or HMart. This is a waste of time."

Did the 24oz Porterhouse. Grilled nice on the outside but raw to rare inside (ordered MedRare). Took most of it home and finished the cook low and slow on my weber, It was excellent! The Allen Brother&#39;s Prime meat is really good!! Also had the horseradish mashed which could have used something to make it a bit creamier/moister. The desert, bread pudding was excellent!

First off, I took my parents here and my aunt visiting from Korea. They live in the Schaumburg area. First bad experience, it took over 20 minutes (!!!!!!) for someone to come to our table. No water. No bread. No NOTHING. FOR 20 MINUTES!!!!! This is supposed to be one of the best steakhouses? Come on man. Customer service at steakhouses have to be the best. And this place was awful. 

Whoever our waiter was, was clearly the biggest jerk out there. He didn&#39;t even explain the specials. Didn&#39;t even offer us drinks. Do you want my honest opinion? I think this place is racist. They see 4 asians walking in, not wearing a suit and they just assume we are poor or something. That&#39;s the vibe I got all night. Guess what you stuck up hostess and waiters. I probably make more money than everyone that worked at the hostess table combined. 

Food was ruined by the terrible customer service. The food didn&#39;t even come out in a timely manner. As we left, there was no thank you&#39;s. There was no have a nice day. There was no apology. 

I strongly do not recommend this place. This chain. This disgusting establishment. PLEASE GO TO A DIFFERENT STEAKHOUSE. I RATHER GO TO OUTBACK THEN THIS SORRY DISGUSTING RACIST ESTABLISHMENT."

A picture of what we got home with is attached.  A very shabby end to an otherwise great in house experience. You can see we don&#39;t penny pinch and we were very disappointed that Mortons DID on our way out. 

The creme brulee resembled a thin pancake (a very thin pancake) and was minimally a portion for one, let alone something to curl up and share as we always would.

You know how it feels when you go through a drive thru only to get home, unload the sack only to find that they forgot to give you the special something your daughter requested and it&#39;s too far to go back.......it was all that after a more significant contribution to revenue.  :-(

This is a decent sized Morton&#39;s with a nice slightly smaller bar area than I have seen at other restaurants.  The place is very dark and dimly lit, which I kind of like, but if you like bright, open restaurants, this is not the place for you.

The service here was spot on from the moment I got there.  Though I was dressed up in my Sunday&#39;s best, t-shirt, shorts and a hat, they did not turn their nose on me.  I sat at the bar and received prompt efficient service.  I ordered a bottle of wine (yes for myself, Chateau Greysac 2009).   They have a decent wine selection, though the main focus is around California wines.  The California wines were priced rather high, especially some of the better known wineries.  I would like to see some more other regions represented.  Some more French and some really good value Chilean wines.  Most people are going to drink red wine (Cabernet and Cabernet blends) and I think they could do a better job providing other options.

For dinner I had the Five Peppercorn Rubbed Prime Rib Steak.  This was cooked to perfection!     This is what you expect from a high end steak joint.  Was the price high, no doubt, but you know that going into a Morton&#39;s.  But I would gladly pay for that steak each and every time.

Overall, this is a solid Morton&#39;s.  Great staff and great food.  The wine menu could use some work.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love California reds, I &#39;grew&#39; up on them, but they could add bigger and better selection of reds from other Old and New World regions."

My friend and I actually gave up trying to eat them and left half of our ribeyes on the plates. When the waiter asked us how were the steaks, we told him that they were tough and chewy. Adding insult to the injury, he asked us if we wanted boxes to take the rest of our steaks home. 

That did it for me: the lack of interest in our disappointment. I did not expect a freebie out of this -- that&#39;s not my style. But an apology or an explanation as to why two, $60 each, medium rare ribeyes had the consistency of linoleum, would have been nice, considering that our table pulled in a $450 tab.

There are quite a few places to enjoy a decent steak in the Chicagoland area. Morton&#39;s is not one of them."

I had the 5 peppercorn prime rib steak, ordered it rare. Came out walking, loved it! The peppercorns made a beautiful crust. My partner ordered the bone ribeye. His was just seasoned with salt and pepper and it was delicious. 
The server offered a soufflé for our dessert while we eat, they would bake it. I&#39;m like yes please! First time for that too. It was light fluffy and hot. The creme sauce they pour over it was a beautiful addition."

The service was excellent and our server was very attentive and my water also got refilled a billion times which was appreciated because I was very thirsty.  I enjoyed the tuna tartar appetizer and the salmon for the main course.  The food was excellent!  The horseradish mashed potatoes were one of my favorite things.

Who doesn&#39;t know Morton&#39;s? They were at one time the primo name for steakhouse. Then, they got sold and became a chain you can find at every corner of the earth. Sad, really. This isn&#39;t Alexander The Great&#39;s time where conquering the world is the thing to do. Nowadays, when you conquered the world, you became sort of generic. They have Morton&#39;s in Singapore for fuck sake.

Nevertheless, I had some long lasting love with Morton&#39;s starting from the days before they sold out. I had been to many of the locations in Chicago area: the two in the city, Rosemont, Naperville, and Schaumburg. My brother actually got married and had a small ceremony and reception at the one in Naperville. However, I frequented the one in Schaumburg the most.

It was because of my company did a lot of corporate dinners there since it was conveniently located and they had nice private rooms. We ate there so much for various events, we got to know the staff pretty well. I would never forget Sonya and if you ever needed private dining services, go call her. She rocks! 

What I love about Morton&#39;s are: 1) the onion bread. Delicious! It&#39;s a whole round bread, warm, soft, and taste wonderful. 2) shrimps alexander - big plump crustaceans covered in breadcrumbs and butter. Mhmhmh....my friend Tina used to go nuts for this shrimps. 3) the steak are great. I&#39;ve had better now but it still ain&#39;t bad. 4) chocolate lava cake or the soufflé - love their desserts. They had the lava cake before anyone else and before it became &#34;the dessert.&#34; They still do it well.

They also have happy hours and offer $5 plates or something cheap like that. Unbelievable because you would get pretty outstanding food for the price. It was awesome! They had filet sliders, shrimp cocktails, etc among others. It&#39;s great for a first date venue during happy hours as their clienteles are usually classy and quiet so you could actually enjoy nice drinks and food at a cool place but wouldn&#39;t cost you your whole pay check. I had my first date with my last hot romance here at Morton&#39;s Schaumburg. It was a fun fantastic night and he was smoldering hot. The small plates were great as frankly I was so nervous I would barf if I ate a big hunka steak. I just took the hunk with me. 

Morton&#39;s is known for this pig lantern on every table. I at one time really loved pig stuff. I would collect some pink pig stuffed animals and other oink oink crap. Sonya gave me the Morton&#39;s pig keychain when she found out about my pig fetish. I still have it and I thought it was so nice of her.

It has been awhile since my last visit to Morton&#39;s. Gosh, now it sounded like confession. However, I probably would hurry back here sooner than seeing my priest to confess my sins. Though it became a thing of the past for me, it still has a special place in my heart for all the good food and fun I had with friends and loved ones right here at Morton&#39;s. However, like Catholic church, the mass will go on without me, and it will stay just as rich."

The host stand seems a bit disorganized as they were sorting through tickets while the line backed up.  We were greeted and seated a few minutes later.  They acknowledged my birthday by having a custom printed menu for the table, which was quite special.  However, then it just went downhill from there.

Our server first introduced himself as Gustavo.  Then at the end of the SAME conversation said his name is Mark.  Um.  So who are you?  Ok, this really wasn&#39;t an issue, but it was just odd.  He also laid the normal menu on top of the birthday menus (which is the same menu, but without the Happy Birthday on it).  He never acknowledged my birthday.  More on this later.  Also, my bread plate was dirty and crusty.  Um, thanks.

Then we come to find out that there is no kid&#39;s menu for my well-behaved 8 year old.  We have gone to similar restaurants (Capital Grille, Fleming&#39;s, Sullivan&#39;s, Joe&#39;s, etc.) and they all have either secret kid&#39;s menus or they can create something for kids.  Not Morton&#39;s.  He would have to order directly off the grown-up menu or the bar menu.  We asked for the mac n cheese minus onions.  Nope, cannot get no onions because they are premade!  For a $13 side, you&#39;re just warming up something you made the day before???  So we ended up ordering a prosciutto wrapped mozzarella appetizer as my son&#39;s main entree.  What the description doesn&#39;t tell you is that $15 gets you 3 pieces.  That&#39;s $5 for each piece of cheese.

But what about the food?? We ordered the Ahi Tuna Tower and that was delicious, but with a caveat.  The fried wontons were a bit odd because there were already crushed fried wontons in the stack...seemed like they used that as a filler.  We also ordered the Filet Mignon and a Shrimp Alexander.  Both were fine.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  It seems like the quality of the steaks have gone down since they modernized all the Morton&#39;s.  The filet lacked flavor and wasn&#39;t melt-in-your mouth tender that I come to expect out of filets at high end steakhouses.  Maybe it has to do with the Landry&#39;s ownership, but I don&#39;t know.  Anyway, we got a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Broccoli was a bit underdone and crunchy.  I had a chocolate souffle for dessert and it came with creme anglais.  It probably would have been better if it came a la mode instead because the creme anglais made the souffle into one goopy mess.

When I paid, I redeemed my birthday reward from Landry&#39;s, and again, no birthday acknowledgement.  Not even a candle on the desserts that I paid for.  I would not return - at least not with Gustavo-Mark-whoknows as your server.  No manager ever stopped by the table either.  There are soooo many better steakhouses in the area.

Good:
The food was excellent, NY Strip Steak prepared perfectly, grilled asparagus with a balsamic demi-glace, twice baked scalloped potatoes... Probably the best steak I have ever had.

Bad:
Mortons is completely missing the boat on beer. Beer (from Europe) has a long history and has the sophistication of wine. The decent beer list amounted to Sierra Nevada Torpedo and Orval. I ordered an Orval for 14.00....

The bottle came to me near freezing, should be around 50 degrees. It was served in a flute glass, which resulted in an awful pour from the bartender that was literally half foam. It should be served in a goblet or tulip, and the guy should be trained on how to treat beer. 

I understand that 10-15 years ago nobody cared about beer and Bud was king (bud and the other american light lagers are served at near freezing temperatures so you cannot taste them because they are awful), so Mortons could get away with not putting in the effort, but times have changed."

We asked for them and then they removed the regular menus which maybe we would&#39;ve liked to have kept in retrospect.

We generally do not go to steakhouses because we do not feel they are a good value. We can buy an excellent steak at Costco or another store and grill it at home for 1/3 to 1/4 of the price.

So we decided to go for restaurant week because one of the entrées offered was a 6 ounce filet which normally is priced at $39. We figured for an additional $5 you would get a pretty good value for that entrée an appetizer and dessert.

We had not been in a Morton&#39;s for years but this one looked like the progression in time one would expect - dark, clubby atmosphere but it also had a lot of metal and black or gray wood and surfaces which was a little more contemporary than usual old-time steakhouses that have deep rich brown wood and red leather.

We chose Caesar salad, spinach salad with warm bacon dressing and the tuna tower. We can definitely say that these were smaller portions than off of the à la carte menu. We saw many Ahi Tuna Towers go by that had at least three times the tuna that mind did. Normally priced at $17 I would&#39;ve paid $10 or $11 for the one I received so were still above the normal pricing. 

The 6 oz filet was good but they did not offer any kind of sauces or crusting on it.

The side dishes were limited to creamed corn, horseradish mashed potatoes or broccoli with hollandaise sauce. Hollandaise was bland, the broccoli was perfectly cooked however.

For dessert the Grand Marnier souffle was good but not great. The top seemed like it&#39;d been sitting around for a while and not crusty and the inside was not hot. The creme brûlée was excellent with crisp sugar topping and creamy custard.

Our server Mia was attentive but not overly so. Her voice was a little hard to hear. 

We would probably not return until next Restaurant Week."

Our server brought us a cart where we got to choose the cut we wanted. It was fresh and the dry aged marbling really came through for us.
I ordered my steak medium rare and it was just that. It had a crisp crust and it really sealed the juices and flavour of the steak.
I also had the garlic butter on the steak with their season mushrooms and Mac and cheese.
What I loved most about Morton&#39;s was that each side was a meal on it&#39;s own and so my wife and I literally feasted. We shared a nice bottle of Shiraz, shared a Chicago style cheesecake and left feeling completely satisfied.

Unfortunately, I went there for a seminar with about 50 other people to get a demo of some new software from a potential vendor. So, this was not a traditional Morton&#39;s experience.

That all being said, Morton&#39;s is certainly nice. The seminar was from 11am to 1pm on a Wednesday, so when I arrived, there was no one seated in the dining room yet. I was taken back into a meeting room where tables were set up and video monitors were pervasive throughout the room.

I&#39;ll avoid talking about the seminar and focus on the food and service. There were ample servers who were very attentive in bringing the drink of your choice. Mine happens to be a Vodka Martini, up, but I didn&#39;t see anyone else ordering alcohol so I stuck with Coke. (They serve Coke products at Morton&#39;s.) My glass was always full - sometimes I didn&#39;t even realize the server had been there. They have mastered the art of refills.

The food was served buffet style. Not being able to tolerate milk products, I was sort of out of luck (but I did cheat to try a few things). They served a Caesar&#39;s salad with fresh sliced Parmesan cheese. They had steak medallions that appeared to be crusted in some sort of cheese. They served a breaded chicken cutlet served with buttered noodles, steamed broccoli (joy) and cheesecake. I took a risk and tried the steak (I scraped off the cheese), a chicken cutlet (no noodles) and the broccoli. Everything was outstanding. Wow. And, this being served as a buffet, now I really want to try the restaurant. The steak was heaven.

Cheesecake was out of the question for me, but it looked fabulous. It had a graham cracker base and was topped with fresh strawberries. I really wish I could have tried it. Oh well, I can have as much cheesecake as I want in my dreams."

On top of the lovely meal, we had incredible service. Our serving staff and hosts were very accommodating. There was one particular individual, however, who went above and beyond for us.  At the end of the evening we discovered that our vehicle&#39;s battery had died, which as most Midwesterners know, is a little more than an inconvenience this time of year. Andy, a valet, searched high and low for a battery pack within the restaurant. Although he was unable to locate one, he took his own jumper cables and drove his vehicle over to give ours a jump.

He was extremely friendly and helpful after what I could imagine was a long night&#39;s work. Even after we offered a tip, he graciously declined and instead wished us a happy holiday.

That night we had a fantastic dinner with delicious food and impeccable service.  I had chosen Morton&#39;s because I had enjoyed dining with them on several prior occasions and I knew what to expect.

Fast forward 10 years...  This is not the same Morton&#39;s.  The building is the same, but that was about the only thing that I recognized. 

I had made reservations for 7:15 on a Sunday (our 10 year wedding anniversary).  We arrived early expecting to have time for a cocktail at the bar, but the hostess just said &#34;no problem&#34; and walked over to another counter leaving us to wonder what she was doing.  I was surprised by the relative emptiness of the tables because when I made the reservation online, there were only two times available.

After about a minute of watching her fiddling with some papers, another man arrived and indicated that we should follow him.  We were seated at one of the classic U shaped booths.  The waiter pulled out the table so my wife would not have to slide around in her dress.  He then handed us menus customized with anniversary wishes complete with our names.

Our waitress, Mia, introduced herself.  We were left with a warm loaf of the delicious onion bread and a wine list.  I was surprised by the absence of Pouilly-Fuisse on the wine list as it has always been my favorite for occasions like this.  I did find a Viognier which we also enjoy.  Then we waited...

In the past the servers worked as a team and you never felt like you waited for anything.  I considered that we had been seated early, but I was still a little frustrated.  I felt like we could not start the evening until the wine arrived.
I asked about the absence of Pouilly-Fuisse and was simply told that indeed there was none on the menu.  No other comment or alternative suggestion was offered.

Once we had the Viognier in hand, our spirits were lifted, but we had yet to be offered the opportunity to order an appetizer.  I like slow relaxing dinners, but they need to get the ball rolling before we settle in for the longer journey.
Speaking of appetizers, the smoked salmon that I so fondly remembered is no longer on the menu.  We went with the lump crab cake and escargot instead.  The crab cake was delicious.  The escargot was small and average tasting.

Knowing that we had a limited carrying capacity for food, we skipped the salad, but my wife wanted the lobster bisque, so our next course was soup.  When Mia noticed that I only ordered one, she gladly offered to split it into two bowls for us.  The bisque was very good and I was glad we tried it.

One small point that I remembered from previous visits was that the servers had a method of discreetly clearing bread crumbs from the table in between courses.  That little detail is apparently no longer part of the service.

For our main course I had the bone-in ribeye and my wife had the 8oz filet... both ordered medium rare.  We chose au gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus for sides.
I was disappointed that the au gratin recipe I used to love is no longer being used.
The filet was as expected... lean and served medium rare as ordered.  My wife loved it, but I have never been a fan of this cut of meat.

The ribeye was served medium rare, but it did not impress me with its taste or texture.  It seemed devoid of the marbling that I love in a ribeye.  It was practically the same as the filet.  Even worse was the tough connective tissue that should have been trimmed off prior to cooking.  I love to savor the grilled fat  in just the right proportion to the meat when eating a ribeye, but this stuff was not that.  I really wanted to like my steak... I was at Morton&#39;s after all, but I have had better ribeyes at other places.

For dessert we had the lemon souffle which we had ordered early to account for the long preparation time.  I had never had it before and it was light and tasty.

We let our meal settle while we finished the evening with Disaronno and coffee.  We were offered refills on our coffee and not rushed out even though they were cleaning up for the night.

I noticed a wide variety of attire.  As this is an occasional splurge for us rather than a weekly dinner, we like to dress up a little.  Apparently Morton&#39;s is not special for others as one patron was seated wearing cargo shorts and sandals.  This is not the fault of the restaurant as I am not sure that I really want them to enforce a dress code, but I do wish people would be more self censoring.

So overall, I had a good time at Morton&#39;s, but I think that had more to do with the company of my beautiful wife and our memories of our engagement.  My steak was  disappointing.  The service was very good and I don&#39;t blame Mia, but I think things have changed from a management point of view that prevent me from regarding Morton&#39;s as highly as I once did.  I felt bad about my long absence, but based on this experience I won&#39;t be rushing back."

Came here for restaurant week. If you don&#39;t know what that is, they have a fixed menu, you pay one fixed price. So for 50 bucks, I got a salad, a cut of filet minon, a baked potato, and a dessert. 

First off the atmosphere is really high class. That&#39;s what they&#39;re going for I guess. I thought a polo would be sufficient but it seemed like most people were dressed up in dress shirts and such. 

My server was great though. Gave me recommendations, always filled my ice tea without me even asking, and always checked to make sure that we were doing alright. My only real complaint was just that it the food came out really slow and spaced apart. Bread came, then 10 minutes passed. Then we ordered and 10 minutes passed. Then the salad came and 10 minutes passed.  Then the main dishes came and we ate. He realized we were done. 10 minutes went by before the dessert finally came out. overall I think we were there for like 2 hours, luckily I had nothing else to do that night.

The food was pretty good. Onion bread, I def had 2 full loafs. Made fresh to your table. The salad was alright. Not sure if it&#39;s worth the 9 dollars it&#39;s worth though. My baked potato was pretty big. The filet mignon I had was pretty good. Not the best steak I&#39;ve ever had but pretty good. Creme brulee was pretty bomb though. 

Overall it was a great experience. Even with it being restaurant week, i spent over $100 for 2 people, so make sure you have some mad money if you&#39;re coming here for a regular visit."

Last time i was here was close to 10 years ago. We came here for my birthday. Our server was excellent! She was very attentive and made sure we were happy. We got a couple of things.

The seared ahi tuni was delicious. When they set the plate down i wish i had some chopsticks. 

We got the mixed grill of 6oz filet mignon with two bacon wrapped scallops and three grilled shrimp. They charge 41 for a 6oz. For another 8 bucks you get the seafood portion so definitely go with the mix grill. This was the perfect portion. The scallop was cooked to perfection. I love scallops but alot of places usually undercook it. The sauces that were paired with it were great.  

We got the 24oz porterhouse with an extra side of truffle oil. Delicious, i was told that wildfires porterhouse was the same quality but wildfire is about 15 dollars cheaper and comes with two sides. So take that how you please.

Overall its an excellent experience, i would definitely come back if i want the superior service. But if i want steak for no special occasion, wildfire would be a more affordable option."

I had the porterhouse cooked medium-rare. Usually, there is a lovely sear on top or grill marks. When I received my steak, it was all that awkward light brown color which says it wasn&#39;t cooked at the right temperature. That color carried throughout the meat and it look so unapatizing.

The meat wasn&#39;t that tender, for a steak that is aged 23-28 days and considered Prime, it cut like something bought from Walmart. Well, I can&#39;t knock Walmart because their steaks are actually pretty good.

What depressed me was that the bill was $160 for two people and my home grilled steaks would have been juicier and tender and I would have saved us $120.

We got a side of sautéed spinach and button mushrooms. They tasted so bland and unimpressive, for $11, the side should have been amazing. It should have had sparklers and felt naughty going down. It should have talked dirty to me and made me blush. What an epic fail, this is not Morton&#39;s, it is a counterfeit like the Apple stores in China. Save your money and go somewhere else.

The service was ok, everyone is really nice. I didn&#39;t feel like drinking but my date had a single glass of wine. When I said I would be sticking to water, I could see the waitresses&#39; face cringe. How rude, our bill still came to $160 and you got a great tip. Don&#39;t be rude because I don&#39;t want to drink and you can&#39;t drive up your bill total. She never came back to check on us either, that was disappointing because I wanted more butter and didn&#39;t get that. What has the world come to when a girl can&#39;t get butter for her steak? I am now going to cry over this because that is how distraught I am."

The big issue we had was with the service and that was pretty bad.  We didn&#39;t expect $50.00 a plate to get us the equivalent of TGI Fridays for an experience.  

Boo had the filet mignon and he enjoyed it but it wasn&#39;t any different than, for example, a filet mignon at Jameson&#39;s.  They charge around $4.00 extra for a sauce and well, there was a drop of it.  

I had a big craving for fish so expecting it to be the best I could get around this area but it was just OK.  The salmon was pretty good but it tasted the same as the samples of cooked salmon you try at a demo in Costco. 


To sum up the food - for the price we weren&#39;t impressed.  

Now, on to the service.  This was AWFUL.  We waited 15 minutes for a menu after being seated.   We got our waters and even after ordering, no one refilled these.  You&#39;d think you might want something to wash down your $50.00 steak?  I guess they don&#39;t think so. 

We won&#39;t be back......"

Morton&#39;s is like the one you marry after you come to terms with letting go of &#34;the one that got away.&#34; Sure, that firecracker was fun, awesome, and incredibly sexy, but for one reason or another, it just wasn&#39;t meant to be. But then you find this other person, who has a lot of those things, but on top of all that, dependable, and let&#39;s be honest, real.

Yes, I&#39;m that pathetic. I just compared a lifelong relationship to a steakhouse. 

I mentioned this in my David Burke&#39;s review, but I&#39;ll mention it here again. Back in, oh, I dunno, 2006, I went to David Burke&#39;s Primehouse for the first time and had the best steak of my life. It was lightyears beyond any steak I&#39;ve ever had. I went back there again several months after, and the steak was just &#34;ok.&#34; Even worse, I went back again about a year afterwards, and all of our steaks were so salty it was almost inedible.

To this day, when people ask for steak suggestions, I still give honorable mention to David Burke&#39;s, but I have to say that Morton&#39;s is, clearly, the best steak in Chicago.

BONE IN RIBEYE
They absolutely pick the best cuts of meat. The marbling on this steak, every time I&#39;ve had it, has been so spot on and so evenly distributed. As long as you avoid the edges, obviously, there is never a bite of just pure fat or a tough stubborn strand of cartilage or anything buzzkill like that. Each bite has a thin lace of fat (jeez, seriously, can we have a more elegant way to say &#34;fat&#34;?) that is never overbearing or in the spotlight, but just adds a moist texture to the rest of the steak as well as a buttery boost in both flavor and seasoning. Every time I&#39;ve had this steak, it&#39;s been seasoned perfectly through and through. There is never a dull bite and like I said before, you never fight with your steak.

If you get a cut of meat this big (I think it&#39;s 20 oz including bone) you really do need to train yourself, because the gold is near the bone, and you could very well end up too full before you get there. I&#39;m a &#34;save the best for last&#34; kinda guy, so I&#39;ll dodge the meat by the bone until the very end. When you get there, you do lose a little bit of seasoning, but the extra flavor is there to take the load. Again, the hard part is really having room to get there.

MORTON&#39;S SALAD
This salad is just nothing short of perfection. It looks completely unassuming, because it&#39;s just lettuce, blue cheese dressing, chopped eggs, and 2 anchovies. Yes, I said anchovies. The stuff even Ninja Turtles won&#39;t eat! When I ordered it, they made sure to ask if I wanted the anchovies. Considering you can just take &#39;em off, I said why not. The salad sans anchovies is still delicious, the dressing isn&#39;t too salty, and every leaf of lettuce is coated perfectly. But when you add a small piece (like the size of a Tylenol gelcap) of anchovie (remember they&#39;re super salty), it explodes this extra flavor and saltiness to your salad. Very light fish taste, well, obviously, but it opened my eyes. From now on, I&#39;m going to start ordering anchovies on salads...maybe not so much on pizza, though.

SOUPS &amp; SIDES
Lobster Bisque was excellent. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly creamy. I don&#39;t know how hard it is to make Lobster Bisque, but no matter where I&#39;ve had it, it&#39;s always been good, so, go figure. The other sides are good, but even at an 8/10 score, they&#39;re just sides. They exist to stop your tongue from getting too accustomed to the steak to where it ignores tastes. I suppose wine does that too, but you get the idea. Not sure what a 10/10 side would taste like, but when I find one, I&#39;ll let you know.

BOTTOM LINE
I&#39;ve been to Morton&#39;s close to a dozen times now. I might get a different wine every time, but generally, my menu stays the same. I typically go with a group of 3, so steak, salds, sides, and wine, it ends up being about $80-100/person (which includes tax/tip) with a $70 bottle of wine. This is my go to Steakhouse."

It was very nice that they took our picture for our birthday celebration. Our server was nice as well, however a little on the slower side as we asked for Parmesan and olive oil for the bread but didnt get it until after we were finished with our appetizer but not a big deal.

Met people for happy hour a couple weeks ago, ended up staying for a late dinner, and we couldn&#39;t have been happier.  Again.

The bar area is really nice and comfortable, and you can get appetizers to soak up the alcohol.  Nice bartender.  Liked the chicken fingers.  On to dinner.  I LOVE the onion-y dome of fresh bread.  Solid, tasty, perfectly rare steaks with very nice sides - the asparagus with balsamic reduction is very yummy.  Ever sooooo slightly on the tough side, but very flavorful.  Great service - he never rushed us for the late hour, and never condescended to my pretty little buzzed self.

When we arrived the decor is upscale, and classy. I loved it. we got a table for 2 at the bar, and it was rather intimate for a bar setting (another plus, since my date looked fabulous!). To be honest, I chose Morton&#39;s somewhat to impress my date, but was a little curious as to the price. Needless to say, the universe worked out and there was an amazing deal for dinner for 2 with filets, which pretty much was what we wanted to order, but for half the price! She ordered a glass of wine, I believe a cab from a vineyard she favored, and I had a belvedere ginger. All of the sudden, Bruce Willis enter the bar. We were pretty floored since it was pretty empty this night, and he came to talk to us! He was charming and flattered my date, but what am I to say, he&#39;s Bruce freakin Willis! Anyhow our food arrives, and I also order the creamed spinach (I love creamed spinach btw, and there&#39;s was on point. It&#39;s definately more of the sweeter variety (or is it my date I&#39;m describing?)... Anyhow the filets were very tasty as well. A great seared crust and tender... BOOM! John Malkovich as just entered the bar as well!! Seems like Bruce and John were working together... And met up at the same place. This was crazy. We also spoke to John, and he was a cool guy too. Him an Bruce both came to chat on this slower night. They wouldn&#39;t get into what they movie they were working on, but it had something to due with soul mates, and hinges. Strange combo, but I&#39;m sure they could make it work. Anyhow, back to the filets, they were delicious and just the right amount. I&#39;d say pretty pricey at regular price, but with the special they had, it&#39;s an amazing deal. I mean think about it... Dinner for 2, drinks, 2 celebs at the table, laughs, smiles, gazes, and most of all, shared all with the beautiful date (who I am still seeing)... For under $200. Not to shabby a price to pay to mark the first of many date nights with your soul mate."

But yes they did tend to hover in groups behind you talking shop if you are by wall.  

Most disappointing is that they don&#39;t ask if you want outside charred black on all the meats.  It&#39;s so bitter it obliterates the taste of the meat and especially with lamb can&#39;t tell what kind of meat it is.  I would like bacon optional, someone couldn&#39;t have bacon or shell fish so couldn&#39;t try most things.   The inside was cooked as ordered for all of them.  

Potatoes were blah but other sides were fantastic.  Desserts are wonderful...but carrot cake too sugary sweet, need to taste &amp; see a carrot.   Would like if they had a combo of all instead of huge servings of each.   

$700 before tip for 6 of us (i.e. $15 for soup)  was not expected as it was our first time, but I guess you have to try it once.  I would say it&#39;s more like five dollar $ signs."

Perhaps it was my fault for eating at the Schaumburg outpost, but my recent visit to Morton&#39;s Schaumburg was quite disappointing.  

The beginning of the evening was pleasant enough.  The onion bread was aromatic and flavorful.  The glass of cabernet (the name of vineyard escapes me now) the waiter recommended was full-bodied and steak-friendly.  That was about when the positives ended.  I got the ribeye medium rare.  The steak was cooked as close to medium rare as that piece of steak would have allowed, as it seemed that the steak was not defrosted properly.  The overcooked outer crust was quite thick and the inner part was bloody rare.  If the steak was near room-temperature when the cooking started, this would not have been the case.  Also, even though the steak was somewhat medium rare, it was not tender at all.  This was worse than the choice-steak I get at Whole Foods or Costco, let alone prime.  I was thoroughly disappointed to say the least.  

Before I finished my steak, the waiter came by and recommended the Grand Marnier souffle because it would have taken 20 minutes to bake.  This excited me, and I ordered it at once.  When it came, the size of this souffle was way too big for one person.  What was worse was that the souffle was not risen properly, and the Grand Marnier was very overpowering.  If I finished that souffle I would have had an Asian glow - that&#39;s how much alcohol there still was in that damn thing!  Of course, when the bill came, the souffle was billed at $20 a pop, as it was for two people.  I would have appreciated if the waiter mentioned this when recommending it to me.  This was egregious.  

The decor of the place was pleasant enough - a lot of beige and wood-tone.  For the suburbs, this was nice.  But the service was woefully amateurish.  The waiter had good intentions but was obviously poorly trained.  Reciting the specials was like pulling teeth for him.   His interaction with me throughout the night was disjointed and awkward.  I was a forgiving patron and still tipped him 18%.  But this was Applebee&#39;s-level service sans the smile.  

Morton&#39;s Schaumburg is a perfect date-spot for people who don&#39;t care about food or service.  With tips, I spent over $100 for myself.  At this price, the service gaffes and sub-par food were simply unacceptable."

My date and I chose to eat at the bar. First I started with a French martini. Very good...raspberry-lemon-y. We had the two-for-$99 special. We each got a salad (Anchovies come on it, I guess?), a vegetable (We got asparagus), a potato (We got skins), steak and something fishy. I got scallops, which were wrapped in bacon and came with a mango chutney sauce. Whoa, so good! My favorite part of my meal.
To round it out, we got a desert: Grand Marnier souffle. The best part is the whipped cream, which has an orange flavor.

First off, our waiter was stupendous.  The onion loaf was amazing.  The salad was a good size (average taste), so we were pleasantly surprised.  

The atmosphere is extremely high-class.  So much so, that it made us uncomfortable.  We like high-class, but not like this.  

My first complaint is that it took so long to get bread.  We had to actually ask for it, but once we got it, we were very happy (and hungry).  After that, our main dishes came out nearly half-hour later.  The filet and shrimp was very good.  The scallops were a bit chewy for my taste.  The sides that we ordered, spinach and mashed potatoes, were very good.  It took very long for everything to come out.  

One nice touch is that they took a picture of us for our Anniversary and gave it to us.  Also, the molten chocolate cake was excellent. We go to a lot of steakhouses, but will not be returning here.  We feel it was overpriced and didn&#39;t like the atmosphere. Overall, the food was good."

I&#39;ve been to other steak restaurants, just never a Morton&#39;s before and I was pleasantly surprised. If I had to describe Morton&#39;s I would say that &#34;50&#39;s playboy club&#34; would be adequate. The lighting is dark and the décor is swanky.

I made a reservation on opentable.com and asked for a booth. When we arrived we were told that a booth would be an hour wait. That seemed odd because once we were seated (at a table...I wasn&#39;t going to wait until 8:30pm to be seated) a booth across from our table opened up...and remained open until we left. The table seating was just fine as there was space and tables weren&#39;t crammed on top of one another (which seems customary at some restaurants on V-Day). It just caught us off guard to have a reservation and be told that you would need to still wait for an hour.

The onion bread that each table gets was absolutely amazing, and I felt it made the prefect appetizer (no need to order an additional appetizer). We both ordered filets as well as sides of mushrooms, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The food was to die for. It was easy to see why they charged $45 for a steak. It was seasoned to perfection and just melted in your mouth. I ordered mine well done and it was perfect...still very juicy and tender. We also got the chocolate lava cake for dessert which was really good too. I prefer really sweet desserts and this wasn&#39;t too sweet, I was hoping it was sweeter. Without looking up the menu, I would have to guess it was made with dark chocolate. I would still recommend getting it though.

I had a few leftovers I wanted to take home and I asked if I could also take our remaining bread. To my surprise, I was given a full, fresh loaf in my doggie bag!

Morton&#39;s is a perfect place for a special occasion. The food is excellent and warrants the high price tag."

I had no idea that they were going to personalize our menus with &#34;Happy Birthday, bf&#34;. I had no idea they were going to take a picture of us and put it in a Mortons frame (ok it was just paper, but this was blowing my mind here). 

Even as we gave our name for our reservation, the staff were ready for us, and said happy birthday to my bf. 

The food: absolutely amazing. And there is no reason why 1 person should eat that much food lol, so we shared (and the bill still made me want to have a heart attack) and I still felt like I might pop at the end of the evening. 

We shared the Chicago style bone-in ribeye which is not my favorite cut, but they cooked it perfectly medium rare. Warm in the middle but still bright red. (if this isn&#39;t your idea of medium rare, then you are wrong :P) We shared the caesar salad, the crouton was delighful, and the complilmentary hot chocolate cake was delicious! 

The service they provided was phenomenal. The waitstaff were never in our face, they knew just when to come over and ask us how were were or if we needed anything. I highly recommend Mortons for anyone who loves steak or superb service."

For our table of 4 we decided on the scallop and crab cake appetizer. Holy mackerel the one tiny crab cake was almost $20!!! It was good but not worth anywhere near that price. The mustard sauce it came with was bigger then the crab cake.

I got the double cut filet mignon medium. Sadly it didn&#39;t make my top 3 favorite filets. It was cooked perfectly but it was extremely bland and didn&#39;t really have that melt in your mouth textures most upscale steakhouses do. 

I tried a bite of the their signature New York Strip. One of the better strips I had. The chilean sea bass was WONDERFUL but the salsa that was on top kind of ruined the perfectness of the fish.

Sides were mediocre. The balsamic on the asparagus was too much. The mushrooms and onions were amazing and helped bring salt to my steak.

I probably won&#39;t be going to Morton&#39;s unless someone else is paying. When you&#39;re eating a $100 meal you want it to be amazing, Morton&#39;s was not amazing.

I have no problem paying for $50 steaks but I do have a problem paying $14 for Lobster Bisque soup or $10 for French Onion soup. Or, $10 for 12 berries and some cream for desert.  Its interesting how they do not list prices on the Soups or Deserts on the menu.   The nickel and diming was excessive and really padded the tab.  

I didn&#39;t care for the seating either right next to the grill and its extremely loud.  Hard to have business conversations.  If your looking to close a deal or better a business relationship go somewhere else. 

Service was Mediocre.  I didn&#39;t feel it was as polished or attentive as I&#39;ve gotten at other steak houses and very unpersonalized.  I think we had about 15 people serving us our various dishes throughout the night.  Especially since my bill was over $1000 I expected better service. 

Parking was stupid too, the valet had orange cones though out the entire parking lot.  Sorry but Im not paying $4 to park my car when I could do it myself and walk 20 ft to the front door.  Its Schaumburg not the city.

Positives:  Steak was excellent and the Oysters were excellent.  Food overall very good.  I just didn&#39;t like the excessive nickel and diming on stupid stuff like french fries costing $9.

Overall don&#39;t waste your time with Mortons in Schaumburg.  Go to Gibsons in Rosemont if you want a really good experience. 

I would recommend it for the $49 deal that was mentioned in the other reviews.  Unfortunately our waiter never informed me of that deal."

I was really looking forward to a really good juicy medium rare steak...we drove an hour to get here. Service was slow, but it was a Saturday night so it is what it is...even though the table waited on by the other server seemed to get food and drinks much quicker than ours. 

I ordered rare/medium rare double fillet (I always get the biggest just to make sure it&#39;s not overcooked in the middle) and my husband ordered medium New York Strip. I was very specific that I wanted it more on the rare side than medium, which i know the waitress did not like, but hey, I really love my steak a certain way. His came out medium rare in the middle and charred on the outside. Unfortunately, I got a very dry medium. I would have sent my steak back but she didn&#39;t check on us right away and my husband was 3/4 done with his by the time she finally did. The manager did come by and offer to return it, but by this time I had choked down half of the dry meat. 

We were in the back room and it was very hard to hear each other...we had to speak very loudly or not at all.  Definitely not an intimate dinner for two kind of place.

We ABSOLUTELY were not offered the deal, which would have been nice with dinner for 2 coming out to over $240.  

I won&#39;t return to this location...it was a huge disappointment."

I assumed that over the years facing a struggling economy and then being bought out by a large chain and losing its Chicago roots would leave the restaurant less impressive than I remember.  It turns out I made a bad assumption.  It seems to have improved in every aspect.  Even upon entry I was impressed with what must have been an expensive renovation (which I later discovered they completed in the summer of 2013).  The restaurant looks more modern, upscale, and inviting.  The menu is mostly the same, with a few adjustments over the years.  I ended up getting the strip steak and I was wildly impressed.  My wife is an extremely picky eater and appears to write off a steak that is cooked either five seconds too little or five seconds too much, and somehow that night the Mortons chef found a way to cook her filet exactly to her liking.  The sides were wonderful, although a night of leftovers in the fridge will reveal how much butter they sneak in there to make everything taste so good.  The price was as steep as ever, but if you&#39;re strictly seeking the best meal you can get around Woodfield, this restaurant can make quite a compelling argument."

Dirty martinis were gently placed in front of us just about the time our server introduced himself and asked if there was any special occasion tonight? - nice touch. Soon we were introduced to a presentation of Morton&#39;s selection of meats, fish and sides and politely asked if we had any questions and would give us a minute to decide. After an appropriate time, we decided our meal selections and our waiter appeared as thought he was also aware. We ordered our meals and a bottle of wine. Steaks and seafood were prepared to perfection, (rare plus for the NY strip). The server was good at keeping a nice slow pace that we could enjoy each others company while still savoring our meal selections.

1) I do not eat red meat.  On this particular evening I indulged on a meal of crustaceans.
2) The rating scale with which I am grading my experience at Morton&#39;s is weighted by the pretty penny paid for the meal.  That said, this restaurant is SO far out of our price range.  We were lured here by a gift certificate we had recieved.

There are a few ways you can go about dining at Morton&#39;s on a budget.  If you eat in the bar, their appetizers/bar food is super affordable.  And given that it&#39;s Morton&#39;s, these menu items are lightyears beyond &#34;bar food.&#34;  Furthermore, they have some $5 glasses of wine in the bar.  They&#39;re not the best wine, but that price is hard to beat anywhere--let alone at a fancy steakhouse.

If you mosey over to the restaurant side, you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find a deal.  While there are some tasty combination packages, you&#39;ll still end up spending a ton of money once you get an eyeful of what they bring out on the cart.

All in all, the service was super and the food was great...I&#39;m just pretty sure we won&#39;t be back due to the hefty price tag.  But if you want to impress the hell out of somebody, head on over to Morton&#39;s,"

I like a nice rare steak, but am also not a big spender.  However, we went her for my husband&#39;s birthday and we each got $50 steaks.  I wanted mine as rare as they would cook it.  The inside was fine, but I must have cut off half the steak to get rid of the outside becaues it was so badly charred.  My husband said he liked his, but hasn&#39;t recommended going back since.  We ordered the tuna appetizer which was very small, but delicious!  We also got the baked potato, asperagas, and four drinks.  Our bill was $240 for the two of us.

But it&#39;s also one of those legendary restaurants that most people claim you got to go at least once in your lifetime.

Is it truly worth the average $35 for a steak? Are the clientele and servers uppercrust and snobbish? Can it compare to the Kansas City strongholds I&#39;m used to?

After debating other cheaper options the other night., it was on a whim that the husband decided to go there (no special occasion whatsoever, or it could be I recently lost my entire purse and valuable documents in it and having such  lousy stetches of weeks. he won&#39;t tell) . We passed by it constantly, but he kept asking where it was, and I was disbelieving his intents the entire time until we turned onto the road leading towards it.

The interesting thing upon walking to the front door is it looked liked the back door. No revolving doors, no glass windows, just a nondescript one-person entry door that led you to a tiny room that led you to the bar/reception.

Inside, it harkens to the ubiquitous &#34;Sinatra-esque&#34; feel -- low ceilings, low lighting, leather-covered booths, and servers in long white waist-aprons.

We were introduced to a platter of cuts, actual size, and given a generous and scrumptious onion bread and a big slab of cold butter.

We settled on the Filet Diane and ribeye, a la carte sides of broccoli and mashed potatoes, lobster bisque and their 30-minute upside down apple pie.

The lobster bisque ($13) was a smooth blend with a fleshy piece of lobster. Although we enjoyed it, we felt the sweetness of the brandy was too intense and made for the last few spoonfuls a little unbearable.

The mashed potatoes was a superb buttery-creamy with tiny chunks of potatoes.  Alas, the broccoli was still a little bland and al dente. Not our favorite preparation.

The Filet (Mignon) Diane was cooked to medium perfection. If I should return, I&#39;m ordering the filet in itself without the Diane sauce, though while good, like the brandy in the bisque, ultimately overpowered the original flavor of the steak.

We&#39;ve had better ribeyes. It was unevenly cooked, and lacked the juiciness.

The upside-down apple pie was a welcome respite from the cold winds and constant drizzle that night. Delicately spiced and warm, it was a great finish. 

The service was splendid, the food was good, and not being drinkers, we left with a tab + tips $160 poorer. Now it begs the question -- is it worth it? My answer: it doesn&#39;t have to be THAT expensive. But we&#39;ve done it."

Met with the party planner, Sonia.  She gave us options to set up a menu that worked within our budget yet still offered an elegant and delicious dinning experience.

Had  a private room.  All was set up as requested.  Food was made perfectly, no one complained about the variety nor the quality.  Wait staff was cordial, coordinated with one another and efficient. 

Our menu offered a choice of seafood appetizer, scallops, shrimp or crab cake (all great choices). Then a choice of Morton&#39;s salad (super yummy) or Caesar.  I noticed that the Morton&#39;s salad doesn&#39;t have tomatoes when ordered at special events, but it has it when ordered in the dining room, funny... as for our main entree, we had a choice of Fillet, Chicken Christopher or  Salmon.  Then for dessert we had a choice of Key lime pie, creme brulee, or chocolate cake.  Overall great choices and nice portions.  Keep in mind you also get a ginormous round loaf of onion bread and butter.  My recommendation, ask to have the bread presliced, especially if you have more than yourself and a significant other with you.  It&#39;ll otherwise be very messy....consider yourself warned....

Aside of the customized menu we ordered, they have a regular dining menu.  The best deal is their steak and seafood.  However, the have many other options they offer.  One things for certain, it&#39;s a steakhouse, so of course their steaks are wonderful.  They also have a great chicken option, it&#39;s called Chicken Christopher, the garlic cream sauce is to die for! 

Overall the menu is an a&#39;la carte menu.   Prices start from $9, but that&#39;s just for sides, dinners start at $27, steaks are always much higher.  Wine by the glass starts from $9.  They don&#39;t have much of a kid&#39;s meal, really it&#39;s nonexistent, however, you could get the Kobe Burgers or Chicken fingers with steak fries.  They seem to be most affordable and huge portions that two children may be able to share.

Will definitely consider this place again for a special event or special evening out."

i wanted a steak while i was in chicago, in fact i was craving it but i didnt want to spend a mint and so that was my only drawback to my mortons experience. i wasnt familiar with the menu but i did get some feedback from people at the hotel that said there wqas a great steak house up the street where i was staying. 

so off to mortons we went. 


mortons decor was very comfortable and cozy, great for celebrating events and anniversaries. this isnt a place one would take a casual date as the fare and prices are very close to higher end dining. 
the service and attention were more than exemplary yes the steak was excellent, cooked to perfection. tender to the touch and melted with flavor with each bite i took but as some other reviewer mentioned, it didnt have to be that expensive.

total bill- with their medium priced steak plate aka filet minon only (didnt come with sides),  my date&#39;s salad (she wasnt hungry) and 3 glasses of wine? 120 dollars."

It&#39;s a relief to know some restaurants still adhere to fine dining and pleasing the customer to provide a class A dining experience.  The steak is quality however I noticed that when you get the special 2 for $99 the steak is different a lower grade perhaps.  This is an expensive restaurant if you want steak and want to stay in the suburbs this is a good choice.  If you want to drive to the city you can go to Lawry&#39;s pay less or equal and have a finer dining experience on every level.

I have not been to one since I started my yelp account, but I have been plenty of times.  I used to get the filet, which was pretty good, but I ordered the cajun ribeye once and it was by far the best steak I ever had.  The only problem is I do not like any fat on my steak.  Save your, &#34;Fat is what gives the steak flavor&#34; comments.  You like what you like and I like what I like.  The waiter told me that in the future when I make reservations I should ask to have a filet marinated in the cajun seasoning they use.  I have been doing that ever since he said that.  Wow!!!!!!  It was amazing!!!!!  I always tell people to go to Morton&#39;s, but call at least the night before and request the cajun filet.  They do not have the cajun filet on the menu, so you have to let them know you want it at least the night before so they can marinade it for you."

It&#39;s very pricey but the food is usually outstanding and so is the service.  I don&#39;t like that the portions of some things (like the baked potato) are ridiculously large.  And I&#39;m not real picky on my wine but once I had to send back two different wines (by the glass) before I could even half-like what I was drinking. That&#39;s just probably me and my dislike for wines with a prune aftertaste.

Having said all that, my husband and I went there for our anniversary, and when they presented us with the menu it was printed up special for us with our names at the top wishing us a happy anniversary, which I thought was outstanding!  Then it wasn&#39;t too much longer when the maitre d came by and asked us if we wanted to move to another (quiet) room and I wholeheartedly said yes!  My husband and I had a wonderful evening talking to each other and that wouldn&#39;t have come about if it weren&#39;t for the Maitre d moving us because it can get quite noisy in there.  

The wine (by the bottle) we had was wonderful and our food was...the fact that I can&#39;t remember what I had (it was back in May) tells me there was nothing wrong but it was just short of excellent.  

I did appreciate the fact that they do have a dress code.  I&#39;m sick of seeing shorts and flip-flops at an expensive restaurant on a Saturday night.  Thank you Morton&#39;s!"

Our reservation was at 9:15. After a long work week it was highly anticipated to dine at Morton&#39;s and to celebrate good news. Our server made our celebration seem insignificant. We felt rushed and a nuisance for the time we arrived at. It was late, but also a Friday night, and the only time we could make it due to a long work day. Even still! Our food seemed to be bottom of the barrel, quality. Our au gratin potatoes had been served extremely cold, no meat presentation was made. Our steaks had been taken away to be re plated and came back just as cold as the potatoes before hand. Our service was mediocre at best. Just an extremely poor experience for a date night and just a dinner in general. This was highly anticipated, and this location did a superb job of making a suppose to be memorable moment, not so special. Highly, highly disappointed. Could not stress that enough.

Time of my visit: Lunch

I live around their other location.  Since I was not sure what I was in the mood for, I figured I would try this place.

It was nice inside, but the outside temperature dropped over the last week or so, why was the air conditioner blasting?  I am the last one to complain about cold or hot, but it was a bit chilly inside.

I looked over a menu, asked my waitress for a recommendation and decided to get a rib &amp; skewer (mixed) platter with fries.

The waitress was prompted with my water and refills.  Over the service was good.  Food, however, was not as good as I anticipated.

My plate arrived and right away, I noticed the size of the skewers.  I was not expecting them to be a mile long, but that seemed to be a small.  Fries were your typical fries, nothing to rave about.  I tried chicken skewer first.  It was about what you&#39;d expect your average grilled chicken to be., not much of seasoning either.  Then I had stake skewer...  The stake was a bit chewy and  just like the chicken did not have much of flavor or seasoning.

The last thing I had was the ribs.  I would not call them famous...  Again, sadly, average at best...  For $14 and change I was expecting, at least ribs to be better.

Overall a C.  I will probably come back to try their burgers."

This joint was walking distance from my hotel so I stepped out to grab grub!
Started out with an Oberon on draft, but thought their beer dispensing system might need a good clean out!
Ordered the sweet potato fries and they lacked the sweetness I was looking for.
For the final chapter in my dining adventure I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, and they knocked it out of the park! Tender chicken in BBQ sauce atop crisp greens, cheese, tomatoes, onion straws...and I added avocado for extra creaminess.
Ambiance is old rich dude pub, and prices are in line with expectation.

Ribs and Skewer: (14.00): 3 rib bones, some skewers of beef, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, bbq sauce and teriyaki glaze. There were hits and misses with this one. The misses were the lumpy mashed potatoes with plenty of skin and the ribs which were generic and slightly burnt. The hits were the skewers which were juicy and well cooked and the glaze was fantastic. The cole slaw was also pretty good.(See picture)  

French onion: Same as before, pretty generic. They need to put it under the salamander longer to crisp up and brown the cheese more. 

The service was pretty good last time and was even better this time. This place is really on the ball when it comes to service.

We ordered Mozzarella Sticks ($8 for 8 of &#39;em) as apps.  They were good, but a bit small and perhaps a tad overcooked.

He had the Bison Burger (on Specials menu).  It seemed moderately sized, and the fries were OK (no salt/seasoning).  I had the Grilled Fish Tacos ($10); they had a nice bit of heat but, unlike my counterpart&#39;s fries, were WAY salty!  The lettuce was extremely heavy-handed - it was impossible to find the fish underneath without totally deconstructing it!  They also had an awkward heaping pile o&#39; black beans and white rice with parsley.  Neither of the &#34;sides&#34; were seasoned nor anything worthwhile to eat (and I LIKE beans and rice).

Our server (Jen) was attentive but not overbearing.

In all it was just OK.  I think we&#39;d try something else instead next time!"

I come here frequently with my family and friends and we&#39;ve never had a bad experience with the food or service.  Chris is our favorite waiter. 

If you&#39;re not concerned about your daily carb intake... I suggest you try their mac &amp; cheese.  It&#39;s so cheesy and comes with onions, tomatoes... and BACON! 
They have seasonal specials, some are better than others.  They always have different drink specials too... Sometimes it&#39;s martini night, sometimes beer.  

Their burgers are above average and offer several different toppings, cheese, etc. Also, they have turkey, beef AND bison patties; the more options the better! 

They do have a couple* vegetarian options.

For not being a pizzeria, they have really good pizza.  It seems they just made new menus and got rid of my favorite, the mediterranean.  Lo and behold, I asked the server if they could still make it and they had no problem!

The Baja fish tacos are no joke either and outrival almost all fish tacos that I&#39;ve had in SoCal and Hawaii. Ask for a side of salsa and a pint of 312 Urban Wheat ale and you&#39;re set.

Something about Anyway&#39;s makes it feel more comfortable than any other resto-bar in the area. Could be the service, the good, cheapish drinks or the fact that it&#39;s not corporate. Or maybe it&#39;s just the lackadaisical name."

Do you know what hangry is? Hangry is me when I haven&#39;t eaten in a long time and my boyfriend can&#39;t make a decision on what to eat and I start getting angry and yelling and my boyfriend says GO TO ANYWAYS LETS GET WINGS! and then I violently pull into the parking lot.

We sat at a pub table to grab some quick wings and a drink.  Well and a quick BOWL of soup.   

Our waitress came up and I ordered an angry orchard cider with a shot of fireball whiskey in it (ANGRY BALLS FTW!).  They have posters plastered all over for  Angry Orchard and she even repeated it back to me and said it was good.  

[Minus] 1 [star] : She brought me a Woodchuck Cider and a shot of fireball whiskey, no glass.  
Ok, I let the cider choice go because it was already open.  I asked for a glass and mixed my angry balls.  

We ordered our meal- two bowls of soup, wings with BLUE CHEESE. 

[Minus] 2 [stars]: She brought out my boyfriends bowl of soup, and my CUP of soup.  My boyfriend made her quickly aware that I had ordered a bowl and she said, &#34;Oh, well I can bring you out another cup then.  Its like the same thing as a bowl.&#34;  
Great, I look like the fatty eating two things of soup.  Thanks homie.  

[Minus] 3 [stars]: Our food comes out.  Wings on both ends.  My boyfriend correctly got his blue cheese, I had gotten ranch.  WRONG!
A guy had delivered our food instead of our waitress and I told him I had asked for blue cheese, his response was, &#34;Oh, now you want blue cheese not the ranch?&#34;  
Well, duh, that&#39;s what I ordered!

I was hangry, and now even more irritated because this server didn&#39;t get ANY of my orders correct.   Being the wonderfully crazy girl that I am I insisted that it must be because she was flirting with my boyfriend.  Then I realized, no, she just doesn&#39;t pay attention.
She didn&#39;t write anything down and even rolled her eyes when she brought me out my blue cheese.  Thanks for your wonderful service! *note the sarcasm.

There&#39;s nothing magical about it, but there&#39;s nothing terrible either.  The restaurant itself looks nice, it&#39;s clean, and it&#39;s pretty spacious.  There is a decent sized bar too, if you don&#39;t mind the loud emcee screaming over the microphone every 5-10 minutes.  I still am unsure of what he&#39;s doing over there...  

Some things that stand out are:

1.  The ribs are pretty good...to put it in to perspective, they are better than Famous Dave&#39;s ribs but are less than The Patio&#39;s and/or Barnelli&#39;s ribs.
2.  The new pretzel bun burger special is delicious.  I would definitely order it raw, as my medium came out well done, and I would add some spice to it (Frank&#39;s Red Hot sauce?  Pepperjack cheese?  Jalapenos?) but it was good.  It may just be the pretzel bun&#39;s deliciousness taking over, but I was a fan.
3.  There is FINALLY some good beer here.  It&#39;s not an extensive list, they are only in bottles, and the 3 Floyd&#39;s runs out fast, but there were a few good ones to choose from.  I ended up with a Lagunitas A Lil&#39; Sumpin&#39; Sumpin&#39;.  
4.  Service was excellent.

Wings are standard, nothing exceptional but if you&#39;re jonesing for some buffalo wings they fit the bill.

My daughter wouldn&#39;t eat her hamburger, but she was all about the broccoli and fries. Shoulda just ordered her the chicken fingers, ohhhh well.  

The man ordered the steak, it was a lot better than I expected. It was good quality meat, tender, and cooked just how he wanted it. It didn&#39;t seem like the kind of place that would have a good steak, but there you go.

I had the lime chicken, it&#39;s listed on the menu as under 550 calories. I ordered it to justify the couple of fat tires I drank, totally worked. I would probably order it again, but I want to try other stuff on their menu first.

Although I cannot attest for the food this time (we had eaten elsewhere!), we did have the chance to imbibe in some of their delicious bevvies.

I cannot believe I have gone almost 28 years of my life (7 *legal* drinking years to my mom if she reads this...) without knowing what Rumchata.  If you have never had this, YOU MUST TRY IT IMMEDIATELY!

It is a shot of some kind of delightful rum.  It doesn&#39;t really matter what&#39;s in it, all that I know is that I was literally licking.the.shot.glass after taking it because it was amazing.  It tastes like the milk that&#39;s leftover after you eat your Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

No I am not kidding.  That is exactly what it tastes like.

The other drink I had, Skyy around the World was good too--five different kinds of Skyy and diet coke.  YUM!  And super strong.  But nothing will compare to the Rumchata, let&#39;s just be honest!

Our waitress was really good, too!!  I wish I remembered her name.  She was all over our table like white on rice (it&#39;s a good thing!) and we had a group of about 10 of us!

I had some of a martini, too.  I will be back for the drinks for sure!  Maybe next time I will be brave again and branch out to food again.

But you bet your bippy I will be getting some Rumchata!!!!"

The bar is in an unlikely midtown location, enjoy the entrance and your very quiet greeting by a well-dressed someone of whom you must convince to let you in via a reservation (Sun-Mon-Tues only) or by agreeing to wait on a list.  Sit in, stand by the bar, or grab a seat in the backyard (a midtown rarity) and sip your cocktails whilst enjoying some civilized, relaxing conversation. 

Anyways tops my list of city speak easy for the beverage selection and atmosphere.  A bit pricey (aren&#39;t they all?), but if you nurse your drink correctly, you can easily have two over the span of an hour and walk out without much of a dent in your wallet."

As a transplanted New York sports fan, I&#39;m glad I have the option to watch almost any game I want. Big props right there.

It took 4-6 minutes for the server to get to us, but she was friendly enough. The size of the drink glasses were tall, which is a big deal for me at a sports bar. For the food, we started with the spinach artichoke dip. It was really creamy, a little more yellow than what I would expect. Very creamy and served with tri-color tortilla chips. I would usually prefer toasted bread or pita, something more chewy, but it worked well enough. If nothing else, the presentation was nice with the array of colors.

I went for the Flat Iron steak sandwich. It came on a hoagie roll with crispy fried onions and sauteed mushrooms along with a side of Cabernet sauce. I was very impressed with the tenderness of the meat. And the combo of the red wine in the sauce and mushrooms was just tremendous. The onions provide that nice crunch, so I got a nice variety of tastes and flavors. The sandwich came with a mountain of French fries that were well seasoned with a Lawry&#39;s type taste to them. And we had certain requests like ranch dressing, honey mustard, our third drink refill, etc and the staff responded quite promptly to all of them.

There aren&#39;t too many sit-down places in that Stratford Square area that deliver the goods in terms of both taste and atmosphere. Anyway&#39;s is a fine exception, I am happy to say."

Who is Anyway? Is this his or her restaurant? No? I rather thought not.

But bad punctuation aside (and sadly, yes, this is how it appears on the building), Anyway[&#39;]s is a solid upscale sports bar-type eatery.

We came on New Year&#39;s Eve - fairly early - and half expected to wait awhile, but we were seated right away. The interior is very nice, with rich, warm wood, a couple of fireplaces and comfy seating. And lots of flat-panel TVs for whatever game is on.

The menu is decently varied and I had a hard time deciding, but I went with one of the specials, a turkey melt on ciabatta with havarti and spring greens. And in true M. family fashion, we started with nachos.

The nachos were solid, not fantastic but good enough to get them again. Tons of cheese (some of it not-quite melted), a little skimpy on the refried beans, decent guacamole, good salsa, plenty of ground beef. 

My sandwich was very good; the only mild disappointment was that the turkey appeared to be processed deli-cut, as opposed to nice pieces of a roasted turkey (like Thanksgiving leftovers). But the bread was quite good, the pesto mayo and havarti delicious. The fries were solid. 

Service was friendly and competent, no problems there.

Next time I&#39;d like to try something different on their vast menu, but I was definitely pleased enough that I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back.

Edit: We came back, just over a month later -- and I must say, the mac &amp; cheese (with tomato, bacon, onion and a garlicky-crumb crust) is AWESOME. I make some good mac &amp; cheese, and this blew mine away. Carb-o-licious heaven."

The fries were greasy.  3 or 4 item dessert menu - nothing w/o ice cream.  I di dnot really see anything on the menu that caught my eye that would make me want to go back and give it another try.

Most recently I went to Anyway&#39;s on a Thursday around 6:30 PM and found a packed parking lot. Gotta be doing something right if you can pack &#39;em in on a weeknight.

Though I don&#39;t drink too very often, the $4 Martini specials Thursday night were enticing enough for me to try before eating dinner. My drink was not too heavy on the alcohol, which is what I prefer. The Tequila Lime Chicken I ordered was quite moist and tender, served over cilantro lime rice and black beans. The beans were excellent! So good that I asked my server what they added to the black beans to make them taste so good. (Made with chicken broth and cumin.)

Of course, I had to have dessert since cinnamon ice cream was on the menu... one of my all-time favorite flavors! Two moderate scoops with a drizzle of caramel, whipped cream and a cherry on top were the perfect size for after dinner, unlike the monster desserts that you usually get and can rarely finish.

I did have the apple crisp another time, which (if I remember right) was heavy on the apples, not enough &#34;crisp&#34; topping, could use more ice cream, and quite messy on the caramel sauce. It was okay, but I probably won&#39;t order that dessert again.

All in all, Anyway&#39;s is a great option to the other chain restaurants on the block. Nice decor, decent lounge / bar area with flat screens TV&#39;s all around, separate dining area that&#39;s not as loud as the lounge, friendly service, and pretty good food.

The Lincoln Park Salad for me, the chicken nachos for the Hubs. 
The salad was very fresh. Various kinds of lettuce leaves, granny smith apples, cranberries and blue cheese crumbles. Quite large for one person. The poppy seed vinaigrette was very tasty and tangy and sweet. I didn&#39;t care for the nachos--the chicken was very dry--almost crumbly. The cheese was ok. The nacho chips were the tastiest part of that dish. 

I like this location better than the Oak Brook Terrace location because this one is more spacious, has a better layout and the staff is very friendly. Same menu, same drink specials. More flat screens and a larger and sleeker bar. Great place to watch a game and enjoy a drink."

If you are looking for dessert, ask your server about the cheesecake flavor of the day. I have tried several and they have all tasted great! Their cheesy fries and fish tacos are excellent. 

Anyway&#39;s has a good pub atmosphere, sometimes a little loud, but not bad. There is also a separate dining room for people who don&#39;t want to be near the bar, such as families with kids.

The prices were considerably more than what was listed on their website and I really don&#39;t like to spend more than $8 for lunch.

Service was non-existent.  When we needed refills we had to flag down the bus boy--the waitress was no where to be found.  The food on the buffet was mediocre at best.

Overall the restaurant is big and ambiance was amazing, really liked the decor, you feel like your sitting in a restaurant across the border. our server was very nice, and friendly, I have a dietary restrictions (don&#39;t eat pork), so I was asking questions regarding that, and she answered all the questions I had, and went above and beyond to find out if there were any pork products in the ingredients (pork in the re fried beans). Now to the food, first off the complimentary chips and salsa was really good, I ordered the fajita dinner, and overall the food was good, seemed fresh and the portions were large. overall I liked this place, definitely will be back for more"

Drinks were good. And the service was solid and friendly. So now we&#39;ve started to come back again and are glad! Definitely ask for Chris. Best server we&#39;ve ever had. Period.

What saved dinner was the fact that they have a vegetarian menu, after asking our waitress what my vegetarian hubby could order. The regular menu was slim pickens for him. 4-stars for the menu discovery! You have to ask for it.

We decided to go for an Ikea run tonight, and everyone seemed to be craving Mexican food. We ended up here by default, because we realized the other smaller independent restaurants we were considering closed at 6pm. Lalo&#39;s was a bit out of the way, but a nice place for a family meal. 

The chips are homemade here, but they were underwhelming for me and the salsa wasn&#39;t very exciting. I enjoyed the chicken soup starter to the meal. Served with a lime, it had a nice kick to it. The kids menu is great, and for ages 10 and under. My hearty eating nine year old boys filled up quickly. The menu is divided into two sections--hungry and extra hungry. They ate for $5.50 and each kid got a mini bowl of soup, steak tacos, rice or fries. They loved it! Hubby ordered guac. tacos, and I ended up with chicken and beef flautas with guac., rice and refried beans. In retrospect, I wish I would have ordered off the vegetarian menu. I felt a little wonky after eating...just too much food for me. 

Would I come here again? Probably not. It&#39;s just not super convenient, and I didn&#39;t find the meal to be memorable after leaving. 

Service was absolutely lovely. Our waitress was quick to handle all our needs."

I went a few weeks ago with a group from work and it was really nice! We ordered several appetizer samplers for the table and the guacamole. Everything was very authentic and fresh tasting, I really loved the guacamole and the flautas were awesome. The margaritas were ON POINT and had a lot of alcohol in them, and the flavor combinations were awesome! I had strawberry and a strawberry mango margarita, and both were great. 

I really loved the atmosphere in this place, it reminded me of the Mexico Pavilion at EPCOT. Little bridges to walk over to get to your table, a mariachi band playing, and cobblestone floors. The bar had karaoke going and dancing. It seemed like this place was always a big party! I really enjoyed my visit, as did my co-workers. I hope to come back for a full meal sometime in the future and I feel bad for driving past without a thought so many times!"

I have been to both the Berwyn and Chicago locations.  In my opinion in comparison to those two, this one as far as the appearance of it is sub-par.  

Today is a gloomy type of day and unfortunately it felt that way inside.  It was very dim and just wasn&#39;t conducive to &#34;bringing out the sunshine in me.&#34;  Luckily I had a great group of people with me to help that.

The food on the other hand was very good.  I ordered the Enchiladas Suiza, my favorite and it was definitely a hit.  My co-workers order the lunch buffet and stated they enjoyed the variety and the food in itself.  

Our waiter was pretty great.  He was very attentive.  He ensured that he did not hover but at the same time met all of our needs.  My water glass never got empty despite him not hovering around so for that I give him kudos!  I can tell he was keeping a watchful eye over his tables.  

The area near the rest room seemed a bit cluttered, or it may just be that it was so dark in their that it appeared to be cluttered.  

Im curious to know if it is any different in the evening, or a brighter day outside as a whole, so for that I will return."

First, the lunch buffet. I was not a fan. Limited selection of room-temperature food. Pass.

Second, dinner. Very good! I&#39;ve had dinner here several times and the entrees have always been tasty. The apps are a little bland but that&#39;s not really a big deal. You don&#39;t leave a movie because the previews were boring, right?

Third, the bar. Totally different vibe from the dining room. There were a few different things going on in the bar while we were there. Part sports bar, part singles bar for older people, and mix in an occasional large group of women drinking margaritas and getting their swerve on with mariachi bands. 


Overall, it&#39;s good as long as you know when to go and when to skip it."

There was a large selection, including taco&#39;s, mini burritos, quesadillas,  gauc, rice beans, dessert etc.    Unlike many buffets where they are light on the protein, all the options were stuffed with meat and delicious.

Started with a Margarita on the rocks - size Large.  It was so bad, I returned it.  It taste like what I would imagine the plastic bottled margarita mixes already blended with tequila would taste.  Got a red sangria instead, not the best I&#39;ve had, but a LOT more tolerable then the margarita.  
The taco platter was just very boring.  Just a step up from on the border, and not by much.

I initially called early in the week to make resevrations for a Friday night, but was told they would only take reservations for a party of 6 or more, understandable. Our party of 4 got there around 7:40pm on a Friday night and it was busy, but no wait, awesome.

We were greeted with some chips and salsa and our server to take our drink order. 1/2 price draft specials and $6.50 red or white sangria, hmmMmmm sangria. I went with the red sangria and it was delicious and fruity, so I had 2 glasses. 

We ordered their Botana Combinada: combination appetizers of nachos, quesadilla, tamales, flautas, and seafood empanada. I always like ordering any combo dish because you get to taste a little bit of everything. My favorite had to be the seafood empanada although i wish it came with more then one. The flautas and tamales were a bit dry, but nothing a little bit of sour cream and guac can&#39;t fix. The quesadilla had ham in it and it was delicious.

I ordered the carne asada a la tampiquena, medium rare and it was perfect. The skirt steak was cooked to perfection with the warm red in the middle, so tender and juicy, drools. I thought the rice and beans and were just okay, but the steak definitely made the meal. I was really satisfied. (It always made for a good steak and egg english muffin sandwich the next morning.) The rest of the party also enjoyed their meals and the live entertainment.

I can&#39;t wait to go back for some juicy skirt steak and a ice cold red sangria."

We were lucky enough to be seated right away despite the restaurant being pretty busy. Overall, everything about my experience at Lalo&#39;s was good... Except for the menu! I eat Mexican food quite often and this menu was so small and lacking your standard Mexican food options. It was kind of pricy, too (though the price of the meal does include chips and a complimentary soup). I ended up ordering the Steak Burrito Dinner with a Pacifico Michelada. Both were tasty, but again, the menu did not leave a lot of room for options! I would&#39;ve loved a steak quesadilla or steak enchiladas with verde sauce instead, but these meals were either listed as vegetarian or with pulled chicken... And I didn&#39;t even see verde sauce on the menu. Kind of weird. We also got guacamole as an appetizer, and it was, sadly, quite flavorless. -insert shocked face here-. Their salsa was good, though.

AYCE buffet every day! I have been here before and was less than impressed by the buffet but I have been away for many years until this past month. I went on a weekday, the buffet is priced at 9.99 I believe or somewhere around that price. You are greeted with a bonanza of mexican food items including spinach quesadilla, small burritos ( I would stay away from this), taquitos chicken/beef, fresh taco station with chicken, beef (res) this was amazing go with this) in flour or corn tortilla. There was even mole and other traditional mexican dishes. Unlimited guac as well in the salad bar area. To top it off rice pudding or flan. This is a nice change of pace from other lunch venues. I would highly recommend if you like traditional mexican food.

Pro: lunch buffet AYCE, friendly staff 

Cons: none

We asked to speak to the management, not to complain, just to make them aware of the situation so it doesn&#39;t happen again. He seemed shocked &amp; repeated &#34;umm, you want to see the manager?&#34; We said yes please. He reluctantly went to find someone.

We ordered the appetizer sampler which was really nothing special. The quesadilla had a slice of ham and you wouldn&#39;t even know there was cheese on it. Tamales were dry as well as the flautas. The nachos were thrown on the plated and all the cheese got on about three chips. Not much cheese either. The service was slow. I understand that they were busy but I did feel a bit neglected by my server. 

I ordered the carne Asada. Huge portio of streak! The steak was good. Rice and beans were good. However, my boyfriend had the burrito and he said we could have gotten one from the Mexican place down the street. It was nothing special. 

I give three stars for my portion of streak and the prices were good. Paid 60 bucks including tip for everything and the dinners included a soup and I had a drink. 

They have a mariachi band that sings to people for dinner or birthdays. It&#39;s s nice touch but it was extremely distracting. I think this place would be great for a birthday celebration but not a date night."

It took a while to get a glass of water and another while to get a refill.  The food is decent and the prices are reasonable (on the higher end for Mexican food).  I came for dinner on a Friday night and the place was packed.  The bright and colorful decorations added to the ambiance of the restaurant.  Definitely good for large groups since they have tons of space and tables.  The chip and salsa were good and help curb the appetite while waiting for the food to come out.

I ordered a medium mango margarita, which was delicious and I couldn&#39;t even taste the alcohol.  For $11, it&#39;s almost like a meal.  

The flautas dinner came with some guac, rice, and beans for $12.  I didn&#39;t think the flautas were anything special and they were kind of on the dry side (dried shredded chicken).  The guacamole was very good, but I think that&#39;s rather difficult to mangle.  The rice was tasty and fluffy.

The lady behind me got a glass of margarita dumped on her when a waitress lost her balance.  I&#39;ve been there before and was glad it wasn&#39;t me this time.

There&#39;s a bowl of lollipops by the entrance that were full of fruit flavored lollipops.  Someone recommended mango, but it was strange tasting for a mango.  There&#39;s also a gum surprise in the middle."

Had a taste for Mexican food today, so my friend and I decided to give Lalo&#39;s buffet a try.  Now I remember why i hadn&#39;t been to one in like 20 years.  It was without a doubt the worst Mexican food I ever had.  No idea why/how people actually like this place.  Guess the drinks must be good.  The buffet was over priced ($11) and tasteless.   Come on people.....how about at least using some Adobo?  We should have known the meal would be bad when we sampled the salsa provided with the chips.  The chips had an odd taste, and the salsa was like a can of crushed tomatoes.  No taste at all.  We arrived at about 12:30, the restaurant was empty and the buffet was nearly bare.

It was the place to go with my coworkers when I used to work in Schaumburg. After several months of being closed due to construction, I made a visit to see the improvements. 

The interior decorating is amazing. You can tell that a lot of money was invested and you see it in the details from the tile to the art work on display.

Interior is one thing but what about the food? I found the al pastor and the carne asada to be mediocre. The portions were large which helped justify the pricing but it wasn&#39;t memorable. I would relate the food to their lunch buffet where it satisfies your craving even though it&#39;s not the best Mexican food that you&#39;ve had. We had a coupon which helped offset the cost.

It&#39;s just as good as the Berwyn location. I&#39;m giving it four stars because the don&#39;t have any booths (which I find more comfortable than tables) and their frozen raspberry Margarita seemed a little more &#34;tart&#34; than the ones at the Berwyn location. After I stirred it up it was fine, but I think the Margaritas at the Berwyn location are a tad bit better. Overall great lunch. I&#39;ll come back next time I&#39;m in Schaumburg!"

I&#39;ve had better, they were actually pretty plain tasting.  So we get 4 flour tortillas and after we ate the four there was so much left over to make more tacos with so we ordered more tortillas and the waitress Rosa gave us 3 more.  Now if you have two people and they&#39;re sharing the meal and you&#39;re aware they are sharing why would you give them 3 tortillas?? Anyways Rosa was NOT keeping our drinks filled I had to call her over 3 times to get a refill and ask another employee to get me another flour tortilla.  The chips tastes like cardboard.  Next time for Mexican food I&#39;ll go to La Hacienda or La Magdalena&#39;s in Addison, their food is much better tasting and very flavorful.  Not a fan of Lalo&#39;s at all."

After what I think was a four or five month remodel job, Lalo&#39;s reopened recently.  We heard that they were open again and headed for the usual lunch buffet.  Unfortunately, it is no longer there seven days a week.  I am not sure on the schedule, but I would suggest calling first.  

We looked at the lunch menu which had been completely re-vamped and decided on a combo platter.  Basically steak, chorizo, chicken, shrimp wrapped in bacon, peppers, etc. served with tortillas.  It was a good price for a great portion.  The staff all seemed different as I didn&#39;t recognize anyone.  The atmosphere was pretty nice and the service was good.  No problems with refills or getting more tortillas.  It was a good visit.  I&#39;d like to try the lunch buffet and see how it&#39;s changed, so I will keep you posted once I do that."

But come here for a night to chill out, have so margs and mexican.  I&#39;m not big on tequila, but was surprised with how good the mango margarita was that I got. We came on a friday, which included the tableside singing. =) i don&#39;t care if it&#39;s hokey. I loved it. Fun entertainment for anyone who&#39;s not too worried about being &#34;too cool.&#34;

Will probably be back for more. The pork on the tacos we had were really flavorful and juicy. Surprisingly, I even liked it a lot more than the steak tacos I had.  Rice and beans were pretty up to par. A lil pricey, but worth it for the experience."

My mother and I decided on the lunch buffet (even though I NEVER do buffets). The first time we served ourselves there weren&#39;t too many options but we say the employees filling the dishes so we figured we&#39;ll have better luck a little later.  
For our second trip to the buffet there were even less options.  I then noticed one of the workers filling up the dishes with only a few items at at a time. For example instead of bringing out a full tray of mini burritos he would bring 4 or 5 at a time.  Unfortunately he did this for every dish. There were enough customers going to the buffet so there was never enough food.  I had to ask him 3 times to fill the buffet. He would just smile smile and nod.
Our waiter was even worse than the buffet. We had to ask him several times for extra napkins which he never brought over. My water (which was the only thing I was drinking) never got filled.  It was a one and done deal. It was a bad experience this time around and it will probably be a very long time before I go back, IF I ever do go back."

The place wasn&#39;t crazy busy as there were more than a few empty tables around us, yet our server would frequently forget about us and disappear. When he came back to fill our water, more than once, he&#39;d fill the glasses with Sprite before walking off despite us trying to tell him. He was overall fairly inattentive.

The food was overpriced for what was served and, more or less, bland and unremarkable. Total, for the four meals, it came out to a jaw-dropping $80, none of which I would call worth it. 

Would not recommend and definitely would not return."

They have a GREAT lunch buffet 7 days a week and for about $12.00 (including drink) you can have a nice lunch....that is, if you can get your drink. 

We ALWAYS get there right when they open and when the food is fresh because if you get there later in the afternoon, the food is garbage. All Mexican food dries out easily so it&#39;s difficult to keep it moist and fresh tasting. 

We have done take out a few times. Not good. They box the food in Styrofoam which simply makes the crunchy foods soggy because they put it steaming hot into the container. Perhaps, if they changed how the food was packed, it would improve. For example: put deep friend flautas or tacos in a hard shell in paper packaging. Cold garnishes should be left outside of the box or bag and packed separately because hot food and cold sour cream don&#39;t mix when it may be transported for up to 20 minutes. 

Be sure to use your bathroom at home before you go, you will not want to use theirs. Also, a shame, because we always rush out when we leave because I don&#39;t want to use their restrooms.

They also offer 1/2 price appetizers Monday through Friday from 4(??) until 7pm in the bar area. They know how to make authentic Mexican food. Their flautas are just like my Grandma&#39;s used to be and their enchiladas aren&#39;t bad either. I look at it this way. You know it&#39;s a good Mexican restaurant when you look around and every patron is Hispanic."

They don&#39;t have a huge variety of margaritas, but the ones they make are good. Strong enough to get the job done I&#39;d say.

The food is very mediocre. Nothing great, but nothing terrible either.

The price is cheap, nothing over the top.

They have karaoke nights, and people dance and what not. There&#39;s a bar area and a restaurant area, as well as a patio that&#39;s open in the summer.

They do make your guacamole by hand and at your table which is pretty cool to watch, and that always turns out really good.

I&#39;d recommend Lalo&#39;s for guacamole with chips and their margaritas, but aside from that it&#39;s nothing to get excited over."

We went later on a Friday evening with another couple for dinner. The bar area was packed and had a dj playing music, but there only were two or three other tables in the dining room. 
Our server greeted us right away and brought our drinks quickly. When it came time to order our dinner, it was so loud that we had to shout over not only the dj from the bar area, but a mariachi band in the dining room. 
The reason for only 1 star? My order was incorrect when the server brought it out and she disappeared so quickly that I had to wait at least 5 minutes for her to come back. I informed her that I had asked for NO onions on my tacos and that there was nothing except for onions on my tacos. She brought the dish to the kitchen and returned with another plate before quickly disappearing again. They simply covered the onions that I didn&#39;t want with cheese and tomatoes. My husband had to go find her after waiting another 5 minutes. At that point, I asked her to just bring the check and that I no longer wanted dinner. The check was just under $100 for the four of us and I didn&#39;t even eat anything. There was no visit from a manager and nothing extended for this extremely poor experience.

We got a pitcher between the three of us and they did not skimp on the tequila, which is always appreciated!  The entrees all came with a little cup of chicken noodle soup which seemed strange to me, but whatevs.  The soup is thin and brothy, tastes good, but you may as well save most of the room for your entree since there&#39;s nothing really special going on in the soup department.

Came with tortillas, refried beans, rice, and guac, so it was easy to build a tasty meal.  I took half home for another dinner!  Fried ice cream was pretty tasty too, I&#39;ve never had it before.

It&#39;s a standard Mexican joint, with the usual Mexican-American fare.  No surprises, but it&#39;s a solid choice if you&#39;re in for some Mexican food and margs."

Yes, I know a burger in a Mexican restaurant doesn&#39;t sound good, but it was.  It had a different cheese than I have never had but it was very good.  The fries were just ok - they didn&#39;t seem salted.  My other family had the buffet.  They both seemed to enjoy it.  We had the flan - I would give that 5 stars!"

We all wanted Mexican food and decided to come back but what a HUGE mistake,  Food came out cold and tasteless, I have been to many Mexican restaurants and know good food. We frequent restaurants enough to know the good from the bad. We sent all four plates back so they could give us warm food but that was a waste of time. We all agreed that the re fried beans were on the cusp of being spoiled.  Waitress was understanding and sent manager over. She looked about 12 years old so I know she was the real managers sounding board.  We had arrachera and it was the worst I have had in decades.  I urge everyone to stay away, I still ended up paying for on the steak that my husband ate because he was starving and half decent chile rellenos my mom ate . But no once touched the sides.  Wasted money."

She was so nice and adorable. Have you ever heard your waitress say, &#34;anything you need I&#39;m here for you&#34;?! Well that was the moment I decided she was coming with us!!!

I had the pick 3 combination plate with a quesadilla, a flauta, and an enchilada. All three were delicious but I liked the quesadilla the best as it had grilled onions on it and it was super cheesy. The rice was moist, the beans were flavorful, and the dollop of guac was tasty. The chips and salsa I can pass on next time because they weren&#39;t good at all...strange. 

Also had a delicious frozen mango margharita that gave the sweetest brain freeze and was absolutely refreshing. No wonder they boast their &#34;famous&#34; margharitas!!

Overall pretty good authentic Mexican fare. Our waitress was really sweet and even though we heard her use the same cute line on another table, we always appreciate good service...thanks Patsy."

Their corn husk wrapped tamales and sauce(s) are good.  Rather than the usual fajitas or combo platter, I ordered Tampico chicken which was excellent.

The first impression of the restaurant was great. Very nice decor, and the atmosphere was terrific. We ordered an appetizer and it came out in a very timely manner. However, when we received our main course, we were quite disappointed at the quality of the food. The food tasted very mediocre. Our main course was served w/ chicken noodle soup, which we thought was a very non-Mexican pairing. We&#39;ve had much better tasting Mexican food elsewhere, and paid fraction of what we paid here.

It does look like they have great selections of Margaritas, however, we didn&#39;t try their drink menu. This seems like a decent place for a larger gathering."

We only live a few blocks from Lalos in Schaumburg and we love it.  Why?  Two reasons: Margaritas and Guacamole.  

Most often, we don&#39;t even order food there.  They have table-side guacamole and the best margaritas in town.  The margs are little pricy, but they also have a ton of tequila in them... so it&#39;s pretty much worth it.

The service is always friendly and the food is decent.  I never really order any dinner there, we just order the appetizers.  

I really don&#39;t have too much to complain about except the bar area sometimes.  Once in a while, my parents and I will go to the bar area because you can get half off of the appetizers before 6 (I think) and one time we were the only ones in the bar and they were BLASTING the music.  I have no idea why, but we had to ask them to turn it down and for some reason they said no.  I couldn&#39;t really hear them but it was something to do with the sound system for later that night.  They should figure out better music to play in there some nights but most of the time it&#39;s a lot of fun.  

Stop by there for a quick margarita or at least some guac and I promise you&#39;ll be satisfied.  Definitely worth stepping out for on a summer night."

It was pretty good for being a buffet, they had everything from flautas to tamales, and AMAZING FAJITAS. 

We went a little after prime-time lunch, around 1:30, and you can obviously tell the food was left out a little while. But I&#39;m not going to complain because the food wasn&#39;t in a buffet style layout, rather chafing dishes you would use at a banquet party. 

For three people it came out to like $40 with soft drinks.

Still a favorite of ours.

The food is fresh and authentic.  I love the chips and salsa here, great homemade taste.  At the weekend lunch buffet, I also love the steak fajitas which are a perfect mix of vegetables and tender beef.  The eggs and rice are another favorite, again great homemade taste and flavor.  There&#39;s also a good variety of enchiladas.  We come here often with our kids and there&#39;s plenty for them to choose from (and they can be picky).

Ambiance is nice, colorfully decorated with soft music playing in the background. And the service is always friendly and attentive.

First of all, I have to admit that I had never heard of the &#34;smashburger&#34; concept until my current place of occupation.  I was required to watch a YouTube.com video of Chef Tom Ryan taking a few curious customers through the process of making a Smashburger, which was how my employers wanted their burgers to be leaving the kitchen to the customers.

Interestingly enough, during a recent trip to the Chicago Area, I spotted a Smashburger and was determined to try this burger that I had been supposedly emulating.  Shortly after walking into the restaurant, I was greeted by Kenyatta (I think that&#39;s how her name is spelled) and she took my order for a Classic Smash and a BBQ, Bacon &amp; Cheddar.  After my order was in, I asked if she wouldn&#39;t mind if I watched the process of how these Smashburgers were made, to which the cook on the flattop happily obliged.  Needless to say, it was enlightening to see the development of the burgers from start to finish in person.  And just as interesting was to observe the similarities and differences between Smashburger&#39;s ingredients and techniques and the establishment that I work for.

I have to say that the folks at Smashburger on Rand did a phenomenal job and I appreciate their willingness to let me check out the cooking process.  The burgers were really good, as I prefer my burgers to be seasoned on the exterior as opposed to the seasonings mixed into the protein.  I also found the thickness of the burger to be spot on, which allowed the beef to remain the hero of the burger rather than being lost among the toppings.  And although I&#39;m not a huge fan of breads that have a pronounced presence of eggs, the egg bun that was used worked perfectly with the overall burger, adding an extra flavor profile to the sandwich.

If I had a few more visits to try more things on the menu, I&#39;m confident a 5-star rating would be in the works."

They were busier than I recall in the past, but not that busy.  We placed our order and I found an open table which put me on guard as it was filthy and it looked like there wouldn&#39;t be any clean up while we were there so I took some napkins and water and cleaned the table so that at least wasn&#39;t sticky (looked like a toddler had smeared food all over).  While waiting for our food we checked the ketchup dispenser for the fries, it was basically empty! We went to 3 other tables checking the dispenser and they were all the same, empty.  I asked an employee for a Ketchup dispenser with some in it (the 3 empty dispensers were on the table in front of us), she said they had been really busy, picked up the 3 dispensers and started to walk away, I asked that she make sure we had ketchup for the meal, she gave me the BAD EYE and we never saw her again or any ketchup. 

The problem here is simple, they were understaffed and no adult managment visible... seems like the typical franchise operation with the owner not active, otherwise why would you permit the level of disarray, poor wait staff, and unsanitary surroundings exist.  I will not be back to this establishment again, there are others to go to that keep their premises operating to high standards of professionalism.

The food was average also, not ant better than most comparable competitors , 5 guys seems to consistently offer a better value."

One has many options to customize their food order. My serving was pretty straight and enjoyable. The salt content of everything seems modest.

Ordered the big classic smashburger with everything and smash fries. My two criticisms of the food were: 1) there was nothing special about the burger, and 2) not a fan of the shoe string sized fries and the smash seasoning on them - I didn&#39;t really taste the smash sauce against the ketchup and mustard in the burger, and the rosemary on the fries didn&#39;t pair well for me. 

With that said, even though I drove 15 min each way to try this place out, it still beats going to a McDonald&#39;s 1 min away. What I was really hoping for was a shake shack/in-and-out type burger, but ended up with a Culver&#39;s deluxe sans mayo and their tastier crinkle cut fries. 

Also, I tried placing an online order at ~3:25pm on a Wednesday afternoon. Next pickup time available was 3:45pm, which made sense, but by the time my ADD butt was finished ordering ~3:30pm, the pickup time had updated to 4pm.

We split the fries because there were plenty.  I didn&#39;t leave the place stuffed, but I was definitely satisified by the portions.

So, one of the employees checked on us and I said that the burger doesn&#39;t taste good. Its too salty,the meat tastes weird and its way too raw cooked on top of it. I asked if they changed anything about the meat, he said no. He offered a new burger and I was willing to give it another try. The second burger was better cooked, but the gross meattaste didn&#39;t change. So, even if it was a very nice move to make a new burger for me, it&#39;s not gonna make us come back to this place.

To start with, the establishment is nice with a clean modern look to it, and almost feels like a real restaurant.  The ordering process is simple and they have the option to create your own burger and multiple ways to have your fries prepared.

The burger....this is where I was disappointed.  It was a single patty (I had a regular) with fresh jalapenos and cheddar cheese on a chipotle roll.  I looked  good, but was slightly overcooked.  The flavor was just lacking.....It didn&#39;t taste/look/feel like a gourmet $10 burger should....I don&#39;t know, it just didn&#39;t do it for me.

Even the fries were somewhat of a disappointment.  I tried the spicy fries, which had good seasoning, but they fell short in volume.  I like thicker fries with some substance....not the shoestring fries they serve here.  

Overall The service was very good, they bring the food out to you and they clear the tables.  There is a fountain machine so beverages are unlimited.  It has a much cleaner look than five-guys, but the burger and fries pale in comparison to the standard of five-guys."

The woman behind the counter had her back to me, asking me now, if my order was to go, when I was not even up to the counter. She was in a hurry because as soon as she took my order she left making it known to me that she was not suppose to be taking my order. 
Besides the service, while I was waiting, I noticed how I did not like the decor. Very dull, for a 10$ burger, perhaps it should be a little more exciting to be inside. 
I got the Bean burger with no ranch and no cheese, with the fries and an order of fried pickles. The burger had no flavor besides the mustard I got on it. It was covered in some sort of grease. The fries, not worth my time.  The pickles were super super salty. I couldn&#39;t use any of the napkins provided because they too were covered in grease. And in addition, in my bag of food, I got ranch. Smashburger will not try it again."

Sorry, husband.

Not only are the smash fries da bomb, the windy city burger makes my world go round.  And at the AH location, the employees are super friendly.  One time we had a little error on our order so we politely complained about it. The manager came over and was so apologetic and offered us some coupons for our next visit.

If the decor were more elegant like Tom &amp; Eddies or the taste stronger like Five Guys, then maybe the price could be more justified. But, it&#39;s one of those places that has potential but falls just short enough to be noticeable at the moment.

The burgers themselves are pretty decent sized and the ingredients are pretty good. However, the patty really doesn&#39;t have much flavor for me. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because of the meat or the way it&#39;s seasoned but it&#39;s pretty flat. That could be why the burger combinations come with so many extra ingredients so that the taste of the beef is less noticeable, particularly on the BBQ, Bacon, and Cheddar where I tasted every ingredient except the beef.

I find the sides to be a tad heavy in salt, particularly the smashfries and haystack onions. The grilled chicken was okay but I still wasn&#39;t particularly thrilled with the cooking style.

I had high hopes for this place since it&#39;s very conveniently located near where I shop and a lot of places I visit regularly. Hopefully they will improve dramatically after another month of operation."

The concept is cute, the offerings city specific and while everything seemed to line up for a stellar eating experience, the food fell a bit flat for me.

As mentioned, the setup is pretty straight forward - a friendly employee takes your order (chicken, burgers, sides, drinks), snag a number and grab a seat in the clean establishment. Our food came out fairly quickly, served up by another friendly face. All good things. 

My Windy City burger - complete with mustard, fried onions on a pretzel bun - was fine. Just fine. Nothing to write home about. The fried onions were a nice touch, but the actual burger was lacking in flavor and pizzazz. Same goes for the sweet potato fries - the portion wasn&#39;t huge and neither was the flavor. Again - nothing was offensive by any means, but I don&#39;t find myself craving anything I ordered. 

If I make my way back in, I would definitely want to sample a chicken sandwich or the smash fries...there&#39;s always a next meal!"

This is an unpretentious semi fast food burgers and fries restaurant. Their burgers are a cut or two above your typical fast food offerings. The beef quality is good and they don&#39;t overcook them to death. They do tend to oversalt them however. You can barely tell their chesseburgers have cheese on them. The shoe string fries when freshly prepared are good, not outstanding. Likewise the rather unique haystack onions side can be a rewarding experience when they&#39;re fresh tasting.

I really enjoyed my prior experience at the Deer Park location, so I figured I would meet up with her for a quick dinner last night.  The line was out the door at about 6 pm on a Friday night.  However, it moved pretty quickly.

I decided to mix it up and I ordered the Club burger with the chipotle mayo on it and a chipotle bun. Yummy.  I also ordered the sweet potato Smashfries which I loved in Deer Park.

The food took about ten minutes to get since the line was backed up, I was not upset since I figured it would be fresh then.  I was a little upset that they got both of our orders wrong.  Mine was on a whole wheat bun which I cannot eat due to my diet.  They asked me if I was OK with then moving my burger onto another bun.  I said sure since I would hate to waste the entire burger.  They also forgot the Chipotle sauce on my friend&#39;s burger so they brought that out on the side.  I noticed that a couple other had to send the food back for mistakes as well which kind of stinks.

The food was okay, but again not as good as the Deer Park location.  The portions were also much smaller.  My side of sweet potato fries was a mound at Deer Park and barely filled the basket here.  I still like Smashburger... but I will be avoiding this location!

Oh and after reading Ericka&#39;s review I am sad I didn&#39;t even get a sorry for both of our ortders being messed up and she got a letter from Smashburger... sad :("

The burger was pretty greasy. While they taste OK, the fries are about as fresh as last week&#39;s garbage. If they could solve the grease problem and serve better fries, this place could be a contender.

Instead, head to Meatheads in The Streets of Woodfield for a better burger and to Burger Fi in Glenview for much better fries.

They have never batted an eyelash at serving a burger without the bun on the plate.  They have chicken breasts as well, and allow you to customize the heck out of everything.  The fry options include sweet potatoes and the veggie frites (which are carrot and green beans).  This makes this place one of the few that can actually fit into a low carb or paleo diet without a huge amount of (wink wink) cheating.  This location offers some outdoor seating near the parking lot, and ample indoor seating with tons of natural light since this is the corner store and they have windows on two walls.  The service here for us has always been nice.  I&#39;ve never seen it that crowded.  It does bother me that we always swap out the ranch dip that comes with the veggie frites for another sauce, and they can never seem to get that right.  They have three choices of iced tea, milkshakes, and a conventional fountain.  (Time to go with the million drink option, come on Smashburger, pony up!) There is plenty of parking in this mall.

The option of sweet potato fries is very welcoming to my belly. 

I wish the layout of the restaurant was engineered better. Everything seems to logjam at any busy time of the day. The option for seating for to-go orders is nearly nonexistent. Also, get the manager a table to stand behind, something branded, while he&#39;s getting to-go orders out of the window and yelling that person&#39;s name. It makes it feel so disorganized and stressful. Plus, that can&#39;t make a great dining experience for those who choose to dine in the restaurant.

The Arlington Heights Smashburger gladly accepted them and my survey promo codes from previous visits (Doesn&#39;t everyone have five coupons in their pockets from visiting the same burger joint 1-2x a week?)

I have to admit that the Wheaton location is still the gold standard of Smashburgers for me, but AH is doing well for themselves and much better than Schaumburg. We showed up around 8pm and were helped immediately. The cashier said she&#39;d check if they&#39;d accept my vouchers and let me upgrade from the free regular burger to a &#34;Big Smash&#34; for an upcharge, but there was no doubt that they&#39;d honor them even though they were from a different store. The manager here said they couldn&#39;t run the promo codes correctly and it wouldn&#39;t work; however, he found a way around the system and basically comped one burger, used the survey codes for the two sides and charged me an expired coupon price for the second burger. He said, &#34;It&#39;s gonna look a little weird, but it makes it so you just pay the $2 more for upgrading.&#34; Hey, I don&#39;t care if the receipt is in another language as long as the math is correct.

Fast, friendly, clean and delicious. Employees checked on us multiple times but didn&#39;t hover. The manager even cleared our table and answered some of our questions. The makings of a great Smashburger! The Windy City Smash with ranch instead of mustard is my go-to. I drove 11.4 miles just to get my burger on and they didn&#39;t make me regret the trek."

I had the Windy City burger. I was impressed. It was very flavorful and the patty was a good size. My boyfriend and I each got a burger and fries and a drink to share. It was on the expensive side. I wouldn&#39;t compare it to five guys. The fries and five guys are way better. I would go back but not get the fries.

So one afternoon during lunch I decided to give it a try. There was a small line and the wait for the food was a little longer than I expected for a food joint like this. I ordered the classic smash with fries and a drink. 12 bucks seemed a little on the high side but whatever. The burger was average and VERY greasy. The reason this is 3 instead of 2 stars is the fries. The fries were very tasty and above average in my opinion. I might come back and try the chicken selections.

Out of the three burger places I go to for good burgers, Smash Burger is one of them. Nothing beats a classic cheeseburger! If you haven&#39;t tried it and want something on par with Meatheads and Five Guys, I would suggest Smash Burger - their fries are the best!

It is a little pricey, but like the aforementioned places, I think they&#39;re worth the price, and Smash Burger is no exception."

A fantastic menu, as fast food goes. Fried pickles, fries with olive oil and rosemary, shakes...everything you need/want, and a cut above in quality, selection, taste, and comfort. 

I got the 1/2 lb burger with lettuce, blue cheese, and fried onions. Note to management: lettuce was a single (slightly) limp leaf, blue cheese was a (slightly) watery salad dressing, and on the side. Note to Yelpers: in combination it tasted great, though a shade salty. With the fried pickles, was expecting mass-produced-and-frozen uniformity, with that crappy coating you taste in your nightmares. Not so with these, though &#39;salty&#39; is the dominant taste, even when dipped. 

The Mrs. loves the black bean burger.

This is a very straightforward place with a simple menu, but they do what they do very well. 

The burgers are tasty and filling. Smashburger offers a variety of burgers or the chance to select your own ingredients. I tend to go with the Classic Smashburger in the 1/3 pound size. A while back they had a special Wedge Club Burger with iceburg lettuce, bacon, tomato, and blue cheese. This was fantastic, and I got one every week until they dropped it. Whatever burger you choose will be cooked to order, and it will have true beef flavor. I will pair it with an order of sweet potato fries or a milk shake. Both are of these excellent, but I can only down one or the other without going full bore into gluttony. The shakes really do shine, though, and you get extra shake in the metal mixing cup when you eat in. The Haagen Dazs strawberry shake is my choice, but they have chocolate, vanilla, and special flavors, too. I appreciate the option of having a Green River or a beer for my beverage, too.

My wife does not eat red meat, but she always says good things about their salads (very large), veggie burger, and chicken sandwich. She agrees with me on the shakes, and she is usually indifferent about milk shakes.

My only complaint about this Smashburger is that it is quite small. Depending on what time you go, seating can be at a premium. I find Smashburgers are a bit better if you eat in. 

On balance, I would rate Smashburger higher than similar fast casual places such as Five Guys for their consistency and well-seasoned beefy burgers."

Environment: This was a new store so it was busy and pretty packed. The place was clean, bright and inviting.

Staff: So far so good. They were all friendly and helpful.

Miscellaneous: I&#39;m just so happy there&#39;s a good burger joint that&#39;s in the neighborhood. Its a real treat, and not that I don&#39;t love Wendy&#39;s or Portillos, but the variety is definitely refreshing and appealing."

1.  Kitchen is hidden behind a small window, so no access to see what is going on back there.

Carry-out was efficient. Their special fries were decent but nothing to get excited about.  Have eaten there a few times, a couple of times the burgers were decent.  One time for lunch the burger was overcooked and dry and the bun was dry and like sawdust.  The kids menu chicken fingers are pretty good.

To me it seems that their ordering process is really overly complicated.  They overload you with what looks like two entire pages of choices that you have to figure out in order to get your transaction completed.  I&#39;m so rattled trying to keep everything straight that I never remember to order the sweet potato fries.

I will add that in reading other reviews there are comments about the price - and now that you mention it you&#39;re right.  Paying $7 or $8 for a fast-food style burger here is a pretty big travesty compared to the big $9 real gourmet burgers at a pub like the Bad Apple.  So I&#39;m downgrading them to two stars.

I noted the drink station needed some tending to and the carpeted flooring had debris and a rather huge hunk of bun under a table. Don&#39;t like the idea of the plastic glasses for beverages are stored sideways under the front counter, thus allowing the rim of every glass to touch the shelf below.

Many people think this burger joint has gotten its name because after you take one bite, you&#39;ll just &#34;smash&#34; the entire burger down.  While the latter is true, it is not why the restaurant got its name.  Smashburger got its name from the way they cook the burger.  Smashburger knows that if you literally smash down the beef patty on the grill with the spatula it&#39;s sears the meat, lightly crisps the edges, and rapidly cooks the burger.  All this allows the burger to keep the juices locked inside.  The result is one smashing burger.  Try their signature onion straws or smash fries which blend olive oil, rosemary and garlic with the fries!!!!   It&#39;ll all cost you just under $10 bucks, but it&#39;s quite an experience!

The bun was very soft and fresh. The fries were a little different.

 I ordered a chevapi which I&#39;ve only had once before. Actually never heard of it before finding this place on yelp. It&#39;s basically little sausages and as little sausages go this was decent. A little fattier than I was looking for but went great with the nice bread and onions. I&#39;m not sure what the white spread is. 

I also ordered a cheese pie. It was good but was a bit over powered by what seems to be margarine. 

They have a fridge case with cheese pop and gallons of milk. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s great for the bear by apartments. 

If you are more familiar than I with the cuisine give it a try. I would try it again if I&#39;m in the area. Maybe a different meat and that Mediterranean looking salad."

The menu is simple which I liked and then of the other customer spoke English so I felt like I was in Bosnia making it more authentic. I ordered the spicy beef sausage and also the meat pie (Burek) beef sausage was the only spicy dish they had an even so was on the mild side wouldn&#39;t even make a baby cry.

For this reason I had never checked them out but being that we were in the area and my Bosnian friend was pushing the agenda, we stopped in for a quick lunch.   

Per their menu and per my friend&#39;s explanation, Bosnian food is about experiencing the food for what it is.  You experience the food for the natural flavors that come from them.  Take a look at a few of the photos posted here on Yelp.  Their Cevapcici (&#34;chevapi&#34;) meal is basic.  A moist, spongy like bread served with a top and bottom.  (This bread begs to be dipped but I haven&#39;t seen any sauces or dips to speak of)  Sausages rolled and look like a plumper version of &#34;brown and serve&#34; sausages.  On the side, a serving of a creamy cheese and a wedge of onion cut with pieces the length of your finger.  You pull some bread and dip it in cheese, take a bite of the sausage with onion.  My friend looks at me and says &#34;whoa, the onion is so spicy buddy&#34; and there&#39;s your spice.  He bought a few &#34;pies&#34; for his children and mentioned that he often buys these for them, when he&#39;s nearby.  He&#39;s tried the same in Skokie, but the taste wasn&#39;t as good.  The pictures section contains a copy of their current menu.  It&#39;s limited and pricing is perfect for the type of food.  

If trying this for the first time, it&#39;s good to get an entree and then order a pie for sharing.  Cheese, meat, spinach, it&#39;s all good and only $5 dollars each.  Think fresh baked pastry, moist and easy to pull apart and enjoy.  I&#39;ve had a meat pie with a side of onion slices and felt satisfied.  Lunch for two will not break the bank and as my buddy says &#34;better for you buddy, than eating fast food.&#34;  Since our first lunch here about a three weeks ago today, I&#39;ve been back three times.  I like the simple quality to it, the inexpensive pricing and I love bread.  Oh and they offer European drinks.  There&#39;s this cola like drink called &#34;Cockta&#34;, it&#39;s like cola and root beer. Interesting flavor.  Try it.

As mentioned by another, it&#39;s a hole in the wall kind of place. Basic, if you aren&#39;t looking for the small yellow sign, you&#39;ll drive by without notice."

We fell in love with cevapi at another restaurant that used to be open in the Wheaton area, but closed down.  We have been on the prowl for a replacement and lo and behold, we came across Bosna Grill on yelp and gave it a shot...

The restaurant is easy to miss on some little strip mall next to some apartment residences.  A small yellow sign with simple black writing hangs over the restaurant.  Inside is hole-in-the-wall in a good sense....small, cozy, and very clean.  First sign that I knew it would be legit is that on a Saturday afternoon, it was filled with Bosnian families....check!  

Ordered the cevapi and grabbed a table....food came shortly...HUGE portions.  Husband and I ordered a cevapi each....$7 each...great deal!  Comes with creamy homemade white cheese spread and some onions to eat with the bread.  The Bosnian bread is definitely superior to other cevapi I have had...outside is crisp....inside is soft, fluffy, slightly chewy, and soaked with the yummy meat juices from the sausages.  Lift up that top piece of bread and there is a waft of steaming deliciousness.  Sausages are tender and nicely spiced...tasty! My husband and I both didn&#39;t finish our portions and packed it up to go.  YUM!  Definitely will be a repeat visit!"

Naturally, I went with the Bosnian style chevapi. It was served on the most perfectly meat soaked and grilled lepinja bread that I&#39;ve had in the US. Don&#39;t know how they do it, but it stays moist in the middle and gets crispy on the edges. It&#39;s a work of art.

Contrary to popular belief, Bosnian food isn&#39;t just chevapi. You can also get sudzukice, pljeskavica (similar to a hamburger), stuffed pljeskavica, chicken, the four most popular types of burek/pita: cheese, meat, greens or potato, your choice of four different salads (I recommend the shopska) or the &#34;diet&#34; chevapi platter which has five sausages, French fries and vegetables.

If you didn&#39;t know to look for this place you&#39;ll easily pass it up. The inside of the restaurant isn&#39;t much to look at either, but it is clean. That&#39;s all I care about. The decor may be humble and downplayed, but the food is not. And you probably won&#39;t even notice the bluish-pink walls and generic flower art with your face shoved into your meal."

I wasn&#39;t disappointed. 

There was nothing on the menu I had ever sampled before (including cevapi), but I am generally a sucker for grilled meats of all cultures, so I took the owner&#39;s advice and went for the sudzukice, a spicy beef sausage.

Four foot-long links of the sausage were served sandwiched between two buttery pita shells (which were wonderful), with tomato, onion, and a homemade mayo on the side. So delicious. I&#39;m definitely on-board with any sandwich shop in my neighborhood that can turn around humble food that tastes as good as this does, so I&#39;ll definitely be back.

The place is spartan, at best. Five tables inside a small storefront in a strip mall location easily missed. As a matter of fact, I worry a little about the long-term longevity of the restaurant because it&#39;s awfully hard to notice from the street. The menu is limited, too, with cevapi, sudzukice, pljeskavica (filled and regular), a meat platter (which I assume to be a mix of the three), and chicken strips as your meal selections, along with four pita sandwiches and three types of salads. There is a special of the day (sausage-stuffed cabbage, yesterday) as well.

I&#39;m okay with limited selection and I&#39;m definitely okay with simple, basic food, so the four stars? That&#39;s for the taste. The platter I ordered made two good sausage sandwiches (er, pitas), and I devoured both with relish (the metaphorical kind - I don&#39;t keep real relish on hand at home).

The owners seemed enthusiastic and eager to please as well. I hope they find success with this restaurant. They seem like good people."

I know what this food is, I grew up eating it and venture out to numerous places on the north side that serve it.  Since it was my first time here I ordered the mixed meat platter.  I have to say that I was looking forward to the cevapcici based on the reviews I read here.  This is where my disappointment started.  They were store bought Sarajevska Cevapcici.  As easy as they are to make, for this style ground beef and ground lamb, add garlic, salt and pepper, they were surprisingly bland.  I could have just as easily have stopped by numerous places closer to my house for homemade food for the same price.  The chicken while cooked perfectly was underseasoned.  The shining star of the plate however was the pleskavica which is basically a Balkan hamburger.  Cooked to perfection and full of flavor.  That said I will be back and will not be ordering the mix plate but the pleskavica.  I will also give the Bosansko Pleskavica a try as well which is the standard but from the menu it appears they top it off with feta."

Love the Japanese style business model. Here&#39;s what I loved about the place:

Clean - It&#39;s new, so I suppose it should be clean, but it just felt like a healthy, neat, tidy environment where I had no qualms about eating the food. 

Nice Service - The one attendant was very friendly, nice and pleasant. 

Beautiful food - Even if you can go in there and not buy SOMETHING you want to try, it&#39;s all eye candy! Cool displays. Neatly organized. Lovely packaging. Just fun to look at everything!

It&#39;s Cute - While my male friend did enjoy the treats and the experience, I can&#39;t exactly see a bunch of burly dudes strolling in for an adorable, cream-filled, perfectly garnished bun (but I&#39;ll bet they want to try everything in the place!). 

Value - While I thought a few of the items were a teensy bit pricey, I would say that 80 percent of what I evaluated seemed well worth the price for what you were receiving. 

YUMMMY - Tried a few things- I would highly recommend the Croque Monsieur (just do it - yeah it&#39;s full of butter and other sinfully delicious things but if you&#39;re gonna eat it, eat it with abandon). Also had the red bean bun and the jalapeno hotdog thing. The standout in each item was the bread/pastry. Scrumptious!

I will say it was my first visit (they just opened a short time ago) but I will definitely go back and try some other treats. They have a full array of beverages and also shave ice (Please note: NOT a sno-cone at all). I will be back to try more for sho!"

It&#39;s got way more seating and soft lighting which is nice. The set up is similar Grab a tray and some tongs and have at it! I realize it was end of day so I expected slim pickin&#39;s. There were still fresh croissants, very expensive filled donuts (like around 5 bucks each!!) And the donuts were petite little things. We ordered hot chocolate and a coconut latte which were piping hot and creamy good. With our drinks we had a strawberry creme filled croissant and a chocolate croissant (a tad disappointed cause I thing chocolate filled not just drizzle when I see chocolate croissant)  Aside from the pricing- it&#39;s a nice place. I will go again to try the morning or midday stuff. I&#39;m happy there are these Euro Asian bakeries around---it&#39;s thrilling to me. Schaumburg needs international flair. Great place to meet friends for coffee and a treat :-)"

Went to the grand opening today after work. I always love a good korean bakery! 

The place was empty and there wasn&#39;t a lot to choose from, but I found a couple things I liked. Everything I got was good and super fresh!

They were bringing stuff out while I was looking so some things were warm. I thought that was nice.

It&#39;s just weird that around the corner from tous les jours. They had a lot of the same stuff, but a lot of different stuff as well. Price was pretty much the same as them too.

I&#39;d come back to try some baked goods I didn&#39;t get to try :)"

This is a Korean owned bakery with sweet and savory options, coffee, and shaved ice!  Basically something for everyone!  

I love the spacious feeling in this bakery as well.  Walking in reminded me a lot of Tous Le Jour but much less cramped feeling.  They have WiFi as well so a great option to get some work done with coffee and pastry.

The only thing that keeps me from giving the 5th star is that everything I tried was a tad too sweet.  Even the savory option of cheese and ham bun.  It was actually more sweet than savory.  

A few surprises:
Ham &amp; Cheese bun - Is more like pizza with the diced green peppers inside.

Hazelnut pastry - I thought in my mind...chopped hazelnuts with sugar filling...I bit into it and found something resembling nutella.  Delicious anyways but just not what I was fantasizing about."

Bonus points- the have soy milk."

It sounded intriguing so I patiently waited for it to open. Now I&#39;m used to American bakeries and Polish bakeries where the staff waits on you and the customer just points at what they want. I stood there for about five seconds before someone asked if I needed help. We&#39;ll duh, I look like a dear in headlights. The thought of people opening and closing those cases with dirty hands made me a weeeeeee bit concerned. So you get your little tray and a set of tongs and go to town picking out your goodies. I went with the strawberry and cream croissant, a bread with like a hot dog in it, a chocolate croissant and some kind of honey glazed bun with custard. You take your little tray to the cashier and then you pay. I didn&#39;t like that they put each pastry into a paper bag instead of a box. They were all rolling around in a bigger bag which I think defeated the purpose if I was buying these for entertaining guests. But since they were just for me I dealt with it. Onto the 4 tasting!  The best of everything was the custard thing, it was sweet and flakes. The strawberry croissant was very good too, thought shouldn&#39;t a cream pastry be refrigerated?  It was a bit mushy from the wet things sitting on the soft dough. The chocolate croisant wad a TOTAL waste of time. I for sure thought it would be stuffed with a chocolate of some kind. But no. It just had some swirles of chocolate on the top. Bummer. Last but not least the hot dog thing. It looked almost like a little spider with all the segments. I thought it was good but weirdly sweet? Maybe it was the sauce or something but I don&#39;t think meat should have a sweet flavor. Might not be for my palette. Didn&#39;t get any coffee or drinks because I was going to compare head to head with tous le jours since the items are so similar. But the line was super long and I was hungry! I&#39;ll be checking out the similar items from there another time!"

Sushi rolls and desserts circle around on a conveyer belt. Once you are ready to pick your sushi selection, you simply open the container and take your dish out. At the end of your meal, the waitress totals out your plates and you go to the counter and pay. 

My favorite rolls were: 
The Spicy Hanako roll 
Magma roll topped with crispy tempura 
Boston roll 

Sushi roll plates are reasonable priced between 3-6 dollars. Will definitely be returning for more!"

The service here entirely depends on who your server is and what mood they&#39;re in. 
My family and I have frequented this place for many, many years and even if the service isn&#39;t above and beyond, it&#39;s rarely ever worth complaining about. However, my server today was rude, extremely impatient,  and careless, and when I asked the manager/asst mgr for my server&#39;s name I was asked why I wanted to know. When I explained, she told me &#34;oh really? Oh, well&#34; and shrugged her shoulders. When I asked for her name again, she simply said &#34;No&#34;

Ten minutes into having a few disappointing pieces of sushi, the owner, Mr. Shitshi Nazi, demanded that my husband stop feeding our one year old the precut strawberries we brought as snacks from home because strawberries are served on their sushi conveyor belt. That is their &#34;outside food policy&#34; and they will only make exception for &#34;babies with no teeth&#34;. Our teething one year old didn&#39;t qualify for the exception...

When I audibly spoke up about the absurdity of the policy while paying the bill up front, Mr. Shitii Namushikuru, threatened to call the police and to &#34;banish&#34; me forever. 

No worries, Mr. Shitgo Nasamoron! I have forever &#34;banished&#34; myself from your establishment.

I am NOT RETURNING for the SUB PAR, UNAPPETIZING, OVERLYPRICED, UNWELCOMING, CRAMPED, UNFRIENDLY TO KIDS, and RUDE SERVICE experience. My teething child will not be back with his strawberries to jeopardize the monopolizing powers of your strawberries!

See you NEVER EVER sushi station!!!"

I probably wouldn&#39;t wait no more than 25+ minutes to eat here, but the experience of the conveyor belt is pretty fun, especially for first-timers.

It definitely depends on what time you go, but I&#39;ve been able to get seated within 20 minutes during dinner time (around 7:30ish). There have been times where the wait was over 40 minutes, but that was more around lunch time/early dinner (5ish), and we would just go to another place.

Since this place depends on the conveyor belt to do the serving, it sometimes takes awhile to get something that you&#39;re waiting for, especially if you&#39;re sitting at the very far end of the belt. There are servers that are around to take your order for you, which I 100% recommend for when ordering rolls with raw fish. 

The menu hasn&#39;t changed that much (if there are any) since first coming here 6+ years back. The plates are color coordinated by pricing which ranges from from $1.25 to $6.25-ish and the portions usually come with 2-4 pieces depending on what you order.

I&#39;m the kind of person that definitely loves trying new rolls, but I&#39;m often hesitant on ordering a whole roll in case I don&#39;t like it that much. This place offers rolls at 4 pieces at a time-- which is just enough for me to figure out if I like it or not. The 4 piece portions also help with pacing yourself while eating, since it&#39;s sometimes easy to order way too much and having too many leftovers. 

The variety on the menu and quality of the food is just OK. They have the traditional rolls, such as California, Philadelphia, Spicy Tuna, etc., and they have some interesting ones like Italian and Mexican inspired rolls. They also have the traditional nigiri pieces, but I didn&#39;t find them tasting as fresh as I would&#39;ve liked them to be. The selection of appetizers and desserts is pretty big and offered a good variety. 

Overall, I&#39;d say everyone should try it at least once. Again, it isn&#39;t something worth waiting for 30 minutes for (in my opinion), but the experience is fun."

Long as there&#39;s no wait. You sit, grab whatever you see you want to have and then ask for the check and pay at the cashier. That easy. The quality of the sushis not so great.

Thee conveyor belt sushi in the Midwest. Today, I get the experience the fun and awesomeness of plucking a plate from the conveyor belt without the 12 hour flight to japan. 

Yes, there&#39;s that spot in Toronto last time we visited there. But this spot is a bit more of the proper conveyor belt type that you see in japan. I come here and I usually lean towards the nigiri sushi type. The cuts here are pretty good. The fish is definitely fresh and it&#39;s very delish.

If there&#39;s anything you&#39;re wanting that&#39;s hasn&#39;t passed by at all. Just flag down the super attentive attendant and she&#39;ll fetch you the certain something that you&#39;re craving. My fiance&#39; and my friend loves the desserts here as well. I happen to enjoy their green tea parfait. That right there is worth coming here and ending your meal with. 

The setting is really nice. Strictly down to business type of eating. The service is great, they kept our tables clear of the covers and kept our tea topped off every time it needed it.

While it&#39;s not &#34;high sushi&#34;, it was fun for me and my son to stop in for lunch, and I think we ate way more than we normally would, because we kept grabbing things off of the conveyor belt. Our favorites were the spicy tuna Phoenix roll and the Wild Tiger special rolls. The Caterpillar roll, while normally a go to, completely fell apart.  The prices were really good, and the color of the plates tell you the price.

Dear Shingo, owner of the rolling meadows sushi station. Your ability to make decisions as a business owner is completely asinine. They have this thing called honey lemon salmon, which is coated in mayonnaise. I am allergic to raw eggs, and too much mayo can make me very sick. I asked for a condiment on the side, and they absolutely refuse. Their reasoning this time was that. &#34;Their food is made the way it&#39;s made and they cannot change it&#34;. Even when someone has allergies. The problem with this, is that this is the SECOND time this issue happened. It happened previously in June and I spoke with Andrea at Yamasho Inc., their managing company and she agreed that this practice was wrong and that it&#39;s ridiculous that a restaurant can&#39;t simply put a condiment on the side and said that if I ever went back, this situation would NOT occur again. Well, my son begged me to come back here for his 5th birthday and since it was his day, we went with it.  Of course, they made a big to do and the manager, Shingo said &#34;please use my name when you speak with Yamasho.  I am the owner&#39;s son.&#34;  Well Shingo and Yamasho, you lost the business of someone who spent lots of money at your restaurant, my extended family, friends, and hopefully anyone who reads this by refusing to accommodate someone with a food allergy by simply not putting a condiment on a piece of salmon.  #byefelicia"

i always feel full before i leave here, only spending $20-$25. that is CRAZY good imo considering the amount i eat. i love the phoenix roll, san diego, wildfire, station roll, etc. etc. they have good options, especially for people getting into sushi (like i said, not the fanciest but there&#39;s a nice range to choose from).

service is fine for the most part, there&#39;s one lady that is always nice and attentative.. wish i knew her name but she has short hair and is over by the fridge whenever i dine in.

overall, i&#39;d say sushi station is a good option for when you want a lot of decent sushi for a small price."

I have been doing so for the past 6 years for lunch as I work close by. Up until the last 8 months, service and the food have been decent. Now, I have had 3 experiences that had turned me off to this restaurant. 

Their lunch hours are 11:30 until 2pm, but their kitchen closes at 1:45. However, at 1pm they start pulling everything off the belt and do not add any more sushi. I have added pictures to show this. They claim that it is because they are slow, and would have to throw the sushi away, but they pull the sushi with all the seats full and people waiting. 

This has happened 3 times. The third time I ordered from the kitchen as the suggested as soon as I arrived, but the orders took too long and I had to leave to go back to work. Why be open until 2, but sacrifice service and the availability of food at 1pm? 

During dinner hours and early in the lunch hour, the waiters push you to leave the table and eat quickly. Many of the dishes with sauce is haphazardly slathered on. The sushi is also inconsistent with some rolls being different sizes and others not having the same amount of ingredients. When I asked the manager about these issues, I was brushed off. 

I would not recommend if you arrive at 1pm or later during lunch, or plan to not be rushed."

If you don&#39;t want to deal with their attitude then I advise you to order a platter to go do you can enjoy it in the comfort of your home. Other then that it&#39;s Best sushi yet!!

It is also the graciousness with which you are served.  Do not eat at an establishment that is willing to insult you.  

Upon bringing a freshness issue to the attention of the female owner/manager, we quickly learned that the efficient and friendly service that we had experienced from the waitstaff over the years was really likely a resultant fear of the female owner/manager.  The subsequent food-born illness we experienced the following day was an odd vindication.  It just goes to show you that no matter how much you have patronized an eating establishment, and no matter how much money you have spent, one must never take honor for granted.  The female owner/manager is without honor and without humility.  So be it.  We shake the proverbial dirt on our slippers from here as the search for honorable sushi in the suburbs continues."

It melts in your mouth taste like butter! And I like their hot n spicy scallops nigiri, yum!
I also like their take out. They are polite and quick! I had to contain myself from eating my order in the car....I&#39;m almost home hang in there gurl, lol!

Any fan of sushi have got to try this place. It is a revolving belt that goes around the restaurant. Their plates are color coded and priced according to the plate you take from the window. There is also a menu that you can order from if you like but waiting is more fun for most people.  There are chopsticks by your table or bar side so you would not need to ask for them.  You can also ask for silverware if that is your thing.  There is little plates for soy sauce with an option of lighter soy for the people who want less salt.  You can also find packets of wasabi by where you sit and a wooden box full of pickled ginger where you can get as much as your heart desires (which no other sushi bars or restaurants will ever do!)  The sushi pieces are also the biggest you will see compared to most locations. The staff are very friendly and they split their tip so they do work together. The place could be a little bigger but I guess it&#39;s nice that the manage what they can serve. Overall of all the sushi places we have gone to this is our number one recommended place.

Love that you can sit down and start eating immediately.  Love that there is almost no waste because you only take what you can eat from the conveyor belt.  We go here almost every week and only had a short wait for seats once.  We haven&#39;t ordered off the menu but will try it out next time we visit.  The only negative is the boxes of ginger that sit on the counter the entire day that is questionable on sanitation.

The food here is delicious, which is why they get two stars. The reason why I&#39;m giving a poor review is because it feels like every time I come here they&#39;re closed. Their hours are constantly changing, people are constantly being disappointed when they go to the doors to eat at their favorite sushi restaurant. 
I even looked up their hours before hand, it says they&#39;re open 12-9 on Sunday but after driving for 30 minutes and arriving there&#39;s a sign that says their hours are 4-9. You&#39;re open for 5 hours on a Sunday?!? Bogus."

Once you&#39;re seated, it&#39;s a free for all. You can choose whatever plate that comes your way, keeping in mind that the color of the plate indicates the price (~1-5 dollars a plate). You can eat $5 worth, or ~$70 like my family of three adults. SS has udon and other entrees and sushi available a la carte. The red bean mochi dessert is a must!!

The sushi here is slightly better than average, but usually nothing outstanding.   The prices are OK, but you will spend a bit of money if you come here on an empty stomach.    Also, the atmosphere is not for everyone.   However, overall it&#39;s a lot of good fun, and well worth your time to visit.

GOOD:    One of the very last kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi chains in America, and last I looked the only one to be found in the Chicago area.   If you love sushi, you&#39;d have to have a heart of stone not to have fun here.   It&#39;s such a great experience being able to pick of your lunch items one by one from the fast-moving conveyor belt.    During busy meal times, the lineup changes rapidly -- that good looking hamachi you see rolling by may be gone before it comes around again, replaced by something else.     I have fond memories of the kaiten-zushi joints in Japan and Hawaii, and Sushi Station is the only place around where I can replicate the experience.    The service here is also good (once you are seated - see below), and the items from the menu nicely supplement what whizzes by on the conveyor belt.   Try the fatty salmon and the seared tataki.

MEH:   The bric-a-brac plasticy ambiance is a bit sad and claustrophobic when this place gets crowded.   And unless you time your visit carefully, prepare to wait to be seated.  The time before you are seated can be a bit unnerving, as the very busy staff rushes by and barks waiting customers into holding areas to wait for seats to open up.   For ordinary sushi, you may end up paying a lot of money, because it&#39;s harder to control portions when food keeps whizzing by.

OVERALL:   I have better quality sushi closer to home, and I generally prefer a more refined atmosphere and broader menu.   But it&#39;s the novelty and fun and variety of sushi staples you can choose on a whim that keep us coming back over and over again.    I&#39;ll probably visit again in the next few weeks."

I paid by credit card and was reaching into my purse to get cash for the tip (jar is at the counter) and the cashiers points and my receipt and says, &#34;no tip, you have to tip!&#34;  I had not even stepped away from the register!  I thought people appreciated cash tips!!  We are very regular customers and have always tipped.  What they should have said is - &#34;did you have a problem with your service?  &#34;  if someone was forgetting to tip it would remind them, if someone was cheap it would be a nicer reminder and if someone was not tipping intentionally because of a problem they would know about it and fix it!

I&#39;m going to do the same thing next time - perhaps with more hesitation and if they are rude again I&#39;m going to say something (I was in shock last time....)"

This place is a small little gem hidden in front of the Walmart Plaza. It features a carousel of different types of sushi, maki and even speciality items and desserts. I have a tendency to try all different kinds when It is roughly around $4 a plate depending on its color. Some plates have bigger rolls or more rolls and the price fluctuates. A good thing to order is the Miso Soup prior to eating sushi. 

The only issue that I have with this place is this place  does not enough seats so you are sitting elbows to elbows with strangers. Another thing is they are pretty pushy about getting a tip when they rarely serve you as most of it is taken off the carousel. They just bring out your drinks and or anything you order special off the menu. Overall a good place to get sushi and catch up with friends."

Food isn&#39;t too great and is expensive for only 4 or 2 rolls on a plate and does not satisfy my hunger. It&#39;s just fun to go there for the experience.

 The waitress I had was really annoying and did not leave us alone and it felt like she was rushing us out the door. I&#39;m for great customer service but it&#39;s also nice to have space and just enjoy your time with people you come with instead of always being asked if we need a refill, the check, if we wanted to order something every 2 minutes. We only stayed there for 10 minutes, that&#39;s how badly she was rushing us to get the check and kick us out. We usually go up to the register to pay ourselves but she did it for us, that&#39;s how I knew she definitely did not like us and wanted us out the door as fast as possible."

The only sushi I really wanted but was hard to get was salt water eel. However, I was able to order it with my waitress and they brought it to me. As anticipated, it tasted excellent.

It was a great place to take out of town guests and friends alike.  Food was OK but the conveyor belt service was so fun.

Recently, however, a misguided owner decided to fill this tiny establishment with 5 60&#34;+ LCD tvs, plus a small one in a hall.  5 60&#34; tvs in a small restaurant.  It&#39;s like they tried to figure out how to best ruin this gem.  Congratulations.

The tvs killed conversation and completely ruined the atmosphere.  You can&#39;t help but watch re-runs of past golf tournaments or old football footage.  (So it&#39;s not even entertaining.  How about some anime or anything that remotely would go with some sushi) I can&#39;t imagine what they were trying to go for here.  Maybe they had $4k burning a hole in their pockets.  What a waste.

I was somewhat regular here but now I believe my dollars would be better spent elsewhere.  It was that awful.

I guess the only bad thing is when it comes to the water refilling. The nigiris are the best. It&#39;s really fresh and sweet (sea urchin too).

I wasn&#39;t fond of the rolls due to the amount of sauce or just the use of imitation crab meat in rolls. Do give this place a try for the interesting experience of picking up food that you want as it sails by on the belt."

This place has the cheapest sushi anywhere near Schaumburg, IL.
 
Food: DELICIOUS! Amazing for the price you pay! Occasionally there&#39;s a sushi roll that&#39;s sloppily put together or cold dumplings, which can be annoying but are still delicious. I personally love the pork dumplings, Chicago Fireballs, salmon rolls &amp; Fire Station Rolls.
 
Prices: There isn&#39;t a cheaper sushi place. Especially not for this quality. Sure, it&#39;s not the greatest &amp; purest sushi you&#39;ve ever eaten but these prices can not be beat.
 
Staff: There are typically one of two people hosting every time I go there. Both of those women are immensely nice and attentive. My problem is a few of the women at the registers and one of the waitresses. Recently a new waitress was hired. She&#39;s the only Hispanic waitress in the restaurant therefore, she&#39;s caught my attention in the past. The past few times I&#39;ve gone she&#39;s been pushy, mildly rude and quick to rush us or myself out of our seats. This last time she poured water into my glass when I had Sprite, without asking and before my soda was finished. Therefore, I had Sprite-water. She kept asking if I was done, even while I was eating. That aside; let&#39;s discuss the cashiers. I only have two problems. There&#39;s one lady who I always see at the registers and she never reads back my total or says a word, she just holds out her hand and stares at you blankly until you bust out cash or charge. That&#39;s beyond rude. My number one problem, however, is that they ALWAYS press for a tip. I&#39;m not implying that I don&#39;t tip; I tip when service is good. Gratuity should never be forced or expected. It should be earned.
 
Bathrooms: There are only single bathrooms and honestly, it makes me anxious because I have this fear that anyone can walk in. However, they&#39;re clean bathrooms.
 
Restaurant Size: Small. Therefore, the wait can be brutal at this place. If it&#39;s packed; the wait can be anywhere from 25 minutes to an hour.
 
Additional Notes: Untraditionally, you get up and pay at the registers in this restaurant."

The appeal of this place is that the sushi is served on a rotating sushi bar. Like a sushi assembly line. I suppose it&#39;s supposed to be fun or convenient cause you can choose whatever you want. However, some of the items would just roll around for an extended period of time. Therefore, it&#39;s not fresh. We did order some items off the menu such as gyoza, crab Rangoon, and eel sashimi. All were sub par. I could get better good going to any other sushi place. The food just isn&#39;t fresh, not cooked well, and loaded with cream cheese and lots of other bull shit. Its very americanized food and you will probably leave feeling strange.

Some pieces are pretty basic but the fish is fresh. The experience I had was great. I ate mostly nigiri the whole night cause I love it and it allows me to just enjoy the fish. 
The concept is cool too having everything on the conveyor belt coming around and you pick whatever you want. We went on a busy night and everything was getting picked up pretty quickly and new pieces were getting placed in there. 
Def planning to go back

The only downfall - and this is a personal preference only - is having just vanilla flavored Mochi. You are a sushi restaurant so I guess I expected the other flavors like red bean and mango etc.

The conveyor belt system is reminiscent of some places in Japan, and the sushi is really good for the area. There&#39;s quite a variety (both Americanized and not), and you can also order some other traditional Japanese foods like udon or kara-age. If you don&#39;t see something on the belt that you want, you can request it directly from the chefs or the wait staff who will then ask the chefs. They&#39;re always happy to get you what you want. 

The place is a little small, but the staff work the system like a well-oiled machine so you don&#39;t usually wait very long. People complain that they&#39;re being rushed, but that&#39;s to be expected in a small establishment that&#39;s a popular lunch and dinner destination.

However the last several visit makes me feel that this sushi station is not the great rotating sushi bar anymore. 

1. Everything cream cheese
It&#39;s hard to find an authentic rotating sushi bar in the US. I know you can still order everything from the menu. But when I sit there, I feel like there is nothing I want to eat from the rotating belt. And sometimes I can see  the same cream cheese roll 5 times and nobody would pick it up.

2. What happened to fresh fish?
The deal breaker was last visit. I&#39;ve always liked to go there because I know the sushi would be good and I can get what I want even if I need to place an order (they come pretty quick). But the tuna they have that night was just awful. It was not fresh at all and they still put it on the sushi. We had one piece and stick with salmon and other fish the whole night.

Will give it another try, but not anytime soon. I want the old sushi station back."

The lady kept refilling our water and it was really nice to have a full glass at all times. Was a tiny bit cramped though but it was probably because it was a Saturday night and everyone was out for dinner plus it&#39;s winter so all the big coats were getting in the way but the service was great and the food was amazing.

I am sure for those folks who has never been to a real sushi place, this place can be a treat. Like some of you who love Panda Express and call it good chinese food. If you love it, that&#39;s fine, I am not judging.

But for those who hopes for real sushi experience, stay far far away! This place is a disgrace for sushi. I imaging a Japanese sushi master would have killed himself for pride here.

That being said, the place has clean environment and friendly staff. I can&#39;t bad mouth them. They are good. Besides, northwest chicks would dig this place. So good luck."

Everything just tastes the same now. I&#39;ve realized that the quality really represents the price. I feel like I only like it because of the spicy mayo sauce to drown out the bad fish flavor.

Also, when busy the chefs seem to roll the maki veryyy poorly. It just resembles a rice pile on a plate.

Finally, they always rush you and try to get you to leave as quick as they can. They are very impatient with their paying customers. Like sometimes I wanna sit and enjoy my company, not put my head down and eat as fast as I can. Not to mention you can&#39;t even be seated until everyone in your party is there which is so annoying--even when it&#39;s empty. I will still continue to come here but I&#39;m just over it."

Before I visited I really had expected a lot...

Not exactly same quality of Japanese sushi but similar quality.

However, it turned out this place is no better than any other Chinese or other Asian owned Japanese restaurants.

Small, tough and dry fish on HUGE rice ball.  

Those sushi Reminded me of the Turtle from Dragon ball cartoon who said he is tough and poisonous."

This isn&#39;t gourmet.  This is fresh - &#34;fast food&#34; style.  Where it is great is that most rolls are 4 piece; and virtually all nigiri is 2 piece.  As such, you can try a variety of things.  If you get something you don&#39;t like - not a big deal - because plates are small.  I introduced my kids to sushi this way.  Another advantage is that you don&#39;t need to decide up front how much you want to eat.  You figure it out as you go.  There is quite a variety - and generally if you don&#39;t find it on the conveyor belt - you can order off a menu."

The service here is great and the staff was very nice. Everything was fresh and I know it is because they made it right in front of me. They color coordinated each plate and each one was a different price. There was a sushi conveyer belt that went around and allowed you to choose whatever you wanted. There was also a menu that you can just order off of if you don&#39;t see it on the sushi conveyer belt. I recommend getting the wildfire, Godzilla, and magma.

My friend noticed that I was breaking out in hives, luckily I carry benadryl with me, and I noticed that I was starting to have breathing issues.
We told our sever what was happening, the hives were extremely apparent and my neck was starting visibly to swell. The server got the manager and all the manager did was tell me that they serve fish. We explained that I CAN eat FISH, but NOT SHELLFISH. Instead of apologizing, she ignored the issue.
This was the 2nd time I had been to this Sushi Station and had an issue that the management ignored. The time before the bus boy took my drink before I had finished it and again the management ignored the issue!

First off I&#39;ll talk about the food. All of it is cheap. You can taste it in the food. Never have the cooked egg. It might taste good then but you will regret it later. My child threw up. 

Secondly, there is no space. Not only is it tight, the place is so busy. Some days you would try to go in but can&#39;t even make it through the doorway. Why would you want to go there when there are so many more wonderful places nearby. I really enjoy sushi but this is just a disappointment.

Lastly, they have the worst service. My brother a had a very important business call so he went out. All my nieces and nephews were here and we had to separate we were okay until the manager and this tall girl with a black shirt and glasses came over and full yell and us. She said we have to wait for my brother. But the problem of waiting is the kids and I have to be separated. We had to even talk to the manager.

And there are many more people coming in throughout our dinner.

My friend gets so excited seeing conveyor belt sushi bar because there aren&#39;t many in the suburbs. There are various types of sushis and rolls to choose from and also non sushi type such as soft shell shrimp, tempura, seaweed salad etc. They also have soup, dessert on the menu which you can order from the kitchen. Service was better than i expected. The server is very friendly and come to refill more tea without me asking, and when we asked for more wasabi she got us more right away, which was nice! And they keep saying thank you thank you many many times!!

One problem is that I think the belt (or the frozen showcase?) is not &#34;frozen&#34; enough so that i felt the sushi or roll or any raw fish there are sort of warm, I prefer cold.  They better fix it to keep the fishes cold. Warm is not nice.

The other bad was their sushi rice doesn&#39;t stick so basically everything falls off, it means so much rice leaves in the soy sauce plate when you are dipping it.

We paid about $26 each person, it&#39;s not expensive unless you eat a lot.

Overall it&#39;s not that bad, its fun if you enjoy the conveyor belt. But if you are looking for high quality sushi you are at the wrong place."

Firstly as a city dweller, it is a cumbersome as to how far one has to travel (to rolling meadows) to try this traditional style of sushi consumption. 
However once you&#39;re actually there, there&#39;s plenty of things to look forward to. The conveyor belt is regularly loaded and hence I didn&#39;t encounter any long gaps of food plates. The charts indicating the price points for each plate color is spread around widely and are very easy to interpret. The plates to stick to the pattern shown on the chart so no surprises there.
One lesson I did learn was that things add up quickly and the items are more basic selections from the maki rolls and appetizers than the more special selections. This is understandable but instead of 4 pieces of a California roll, I&#39;d have loved to have the option to try 2 pieces of a special roll.  But that didn&#39;t happen. However, the rolls that did come through were very good. The fish was tasty and fresh and the presentation was quite nice.
To try this traditional way of having sushi, if you have the time and access to a car, do go check out this place."

I thought it was a nice little inexpensive sushi joint.  It seems to be quite popular at night so you may have to wait a little bit.

The food that were in circulation were pretty good.  Didn&#39;t have everything I wanted, but had a good selection for a sushi place.  The freshness was not bad either considering some dishes are meant to stay afloat for a long time or may not even get picked up.

Still since it is a sushi place and not an AYCE restaurant, your bill is not going to be light if you didn&#39;t count for what you eat.  Well, still reasonable though."

They have their standards here (Boston rolls, spider rolls, etc) but they&#39;ve got some unique ones too. My fave is the Shrimp Harmony gunkan.

They consistently make affordable sushi. But that unfortunately is all they seem to do right. Over the years I&#39;ve always struggled with feeling disrespected by the staff during my dining experience. I tolerated it in part because I enjoyed the affordable sushi in the rotating belt, and partly because I attributed the disrespect to a cultural disharmony. Unfortunately the last half dozen visits have fallen progressively worse each time to a point now where my family will no longer return and will, even more, refuse to join friends and business partners there for lunch again. At Sushi station there is a cost for cheap sushi and it is a deep disrespect and disdain for the customers. Don&#39;t even try to bring children. Children are clearly unwanted guests at this restaurant. No infants in baby carriers either parents! They&#39;re not allowed to the table unless they&#39;re sitting upright in a high chair or being held. I understand not wanting the carrier placed into the high chair, but to not allow the carrier to the table at all and instead forcing me to wake my sleeping baby is unacceptable. Period. At the end of my most recent meal my kids hadn&#39;t finished the last bite of pot sticker and shumai. They adamantly refused a leftover box. They threw my food away while we disagreed over whether my child&#39;s last bite of food constituted leftovers or carry out. I think they&#39;ve gotten too arrogant and lost all humility.  This restaurant is in decline. I will gladly pay a little extra for my family and my children to be respected and kindly treated as fellow humans and paying customers, over sushi that lately is almost entirely rice anyway.

Sweet shrimp is fresh ALL the time. (Order the ones on the green plate).

Get the regular 6 piece salmon roll (no spicy) because the salmon pieces they give you are huge!! Even though I like spicy, I&#39;m not a fan of the spicy salmon roll though. It&#39;s weird... The fish is like mashed up with spicy mayo.

Sharkfin jelly is soooo good too! (Not real Sharkfin of course).

Sushi Station is a fast paced Japanese style sushi restaurant.  Most of the waitstaff is Japanese and will greet you in a traditional way.  I don&#39;t believe they take reservations as this place is always busy.  You will be given a number in the order you arrive and there are chair/bench areas around the outer edges of the restaurant.  

The focal point of the restaurant is the middle section that features the conveyor belt with moving sushi on it.  After you are seated you can either order from the waitress or simply grab anything that looks good as it goes by.  Items are priced according to the color plate that they are on.  This is used as your tab when calculating your bill at the end.  You get a nice warm toilette to clean your hands as you would in Japan.  

Everything we had was great.  From the miso, to the gyoza, to the sushi.  What a fun experience.  If you want to feel like you are in Japan I strongly suggest coming here.  We weren&#39;t sure if we needed to order from the waitress, just grab our food, when to ask for the bill, and where to pay.  All of these things remind me of many of my experiences in Japan when I had no clue what was going on when dining out.  Fortunately, everyone here speaks English so you won&#39;t feel completely lost.  Simply ask a question if you have to."

Both of us were excited to eat at a Malaysian place after a long time, as there is such a dearth of Malaysian cuisine in the city. 

It was not crowded at all and we were seated promptly. The restaurant was quite nice, the ambiance was good. We ordered the vegetarian roti canai, mango tofu and the Mee Goreng. The service was prompt and friendly - no complaints. The roti canai was great - the vegetarian version had some potatoes and chickpeas. It was great. The mango tofu was a surprise. It was served in half a mango, and had actual pieces of mango stir fried with the tofu. I wish it was a little more spicier but I loved the dish. It had really great flavors, and the presentation was good too. The noodles were ok - had the nice smoky wok flavor. But they were a bit too greasy for my liking. I would definitely visit this place if I was ever in the neighborhood again."

The first experience was in December 2014 right before I left the States to Malaysia. That was not a bad experience. The server was friendly and food was okay. I ordered the Char Kuey Teow while my companion ordered Nasi Lemak and we had roti canai for appetizer. The CKT was very average while the other items were good. The cendol for dessert was okay too. 

This two star is for my second experience with the same companion last weekend. We went in dinner time and it was not busy with about 6 other tables of patrons. The service wasn&#39;t bad but it was slow and the waitress could be friendlier. Ordered roti canai again and prawn mee (with mixture of both rice and egg noodles) and Hokkien Char Mee for our entree. Without a doubt after the first taste I was not a fan of both the dishes. The broth to the prawn mee was really disappointing and the Hokkien Char Mee tasted just like noodles I whip out of my humble kitchen. The viscosity of the sauce was just off.  However, we did enjoy our roti canai. 

Overall, I think Penang has some potential but it would require some work. If you are looking for something worth trying, I would definitely recommend the Hainanese Chicken Rice (from the NJ Penang), Nasi Lemak and the roti canai since they were more enjoyable among the food we tried."

the pendeng beef is pretty good, but not spectacular

Ratings are as follows:

BAK KUT TEH: B+
Pork bone soup or meat bone tea was the darker Malay style. didn&#39;t like the pig tail and could have used some higher quality pork ribs. Unique and complex taste with quite a few exotic ingredients.

BEEF RENDANG: A
Nice crowd pleasing saucy style as opposed to the traditional bone-dry version. Lots of stuff going on here and tastes great means the chef knows what he&#39;s doing!    

HAIANESE CHICKEN &amp; RICE: A
Considering the real McCoy was over hyped and a consistent let down in Singapore, this dish wasn&#39;t difficult to meet or beat.

ICE CACHANG: A
Was impressed how they got the shaved ice and presentation down in solid form and brought it out rather quick."

All of us got roti canai for starters and after the first bite we realized that this is going to be a very good meal. For main course, We ordered basil fried rice, curried vegetables and chilli chicken. All of them were delicious and the quantity, omg! It was alot. I ate my curried veggies for 2 more meals. ;)

The waitress though seemed a little confused and was not able to understand what we were asking for and kept forgetting the ordered items. My sister and I ordered a mint tea which was just a tea bag and not freshly made and that was a big dusappointment.

So I would say food- 5 stars, service - 4 ir may be even 3 stars. Overall a 4 star place.

I also spent the summer in South Bay, where there are a multitude of options (well, a few) to choose from when it comes to Singaporean/Malay food. On one visit to a choice restaurant (Mango Garden in San Jose), I waxed poetic to my Chicago-based friends that there was somewhere between zero and negative infinity Singaporean restaurants in the Chicagoland area.

Naturally, I come back and stumble upon Penang in Arlington Heights. We were on our way back from Apple picking out west, and had planned to go to Santouka as our dinner pit stop. Instead, we drove past Penang and my wife, half-Singaporean herself, voted that we make an instant u-turn.

The menu had all our favorite Singaporean dishes including prawn mee, Hainan chicken rice, beef rendang, satay, and the like. But we opted for our two favorites, wonton mee (for me) and laksa (for her). We also threw in a roti canai and Malay tea (for her) and coffee (for me) for good measure.

Of the dishes, the roti canai was my favorite. The sauce was impeccably good, just spicy enough to tingle the tongue, and filled with flavor to excite the taste buds. The roti was a little on the airy side, just a whisker&#39;s short of the requisite dough to make each chew a fantastic one.

The wonton mee wasn&#39;t as good as Singapore. You&#39;re saying to yourself--of course not!--but it&#39;s arguably one of the easiest Singaporean dishes to make in America. Most Singaporean dishes require complex spices and curries, whereas wonton mee is base Cantonese and more soy and salt-based. In any case, I really liked the noodles--springy and chewy, though almost assuredly not housemade. The soup was a little salty, and the wontons mediocre with no separation between the wrap and filling. I really liked the pork. It was overcharred, and thus dry, but with a more smoky, crisp flavor than the more standardized char siu.

Interesting story on the laksa. Historically, laksa wasn&#39;t one of my go-to dishes in Singapore, but my wife adores it, so it was added to the rotation when we visited last summer. The more typical Singaporean laksa is curry-based, so I was surprised when I ordered laksa in San Francisco and received a sour, fish sauce-based broth. The same happened here, when my wife ordered to asam laksa. A quick trip to Wikipedia revealed that asam laksa is indeed sour broth, whereas curry laksa is a different beast entirely. Remove that disappointment, and I really liked Penang&#39;s version. it&#39;s a kick in the teeth, with a stinging sour broth complemented by sweet and salty after tones.

Because Singaporean optionality in Chicagoland is borderline impossible (I can now safely say between zero and one options), my curve grading is inflated. Banana Leaf in Houston is still my gold standard, but it&#39;s nice to know I can get it in Chicago, even if I have to drive an hour into the Northwest Suburbs to eat it."

For a while, I was going there a few times a week.  No recognition, no smiles, no thank you.  Now, I have only been there for lunch.  From a price side, they are great.  For about $8, you get soup, a meal, rice, and some fried things.  And, for the most part, it is good and has a lot of flavor.  

But, for lunch, there are some other places in the area that blow this place away for the same price.  Try it and see for yourself.  Maybe you will have a more positive experience.  I will go back, but not frequently."

I gotta say, California pretty much has everything down except Malaysian food.  I&#39;ve been craving for some good Malaysian food, so when she suggest that we grab some, I couldn&#39;t resist.  

Fist dish, coconut curry noodles.  The Malaysian coconut flavor was spot on!  It is one the best curry noodles I had.  The tofu skin soaps up all the flavor of the noodles, it&#39;s so yummy!  The noodles were thick yellow noodleish kinda noodle.  It pairs perfect with the thick and bold curry flavor.  You gotta get this dish if you&#39;re here. 

Second dish was the lamb curry.  This is a dark brown curry type of curry dish. It has a color like gravy, but taste nothing like gravy.  The lamb was perfectly cooked that it falls off the bone.  The thick flavor takes away the gamy taste of the lamb, so if you&#39;re afraid of the gamy flavor, but want lamb, this is the dish for you.  I don&#39;t really know how to describe the curry flavor, but it definitely hit the spot!

The lightest dish we got for the day was the seafood tofu pot.  All the seafood ingredients were fresh and light. When you got so many curry dishes on the table, this is the a dish you&#39;ll need to cut down all the bold flavors you got running in your mouth. If not this dish, choose another light dish. 


Tip: Bring as many friends as you can cause you&#39;ll want to order everything.  The best way for a place like this is to share everything!"

I was too young to appreciate quality food, but I remember it being good. As a young one, my favorites were the chicken rice and the Chendol. Regardless of the food, I remember the restaurant always having that familial and fun environment to it. 

After walking in to the restaurant, I noticed there was only one other family seated. We were greeted and seated right away however, I was surprised because Penang was always super packed back in the day. We ordered the Roti Canal for appetizer. It&#39;s Indian flat bread with a curry dipping sauce - very simple and flavorful. For entree, we ordered the Mango Chicken and the Malaysian Style Sweet and sour chicken. Wow! Those dishes were amazing. Nice presentation and the flavor was just so bomb! I wish that I could have had a test of every little thing there. Another benefit: the meat is halal if you ask for it, it&#39;s possible. It&#39;s nice that they try to appeal to all people. 

One thing I would suggest is to improve the customer service aspect of it. It wasn&#39;t a welcoming or inviting atmosphere like it was back in the day. Maybe I came in on a slow day that wasn&#39;t reflective of its normal business day.  Otherwise, I would recommend becayse the food is delicious!"

The atmosphere seems very friendly and is good for kids and families as well as couples.  The lighting was well done as well and the look and the feel of the restaurant felt very relaxing and it was gorgeous with art imbued on the wall, on a partition, on a tapestry and even on the light shades.

So why a 4?  My food got cold so I felt there was a draft. I don&#39;t eat fast but I don&#39;t eat slow either.  Regardless of, I&#39;m a fan :-). The wait staff was always polite and apologetic for when they may have misunderstood and or erred.

My family loves this and orders it every time. The soft yam inside a layer of softly crisped fried batter works so well, and there&#39;s a tasty filling inside the &#34;basket&#34; with tons of veggies and meat.

The Penang Shrimp had bits of very crisp lemon grass (for a certain flavor) that was inedible. They should have left it whole so the pieces could have been set aside. As it was, the chips were mixed with the food and seemed like slivers of plastic. The flavor of the dish was OK, spicy and sweet. The shrimp were med. size but plump and nicely cooked. The Salt and Pepper Soft Shell Crab is not as good as the recipe they used a few years ago. Now the dish is heavily spiced with jalapenos and is no longer a delicate meal. Appetizer Crab Rangoon is good, but we much prefer the fantastic Roti Canal and Satay Chicken we have had before.

We will return, as past visits have mostly been very good experiences. It&#39;s the only Malaysian restaurant we know of in the Chi area."

Penang and I go way back. It&#39;s close to my old office and my good friend, Evi, and I used to meet here all the time for lunch. It&#39;s a decent Malaysian restaurant. In fact, some of my Malaysian friends from Minnesota always stop by here whenever they road trip to Chicago.

The menu also is cross-pollinated with some Indonesian items, but it has been malaysia-ized. It doesn&#39;t taste the same but it&#39;s good enough to kill some craving. Like the rendang, it&#39;s pretty nommy but it doesn&#39;t taste like mom&#39;s. The menu also has fusions of Thai and Chinese dishes.

When I went with my Indonesian friends, I love Penang. We ordered roti canai, rendang, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Kampung Chicken which is a free range chicken deep fried and then cooked in spicy sauce. I love these varieties of dishes. When I go with Malaysians, I don&#39;t heart it as much as they would order Hokkien mee, Prawn Mee, Asam Laksa. They don&#39;t suite my palate. However, Malaysians of course love their traditional foods. To me, it&#39;s close but no cigar. I ain&#39;t smoking it.

One of their loyal and long time servers there, Danny, is Indonesian. He&#39;s cool and he gives great service and he&#39;s very knowledgeable about the food. One day some years back, I was doing no carb diet, and I came there and ordered Hainanese chicken with no rice. I asked for a half chicken as it didn&#39;t really fill you up without the rice. However, it&#39;s an awesome diet food as it is pretty much just boiled chicken and seasoned with ginger and garlic soy sauce with hot garlic chili sauce on the side. However, it tasted ridiculously delicious! Danny was surprised when I asked for half chicken. He was like half??? To him it seemed like a lot. However, he remembered tonight and he asked me &#34;just a quarter, right? Not half?&#34; I was like.. &#34;Yes., a quarter would be plenty..&#34;

I&#39;m glad they opened in Rolling Meadows after closing down the Chinatown location after the fire. It&#39;s a good spot to eat in that area. Between Penang, Chef Ping, Sushi Station, and Mitsuwa nearby, I had a hard time to decide what&#39;s for dinner. Plus, if one decision did not work out, the next best thing is around the corner.

This place doesn&#39;t disappoint if you enjoy Malaysian cuisine. Even for other South East Asian cuisines, it can still be a treat though it may not taste exact to the one in the old country. It is definitely one of my faves whenever I come to town."

My 3 other friends and I had no problem getting a table on a Friday night at 7pm.  However, by the time we left, the parking lot was pretty full. We started with the roti canai. I loved the dipping sauce it came with.  When my meal came, I even used some of it on that.  I was craving a lamb dish, so I went with my craving. I forget the name of what I got, and I can&#39;t find it on the online menu but I was happy with my choice.  The pieces of chopped lamb were tender and the coconut rice paired well with the dish.  The waitress was very attentive and gave good suggestions. I would come by this restaurant again for sure"

It took over 40 minutes for our entrees to arrive, although others got theirs more quickly - we were a bit annoyed. However once our dishes arrived, we were happy campers. We got Penang Shrimp and Sizzling Seafood Platter. Both were delicious, but the Penang Shrimp was outstanding. It had the most amazing inky dark sauce - neither of us had had anything like it before! And then to make up for their slow service, they offered us free desserts, which was nice. We had coconut pudding, which is served in an actual coconut, and fried ice cream. Both were wonderful. We would definitely come back here for the food,  but would choose a less busy time."

On my second visit I ordered Curry Mee, this time I didn&#39;t feel disappointed as the taste is pretty close to the curry mee from Malaysia even still not as good as the original Curry Mee because the noodle too soft seems overcooked, but I think I shouldn&#39;t complain again as hardly to find Malaysian Cuisine here in Chicagoland. 

Overall the Roti Canai and Cendol is worth to try... If you never been to Malaysia and you would like to experience Malaysian Cuisine this is a good place for you to enjoy Malaysian foods, but if you are from Malaysia and expected to have the same quality, this restaurant may disappoint you. Suggest restaurant owner or chef try to make visit to Malaysia to update the true malaysian cuisine, is very competitive now, don&#39;t forget chilli padi and sambal belacan is a must :)"

We started off with some drinks and appetizers. The waiter noticed my birthday as he checked my ID for the drinks and wished me a Happy Birthday. We got the Spring Rolls and Tofu Satay to start. Spring rolls were deliciously crispy served with a delicious dipping sauce. The Tofu Satay was flavorful with a nice presentation. I ordered the Mee Goreng noodles as my main dish which was seasoned to perfection with the perfect amount of spice. My sister ordered the Curry Vegetables, which came out in sizzling clay pot served with rice. I tried some of hers and the broth was very flavorful and vegetables tasted fresh. The food came out at a reasonable pace considering we arrived during the dinner rush. We had a waiter and a waitress that rotated to our table since it was so busy. Both were extremely friendly and made us feel very welcome. At the end when we paid the check the waiter brought us out a complimentary order of what I&#39;m guessing is the Chendol (a coconut type pudding) to share and wished me a Happy Birthday. We were both very surprised and thankful for such great service. My sister and I both walked out full, satisfied and with smiles on our faces from the great atmosphere and friendly service they provided for us. We both will definitely be returning in the future!"

I&#39;ve only been here three or four  but the experiences were good ones. The ambience is not bad for either lunch or dinner. The menu is extensive and reflects Malaysian food. Prices are reasonable. There are a lot of potential options for Asian food in the area such as Chef Ping and Hong Kong cafe. We tend to split our time that among these restaurants and this is a good choice for the dollar. In my experience the staff will tell you about the food and what makes it uniquely Malaysian. I find the flavors to be interesting as there are lots of different influences from China India and Thailand in the food itself. Well there are traditional Asian food on the menu you may want to try some of the food with these unique influences.

It was fragrant and excellent... However the egg still smelled a little offensive. I ordered a Thai iced tea and husband ordered a lychee drink.

If you have had your share of pad thai and sesame chicken and want something new, then I would recommend venturing out with Malaysian cuisine and trying Penang Restaurant in Arlington Heights. 

The name Penang is actually in reference to an area in Malaysia rather than the popular Thai curry. Malaysian cuisine draws influences from Thai, Chinese, Indian, and Malay to create a unique flavor. Based on its geographic location, the cuisine is a culmination of cultures. There are plenty of rice and noodles dishes from the northern Asia to curries and roti dishes from southeast Asia. Imagine ingredients like ginger, lemongrass, shrimp paste, cumin, coriander, turmeric, sambals, and chilies. 

We ordered the roti canai, penang shrimp, lamb curry, nasi goreng, Haianese chicken, wonton soup, and kangkung belacan. It was a range of flavors from savory, sweet, spicy, and aromatic. The dish that most people would overlook but I strongly recommend is the kangkung belacan. It&#39;s Chinese watercress (ong choy) stir fried with shrimp paste and chilies. It was the dish that I ate often in the streets of Bangkok and Penang is one of the few restaurants in Chicago that serves it. 

The prices are a little more expensive than most Thai and Chinese restaurants but Penang is the only authentic Malaysian restaurant that I know of. It&#39;s definitely worth the price and the visit for those who would like to experience a new cuisine from Southeast Asia."

Beef Rendang - Doesn&#39;t look appetizing, but it&#39;s tender and nice flavors.

From the outside, Penang looks like a kind of chic setting, neon and such.  When you go inside it looks like a typical Thai restaurant on the cheap end of the scale.

But, the menu is really interesting.  Penang is a mixture of Indonesian, Indian, Thai and Chinese.  I had Lamb Shank Curry, my daughter had Curry Vegetable. We both ordered brown rice.

When it was served, the lamb shank was large, meaty and covered with the most wonderful brown curry sauce.  This was not what I expected.  The meat was juicy and very tender.  The sauce was very complex tasting with chunks of mushroom and onion. It was garnished with very crisp broccoli.  My only reservation about this was I hoped for more substantial veggies, but no matter.  It was really good. And, the reaction from Sarah was about the same.

That is, until we got the check.  I had a restaurant.com coupon for $10.  Reading everyone&#39;s comments about problems they&#39;ve had when the server knows you have one of those little coupons reminded me to read the fine print.  No, we did not have to present it before ordering.  When I showed the waiter the coupon he said &#34;oh, you have one of those.  I have to charge you for the rice.&#34;  So, my $4 purchase for the $10 coupon was pretty much negated when he charged $4 for the rice.  

I may complain to restaurant.com about this, but I may not.  The food was that good.  So 5 stars for the food and one star for service.  In deference to the food, they get 4 stars.  Although I&#39;m a little pissed off about how the evening ended I know I&#39;ll have to go back."

Don&#39;t make the mistake I made of going to the bathroom right as the appetizers come out, or the piping hot (but very delicate) roti will be cold when you get back. It&#39;s really nothing like the version we get at Indian restaurants, which is more of a basic thin flatbread. Penang&#39;s roti is stretchy. Sinewy. Glutenous. A living animal of a flatbread.

I&#39;m a fan of the clay pot tofu, which features tender tofu and fresh veggies. If only they used fresh shiitake too, it would be the best thing ever.  I usually order their lychee smoothie which comes in an crazy tall glass, enough for two people. The coconut pudding is quite good. I&#39;ve also had the mango tofu which is tasty and interesting but in my mind, too sweet for an entree. My partner loves the stingray here, which is, amazingly, only a dollar more than the fish dishes.

The service is decent. I wish they&#39;d serve more rice with the meals, as it comes in this tiny bowl that only goes half as far as the entree. Brown rice option (50 cents more) is yay!

The flimsy vertical paper towel holder combined with the tough, non-perforated paper towel roll in the bathroom is ARRRGH!!

I feel as if they have more items leaning more toward Chinese than true Malaysian food now. At any rate, you&#39;ll want to try something that makes the best use of the spices or the curry. If you&#39;re in the area, worth a try simply for the experience."

So we were obsessed about 5 years ago finding a place that served it when I moved to Chicago. The Penang in Chicago (Chinatown) apparently burned down. And the one in Philly I used to frequent is just too far!!
We have driven from Chicago to Arlington heights in traffic to get to this place just for the Roti Canai. It reminds me of the South Indian coconut based chicken curry my mom makes with the fluffy and flakey crepe (or porotta or roti) that comes with it. The dish should be a meal--why haven&#39;t they done that yet? But I&#39;m not mad, we&#39;ve ordered 4 orders of the stuff and been satisfied here! Mmmm finger licking good--no really you&#39;ll want to savor every bit, every morsel of goodness of the Roti Canai!"

They also offer Chinese and Thai food, but their specialty is Malaysian food. I have not been disappointed by any of the chef&#39;s recommendations on the menu or by the staff. While being Thai myself, I had to try the Thai food, and it&#39;s good but not authentic. Again, this is not a Thai restaurant, so I did not have high expectations for their Thai food. I did not even bother with the Chinese food. If you come here, please try the Malaysian food. 

If the name sounds familiar, it&#39;s because they used to have a location in Chinatown on the corner of Wentworth and Cermak. It was shut down due to a fire, and never reopened. They owners instead opened this location in the burbs. I was so glad to find this place because I really missed the other location! 

I sought out Penang because one of my favorite dishes to eat of all time is Hainanese Chicken Rice. It is associated with Singapore, but can be found at Thai restaurants, Malaysian restaurants, and sometimes even Chinese restaurants. It is a dish that has steamed chicken served at room temperature with the most important part, the &#34;chicken rice.&#34; I can only describe it as rice that is usually cooked with chicken broth to give it an aromatic smell and taste. It can sometimes be oily, but I like it this way (and also how my grams makes it). I just love this dish so much because it reminds me of my childhood and home country. It&#39;s awesome. Sorry if the description doesn&#39;t do it justice, but it really is awesome. 

Some of the other dishes that I have personally tried and enjoyed were the Roti Canai appetizer, Char Kway Teow, Penang Spicy Chicken (beef was also good), and the Kangkung Belacon. This is like a Chinese spinach (or Ong Choi, if you know that is in Chinese cuisine) that was stir-fried in a spicy shrimp paste. Very unusual but tasty. 

I did not care for their TomYum at all (again, don&#39;t come here for great Thai food), nor the Asam Laksa. The Asam Laksa is a traditional hot and sour Malaysian noodle soup which I found to be too fishy and sour. I&#39;m glad I tried it, but not my cup of tea (noodles). 

They also have a lunch special during weekdays and serve a generous portion for a lunch special. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful, although their english isn&#39;t perfect, they get the point across. The food comes fast. The bathrooms are clean. Be sure to try the Malaysian iced tea and coffee and desserts!"

so far I&#39;ve tried..

malaysian style ice tea - it was ok.. i could of done without it... it has a unique taste to it.

nasi goreng fried rice -  it was really good and very flavorful.. its a must order!

bowl of chicken rice -  it was decent.. could also done without.. not too much taste to it..

roti canai flat bread with some king of chicken dipping sauce - my friend loves this.. but to me it nothing special at all.. the dipping sauce wasn&#39;t bad tho..

chili pepper chicken - love this dish! the chicken is lightly breaded and it has the perfect amount of spices

Penang char kway teow - the waiter recommended this to us and i found it kind of bland and oily

mango chicken - something different and i thought it was pretty good.. the shredded mango and chicken is served on a gutted mango.. it was cool haha

curry me noodle soup - it was alright... it wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t good.. but then again I&#39;m not that big of a fan on noodle soup type food..

i would come back just for the nasi goreng fried rice and chili pepper chicken tho! those are a must order .. so good!"

Been there quite a number of times but this is the first time I&#39;m writing a review because they totally deserve an excellent one.

My partner and I loved the Pad Thai so much - every bite was so flavorful and not dried out like some places. The Penang char kuayteow (sorta like a Malaysian version of pad see ew) was also pretty decent.

He also raved about the Malaysian lemongrass grilled pork chops that was so tender and delicious.

For me I absolutely love their dry wonton noodles -think egg noodles in tasty dark sauce topped with choysum, crispy fried wontons and BBQ pork. Ask for sambal chilli paste by the side if you like a spicy kick to it. This is definitely something different from the typical Americanized Chinese food.

Once we thought we might go for something different and went for the claypot curry fish head (25minute wait) and was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the grouper. Was flavorful, not too spicy and lots for take-out.

I like the fact that Penang uses fresh ingredients and doesn&#39;t skimp on their dishes. You can taste their effort and each visit there has been very consistent.

There are so many dishes on the menu to check out. Go and judge for yourself. I&#39;m already looking forward to our next visit!"

Dessert, the Pulut Hitam and the Cendol is a great way to hit the spot.

Penang is a chain of restaurants, but I don&#39;t know if they all have a standard menu, or if all they share is a name. This particular one has its own website, so I don&#39;t know if that means there&#39;s a Penang corporate or what.

I never visited Penang while it was in Chinatown (too close to my beloved 554). Funny story, well, not for Penang, is that in Chinatown, Penang is literally across the street from a Fire Department. I literally mean literally across the street (yeah, I just said that). I could throw a rock from the fire department and break a Penang window, yet, Penang burned to the ground. Go figure.

So, somehow it&#39;s now planted in suburbia, Arlington Heights. Now I still never go, because it&#39;s too close to Chef Ping&#39;s, but alas, the day was a Monday, and Pings was closed. 

ROTI CANALI
So many reviews talk about this. It&#39;s basically flatbread sered with a small cup of curry. Now, I&#39;ve had roti, and this is like 1 single layer of roti. It&#39;s extremely thin and doughy. The curry actually tastes a lot like Korean S&amp;B Curry, but it does have a slight Indian spices flavor to it. In any case, it was pretty good. The curry had some potato and chicken I think. The bread was really good too. It was flaky, yet chewy, and acted as a good canvas for the curry.

TOM YAM
I guess this is a Pan Asian restaurant, even though it says &#34;Malaysian&#34; out front. We went from India to Thailand. They serve this thing in a very tall bowl, which makes getting the last several spoons (using Chinese spoons) very difficult. By tall bowl, I mean practically a pint glass. As you picture a pint glass, imagine trying to ladle soup with that aggressive angle of attack. BUT, it&#39;s just wide enough that you&#39;d look silly trying to drink it as if from a cup. Very impractical.

So, enough about the serving apparatus! I asked for extra spicy, and it was nowhere near it; however, they brought by some chili sauce and it made up for the effort and got some sweat to escape my forehead. Flavors were right on, right up there with many of the better Tom Yums I&#39;ve had. I&#39;d say it&#39;s comparable to Dan Thai&#39;s Tom Yum. Not a lot of &#34;land mines,&#34; which if you&#39;ve read any of my other Thai reviews, you&#39;d know what I mean.

FRIED DUMPLINGS
These are very plump pork dumplings, and it&#39;s not deep fried, but pan fried just a bit.  Now, these were delicious! Put a little bit of soy sauce on them and go to town! The flavor were not edgy like other dumplings. It wasn&#39;t too high on ginger or anything like that, but that could also be the pork sort of softening those edges. I couldn&#39;t taste any of the pork flavors, but based on what it did to sort of dull down some other, normally, spiky flavors, you could tell it was there. It sounds bad, but this dulling of the sharp flavors is actually what made me really enjoy these! They were almost buttery, and the soy sauce provides the perfect spikes of seasoning for every bite.

PENANG CHICKEN
This is basically like Szechuan chicken. No breading, mixed in a salty, spicy, little sweet, gingery sauce, with vegetables, green peppers, chili peppers, and other things. It&#39;s really nothing special, but it tastes fine. Something I&#39;d expect at your local $5.95 Lunch Special Chinese Restaurant, and that&#39;s not a bad thing. I usually like that kind of Chinese food! Oh, and take my word for it. If you think you&#39;re picking up a bamboo chute, NO! IT&#39;S FREAKING GINGER AND IT&#39;S NASTY!

CURRY BEEF
I was about to order some pork chop thing, but the waiter told me to order this instead. Boy was he wrong! This was terrible! It&#39;s basically simmered beef, so you can break it apart with a fork. The curry sauce was nothing like the Roti Canali from before, but it was this really super gingery curry that tasted funky. It definitely wasn&#39;t gamy, but it almost had the characteristics of gamy flavor! I ate it as fast as I could just to make it go away. Beef had great texture, very soft and tender, and if the curry was good, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d have really enjoyed mixing rice into the dish, but, ugh!

ICE KACANG
It&#39;s sort of like a potbingsoo or halo halo, but reduce the sweetness by about 90%! It&#39;s still shaved ice, but not as fine, they&#39;re more like ice flakes. It also has peanuts and corn. Never thought I&#39;d see corn in a dessert, but here it is. It was certainly interesting, and I&#39;m sure I could get used to it, but why bother?

NOT HAP-PENANG
Other than the appetizers, really wasn&#39;t impressed. Entrees were mediocre and expensive (I think the beef curry was $16). I probably wouldn&#39;t complain if I was forced to eat it, but with Chef Ping&#39;s so close, or even Bowl House for their sushi combo, or even Chicken Roasters, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be coming back on my own accord."

Great hainanese chicken with chicken rice. If you order this from Asian noodle house in Hoffman estates (which taste nothing like hainanese chicken), you will love the ones you have here.

Noodle soup are fantastic too!

I used not to like this place, I probably gave them 2 stars before. But with their improvement they are at least 4 stars.

Now that the Chinatown location has closed down, I still make the drive out here once in a while because of the good food. Anyway, I came in here on a Saturday night when it was packed, so there was a line. We patiently waited for about 5 minutes before we were attended to and situated. When we were seated, we did not get any service for about 10 minutes. I was a little frustrated at first, but my craving for Roti Canai overcame my emotions. After finally getting service, we quickly ordered Roti Canai, Nasi Lesak, and Rendang Beef. 

The Roti Canai, which is Indian Flatbread with curry dipping sauce, has always been my favorite and it was made perfect as usual. I believe this is one of their most popular appetizer. The Rendang beef was very good and the beef was very tender and flavorful. However, when they brought out the Nasi Lesak, we thought it was a fried rice dish because it was under that category on the menu. It turned out to be a regular entree instead and our waiter, who turned out to be the owner, noticed the confused look on our faces and was extremely nice. He insisted he can make us fried rice if we wanted to and he started asking what kind we wanted. He threw out recommendations and we asked him to make something he liked. He came back with Nasi Goreng, which is Spicy Indonesian Fried Rice with shrimp. It looked amazing and tasted as good as it looked. I have never had fried rice that tasty before without it being overly greasy or drenched with soy sauce, and I have eaten many fried rice of all sorts from many different places. We started a small conversation with the owner and he surprised us with coconut pudding, which was delicious. The coconut tasted like it was made from fresh coconut.

The quick minor frustrating experience I had earlier quickly became a pleasant one because of the owner. When we got our tab, he did not even charge us for the Nasi Goreng Fried Rice and basically gave us a free dessert with it. Now that is good customer service and you can say I will definitely be a regular. We left happy and gave them a tip that pretty much makes up for all the stuff he gave us in return."

My three experiences have been very good.  The appetizers are all pretty tempting, so the combination platter is a good compromise for a group.  The duck is quite tasty, and the barbecue ribs...ummmm.  I also recommend the roti at appetizer time.  The pineapple fried rice, while not original, is also delicious.  Beef rendang tastes amazing, as ugly as it might appear.  The banana dessert was lovely.  I try to avoid sugar these days, so I had them make it more plainly, and I didn&#39;t miss the extra sin.

Service is pretty slow, but they don&#39;t miss anything.  Very cordial.  I like to think this means they focus their resources on the food first.  I&#39;ll definitely be back."

And there&#39;s a few from this decade which is good to see haha.

The place is quiet and relaxing, nice wait staff overall, not the quickest / most attentive but worked well for us since we were talking and they were probably being mindful of that so I don&#39;t knock them for not being by that often :)

We got Mango Shrimp and Clay Pot Tofu.

Mango Shrimp - it&#39;s served in a mango!  It was pretty good, not quite as sweet as I would have thought, which made it perfect for eating with rice.  It&#39;s supposed to be spicy but I didn&#39;t taste alot, it was good and well balanced between sweet and spicy.  There were like 3-4 shrimp in each mango half (med sized, so 6-8 shrimp total) for 15 dollars. Oh and there was some green peppers and onions as well which rounded out the texture to not be just soft.  The mango was nice, not smashed which I expected with it being heated / cooked.

Clay Pot Tofu - Has tofu, mushrooms (2 types), and some other chinese veggies.  The major thing I loved was the sauce and the tofu, nice blocks about 1 inch long, half in on the other sides and the skin was great!  The tofu was all in one piece and the veggies were a very nice compliments. This was only 11 dollars!

I&#39;d def eat this again in the future.   It will be interesting to see what else they have :)"

I tried many satay and the taste is totally different from Penang restaurant. According to one of the male server, it is cooked the same way in Malaysia which is barbecue on a pit with a little burned to make the satay a little bit crispy and keeping the taste to the meat. 5star for the satay. 

Service was awesome, server kept our drinks refilled, free flow of normal ice tea, which taste exactly like Malaysia&#39;s teh&#39;o, Thai ice tea and Malaysia ice tea is also a must try! 

Best banana leaf grilled fish. The taste is exactly the same as Malaysia&#39;s famous grill fish, especially the skate wing(stingray), is a n unforgettable dish that goes best with rice. 

Coconut pudding was made by the owner/chef so it is unique that none of the restaurants out there could beat the coconuts pudding here. Went there a few times and somehow they were sold like hot cakes and none is left. So better get it before they are out! 

All in all, food was amazing, great and friendly service, superb desserts, unique deco.. Better than chef ping I would say. 

2 thumbs up for server an chef, keep it up! Will definitely bring more friends together to try more different dishes!"

Pretty solid!  Had the Roti Telur (Indian flatbread) as an appetizer.  The Roti Telor ha an amazing curry chicken dipping sauce!   We also tried the taro shrimp, which I liken to a sort of dim sum taro puff filled with a shrimp instead of the pork / taro mixture.  That was OK as well.

As far as main courses, I really enjoyed the Yam pot.  This dish is very similar to a &#34;bird&#39;s nest&#34; dish you&#39;d find at traditional Chinese restaurants.  Instead of using a potato made nest or basket, a taro basket is used.  The taro basket I believe is fried.  The exterior of the basket is crispy and once you break the basket open, the super soft potato-like taro is exposed.  So good!  

The yam pot includes an assortment of shrimp, squid, scallops, cashews and other veggies.  It&#39;s really good.

The curry lamb shank is something I don&#39;t normally eat, but I wanted to try something new.  The curry sauce was very good and the lamb was actually not pungent or gamey.  In fact, it was super soft, went well with the curry and it was actually something I can totally order again. 

The only dish I was sort of disappointed was the coconut fried rice.  At the same time, fried rice isn&#39;t something I order.  It didn&#39;t have that much coconut flavor to be honest.  In fact, if not for the menu, I&#39;d mistake it for just ordinary fried rice.  

Overall, a pretty solid choice for Asian and I&#39;d definitely be back..."

Haha, ok not really, do not be afraid of the Muslims.  Seriously.

Anyways, we get a bit fantastical in our thinking after being hungry all day, so we decided to drive 1 hour and 45 minutes from home to break our fast at 8:05pm at Penang Malaysian restaurant (yes, this is how far one must drive for Malaysian food, tsk tsk Milwaukee)..   

We had:  

Iced Lychee drink and Malaysian iced coffee (5 stars, and yes I was wired from the caffeine at 8pm, don&#39;t ask hubby about the drive back)...

Appetizer:  Roti Telur.  This is where the &#34;fusion&#34; part of this restaurant comes into play, as it was a far cry from Malaysian roti telur, but still tasty nonetheless.  They served our roti (bread) with chicken curry and the curry was amazing.  

Our meal:  

I had Penang Char Kway Teow (think flat, wide noodles with shrimp and squid) and it was sooooo good. 5 stars for sure.  The squid was perfection, no chew to it at all.  Yummm

We also had the Rendang Ayam, or chicken rendang.  It was 4 stars worthy and was quite good, but it didn&#39;t taste like rendang, so we were thinking maybe this is where the whole fusion aspect comes into play again.  

All in all it was a great night and my stomach is now grumbling while I write about food merely 8 hours into today&#39;s fast."

Not amazing, not horrible - very average for Balkan food and I&#39;ve been to many since Des Plaines has a ton of these restaurants everywhere now. It&#39;s not mediterranean as the description would have you believe. I did like the cheese pie listed under &#34;appetizers&#34; - HINT: the portion is HUGE and the size of two meals! 

The reason they are getting 3 stars and not 4 is because the waitress was incredibly rude. I&#39;m not sure if she was having a day or if she always acts completely depressed, unfriendly and generally uninterested to be there but she never made eye contact with us, never smiled, didn&#39;t say anything unless she had to and acted like our presence was a bother. It wasn&#39;t just with us either, it was with ALL the tables. 

I heard from my friend who goes here sometimes that there&#39;s another waitress there who is the complete opposite (super friendly and helpful) so I will try to go again and catch her. I&#39;d be interested in having their desserts because they look delicious.

Also, they had smooth jazz playing very loud which was very annoying."

I&#39;ve tried all the other balkan restaurants in the area and this place was kind of a let down since some friends said it was pretty good.  We ordered the Cevapi, Burek, Sopska Salata, and Punjena Pljeskavica. 

To start with, I&#39;m not Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian.  When I ordered, I tried my best to pronounce the names of dishes but the woman taking the order was quick to make fun of me for trying.  Not a big deal, but right away I was kind of disappointed by that.  I looove balkan food and we tried 2 new items we hadn&#39;t had before and wasn&#39;t with any of my balkan friends so I tried my best, but i guess that was just funny to them.  As soon as we left with our food they started talking and laughing with each other, which of course could have been anything, but it definitely felt like they were talking about us.

Cevapi and bread was good, but I was SUPER disappointed that when I got home there was no Kajmak even though it said there was on the menu.  Every other place i&#39;ve eaten they give you a very generous side portion of it.  If I had to guess, it looked like they may have spread a VERY thin layer of it on the top half of the bread, but it was really hard to tell.  That was a major let down.

Burek tasted okay, but was the worst i&#39;ve had when comparing to the others I&#39;ve tried.  Not much meat in it and pretty much all dough.

Sopska Salata was excellent and probably the best thing we had there.

Punjena Pljeskavica was pretty good as well.  This was the thing I got made fun of for trying to order.

Glad I gave this place a try, but probably won&#39;t be going back."

All the food items I tried were mostly unmemorable. I was a bit disappointed in nearly all the dishes for small details -- Cream of chicken soup had more of a broth like consistency, pancakes were not fluffy, philly steak was a bit overcooked, omelette could&#39;ve used more salt and significantly more cheese, benedict didn&#39;t have the consistency of thick gravy, etc. Alright given the price, but I&#39;d rather pay slightly more for better executed cooking."

I got the mediterranean omlet with potatoes and fruit. Hubby got his monster breakfast - biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, potatoes and bacon! Way more than I can eat. Anyway we were shocked by how inexpensive it was, something like $7 for all that.

Our waitress was ok, I had to flag her down for a coffee refill which wasn&#39;t good. It takes me about 3 cups to get going and before that, watch out! There&#39;s an open floor plan here, so you can see all around the restaurant and we didn&#39;t see the usually array of servers running around, so maybe many were waiting for coffee.

They had some baby boomers rock station on which I found pretty annoying. Maybe I&#39;m getting old, but I&#39;m not in the mood to rock out to Aerosmith at 8:30am.

I ordered the Veggie Skillet and (I think) he had a spicy/Mexican Skillet (each around $7.25). Each came with a side of either toast or two pancakes - I chose the latter. Yummm. The veggies seemed fresh and it was cooked to my liking, but I admittedly got tummy problems as soon as I got home, and then later after I ate my leftovers.

The server was ok - not really warm or friendly, but brought everything we requested (mustard, napkins, coffee refills, To Go boxes). We hadn&#39;t been sure how to pay (up by the front door at the register), but she graciously took the credit card, rang it through, and brought it back to us.

I got a omelet with cajun chicken, mushroom, avocado, and cheese today and it was great! The flavor of this particular omelet was unique, I can&#39;t put my finger on it but the cajun spices probably brought about it. The omelet is a little on the oily side though. You have a choice between fresh fruits or hash browns and pancakes or toast. Chose fruit and multi-grain toast to be slightly healthier. If you have a small appetite you can definitely eat half here and bring half home. My friend ordered the crab and asparagus omelet with hollandaise sauce and that was good as well. I&#39;ve ordered the french toast, skillets, and eggs benedict here before and they were are filling and tasty. Not your high quality breakfast here, but it&#39;s economical and still hits the spot!"

I ordered an iced tea to go with my meal. I decided to switch to Diet Pepsi as a refill since I figured like any other restaurant, they offer free refills on all soft drinks. Also, my friend ordered a Diet Pepsi &amp; asked for a refill, it was free. WRONG! Eventhough iced tea &amp; Diet Pepsi are both listed as a &#34;soft drink&#34; at the same price of $2.19, they don&#39;t allow you to switch cause &#34;technically it&#39;s not a refill&#34; (as the server put it) &amp; charged me for both an iced tea AND Diet Pepsi. Eyeroll. Eventhough, the server fixed the check when I inquired about it, she got rude &amp; lost her server charm she had in the beginning of our visit. I said &#34;thank you&#34; but she didn&#39;t seem to care &amp; walked away while my friend was talking to her. Sigh."

We are late sleepers! This place reminded me of a good old fashioned family restaurant. They were pretty busy but we waited only about 5-10 minutes for a seat. They gave us coffee right away which was good because coffee in the morning is a necessity. The food was really good, much better than an IHOP or any other commercial place. I am a vegetarian so I ordered the vegetarian omelette and my husband ordered iron man omelette with a side of biscuits and gravy. The food portions were large and the food was delicious! I am a big breakfast lover and we normally go to the same restaurant every month but I think we will be changing it up now that we have found this place. Prices were also very reasonable and coffee was fantastic!"

I called and told the cashier that my last order which was suppose to be a BLT on wheat ended up being a regular club sandwich on white and that I was already out of the area so all she did was apologize. I was so disappointed while I didn&#39;t ask for a credit  neither did she offer one. I was disappointed because that is a reflection of their customer service."

I arrived on a Wednesday morning right at opening. Sign says wait to be seated but nobody there to seat you. I was served a cup of coffee relatively quickly and my order for pancakes was taken. Then I sat and watched as 4 or 5 tables who came in after me get served food before me. Waitress then tells me they had preordered. Took 25 minutes  to serve mediocre pancakes. I guess I understand why the other tables preordered their food - they must know about slow prep times. Unbelievably terrible service. Stay away from this place.

It has a diner type feel. Located in a strip mall at the corner of Schick and Army Trail,  it took a Yelp search for me to notice this establishment. So much gets lost in strip malls. 

The food was typical breakfast food. Good but nothing special. Service was good and the prices were reasonable. I ordered eggs, turkey saussge, wheat toast and breakfast potatoes. My companion opted for strawberry stuffed french toast and bacon. The total was about $20. I would choose this over IHOP any day of the week. 

If you come alone or want a real diner feel, you can eat at the counter which has old school stools."

I don&#39;t know if this place would qualify as a hidden gem, since it&#39;s fairly large. But I&#39;ve been living in the area more than 10 years and hadn&#39;t even noticed it. Probably because it&#39;s only opened till about 1 or 2pm. Not really a morning person, much less on weekends. 

Anyway, since I&#39;m not a morning person, I don&#39;t really do breakfast. It&#39;s not my favorite food. This place totally changed how I look at breakfast. The two times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve had two different types of skillets. DELICIOUS and large portions. You can definitely tell it&#39;s family owned, the place feels cozy, and the service is great! Everyone is very nice and attentive. Their menu is quite large with many options.

It&#39;s a decent breakfast place with good size portions. I tried one if the biscuits-n-gravy combos and my sister had the Cajun skillet. I like my eggs over-medium, and places sometimes have a problem with that, but my eggs were cooked just the way I like them today. The sausage gravy wasn&#39;t anything special, just average. The biscuit was good and fresh, and they have decent coffee. My sister really enjoyed the Cajun skillet, I tasted a piece of the chicken and it was very good; just enough of a little spice to give you that heat in the back your throat. 

We got there at 2 PM and their hours say they close at 3 PM. There were only about four tables occupied when we got there, and of course those people were finishing up so wasn&#39;t long before there were just two  occupied tables in there. My biggest complaint is that they started vacuuming at about two 2:40 PM; i&#39;ve never heard of a vacuum that doesn&#39;t stir up dust, so I didn&#39;t appreciate them vacuuming right around our table while we were eating. And I mean right around our table; he didn&#39;t actually bump my chair but he had to be just an inch or two away from it. When we left it was only 2:50 PM. personally I don&#39;t think restaurants should start cleaning up until their guests are gone. Or at the very least give us space and not clean the corner where we were until we were gone. 

We will return but will get there earlier."

I&#39;ve gotten lunch and breakfast items here and everything I&#39;ve had has been delicious! Today, I tried something totally new and got the Erin Go Benny, a benedict with corned beef. Now I say something completely new in that I have never had corned beef before. 

It was delicious! The eggs were poached perfectly and their hollandaise sauce was top-notch. Often at restaurants, the hollandaise can be as salty as a salt lick. This was just right. And the corned beef was great! With the sweetness of the hollandaise and the corned beef, the benedict was balanced perfectly with the addition of a little acidity in the form of sliced tomato, which pretty much made the dish. I ate the whole thing despite fullness because it was just that good.

I&#39;ve also gotten a mediterranean wrap before, which was very good. Their daily soups are usually really tasty options as well. The coffee&#39;s decent, and refills are plentiful.

I highly recommend Granny&#39;s for a yummy brunch!"

Then you will get greeted and sat by some pleasant help and usually you will have a waitress by you in no time. 

I used to come here for breakfast a lot, but have also had lunch items here. 

The food is above average and so are the employees. 

I&#39;ve been here with some fairly large groups too and they always did their best to accommodate us by joining some tables together.

I don&#39;t live in the area. We switch off trying new restaurants in each others neighborhoods. We found Granny&#39;s and decided to give it a try.  When we first saw it, we were sort of leery. It is located in a somewhat desolate strip mall. Once we walked in we changed our minds. The host, probably the owner was very friendly and gracious and walked us to a table. He seemed like a very happy person with his huge smile. Then once we were seated, our waitress was very attentive and very engaging.  Their menu has a wide selection of items. They have the general breakfast items but had more extra special items not found on other restaurant menus.  I ordered a Black and Blue salad, which had blacked sirloin in a salad with bacon and blue cheese bites.  I have to say I was impressed. I will go as far as saying it was probably the best salad I have had in a restaurant.  The portions of meat were big. The lettuce was not your typical piece of head lettuce but finely chopped pieces of lettuce that would actually fit in your mouth.  It was a great salad. My friend had a skiller and she was also very happy with her meal.  Both the food and the friendly people working at this restaurant really made this a good place to come and eat constantly.

The service was slacking, though. Service was slow in general, and we were not even checked on once after our food arrived. We wanted refills on our drinks but never got them because no one came by to check on us.

There were 4 other tables outside everyone just went in on their own and no one came to check up on any of the customers. I wanted to take my food to go so I personally carried the plate inside to find a server. I even walked by the manager who was to busy talking to a friend to acknowledge me just holding a giant plate of food in my hand. I had to ask the hostess for my bill so I can pay and leave. Another server handed me the box and told me you can sit there just pointing at the nearest table to where I was standing. I was standing there boxing my food in front of the manager near the exit and no one told me anything. Idk who the owner is but he should really reevaluate his staff and managers because this is some of the worst service I&#39;ve ever experienced. The food was ok at best

At first glance this place looked huge and as I entered my assumptions were true. There is a &#34;homey&#34; feel to this place and I compared it to being in someone&#39;s fancy living room. The tables were a bit close for my liking but I appreciated how much seating there was. I&#39;m sure this place can get pretty crowded on the weekends.

I was a little overwhelmed with how many people came up to our table. The was one person bringing us the complimentary salsa and chips, one person with our waters, one person bringing my table the complimentary soup and another person actually taking our orders. At least they were attentive?

As far as the food, I had ordered simple chicken tacos on corn tortillas. These taco dishes came with a side of refried beans and rice, yum. I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t a la carte. My meal was tasty but wasn&#39;t the BEST I had ever eaten. There wasn&#39;t any guac, sour cream, etc. to accompany the tacos but this wasn&#39;t a huge deal - the tacos had enough flavor. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t order any drinks so I can&#39;t make comments on the margaritas or fancy beverages.

I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to visiting again. I&#39;m sure the outdoor seating and a drink next time would make my visit more appealing. Sadly, I had felt like this was just a typical chain Mexican restaurant. Nothing really stood out to me. But nonetheless, I would return! The food was good!"

The chips and salsa are standard and just as good as you can get anywhere else. The service wasn&#39;t bad. We actually had the same waiter both times, and he was friendly. The prices are reasonable, especially for lunch. My wife has a gluten-allergy, and was able to eat here safely.

First off, they had $3.99 margaritas, and Taco Tuesday specials! I was excited. I ordered the steak tacos (comes with 3) with onion and cilantro, and added cheese for a little under $10. They were SO good! I inhaled them. Their complimentary chips and salsa were also good. For $4, I didn&#39;t think the margarita was bad either. A pretty cheap meal overall!

Our waitress was nice and attentive. We didn&#39;t have to wait long and she paid attention to detail.

Most places so far up here have disappointed with few few exceptions. This place is not one of them they offer great size margaritas and drink selection and the food is good not great but good. 

Parking: Parking Lot, free,  no problems.

Service: Attentive and helpful. Waitress/bartender had no quarrels giving us her personal favorites from the menu. Was seated promptly as well, no complaints

Food: The Chimichanga almost upset me since I asked the waitress if they could use fajitta chicken. She assured me they could but shredded chicken was used instead. I tried it anyways and wouldn&#39;t u know, it was still good (I typically dislike shredded chicken in my mexican food entree). So , bold move that worked out well. Raspberry and classic margarita are again good not great. My gf had the pina colada coconut that was very well done . The guacamole for appetizer we both agreed was lacking, seemed a bit bland and no real taste to it( we added salt to try and bring it to life). not worth the buy imo. The fried ice cream dessert impressed us both. 

Overall: good place for drinks lunch. Layout is your expected tex/mex spot (not a bad thing mind you). Would come back being it&#39;s right around the corner and I want to try few more of the desserts. For all we ordered bill was around 55$ incase youre wondering. Cheers"

Whenever we go to a Mexican restaurant, I almost always order the Chicken Enchiladas with Verde (green) sauce. Not only were the portions perfect, they didn&#39;t leave me feeling bloated and heavy afterwards.

The Chicken Enchiladas are spectacular. The 3 corn tortillas come with refried beans and Mexican rice. I especially like to mix in the shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes that also comes with the order to my enchiladas. The fresh vegetables adds flavor, coolness and a crunchy texture to an otherwise mushy plate of food.

So I decided to go here for lunch one day, I mean I&#39;ve never lunched during their lunch hour. I was really looking forward to the soup they offer with their dinner meals. So we walked in and to our surprise there was a lunch buffet. I thought &#34;wtf, I&#39;m not going to get my soup&#34;. Should have looked at the buffet before speaking. They had so many of my favs: enchiiladas, rice, beans, fajitas, chicken milanesa, taco meat, tortillas for the meat and even seafood entrees! So awesome! 

Unfortunately I&#39;m horrible at all you can eat. My eyes are definitely bigger than my stomach. Is that how that phrase goes?

Their dinners are pretty on point too. Keep in mind, this is a Mexican American restaurant so don&#39;t go in there expecting Abuela Maria&#39;s homemade meals, but it&#39;s pretty good for what it is.

Our server was very nice but she didn&#39;t come around all that often asking if we wanted another cocktail or to see how everything was.

Based on previous reviews, I am quite paranoid I will see a cockroach. However, this place is fairly clean. They say our part of 12 quickly so the previous reviewers may have had a bad experience.

Comparatively to other similar places I expect at least 5 or 6 combo platters. My chimichanga was adequate. It&#39;s no pepe&#39;s. More saggy than other places.

She also didn&#39;t ask if we wanted refills. We were all drinking soft drinks.  Strike three.

The meals are usually very good. But not last night. The carne asada was cooked as I asked, but very tough. The rest of my family also were unhappy with their meals.

My husband stated that we wouldn&#39;t go back again. I, however, will go back one more time. I hope that last night was just an off night. Maybe it was just that the server started the tone of ambivalence to us.

I used to go regularly every Friday night because they are one of the few restaurants with a kitchen open until Midnight on weekends. That&#39;s a HUGE plus because you get quality food late at night when the other options are limited to Taco Bell or White Castle!

The food here is very consistent and delicious. The service can be hit or miss but I&#39;ve been coming here long enough to know the servers and ask for certain ones by name. My only complaint is that recently they have increased the prices on their menu. I understand businesses have to increase their prices as time goes on, but please don&#39;t cheapen the food when you do so. For example, the Mexican Chopped Salad (one of my favorites) used to be cheaper and it came with diced chicken. The salad is now more expensive and does not feature chicken unless you pay a few dollars extra. 

Regardless of the above complaint, I would recommend this place to friends, and enjoy coming here with groups in the summer to sit on their outdoor patio and sip on their delicious sangria and margaritas. They have fantastic drinks."

Well...&#34;I was&#34;, &#34;I do&#34; and &#34;I will learn&#34; are my answers. 

Sadly, my Grandmother, on the Mexican side of our family, has been gone for 10 years, and some of my family members try to mimic her recipes. They always come close and sometimes it is spot on, but when they don&#39;t have the time to prepare a full dinner for me, I plan on coming here. 

The little lady in the kitchen making tortillas by hand, the sombrero they make you wear if it&#39;s your birthday, and the delicious food make this place memorable. 

We went with some friends last weekend after a super long day of errands, working out, tanning, and chores. We were all worn out and if I had to do a dish that night, I was not going to eat!

My buddy suggested coming here. I was a little hesitant because I had been here a few years back and really wasn&#39;t&#39; impressed, but after this most recent trip, I have decided to add this to my regular rotation of dining experiences.

I think we all ordered off their &#34;Dinner Specials&#34; menu and tried something new. I ordered Tacos Al Pastor and holy cow (pun intended), they were so good!! Spicy, but gooooood. Served with Rice &amp; Beans (what isn&#39;t?). Three tacos- I think it was about $10. Very reasonably priced. My guy ordered Shrimp tacos and they were awesome, too! And our friends ordered Fajitas.... gringos! ;) J/k.

They serve you a small cup of chicken soup [with a kick] with your entree and all the chips and salsa you can handle. 

I really enjoyed this place and look forward to another visit soon. My birthday IS next week, I may have to consider going to try on that sombrero!"

It&#39;s a nice place for lunch, dinner or drinks. The place is well-kept and clean and service is pretty good most of the time. 

The food is just ok. The menu is standard Mexican restaurant fare--tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, etc. They sometimes have steak or fish specials--worth a try. 
Each meal comes with their house soup which I find way too salty every time so I have now started to take a pass on it. 

My usual meal is the enchiladas verdes with chicken. And they&#39;ve always been ok. 
My last visit I ordered a taco salad with steak and although the salad was fresh, the steak was not flavorful.  The Margaritas though--those are consistently good and I&#39;ll never hesitate to order one of their house margaritas on the rocks. 

Just an FYI:  on busy nights, even though you have a reservation, you still might have to wait for your table.  So hope there&#39;s room at the bar where you can have a drink while you wait.

I&#39;ve come a couple more times and they are always friendly and efficient. The most recent stop, I surprised them with eight guests on a Saturday evening and they sat us immediately.

We pretty much stuck to booze. We&#39;d already had a ton of tacos on my UYE: Lake Street Taco Tour 2012, so we wanted margaritas and maybe some desserts. My friend Celeste S ordered up a platter of Al Pastor tacos and we were happy to find they are cooked with pineapple, which is hard to find. She also split some flan with me and the rest of us ordered up 3 pitchers of margaritas and plowed through them. We got two Ultimate and one Cadillac. Both were good, but Ultimate was my favorite.

Splitting the bill was a bit complicated because they still don&#39;t offer separate checks. However, we were able to pay one card at a time and they brought out the remaining balance after each swipe.

Him and his wife have two small children at home. He loves Mexican food. La Hacienda was a no-brainer for an adult dinner out. 

Located on Lake Street in Addison, La Hacienda is easy to find with an abundance of available parking options. The hostess was nice, but we were a few minutes late, so our party was already seated. This place fills up!  And everyone seems to come here for birthday celebrations. We heard the singing, clapping and cha cha cha&#39;s countless times during our meal here. 

The food was great. Pretty authentic. Or at least as authentic as my Mexican grandmother&#39;s cooking was. 

What was not so great was the service. There were only six of us, so it shouldn&#39;t have been that difficult. Five had been ordering alcoholic beverages, so I had envisioned better service to keep us here spending our dinero longer. Things like asking for corn tortillas and getting flour instead really agitated me. I ordered my tacos on corn while my sister (who was sitting across the table) ordered her tacos on flour. Different fillings and we both got the wrong tortillas. I asked for corn on the side.  It took F-O-R-E-V-E-R to get them, but when I did, I reconstructed my tacos.  My cousin ordered some sort of pork stew...which he thoroughly enjoyed, but his tortillas were wrong too. Why ask if you aren&#39;t going to deliver?  It&#39;s disappointing. 

After our waiter went MIA, we decided on dessert and drinks elsewhere. We would have stayed, but no one seemed to care if we did or not. Service fail.

By the time we got done eating it was almost 2 hours later and they weren&#39;t even busy. The waitress had a very bad attitude and when I asked for a few tortilla wraps to take home with the mound of fajitas I had left over she charged me extra. I don&#39;t know why they give you a huge amount of fajitas with only 3 wraps. I may try this place again but Uncle Julios in Lombard I believe is their sister restaurant, and it&#39;s way better all around."

Servers have always been great, food always hot and fresh and the ambiance is a nice touch. Great for large parties or just a couple people.

The service was attentive and the food was not bad but could have had more flavor. The chips and salsa they serve are good but beware, the salsa was a little bit spicy.

We went after a movie nearby.  The best thing I can say for the food is that their location is great. Chips out of a bag.  Salsa tastes like it&#39;s from a jar.  Just average everything.

The food here is always hit or miss for me.  Sometimes I come, and it&#39;s fresh, tasty and delicious.  Other times, it tastes like I&#39;m eating the #2s from Caputo&#39;s.  

Last Saturday night, they were serving up the #2s.  The chips were stale, and the salsa a bit bland.  The beans tasted like they came out of a can, so after the first bite, I didn&#39;t eat any more of those.  The chicken soup is a little salty, but still pretty darn good.  The pork tamales were the best thing I ate of the night.  Lots of deliciously seasoned pork on the inside, and a perfectly cooked outside."

Has a convenient location by the movie theatre here in Addison.  I&#39;d probably rate this place as between a 3 and a 4.  The food is good.  Usually comes out pretty quick.

Some of the tables feel a little bit small.  I went once with a party of 4 and sat on the right side of the restaurant, and felt a little cramped in our table.  Usually I was sat at a booth and that was plenty of space

I have also been there for there for the lunch buffet.  A good price for what you get.  Salsa is about average, Margaritas were good.

Overall, a solid Mexican Restaurant."

The service was 4 stars, and it is homey... 
 
I dined there just tonight with 2 other friends.  I had the Taco Salad with beef was sorely disappointed. While the ingredients were fresh, there  was absolutely no flavor at all to the entire salad.  It came with a sour cream on top, lettuce, tomato&#39;s, and slices of avocado.  My disappointment was in the fact that again - there was no seasoning.  I ate about 5 bites and then left the rest - didn&#39;t bring it home.   Friend 1 got a burrito and it was enormous - she said it was OK but agreed it had not much flavor.  Friend 2 had the Vera Cruz fish. She said she has had better.  We all unanimously agreed we would never return -overall we all felt we&#39;ve gotten better food elsewhere for much less. 

p.s. The chips and salsa were just ok too ...  we did not have drinks."

Been here several times, and the results have always been the same...good mexican food.  Not great, but the positives (price, cost, &amp; ambience (plus the good food)) make it a 4 star rather than a 3.  (I wish i could do a 3.5 star, but i&#39;ll lean toward a 4 here.)  

The enchiladas &amp; fajitas are always good, and I really enjoyed the chilaquiles dish today.  The food is good, but don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve been to Mexico several times, and I know the difference between food made and served in Mexico vs. Mexican food in the US.  (there is nothing like a homemade corn tortilla made on the inside of an old hub cap from a tractor, filled with fresh small farm veggies and meat!)  The food here is what most people in the states enjoy, so, for what it is, it is good stuff.  The wait staff is always pleasant and keep your drinks filled, and the interior is very nice and clean.  

I do wish that they would have some seafood options on the buffet as that is something I enjoy (chicken, steak, pork and cheese are in almost everything.)  The chips and salsa are OK, but since the salsa I enjoy most is my own homemade fresh salsa, it is hard to compete against that.  No guac is available on the buffet either. 

But, when you get right down to it, we go here to get stuffed... and....i just lost track of what I was going to say because i really do need a nap now.   zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."

Good venue and nice interior. Good place for groups and a casual date. Portions are huge, but prices are pricier than a standard fare to go with it. Service we got was helpful but he also got a few things wrong too.

I thought the food was pretty decent - the salsa is OK but if you ask for cilantro and onions on the side, that makes your dish much tastier.

Extra sour cream is $0.75 extra but you get a lot so it&#39;s worth splitting with someone.

I got the pulled pork tacos and those were tasty - but doesn&#39;t come with any lettuce, onions, or tomatoes."

Not at all authentic, but since it&#39;s not in a Mexican neighborhood, I wouldn&#39;t expect it. Anyplace that has a chimichanga on the menu is a very telling sign of non-authenticity. It&#39;s like the faux-Mexican equivalent to chop suey. I had the guisado de puerco and it was hot and well-prepared. Their salsa had a nice bite to it.

The restaurant boasted beautiful wooden tables and wooden chairs. Loved the décor! We were seated right away, tucked away in a booth, just the way I like it. We greeted by our server who immediately brought us some chips and salsa. The chips had a nice crunch to it, which tells me they were fresh. The salsa had a kick to it. PERFECT!!!  I ordered the beef soup, which was a massive bowl of beef, carrots, tomatoes, cilantro, onions and a couple slices of lime. My BF is a bit pickier and ordered chicken fajitas which he raved about. He kept saying how excellent they were. That&#39;s a good thing since he prefers pasta and pizza. This is him eating outside of the box. Our server was very attentive, but not overly.

I ordered a Taco Plate with Beef and Corn Tortillas thinking that they would be the crispy type. NOT! They were steamed and soggy and I had to eat them with a fork but were so bad I didn&#39;t finish them. The Frijoles tasted like someone had run a small can of beans through the Cuisinart and put them on my  plate. with no seasoning of any kind. The rice was a little better.

Do I still think its on the pricier side compared to others? yes....but the quality of ingredients and portion size, along with some unique menu options I don&#39;t normally see on Chinese menus, made this place stand out among others...

My recent order though, left more to be desired...hence the 1 star drop..

I went off on a limb and decided to try the Beef Tripe braised noodles...I love tripe and eat it often, but have never ordered from a Chinese place before...also got the Dumpling soup, Pot stickers, Seasoned Fried Shrimp &amp; Moo Shu beef...

First time I had the pot stickers I felt the dough was too thick, yet filling was tasty and substantial...I still feel the same.  I just always need dumplings whenever I order Chinese, cause I love &#39;em...I was sold on the dumpling soup from the moment I had it months ago....but this time, while I still enjoyed the delicious dumplings, the broth really lacked flavor...it was so bland that I had to add lemon juice, and a little salt just to make it go down easier...

The seasoned fried shrimp was lightly floured large shrimp seasoned with salt and pepper...simple dish, but perfectly cooked and nice sized shrimp...this was really good..
Moo Shu beef here is great.  Filled with vegetables and ample beef, flavorful and satisfying...

The braised tripe was perfectly tender.  It came with a side of noodles of your choice. 
In terms of tenderness, it met my expectation, but flavor-wise, it really fell short...
Since tripe has little to no flavor to begin with, it needs a lot of help (acid, seasoning, veggies)..
Sauce/liquid was missing and this included no vegetables (with the exception of finely chopped peppers i couldn&#39;t taste). If your gonna prepare tripe on its own, I expect it to have good flavor and this was just &#39;there&#39;...the braising worked for the texture, but nothing else...yet, I&#39;m glad I tried it.

Maybe the cooks were having an off night with the soup...
I&#39;ve had some great dishes from here, and some not-so-great dishes....
I will just say - - consistency goes a long way..."

The inside was pretty nice, and had your basic setup for a Chinese restaurant, but something I hadn&#39;t seen before were round tables, that was pretty neat to see. Also, it was fun looking at the chinese zodiac papers that were used as place mats. Very interesting how close mine actually matched me!  The restaurant was very clean, and the staff was very friendly and that&#39;s always great!

We ordered The Empress Chicken Lunch Special, and egg roll, Pork Lo Mein, and Mongolian Beef. Each of them came with a soup. We ended up with 2 Egg Drop soups, and 1 Sweet and Spicy soup. The Sweet and Spicy soup was my favorite, and could have eaten a good gallon of that soup!! Don&#39;t change a thing about that soup! The egg drop soup was flavorful too! 

The Empress Chicken was NOT good at all!! The sauce wasn&#39;t much different than General TSO&#39;s. The chicken however, was disgusting! I don&#39;t know what kind of chicken you guys use, but it&#39;s definitely not something I&#39;ve ever had before and not something I EVER want again! The chicken had such a strange texture. It was rubbery, grissely, and had a nasty taste to it. Nothing about it taste like chicken. 

This is the only chinese place I&#39;ve been to where the chicken tasted like that. I&#39;ve read other reviews and they are saying the same thing, so please listen! Change the meat you are using! The Pork Lo Mein was gross too. The noodles I was never used to. They are very narrow, and the Lo Mein altogether was so bland! I also didn&#39;t understand why it had a peanut taste??

Pork Lo Mein to me has NEVER had a peanut taste, so that totally killed the dish. At this point I&#39;m confused if this was really chinese I&#39;m eating, or Thai? The beef Mongolian was pretty good, and loved the sauce, but when 2 out of 3 dishes we had were bad, that&#39;s not good! Please look into changing the chicken, and warn others before they eat the Pork Lo Mein, because it&#39;s different than anywhere we have had it. The waitress who was very nice, took the Lo Mein off of our bill so thank you. I don&#39;t know if we will be back. Please don&#39;t say it must have been an off night, because I&#39;ve seen that comment in a lot of bad reviews that were given, and you seem to have too many &#34;off&#34; nights. It&#39;s apparent that some changes need to be made, and as your guests, please listen! Your customer service I give 5 stars, but the food was a 1 star and overall 2 stars, I&#39;m sorry. Please take these comments as constructive and useful information and not that I&#39;m battering your restaurant because there are a couple of good things about it. 

 We were visiting from Indiana/Wisconsin, and craved chinese, but this didn&#39;t cut it for us. Too expensive for mediocre quality."

We ordered the Veggie Egg Rolls, Sauteed Salt and Pepper Shrimp (w/rice), Fried Fish and Calimari (w/rice), and Chicken and Chinese Broccoli with Cantonese Noodles.  We had complimentary soup, and I tried hot and sour soup for the first time.  Delish!

I really enjoyed everything, but I think the S&amp;P Shrimp and Fish dishes were my favorites!  I also appreciate that they serve authentic Chinese broccoli (not American broccoli with oyster sauce)!  I was the recipient of tons of leftovers, which leaves me a happy camper.

Finally, my search for go-to Chinese delivery has come to an end!!

The food is very good quality. The egg rolls were great. For entrees we had the empress chicken and Mongolian beef. The meat was excellent, none of those fatty gross pieces you sometimes get at poor quality places. The sauces were also excellent. The only thing keeping me away from a 5 star rating was the lo mein. The noodles were tiny and there wasn&#39;t much flavor. Silver Lake still wins on that dish."

There have been some &#34;OK&#34; experiences as of recent, but in general over the 5 years I&#39;ve been going the food is really good and been very positive. The service is great, they remember me and often just confirm I want my normal.

The lunch special is a really great deal. The hot &#39;n sour soup as well as the egg roll are my 2 favorite things of the special and on the menu that keep me coming back. Oh I also really enjoy there sweet n sour for the egg roll, its really pink, but so yummy!

I always rate other Chinese places to this place. I&#39;ve even driven 30+ minutes to come pick up dinner from here because I can&#39;t find another that stacks up to their"

The online ordering was smooth, ant the delivery did get there within an hour (which is what they confirmed both via call and email). So needless to say the service was very good. The food was delivered on time and was hot.

As far as the actual food goes...it was ok. The crab rangoons and the fried rice were very good. The fried rice was overflowing, and flavorful. The egg roll was just ok, and the sweet and sour chicken was way too sweet, and the chicken is breaded and deep fried. I just want chicken in and sweet and sour sauce. Not a bunch of fried chicken in syrup. They don&#39;t have anything sesame (like sesame chicken or beef). The menu is ok but a bit boring and typical. I do like that you can order 2 crab rangoons and an egg roll as an app/side dish. That portion and price is perfect.

Needless to say, it was ok and met my expectations, but nothing over the top and some things were not amazing."

I ordered their house special lo mein and their madu tofu. Both totally bombed. The lo mein had no taste and the tofu dish was made with soft tofu again with no taste. I&#39;m not hard to please since I eat anything and everything under the sun but these 2 dishes got me wishing I went elsewhere. 

The price was ok, a bit pricey for a Chinese joint.

The egg roll is not included in the lunch special?? First time I ever saw that in a Chinese restaurant. I would not go back..
As far as the comments go from the owner.... The service Is a bit over whelming for more then just me as you can see from plenty of other reviews. The servers need to wait until you are finished before pulling the plates. One waiter per table will do just fine in a small restaurant like yours. Also, your food was NOT unfamiliar to me. I find your responses quite condescending. Sometimes no comment is better then commenting on all your reviews."

However, they are under new ownership and it just isn&#39;t as good. General Tso chicken which both my kids love has recently been very dried out, under breaded and under sauced. 

I hope they return to the old cooks, prep or recipes it&#39;s really hard to find good quality Chinese."

Her words were &#34;We cannot Dine you in&#34;.  Humaliated i quickly put them back to their stroller and left. I dont think they were busy just not accomodating to us. Its not that i was alone i had my mom with me. 

I have been to this place and their food was decent just needed to work on their costumer service.

We have never previously had a negative experience with take-out, dining services, or the food until recently. The food isn&#39;t the most authentic, but my family did enjoy the beef noodle soup, hot and sour soup, wonton noodles, and crispy pork chops. 

However, we were recently dining in and ordered our usual. Our hot and sour soup arrived with a big, dead fly in it, buried in the thick gel about halfway down. We did not realize this until we started stirring and serving, so you can imagine how disgusted we were. 

Despite questionable sanitary conditions and lack of proper dish inspection, we were at least hoping to get a refund or compensation of some sort-- we did not. We received a mild apology from our waitress and an offer to replace the soup...no thanks. Being loyal customers for so long, we were VERY disappointed by this poor customer service and stingy accommodations. 

Sadly, we will not be returning for these reasons."

If you deny climate change, or don&#39;t like hearing about how a healthy body reacts to noxious events, don&#39;t read any more of this review other than I still can&#39;t advise going there.  However if want to know what I&#39;m talking about then read on.

My regular place doesn&#39;t deliver so I decided to order from here with a new app. Very impressed with the app and how speedy the service and delivery was. They called and confirmed my order and the gal on the phone was very pleasant. The driver was very also nice. The food tasted a lot better than it did the first time. I actually loved the taste of everything from the Mongolian beef to the chicken fried rice and egg rolls and crab rangoon. However I can&#39;t remember having been so uncomfortable and bloated in my entire life! And I was obese when I was pregnant! Between the two of us we had so much gas I&#39;m pretty sure we made a significant impact on the ozone layer. Suffice it to say that while the food was greatly improved from the first time, every person associated with the restaurant was nice and the app was cool, something associated with that meal really did me in! This is never happened to me before anywhere. Too bad but I cannot give them a higher rating.

Ate my leftovers the next day except for the egg roll.  Still delicious, I felt a little &#34;full&#34;, didn&#39;t go near the leftover egg roll.   I figured maybe it was some bad cabbage?  I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s gone now."

When we arrived at approx. 7:45 pm, the dining room was PACKED!( In my experience, a crowded dining room on a Sunday night is always a good indication that the food is going to be great=) We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and told that there would be a 20-30 minute wait to dine in. We were also told that the dining room closes at 8:30pm. We decided to carry out.

We were impressed by the large menu, but decided to stick with dishes that we were already familiar with. We chose Wonton Soup, 1 order of egg rolls, Mongolian Beef, Empress Chicken, and Beef fried rice. The owner, Sunnie took our order. She was very friendly and answered a few questions that we had about some of the items on the menu. Sunnie said that our food would be ready in 20-30 minutes. While we were ordering our food, many other customers walked in to either pick up their food or to place an order. 

20 minutes later, our food was ready. The car ride home was torture, because we were starving and the food smelled heavenly. ***There is a Chinese restaurant (which shall remain unnamed) in Elk Grove Village, which is a 2 minute drive from my house. This &#34;other place&#34; was always our go-to place if we were craving Chinese food. We finally agreed that all of the dishes at the &#34;other place&#34; looked like pig slop. Umm, is Lizzy Borden the sous chef here? Why are the veggies hacked up in giant wedges? Why do all of their dishes contain an abundance of green peppers? ALL of them. It is obvious that they take zero pride in preparing their food*** 

Now, as I mentioned, the 5 minute car ride home was torture because of the heavenly scents wafting out of the bags. Once we unpacked the bags, we noticed how delicious everything looked. But when we tasted it, WOW!!! Everything was soooo delicious! Boy oh boy, when I took a bite of the Empress chicken, I am sure that I heard angels singing. The wonton soup was delicious: flavorful broth and the dumpling filling was excellent. The mongolian beef was outstanding, with tender slices of beef and just the right amount of green onions. The beef fried rice was great too, because they didnt drown it in soy sauce. And when I bit into my egg roll, and dipped it into their homemade Sweet &amp; Sour sauce, a single tear of joy ran down my cheek, because I&#39;ve NEVER tasted such a delicious egg roll. 

September 27th 2015 was our 1st visit here, and we were so impressed by the service AND the taste &amp; quality of the food, that we will definitely be back very soon. And by the looks of their lunch special menu, with 40 + options, we will continue to patronize this well-run, family- owned business. 2 thumbs up to Sunnie and her restaurant!!"

The food is delicious and all the waitresses and managers are all super polite and very attentive. I never had an empty glass in the food came very quickly. Sometimes when you go to Chinese restaurants they give you a whole lot of noodles and not a lot of toppings. I ordered the beef chow fun of my friend ordered a seafood noodle dish. There was so much seafood and vegetable on that dish it was amazing. The noodle with beef was delicious and they did not skimp on the beef at all. It was a little greasy when I ate the leftover but that is what Chinese food is typically anyway. Overall I love this place and everyone is super nice! Definitely saves a trip going to Chinatown if you live in the burbs.

I kept telling my wife, &#34;this food tastes clean!&#34; Pricing is pretty standard roughly $10 bucks per dish, generous portions.

With that said, the last two times we visited, we left the place feeling rushed.  A group of 3 or 4 servers that would keep on hawking over us the entire time, asking if we were done.  Even before we fished a dish, one would walk by and ask, &#34;done?&#34; with her hand already on the plate. This happened 2 more times before I was actually done with mine.  When I was done, a lady took away my plate without asking.  They constantly walk up and down the isle while starring at your plates to see if they can take away anything.  It&#39;s like they want you to get out of there already. Often times, I felt like I was being supervised.  This did not sit well with us.  This happened last month, and we let it slide thinking maybe it&#39;s just a one time thing.  Well, now I know it&#39;s not a one time thing.  If I could relay a message to the owners, I would like to say you should instruct your servers to wait til everyone at the table is finished before asking, yes, asking to take the plates away."

We went here based on the reviews on Yelp and Google. 
The staff are friendly and very attentive, I don&#39;t I ever had less than half a glass of water the entire time I was there and they were quite busy.  

We ordered an appetizer to share, soups and a main dish.  The crab-meat rangoon were some of the best we have had in a while.  The  wonton soup was nearly perfect.
For our main dishes they were absolutely what we wanted; chicken with vegetables in a nice clear sauce and beef lo mein.  Our typical dishes when going to a new place and they were fantastic. The servings are big, but we were looking forward to having them for lunch the next day as well.

Looking around the mushu pork, fried rice and other noodle dishes looked just as good.   The Mongolian beef looked so good I was momentarily disappointed in my lo mein!

Staff was friendly, fast and curteous. The restaurant itself was clean and noise levels were fine.  We will be back!"

I would say dine in is better. Take out is fine but my only critique is the stinginess on the rice and seems like less meat vs. Dine in. 4 out of 5 is for taste and I would not compare this restaurant to Chef Pings. The 2 are very different....

For those who commented  on service, the service is fine. This is a family owned restaurant and they certainly pay attention to their customers and remember you."

They have no issues making things the way you want, although I have asked for extra celery and bok choy (cheap ingredients compared to a meat item) on 2 occasions and would be happy to pay for them, but didn&#39;t get them.

I called one evening not knowing what I wanted and they suggested a few items for me.  I was not disappointed with any items, nor have I been since.

Definitely try the Cantonese noodles, beef, and Chinese broccoli dish - there are some pictures provided here by others.  It is by far my favorite dish there.

They were just about to close too but they were more than happy to serve my husband and me.  Right away complimentary green tea was brought out. We ordered pot-stickers that had great flavor and came out Jimmy-John, freaky fast! Our entrees were equally delectable and came out quickly. It was difficult to select which entrees as they all sounded superb AND they even had NEW Chinese food options.... wuh?!?

The staff was very friendly and insisted we relax and enjoy our time as &#34;their guest.&#34;  They didn&#39;t want us to feel rushed even though when we looked around the restaurant... we were the last ones there.

Looking around, they did have a full bar. Fresh paint on the walls. Tasteful decorations. Charming restaurant space. One could have a modest party at this location.

The restaurant is small but very tastefully decorated, a bit of a surprise in this strip mall. I love that they provide extra rice when packaging your leftovers.

Without a doubt, 90% of places we go to mess up by doing things like putting eggs in our rice. This place was so attentive to our needs. When ordering, they steered us in the right direction by pointing out things that had oyster sauce or eggs in it. When possible, they made special dishes without meat products. What great service. Of course service is part of it, the food was also great. We ended up over ordering and finishing everything. Highly recommend the string beans and seasoned fried tofu"

We had, among other things, the braised duck. You sort of have to pick the fat out, but the duck meat is awesomely moist, tender and seasoned. The mixed vegetables that came with the dish were snap-crispy. Great all around. 

To start with we had some dumplings. These were pan-fried and also excellent. I recall these having more flavor than the other dumplings I&#39;ve tried. 

Our other main dish was Lo Mein barbecue noodles with pork. Again, surprising bursts of flavor, not at all greasy. This was made perfectly.

We had the house fried rice special as well, which had shrimp (among other meats) and vegetables. Not too salty, seasoned just right. Noodles Delight seems to be the kind of place where they know exactly how to cook all the vegetables, which is always a good thing.

We had a ton of leftovers as well, so even though it&#39;s a bit more expensive than your usual Chinese food place, you still get a ton of food. And that makes all the difference.

I&#39;m looking forward to going back!"

The chicken was moist and tender. Most other places give you glorified chicken nuggets from restaurant depot. I&#39;ve also enjoyed their beef and broccoli in the past. The beef melts in your mouth! If you enjoy some heat, get the Empress Chicken. Crab Rangoon and egg rolls are awesome.......I could go on and on. Whether you&#39;re here for the lunch specials or sharing a dinner with a loved one, you&#39;ll get a great value.

Everything was delicious here - we have come here twice in the past month for dinner, once just my family and we liked it here so much, we came back another time with a close friend and his family.  We had the &#34;Dinner for Six&#34; - it fed us all for dinner that night plus lunch for the next day.

Everything is delicious - from the fried appetizers (that are crispy but not greasy) to the entrees where the &#39;proteins&#39; are all cooked to tender perfection, whether it was chicken, beef or shrimp.  The fried rice was very flavorful, too.

To be honest we have yet to find anything here that we consider to be less than perfect.  I wish they were closer to my home, but we will gladly make the drive back here, despite the 16 mile one-way drive -- THAT&#39;S how good this place is!!"

My must haves are empress chicken and fried rice! We&#39;ve also enjoyed ragoons, won ton soup, orange chicken, and a few others and would recommend to anyone!

The reason for the 2 stars is service. Depending on who answers the phone when I call they will either accept my order, or tell me they can&#39;t do it. I have two children with some food restrictions so I have to specify exactly what is on the dish. Everything else we order straight off the menu. When you call one week and talk to a woman, and they not only take the order but it&#39;s exactly as you ask, and then you call the next week and the guy says he can&#39;t accommodate because his kitchen might screw it up and then the customers get mad at him. It&#39;s a restaurant, how hard is it to make a 3 ingredient dish?  It&#39;s a total cop out and he&#39;s covering his @$$.  I politely stated he lost our business and I would share their inconsistent and non-customer oriented approach. 

If you can order EXACTLY as listed on the menu please try the food. Otherwise find somewhere more accommodating. Silver Lake was happy to not only deliver but accommodate our needs as well. Give them a try."

Was in Chicago for a week staying at the nearby Westin... arrived Monday and started scouting the area for eats on Yelp.  Found Noodles Delight and was getting ready to place my order when.... oops.... they&#39;re not open on Mondays!  Grrr.... minus 1/2 star.

Finally got to try them on Thursday that week - stopped in to do a pick-up order.  The owners were very friendly and know how to care for their guests - even those just waiting for a pick-up order!  Good start....

I ordered a combo noodle of the beef brisket and dumplings over egg noodles, an appetizer of the crispy chicken wings, and a side order of roast duck.  The order was well packed for my take-out.  

Back at the hotel, I started into my feast... and wished I had ordered from them at the start of my week instead of waiting until Thursday.  The food is authentic, well prepared, and miles above the other chinese food locations I tried Mon-Wed that week (hey, I like asian food!).  The wings were, hot, well seasoned, and crispy but moist where it counted.  The dumplings were thin skinned and well made, the brisket was tender, and the roast duck was nicely rendered and flavorful.  Everything I ordered was well made and delicious!

When ordering a small entree meal you expect one small rice (which is a pint), when you order two you expect two small rices (2 pints) they only gave us one and then even the box wasn&#39;t even full. Definitely not enough rice for the amount of the orange chicken provided. The plus is their delivery driver was nice and it arrived quickly. The over the phone service could be improved when someone calls back because something appears wrong with their order, and then to hang up on them. Not cool. Will not be ordering from here again."

I eat here on a regular basis, and I can&#39;t think of anyplace better (for Asian cuisine) in the immediate area.

My only complaint is that they go a little heavy on the cellophane noodles on Mongolian Beef.

Service is very good.

UPDATE:
I added a star. I dined here on a Friday. Great potstickers and I appreciate the complimentary tea.

The place was nearly full, but the service was STILL exemplary. The entire staff is very attentive. The manager was checking in on the customers making sure everything was as it should be. I asked her about an entree I saw at another table, and she took the time to check the orders at the register and show me on the menu.

I ordered 2 pork tacos and a glass of water. For $4.86 I had the best dinner I have had in a very long time.

The service was perfect, they were so friendly and I felt so welcome and comfortable dining alone. The restaurant was clean and when I left I asked about ordering guacamole and chips to take home. The man asked if I wouldn&#39;t mind waiting a few minutes and whipped me up a huge, fresh batch without peppers because he had asked if I like my guacamole spicy. 

Now I have finally made it home after a very long drive enjoying the very best guacamole I have ever had. I am now spoiled off any other guacamole. Next time I am in the area there is no other place I will even consider going to for a meal. Thank you for such a great end to a very rough day."

It is small, maybe ten tables and a bar with a few stools. It&#39;s just east of Barrington Road on Hassel, in an older strip mall next to the 7-11. 

We went for an early dinner. When we arrived at around 4:45pm, there were two people at the bar and all of the tables were open. We grabbed seats, wanting to try their Wednesday night $1 taco and $3.99 margarita specials.

On the regular menu, there are a variety of meats to choose from. The $1 taco special is more limited but has enough options to make you happy. 

After reading earlier reviews, we decided to try their guacamole. I must admit, it was probably the best I&#39;ve had. Anywhere. The guac was fresh with just the right amount of tomatoes, jalapenos, cilantro and garlic. There was plenty for the two of us.

I had three tacos - two steak and one chicken. They are served on double corn tortillas with onion and cilantro. Théy reminded me of great street tacos. My wife had two steak tacos and we split an order of time and beans.

Everything we ate was outstanding. The bartender was generous with the amount of tequila in the margarita, so I only had one. 

But, most of all, the service was fantastic. While we were there, the place started to fill up. But, even when all of the tables were full, he made us feel like we were his only customers.

The prices can&#39;t be beaten. The quality of the food is outrageous and the service is excellent. I think we&#39;ll become regulars on taco night!"

Strange how sometimes the places we visit the most frequently often escape the thought processes for Yelp. Odd. 

Anyway, as you can tell from the vast majority of previous reviews of this little gem tucked away (almost hidden) off of Hassell, people come from all over to get the food here. Here in Hoffman Estates itself, this joint has a damn near cult-like following. They catered a huge party at my apartment complex, the girl I am dating thinks this place is the second coming of Pancho Villa, and their Guac is flat out orgasmic. Does it live up to all this hype? Pretty damn close in my estimation, and this is coming from a guy that adores Mexican food over any other ethnic cuisine out there. 

The restaurant itself is tiny. They have maybe 6 tables, a bar, and a small kitchen. I have always encountered the exact same people every time I have ever visited and they are super friendly. It also gives me the opportunity to work on my rapidly diminishing Spanish language skills. Speaking of which, why the hell do most universities teach Spain Spanish as opposed to the Mexican variety? I think odds are far higher that I will encounter a Mexican in my day to day life in the US than I will find myself sitting in some villa outside of Barcelona, but what do I know? 

I am not going to rehash everything that has been said before about Cantarittos, as the vast majority of what people are Yelping here is 100% accurate. The food is fantastic and about as authentic as you are going to find anywhere I have ever been in Chicago. 

The only reason I rate this place 4 as opposed to 5 stars has to do with a lack of consistency. Sometimes when I show up it&#39;s unbelievable, others it&#39;s just so so. If they could do it up like a rockstar on every visit, they would be firmly sitting undisputed on the top of the food chain and be the gold standard by which all other Mexican places were measured against."

There really aren&#39;t too many GOOD mexican joints in the area... this one gets the job done. I&#39;ve never dined in, but it seems clean and to-the-point. It&#39;s a smaller spot, so I&#39;d recomment it for two-somes or for lunch. I&#39;ve often ordered to-go, and I&#39;ve been called by the restaurant before, notifying me that my food was ready. Clearly, they care about giving quality service grub!

Over the course of a couple of visits, I&#39;ve stuck to really ordering $1 tacos on Wednesdays. You can opt for the lettuce/tomato version, or the more authentic taco with onions and cilantro.  It&#39;s not very filling, and I probably order and extra 1-2 more (less meat and less ingredients overall, say, in comparison to other spots like TBK). 

But I enjoy supporting small businesses, and this one is on point for sure! You won&#39;t find greasy, fatty, poorly cooked anything here. they care.  Extra plus: they once had an elotes cookout during the summer! YUM!

The only down side is that its a small operation with one guy in the front and two people in the back, so service can be a bit uneven, but if you want to eat in smaller places where people actually care about what they serve - then you already have learned to live with that.

(note: I travel to Mexico quite often and only go to local restaurants in Mexico, this review may be a bit skewed since it is compared to my Mexican joint experience- yes, I&#39;m a taco snob!).
I may have been too excited and expecting much more since my fellow Yelpers rated this place 4.5 stars.  I gave this place 2 stars for the friendly staff and decent Pastor taco.  Both meals we ordered came with a free fountain drink.  So that was an unexpected cool thing.  Thank you!
Here&#39;s why it didn&#39;t get any more stars:
I ordered chicken enchilada and taco combo($6.99)- chicken was dry, rice was dry and pretty tasteless, and I don&#39;t care for the beans.
My bf had the steak burrito suizo($9.99) and it was drenched in mole sauce which was too bitter for our liking and the steak had no taste.
We also had the ceviche, this was decent but not worth $6.99.
The location is pretty hidden behind all other business in the busy streets of Higgins.  It&#39;s along a mini strip mall.
The restaurant was ok for a Mexican joint.  Not very inviting.

Service was terrible. Took forever to get chips and salsa to the table. The salsa was watered down without any kick at all to it. Chips came out of a bag. 
I ordered the ceviche and it came out reasonably on time and was not bad. 
When I ordered my dinner, Tampiquena Al Asador (marinated skirt steak with an enchilada) I asked the waitress for some fresh jalapeños and serranos on the side. This was completely foreign to her. She had zero idea what a Serrano was. Not very encouraging for a &#34;Mexican&#34; restaurant! 
When the dinner arrived, as I suspected, there were no jalepenos or serranos. Neither the waitress or the cook had a clue what I was talking about. Finally the cook sliced me some jalepenos - I gave up on the serranos. Good thing I didn&#39;t ask for a habenero! 
The dinner was below average. Steak was over cooked. Enchilada was dry. 
Granted I am from Texas where they do Mexican right. But this place would be out of business in a month ANYWHERE in Texas.

Don&#39;t make the same mistake that I did.

First off, the two stars are for the host/waiter/guy running the place. He was pretty nice and attentive. 

Now to the food. It was total crap. The tacos were tiny. I got one de carne asada and an al pastor. The carne asada was bland and loaded  and loaded with chunks of fat. The al pastor taco had more flavor, but I asked for al pastor and I was given chorizo with chunks of pineapple.

Definitely avoid this place. So not worth it."

To start Flavio is such a nice guy and provides such a friendly dining experience.

The food was excellent!   
Started with the very generous order of freshly made guacamole and those homemade chips.........yum!
I had the Tacos Al Pastor and they were the best I&#39;ve had ANYWHERE! 
Spicy yet the bits of pineapple are the perfect compliment (most places tend to overdo pastor with cinnamon)
My mom had the chile rellenos and they were also excellent.........My dad had the pork stew that Flavio&#39;s mom occasionally has on the menu......YUM! 
My husband rounded it out with the chicken tacos which I don&#39;t believe he left a crumb on the plate they were that good.

We went in on a Wednesday for .99 cent taco night, which was an awesome deal, but I wouldn&#39;t mind paying full price next time. Like other reviews, there isn&#39;t much atmosphere, however it is very intimate; A few seat-yourself tables, a small bar, and a cash register. Where the dining area may lack in decorations, the kitchen, and service more than make up for it. 

The Guacamole: Made fresh. Choice of picco de gallo -- We ordered with the picco de gallo and almost ate the whole bowl before the tacos were ordered; not that service was slow, we just have no self control. Very fresh and delicious. 

The Tacos: Ordered individually, and some ingredients are only available on weekends (the more &#39;exotic&#39; choices). Choice of lettuce and tomato, or onion and cilantro. 
We ordered (with onions and cilantro):
3 Asada (steak):  very tender, and perfect with either salsa--the verde is spicyyy
2 Pastor (pork): also tender, already seasoned so we felt there was no need to use the salsa  
1 Pollo (chicken): I didn&#39;t try this but I heard it was also great especially with salsa

I&#39;m mad at myself for not getting her name, but we really like the hostess/server/cashier/etc. she was very nice and welcoming, and helped make our first visit a great experience.

The location of this restaurant isn&#39;t the nicest, but it&#39;s easy to get to and has a lot of parking.  
The inside of the restaurant is small (4-6 tables) and was very stuffy when I went.  There were a few people eating, but otherwise pretty quiet in there.  
I placed my order and got a variety of steak, pork and chicken tacos to go; the $1 price point was nice.  The waitress had a hard time understanding what I wanted.  You get an option of the following toppings for your tacos: cilantro and onion or lettuce and tomato...why not your choice of any 4 of the toppings...?  I opted for lettuce, tomato and cilantro.  The cilantro addition is what threw her off, but she finally got it.  

I didn&#39;t check out the bathroom so I can&#39;t comment on that, but I did see a child playing in the kitchen around the food.  I&#39;m all for family businesses, but there should not be children (frequent germ carriers) playing where food is being prepared.    

The tacos were ready to go in about 10 minutes and came with some red sauce on the side.  

I got home and opened up the foil wrapped tacos and got to work.  I tried some of the red sauce (which is typically good at Mexican restaurants), but was not a fan...way too garlicky and unpleasant.  
The pork taco was the best and had awesome flavor.  The meat was tender and the seasoning was perfect.  
The steak was mediocre and fairly bland with a bit of chewy fat.  The chicken was flavorless.  If I were blindfolded, I wouldn&#39;t have known what I was eating.  The meat looked good though.   
All in all, this place is average at best....even being in Hoffman Estates.  El Famous Burrito has much better tacos as do the places down Irving Park Rd. in nearby Schaumburg.    
I can&#39;t speak to the other menu options, but based on the tacos alone, I&#39;d likely skip this place in the future."

There was a good portion of meat on each taco (I had one skirt steak, one pork, and one shredded chicken). My boyfriend&#39;s pork burrito was huge! It was really tasty as well, and the sauce on the outside of it was just a tad spicy but nothing too hot.

The al pastor taco was bland, and they got my order wrong.  There are very few quality Mexican restaurants and the Rockford area, so when I go out of town I always pick something up. I spent $14 on a burrito and a taco. when I got home the burrito had sour cream in it which activates my gag reflex! the cook and order taker both were standing next to me when I ordered emphasized my dislike for sour cream. the rice is bland the beans are bland and I can&#39;t tell you if the burritos good or not. I noticed they were maybe a dozen in the area so go somewhere else for a good Mexican restaurant. I will go to Taco Bell for my dinner tonight! obviously I will not be back to this place."

things you should try are the fish tacos, guacamole and the burritos. They are great and large portions so you won&#39;t leave without a full stomach.

Our waiter/chef was a sweetheart (I think he had a crush on our co-worker hehe) and was extremely accommodating.  We all ordered lunch combos which were priced very reasonably at $6.99.  I forget the name of my combo..but it came with a cheese enchilada and either a beef or chicken taco; all combos come with beans, rice, and a large soft drink, .  Since my coworkers and I were ravenous and feeling a bit greedy, we were hoping the enchiladas and quesadillas had meat in them (which they didn&#39;t).  So we asked our waiter if we could add meat to certain dishes.  He was so nice and told us sure.  He also let one of us substitute the beef/chicken taco for a pastor taco and did not charge us anymore for the additions/substitutions.  The only reason I deducted one star was due to the long wait for food, the mixup of orders, and our checks.  Since he was our waiter and cook..it took him awhile to cook our 6 dishes and we were there for a long time.  But it&#39;s so hard to be mad at a guy who was extremely nice and tried so hard to please us.  We&#39;ll be back to Cantarritos when we&#39;re having a craving for Mexican food.

food here is AMAZING. i don&#39;t know what it is but their tortillas taste different too. has slightly chewier and bulkier texture; taste authentic.

Chips are just OK--out of a bag; two salsas are served--gringo red and a tasty verde. 

One thing that I do find irritating is that beverages are listed on the menu without a price.

We were looking for a tasty authentic appetizer and a nice cold maragarita.  The margritas were really good so there were no complaints there and they also have complimentary chips with three different salsas to satisfies all.

However, we ordered the quesadill which was $8 and it was very underwhelming.   It was on a small 6 inch tortilla with barely any cheese and left us unsatisfied because it was so small.

Once we placed the order is when we became disgusted.  It took 45 minutes to receive our food. We were the only people in the restaurant. We ordered tacos and a cheese quesadilla and could not figure out what took so long.

The ambience was nice.  The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  

The bad:
We ordered 3 plates of the steak tacos, a marked &#34;house speciality item&#34; and were surprised to find it was extremely salty.  Its not an exaggeration to say that the taste was not too different from a drink from the pacific ocean.  Not only was it incredibly salty, but salt was the only taste we could discern.  

At a price point of around $15 we were expecting something a little more flavorful.  For the cost of roughly half of this plate you could get yourself tacos from Chipotle that are modestly flavored."

OMG terrible decision...and I&#39;m not being a dramatic female I promise.  When we arrived, we were seated immediately since the restaurant was still fairly empty.  I know this is nothing to be picky about but when I sat down in the booth, the booth seats were so uncomfortable! You sank like a foot down and felt like you were sitting on box springs covered with plastic.  So I thought to myself, I can overlook the ambiance of this little restaurant as long as the food is delicious.  Little did I know that I would continue to be disappointed.  

My coworkers and I were tricked for a hot second that hey, maybe the food will be good because of the chips and salsa.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because we were hungry or if the chips and salsa were especially tasty but we devoured them.  They had 2 different salsas, a green and a red; both of which were yummy but I was partial to the green.  We took some time looking at the lunch menu and I settled on ordering the steak burrito grande.  One of the girls ordered 2 tacos and the other had the enchiladas.  

Ok, now let&#39;s talk about the food.  Service was pretty quick and we got our food within 15 min of us ordering.  When our food came out, my first disappointment was the size of the burrito.  The name of the burrito was &#34;Steak Burrito Grande&#34; and my burrito was far from grande.  The burrito came with a side of beans and mexican rice, both of which were not impressive.  The beans were watery and the rice was overly salty.  As for the burrito, it was so salty I&#39;m pretty sure I ingested my recommended salt intake for the day!  I was less than impressed with everything and to make matters worse, when we asked to split the check our waitress wasn&#39;t too pleased.  She responded with a disheartened, &#34;oh, ok&#34; and a sigh..as if we asked her to split it among 20 people.  

I&#39;ve heard from my boss and other people that their Sunday brunch is pretty good.  However, my one time here for lunch makes me pretty skeptical.  I&#39;m not sure if I would give it another try but if I were to, I&#39;d come for their brunch."

It&#39;s slow, and what gets me the most is that they round the bill, which is weird (is it even legal!?). On two separate occasions they&#39;ve rounded the bill up between 10 cents and 50 cents to make it an even number. The other night a friend and I went for drinks, and our bill was 19.50. We split the bill, and both our charges to our card were $10. We asked the server, who still had our bill saying $19.50, and she said they just rounded it. What? It happened months ago when I was there with my family as well. I just think it&#39;s really odd, we dine out ALL the time and I&#39;ve never had that happen. 

Besides that, she service is always bad when we&#39;re here. It&#39;s so slow, and they&#39;ve forgotten things we ask for fairly regularly. 

The place has potential, but we probably won&#39;t be back."

My coworkers wanted to go for lunch on Friday so we headed over about noon. El Meson is a cute restaurant, hidden in a strip mall on Schaumburg Road. We sat in their beautiful outdoor seating and I loved the atmosphere and seating. Our waitress was nice enough but we were often left waiting...waiting for our order to be taken or waiting for our check...We went over our lunch hour by quite a bit.

Now all this could be forgiven if the food was amazing but it feel flat for me. Their normal menu prices are way high, $16.50 for Bistek Milanesa? And their lunch specials are $7.25 to $10.50. I had the two tacos lunch special for $7.50. This came with one chicken taco, one machaca beef taco, rice and beans. I asked for no tomatoes or onions on my tacos and they came with no lettuce but did include the tomatoes &amp; onions. Aside from the mixup, I found the tacos to be just okay in flavor and beyond greasy. I know good grease, especially when it comes to Mexican food, and this was just...my whole plate and soft taco shell was completely soaked in the grease &amp; juices. It was not appetizing at all that my taco shell broke apart because it was so soaked. The rice has no flavor and was dry. We paid $30 for two of us with tax &amp; tip for lunch, completely not worth it in my eyes.

My friends seemed to all be okay with their food although also not blown away. They paid $55ish between the three of them.  I won&#39;t be going to El Meson again, but I imagine dining on their outdoor patio with a pitcher of margaritas is super relaxing!"

I can eat it occasionally but I don&#39;t make a habit of it. El Mason changed that for me! I suggested to my boyfriend that we go there, strictly for their outdoor patio and a margarita. But the entire experience turned out to be wonderful. 

Let me start with the patio. It is beautiful. My boyfriend and I were seated at a table that was fairly private and along the outer edge. With plants surrounding us, tiki torches that substituted well for candlelight, and music playing in the background, we forgot that Schaumburg Rd was only a few yards away.

It was a gorgeous night and I loved sitting on the patio enjoying their delicious house margarita and complementary chips and salsa. Then the food came. I ordered the chimichanga and it was delicious! I rarely eat an entire meal in one sitting, but I couldn&#39;t resist finishing it all this time around (well, the chimichanga part, side beans and rice never do much for me). The meat was tender and the sauce savory. I can&#39;t wait to go back and have it again! My boyfriend ordered the steak tacos, which he thoroughly enjoyed. 

I checked in to El Meson on Facebook and was surprised by how many people commented to me that they also love this place. Great for families, great for catching up with friends, and the patio makes it great for date night."

The waitress was dressed in cute, classic Mexican garb. The atmosphere was charming. We were greeted with a smile and seated immediately. It did take some time to get some water, chips and have our drink orders taken BUT the food made up for it. I had the House Special beef tacos, the guac, and their frozen margarita.

They offer 1/2 pitchers of margs which I highly recommend if you&#39;re ordering two drinks...costs the same but there&#39;s enough deliciousness for 3 margs.

Not a huge fan of the rice tho ... kinda bland.  And... I just don&#39;t like strip malls."

Chips / Salsa - unsalted or barely salted chips, salsa is ok, not great

Horchata - it was like tasting creamy sand ... i actually sent it back sadly.

It&#39;s been many years since we went to El Mason in Schaumburg so we decided to try it out.  Our memories of it from years past were very very good.

It&#39;s nicely decorated and very clean - always a plus.  You enter the restaurant in the rear where there is plenty of parking.  (The area around Roselle and Schaumburg Roads can be very busy.)  We were seated very quickly.

The first strike was the layout of the restaurant.  The restaurant looked smaller than we recalled, and every seat seemed to be taken.  But, since it had been so long since we went there, we didn&#39;t really remember how it was set up.  I would guess that over the years it expanded and must have taken over a space to the west of their main space.  So, we were guided along a long hallway, past the restrooms, to another dining area out of view.

The three of us were given a table for six, since it was all that was available.  Strike 2 - we were seated and given one menu.  There seemed to be one waiter frantically moving from one table to the next.  He acknowledged us after about 10 minutes and we asked for two more menus.  Sure, and he rushed off.  More time passed as he brought food out for tables around us.  He stopped again and apologized saying he would be right back with the menus. A few more minutes went by and he dropped them off.

Strike 3 - he asked if he could take our drink order, then excused himself quickly to run off to another table. While he was gone, we were brought chips and salsa.  Now, I will complement them on their salsas.  There were two - one red, a little spicy and quite smokey flavored.  The other was green, a little spicier and sharper and had a distinct citrus flavor.  Both were very good.

He offered to take our drink order, but we were more than a little frustrated by that point so said we would also be ordering our meal.  Believe it or not, he ran off again.  When he came back he, pleasantly, complained that he was the only one working the back.  Well, duh.  We figured that one out already.  On subsequent stops to our table that became his mantra - I&#39;m the only one back here.  

Overall, the food was good.  I had burritos - one shredded beef and two chicken.  The beans and rice were both good.  The burritos were soggy.  Jon had chicken soup - it was incredibly large, loaded with chicken and vegetables, including a whole zucchini, in one piece...  Kerrie had veggie enchiladas.  Both remarked their food was good too.

This is probably the longest review I&#39;ve written in the few years I&#39;ve been writing reviews for Yelp.  But, the service was so bad it was comical.  I don&#39;t know if this is the way they do business, or if they were just shorthanded that Friday night.  And, I really don&#39;t care to hear waiters complain about their jobs.  

This was unfortunate.  El Meson has been around a long time and I have fond memories.  But, given this experience, it will be a long time until I next return."

Then I received my cold horchata no ice exactly as I requested, It was great. The food came later and It was delicious, fresh and good size. While I was enjoying the meal I could not fail to appreciate the decor of the restaurant, very colorful and with many Mexico ornaments and music too.

Chimichanga-FRIED burrito that can be filled with a variety if meats. 
As we all know, &#34;fried&#34; means crispy. I say that to say when you douse a chimichanga or &#34;fried burrito&#34; in sauce, it makes it soggy defeating the purpose of it&#39;s being. I love chimichangas and no where on the menu does it state that it will be drenched in sauce otherwise I would have ordered it on the side. The meat, (chicken) was seasoned beautifully and tasted great. The sauce had it been on the side would have been a great compliment to the dish. The bean were cool in temperature and a bit soupy, the beans themselves were a tad hard and slightly undercooked. The overall taste of the beans was &#34;ok&#34; I could have done without them and I love beans. They also give the same amount of sour cream and guacamole with the macho chimichanga as they do with the regular size which is insufficient. If I&#39;m paying $2.25 more for a macho I think I should get more condiments to accompany its size. I ordered the regular margarita which is the special on Wednesdays for $5. I had my frozen, the consistency was great but couldn&#39;t taste the alcohol. The staff was polite but the service was minimal. For a $17.25 price tag, not worth it due to the lack of a full experience. I MIGHT come back but probably not."

While I always have my fave few restaurants that I HAVE to visit, I decided this trip that I was going to try new restaurants. After reading some reviews for el meson, I figured I may as well give it a try....

Food - 
The food was good, I&#39;ve just had better.. The chips were great in the beginning- warm and seemed fresh, but as they started cooling off, they had the &#34;fresh from a store-bought bag&#34; kind of taste. They had 2 salsa options, the green was a tangy milder salsa and the red was a pretty spicy red salsa. They were definitely good! However, I asked if they had a milder red and they didn&#39;t. I ordered the vegetarian combo (guac tostada, cheese and onion enchilada, and bean burrito). The tostada was okay- I love guac so I was happy with it... the enchilada sauce was too salty, and the bean burrito was just beans in a small tortilla- could have done that myself :-\ ... My friend got the taco lunch special and I was impressed that they put all the toppings on the side- smart! 

Price - 
Definitely more expensive than some better mexican restaurants... Entrees can range from 13-28 dollars depending on what you get.

Service-
Considering we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant (with the exception of one other group of 2 that were there for maybe the first 10 minutes we were there), you&#39;d think they&#39;d be very on top of things. The waitress was in the beginning, but then started to slack. I placed my empty glass of water at the edge for a while and it wasn&#39;t refilled. When the guy came to give us our food I asked him for a refill on my water and my friend asked for a diet coke refill. He eventually brought her diet coke and my water remained empty. Finally the waitress came by when we were almost done with our meals and I asked her (third request) for water which was finally refilled. Again- we were the only customers....... wonder how the service is with a room full of people. 

Drinks -
Can&#39;t comment on this, we just had water and diet coke. 

Overall- I&#39;m giving this place 2 stars- the food was OK - nothing special. Service was poor even though we were the only ones there and they kept the place pretty cold (in chicago winter.... not cool)... probably because they didn&#39;t want to pay a heating bill for 2 customers, but still. 

I doubt I&#39;ll return to El Meson- Maybe it&#39;s better on other days, but my experience wasn&#39;t the best."

The tables and booths were spaced far enough apart that out conversation was private but very cozy dining room for every table taken. The cheese quesadillas with chicken were delicious. I&#39;m not a guacamole person, but I ate my entire helping. I ordered the carne asadas which were the best I&#39;ve EVER HAD. My husband ordered the enchiladas which he also said were very tasty. EVERYTHING was hot and we were surprised with a dining room full of people how quickly we were served. We had guave margaritas on the rocks with sugar rim...I&#39;ve never had one but I&#39;m a huge fan now! Wow!

I feel like this place has been there forever...or maybe it&#39;s just been there since I was a kid. Regardless, even as an adult, El Meson is still pushing out some solid Mexican eats that are both nostalgic and delicious. 

My mom and I rolled in here on a recent weekend afternoon to an almost empty restaurant. Mind you, it was 3 pm on a Saturday, so the lack of other patrons wasn&#39;t super surprising. Service was more than impressive, especially considering the typical occurrence of &#34;phantom server&#34; when restaurants are completely dead.

We went pretty simple and opted to split the chicken quesadilla appetizer. After we had dined on the hot, fresh and perfectly crispy chips and salsa at the table, we didn&#39;t want to overstuff ourselves. While the quesadilla is on the small side (it is an appetizer after all), it&#39;s packed with one of my most favorite cheeses of all - Chihuahua. I would eat said cheese on a daily basis if I didn&#39;t have pants to fit in to.

So, is El Meson the best Mexican I&#39;ve ever had? Nope. Do I think some of the items are overpriced for what you get? Maybe. Will I come back? Absolutely. The nostalgia, ease and Chihuahua cheese make it all worth it."

There is a patio for dining al Fresco with a big green lawn between you and Schaumburg Road.

The place is a standard, sit-down mexican joint. The food isn&#39;t spectacular and the fajitas didn&#39;t seem to be spiced at all other than peppers and onions.

The beans just seemed a bit watered down, thin and tasteless.

The mexican rice was also rather bland.

They charge you for any more than the first bowl of tortilla chips... weird that they don&#39;t mention that when they offer you more!!

The salsa and assorted sauces were very tasty and one of the saving graces.

The price points seem about 25% higher than any other mexican place. Must be the locale.

The rice pudding was cold and not very cinnamon-y. The flan was decent.

This place is too expensive. The meats and veggies were cooked well but the flavor and spice wasn&#39;t there."

Rude, rude rude. The &#34;guac&#34; made table side was so salty, and tasteless that we didn&#39;t even eat it. I ordered the burrito with shredded beef--I was served my burrito with ground meat dripping with grease. 

We both ordered margaritas when asked how many the half pitcher would serve, we were told that they were only serving singles no pitchers on Saturdays??????????? When questioned she just shrugged.

Better off going to Taco Bell. Prepare to be paying city prices. Horrible service also. Be prepared to wait awhile and drink tap water that tastes like toilet water. Also beware the waitress will sneak in a 15% tip no matter what the bill is or how many people are in your party. So she will be getting a double tip each time! Is this even legal?!?  I&#39;m gonna go with no!

Of course, I had to order those delicious tamales again...and this time I cleaned my plate!  No leftovers for lunch tomorrow...

I&#39;m posting this update because I experienced two new things:

-We tried the sangria- fruity &amp; quite good , though not as strong as others I&#39;ve tried.  I did love the option of ordering it by the glass, the 1/2 pitcher or the full pitcher.  Our server, Gabriel once again, suggested we go for the 1/2 pitcher instead of two glasses - more bang for our buck :-)

-We sat on the patio.  Even though it&#39;s along Schaumburg Road I didn&#39;t really notice traffic noise since the patio was quite full of diners having a grand time.  The patio is mostly covered so even if it were raining out (which it was threatening to do this particular evening) you can still hang outside. And citronella candles for each table!  THANK-YOU!  

One downside to this visit - this time the rice had a very slight metallic taste to it.  Strange, I&#39;ve never had anything not taste fabulous here.  Not sure what the cause was but since this has never happened before in all the times we&#39;ve dined here I&#39;m not worried about it."

I took my wife and Son along with my parents here.

It&#39;s a great location, albeit abit obscured you might even drive past it due to the trees in the front, If I wanted a small restaurant I would definitely want this location. &#34;El Meson&#34; decoration resembles a countryside rancho in Mexico.

We went in for the Morning Brunch, great open styled buffet, Omelet grill you can even order and open styled Omelet if you want. Some of the items on the brunch menu are not worth the $15 price tag I&#39;m afraid, 4 pork Items that are identical except for the sauce. Other than that it was a good brunch. Food was overall good.

     As I said earlier It is a great location I love the outdoor patio they have and I can image how beautiful it must be out there on the late night service.  The food was good as is with any other Mexican joint. but not worth the amount of money paid for such food when I can get the same taste elsewhere. and Guacamole at $8 a pop is asking to much. My main grip with this place is simply the price for simple staple Dishes. The staff is very attentive if not slightly forgetful at times.

    so WITH all this said it&#39;s still a good place to eat, suggested Items, Sopes, Guacamole, Omelet, and fajitas- it&#39;s a toss up for me while I love the place decor and location, I feel that the menu needs some work along with pricing."

The basket of hot tortilla chips and are good.  The guacamole made table-side is also really good.  But my favorite thing here is their Mole, which is packed with flavor and really good.

The place gets pretty packed, which is usually a good indication that the foods good.  Plus I saw they make some huge margaritas.

Great food and friendly service."

What happened to tomatoes, cheese, lettuce, etc???  It&#39;s literally only steak and the tortilla with sauce and cheese on top.  Save your $$ and go elsewhere.

My Spanish 2 class study the restaurant.  I organized to go to El meson so the students would be able to practice the lesson they had learn in the classroom.  The objective was to order and speak Spanish.  Some parents who speak Spanish helped me in the field trip.  Their job was to keep up with the Spanish conversation with the students. Also, the students knew that had to pay the check and tip to the waitress.
On November 3,  I went to the restaurant and I gave to the manager a copy of the menu with the quantity of each foodstuff the students were going to order, that way the cook and waitresses could be prepare for the next day.  
On November 4 my class, parents and teacher arrive to the restaurant at 11:30. We were 70 people. The waitress started taking the order right way.  Some tables were serve in fifteen minutes.  However, there were three tables that waited 45 minutes.  One table was serve until 1:10 p.m.  
The students from that table were very hungry.  I talked to the manager about the subject.  She told me the food was getting ready. 
At 1:30 the manager went to collect the pay from that table.  The parent who was in charge was upset and told her that he and the students would not give the tip because it took them too long to get their food.  The manager argued that everybody had to give the three dollars tip.  The parent told her that she did not gave to that table a good service.
The manager was upset and she went to complaint to me that the parent and the student from that table did not want to give her the tip.
I told her, &#34;but you were late to serve that table.&#34;
She said to me, &#34;Well, you did not bring the right numbers yesterday and it is the reason we were late.&#34;
I was in shock.  She was accusing me for their bad service.
I saw her distressed. She wanted to make and squeeze every single penny from my students.  Each students, parent, and teacher spend a proximally $12.50 around $900 in food.  Besides each person was giving three dollars tips around which was around $210.   Then, the manager was not letting the rest of the waitress charge the tables because she wanted to take over the tip.   Time was running because it was taking too long for one person to charge all the tables.
We were in the school after the time I had planned.
I will not do another field trip with my students to El Meson again.  My family and I will not visit the restaurant."

I can&#39;t get over the reviews that people are leaving on here. I&#39;ve gone there with friends and have even recommended people to come here and they always call me and tell what a great time they had.

The food was ok - not memorable, not bad. 

The service is what will keep me from going back. I used to be a server, so I understand how tough it can be when you&#39;re really busy. But when I&#39;m one of 3 tables, you should be checking in on me more often for water/chip refills, etc. Went for margaritas with girlfriends during a happy hour deal.

They DO have amazing outdoor seating, so that&#39;s really nice, but ambiance doesn&#39;t really make up for lack of flavor and overinflated pricing.  I think El Meson has definitely fallen out of favor with our family lately.

We will not be going back to El Meson for brunch or any other meal. We didn&#39;t even stay to eat today due to the issues.

We&#39;ve been going to El Meson for the last 10 years. We had lunch there once and found the service horrible and the food decent but nothing noteworthy, so we gave another Mexican restaurant our lunch/dinner business.

Brunch was the one area where El Meson stood out. It&#39;s the only Mexican brunch buffet in the area and features a huge molcajete full of fresh guacamole, several different salsas, a few meats and toppings to make your own tacos, a few premade Mexican items, a cooked to order egg station, delicious waffle boats made fresh when you order them, fresh squeezed orange juice made in an old fashioned iron juice press, and coffee with a faint hint of cinnamon.

The biggest issue with the brunch was horrible service and inconsistent availability of promised items. We let it slide. It was brunch and 95% of the items were self-service. The omelette station/waffle station always opening late just meant we&#39;d have a leisurely meal. Items missing from the steam table would eventually be brought out if we just had patience.

However, on our last visit prior to today, we got to the restaurant 5 minutes after posted opening time and it was locked up. Someone let us in a few minutes later. The steam table was out, but no trays were on it. The omelet/waffle station wasn&#39;t set up. Chairs were still up on tables from the floor mopping. Again, we showed patience and food was brought within 10-15 minutes, except for the omelette/waffle station. No one was cooking on it. As I already pointed out, we had experienced a delays on the opening of this station in the past, but this wait was over our typical experience. I overheard the server tell another party that the cook decided he really needed to go to church that morning, and thus they were waiting for him to come in late. When we were about 70% done with out meal, someone finally manned the station. Perhaps it was the cook who finally arrived.

Which brings me to our experience today. Learning from our last visit, we arrived at El Meson almost *20 minutes* AFTER posted opening time. It was locked up tight and large group of people were waiting in the parking lot. I walked up to the window to look inside. NO steam table set up. NO omelette/waffle station set up. The lights were on and ONE person was working frantically to ready the place.  The dining tables were still out on the area of the floor that the steam table and various stations should occupy. They were nowhere near ready to start brunch and it was 20 minutes after their scheduled opening time.

We had plans with another family later that morning and did not have the time to wait around while they go their act together to start serving, so we left. It&#39;s a shame that there is such a lack of accountability on the part of the staff/ownership of El Meson.  We&#39;ll miss the brunch."

Everything was fresh and delicious. They had a made-to-order omlete and waffle bar, which you can customize with a great variety of toppings including cheese,  guac, pico, and a selection of  salsas (didn&#39;t get a waffle so didn&#39;t pay attention to those toppings). My meal also included tasty tamales, taquitos, and stewed beef and chicken. Finished with some nice rice pudding and fresh fruit for dessert. Among what I didn&#39;t try  was standard Mexican fare like rice, beans, and everything you need to make tacos and tostadas.

I heard good reviews about brunch and let me just say the food was great. My family and I came at the time when it was empty and the service was fast.

First of all the service was horrible with the waitress lacking any type of personality or service skills. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever been to a Mexican restaurant and charge extra for second rounds of chips and salsa( completely outrageous ) after seeing our dull waitress only two times and waiting for refills we finally received or entrees. We had the chicken and steak fajitas with the Carne Asada. The first thing I noticed was the portion size on both entrees being small considering prices were high on both. The food had no flavor at all I expect more when dining at a family business especially when it comes to Mexican Food. Over all this place was one of the worst places I&#39;ve ever been to eat and wouldn&#39;t recommend or ever go back. I felt like asking for my money on the way out.

They wanted &#34;Mexican&#34; and it&#39;s a minute away. We haven&#39;t been there in a while, so we figured, why not?  

Not many people in the restaurant when we arrived, granted it was an early dinner, so we were seated right away. And as usual, there weren&#39;t any Mexicans eating, but since I know what to expect, I was fine with it. It was a chilly day, so we sat inside. (Sitting outside is nice on a warm day, but during high-traffic times it can get a bit loud.)  

I asked if they have something special for an anniversary, and I was told promptly, No. (I was thinking not even a scoop of ice cream, or a flan with a candle or something...???) 

Drinks and food were ordered... Margarita was pretty good, but the larger glass might have been an optical illusion (that and a lot of ice) as it seemed that I drank it rather quickly - which isn&#39;t usually a problem, but I didn&#39;t get any water and the service was infrequent. 

I ordered the steak oaxaquena. I didn&#39;t get any tortillas, so I had to request some. The tortilla warmer came and inside were three! Yes three! Gawd. Well, my steak was in a spicier sauce, and actually pretty tasty, BUT the instant I took my first bite my stomach hurt. I knew right away that they use a ton of salt. I don&#39;t have an ultra-sensitive stomach, but it is a very good indicator of sodium content and nitrates - and this place (or at least my dish) uses Olive Garden-like levels. I just couldn&#39;t finish my dish...

Others seemed to be enjoying their meals (combination plates and a fajita plate), so maybe it was just mine. 

Our server, as mentioned earlier, was seen infrequently. Having two kids, we could always use napkins, or spoons and such, but since we didn&#39;t see our waitress after our food came, I ended up getting those things myself. I should&#39;ve gotten myself a water while I was up too. 

We finished up, and luckily I was with good company. The bill came and it was a darn good thing I checked it, as they added an 18% tip - assuming because of our party of 6. When I didn&#39;t add any extra it seemed like I got a look... 

It&#39;s within walking distance, but it&#39;s a shame. I&#39;d be hard pressed to go again."

So why only 3 stars? We just weren&#39;t thoroughly impressed with much here except the pitcher of margarita we ordered. The ceviche was mediocre and so were the tacos and regular enchiladas. I ordered the mole enchiladas because of all the Yelp raves but wasn&#39;t really happy with my meal. My main gripe is the overall sodium content in all the dishes we tried. It was like sucking on a taco flavored deer lick. At least it helped us drink the tasty margaritas quickly.

I really want to like this place so I&#39;m going to try it again but this time I&#39;ll tell them to hold any additional salt possible so that I can taste the food instead of the Dead Sea every time I take a bite.

First of, two words: Sunday. Brunch. 
Omelet, waffle, taco, and salsa stations all under one roof?! You bet! With a sampling of many of their popular items, you can&#39;t go wrong for a hot and spicy, and inexpensive brunch. 

As for the regular menu, the dishes are very authentic. This isn&#39;t your local Chevy&#39;s or Taco Bell ((thank god)). El Meson serves up the real deal. As always, you can order a combination platter to try a few different options. Just about everything comes with rice and beans - obviously. El Meson is infamous for their margaritas, mole sauces, table side guac, and killer salsa. All are delish, and all I would recommend.

Fave Craves:
::Vegetarian platter: guacamole tostada//cheese burrito//cheese &amp; onion enchilada
::Chiles Rellenos
::Flautas ((chix please!))
::Chimichanga ((Machaca beef...mmmm...))
::Homemade Guac ((duh!))
::Enchiladas - Hot//Medium Hot//Mild. ((I dig cheese with the green mild sauce. nom.))
::Caldo de Pollo ((chicken soup - so good for the soul!))

Service has always been great. The staff is extremely friendly and knows how to serve up a Mexican meal right! Between the decor and music...I swear you feel as if you&#39;ve been whisked off to Mexico. Too bad you&#39;re only in Schaumpton. ((weak))

The atmosphere was decent. Nothing special, but nothing wrong with it at all. The food was tasty. I had the mole enchiladas and my fiance had a different enchilada plate. They were both very good. Big servings, good flavor and tasted fresh. We ordered a cheese dip appetizer and got the wrong one. However, what we received was very good. So, I had no complaints.

Overall, a bit pricey, but it was to be expected. I would recommend this place for some good food and decent drinks. I read some reviews of the service being awful and I didn&#39;t think so at all. I thought it was just fine. We will go back."

I&#39;m not driving all the way from Naperville again, but whatever.

The chips-- fine. Not amazing. You are only allotted one basket per table and then you&#39;re charged like $2.50 for a second basket. Bummer. I have never ever ever ever ever heard of this in CA, where I come from. The salsa was good. They provide a red and green tomatillo. I enjoyed both. 

The prices for lunch were good and they offer both the lunch and dinner menus. I had a cheese enchilada, avocado tostada (they call it a guacamole tostada but it was definitely only pieces of sliced avocado), rice and beans for $7.25, pre tax. Not bad!

I&#39;m a vegetarian that doesn&#39;t consume lard or animal stocks, so it&#39;s nice to know their rice uses veggie stock and their beans are without lard. FYI to other veggies out there who dig Mexican food.

Nice patio outside. Glad I visited."

Wish the weather was nice, the patio area outside looks like a nice place to enjoy a drink on a sunny day. 

The food was decent. Really about what you would expect and on par with places like Chevy&#39;s. I had the Enchiladas El Meson and she had Chicken Taco. Portions were large as neither one of us finished our plates. Her tacos were dripping water/grease/something out when she picked them up. Not the most appetizing way to start the meal.

5) Happy decor to be in

The bad;

1) Family members as waitresses = a) walking past you and not looking you in the eye as you are trying to flag them down b) communication by grunting with no interest in describing the food or pointing you in a direction c) generally slow and inattentive service because they are not going to be managed or fired.

2) Tableside guac! ohh sorry not today its Tuesday, oh and we must have run out of salt, pepper and spice. Didn&#39;t we say it was bland guac night!!

3) Lots of pre made menu items that tasted pre made, dry and bland.

I have gone to this restaurant since I was young, it&#39;s the only real mexican restaurant in Schaumburg that I was ever aware of.  My family and I are still fans, going as often as we can (especially now that I moved back to the area).

Margaritas, guac and almost anything on the menu is amazing!  Food comes out quickly and is fairly priced (cheaper and Way Better quality than the big mexican chains!).  Servers know spanish, if you wish to order in spanish you can (you can&#39;t get that at the big mexican chains either). 

Summer is my favorite time to go since I enjoy hanging out on the patio with girl friends and a margarita after a long day of work.  If you received bad service while visiting this restaurant, you should really give it a second chance.  No one is perfect and everyone has off days just like you."

It&#39;s great for 2 people or a large group.  When I came here to have dinner with 10 other people, we had a great time.  The service was fantastic and the food was great.  As with most Korean restaurants, they bring out a set of banchan, which are like mini appetizers mostly of different kinds of pickled vegetables.  I enjoyed the variety of bancahn they had here, especially the omelet one.

There are tons of options on the menu besides the table BBQ where you (or the restaurant) grill the meat.  For the BBQ, you can pick different types of meat (minimum of 2 servings) or you can go with one of the 3 combos that are for 3+ people for $68.  Each combo comes with 4 different types of meats.  The galbi and bulgogi are always a favorite.

Other things on the menu includes bibimbap $10 (signature Korean rice bowl served with vegetables, beef and fried egg), all sort of stews $10 - $14 (spicy fish roe is one of my favorites), stir-fry, and noodle soups $10.  Their Bokpunja black raspberry wine was delicious!"

It was our first time here and the service was excellent. The waiter explained the menu to us. She asked if we wanted to do the BBQ or the regular menu with food from the kitchen and we chose the Korean BBQ of course! 

They offered 3 different combos, which each have 4 different meats. We chose Combo B, which had pork belly, galbi, brisket, and sirloin steak. The combos are $68 but it&#39;s worth it for the quality and flavor of the meat. It also comes with miso soup and rice so this is the best deal. Otherwise, you can order the meats individually but it&#39;s more expensive this way, with each meat averaging in the $20 range. I would&#39;ve given 5 stars but I just wish this place was unlimited all you can eat KBBQ but it was definitely top quality meat, worth the expensive price tag.

I also loved that each of the servers would come by and ask if we needed anything and they would cook the meat for you unlike at other KBBQ places. It&#39;s nice because you can just relax and eat while they cook the food in front of you!

This place has become one of my top KBBQ restaurants. I do have to say that it is pricy for 2 people, the Combo was $68 plus $8 tax to the bill plus tip. We paid around $90 total and for that price, I wish it was unlimited KBBQ. However, the excellent service and quality of the meat makes it worth the price. Can&#39;t wait to go back and treat my parents to dinner here!"

I&#39;m not greatly impressed, but I&#39;m not exactly  disappointed either. Somewhere sort of in the middle, I suppose, is the most apt way to put it. The meat servings were sweet and juicy, but small (AND EXPENSIVE, but we&#39;ll address that later). Rice bowl portions were also initially small (seriously).
The side dishes (banchan) were good, however. The kimchee is a little more on the fresh side (not as fermented) with a good spicy kick, the vegetables and herbs were well-seasoned, and this is one of the few places that has macaroni salad (which is always good in my book).

So the BBQ was just mediocre, but the soup was incredibly bland and the codfish casserole was really not very meaty at all and I just got a lot of the fat. Granted, the fat is part of the fish, it just seemed a little excessive. The soup was somewhat spicy but almost flavorless, and there weren&#39;t as many vegetables as I would have thought. It was just missing some of the essence of what makes this particular soup special.

SERVICE *Note, I suspect they were short on servers this day
The meat was cut initially by Friendly Sam L (who may be a manager there, according to Yelp. Seems like a nice guy). But he didn&#39;t exactly cut all of the meat that we ordered, so after placing what was cut on the grill, he dropped the tools into the meat dish and ran off (in his defense, it was sort of busy). However, the meat on the grill was gone within minutes and we were left feeling ignored. Not a major complaint, but don&#39;t expect the servers to cut and grill the meat for you (as some of the reviewers have had). Here is where the problems REALLY began:

1. When we were seated, the banchan came out, but instead of the server placing the banchan on the table, she handed the tray over and we had to unload the banchan ourselves. My wife was rather taken aback but the serving lady offered no excuses. There was nobody at the table next to us so it&#39;s not that she was physically unable to walk around and place the banchan on the table. Rather, she just couldn&#39;t be bothered with it. At any other Korean restaurant, this is unheard of.

2. After Sam cut up some of the meat, he got called by a table and ran off, but dropped the tongs and scissors INTO the meat and juices, handles and all. We noticed this and did not want to touch the tools which were now swimming in the meat juices. I&#39;m not sure but last I checked, that could be a health code violation, especially since he was handling the tools with his bare hands. We didn&#39;t want to touch the tools, but the next lady who came to cut up the meat (not grill, just cut) ignored our observations with some hasty excuse and just cut using the same, wet tools.

3. When you have at least 3 grown men at the table, it&#39;s a good idea to keep an eye out to see if there&#39;s anything that needs to be refilled. Nothing got refilled until much later and we were left sitting, feeling rather ignored.

4. I counted exactly once, that we were checked up on. Once.

5. I emptied my water cup, as did some of the others at our table. Only one cup was refilled. Once.

6. We asked for rice and soup, which, for those who don&#39;t know, at a Korean BBQ restaurant, those are the most basic dishes that are ALWAYS ready to go. Those took about 15-20 minutes to arrive, and they were not well filled-out (the soup had a few vegetables floating around in it, but that was it), and the rice bowl was seriously 1/2 filled and fluffed (not packed). 

PRICE
EXPENSIVE. It costs $29 per order of gal-bi and we had to order 4 servings to feed 6 adults (it still was nowhere near enough). The A combination was $67, and while it would have been a little less food (but 4 different kinds of meat), the amount of gal-bi per serving that we got instead was absolutely not worth $29 per serving.

We also ordered a codfish casserole as well to go along, which is extraordinarily expensive for what it is. 2 clams and 1 piece of fish for this price?

We were also going to order the spicy stir-fried rice cakes, but $14 is...criminal...for what it is. Most places will serve the same plate for about $9.99, which while still a little pricey, is a better deal than what they have here. Although I admit we didn&#39;t order it, for $14, this dish ought to be massive since rice cakes are seriously nothing but densely-packed belly-filling carbs and it&#39;s dirt cheap to boot.

AMBIANCE
Clean(er), but noisy and crowded. Very oddly, there are marathon medals and pictures near the door, but I don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re there. Is this marathon food? Should we be motivated to run? Unless they&#39;re awards or restaurant reviews, I don&#39;t understand the point. Just sort of strange.

FINAL THOUGHT
Despite my complaints, it&#39;s really not a bad place. The meat is pretty tasty and service (can be) pretty friendly. I just wish (as I imagine others might too) it was a little more reasonably priced and the portions were a little...bigger. I will say, however, this place does have some potential. Guess we&#39;ll se"

I think I like this place better than Koreana also because the interior is a lot cleaner and more ventilated- a necessity if you don&#39;t want to leave smelling like Korean bbq. The service was pretty slow, however, and Korean restaurants are usually known for their no-frills faster service. So that was a disappointment.

I ordered the dolsot bibimbap with beef. It was a deliciously huge portion in a nice sizzling stone pot. I loved the array of tasty seasonings and veggies in this dish. The banchan (side dishes) are also pretty good here- awesome picks including Kim chi, radish Kim chi, seasoned cucumber, fish cakes, beans, pasta salad, and more. 

Always a very filling meal when you go to a Korean restaurant, and I was definitely way too full after this meal. Better that than still needing more food though! Overall a satisfying experience."

We sat down for some Korean BBQ at a special table for it. It has a little indent in it where they place a grill top and grill the meats on. The experience of seeing it grilled and eating it straight off the grill was awesome. We got the beef something, forgot the exact name and a chicken. Both were exceptional and my favorite part was that it seemed to be a family restaurant. A lady cooked up our beef, older one and she was really nice! She also showed us how to eat the beef, dip it in the sauce. I wouldn&#39;t have known to combine the two. Overall it was awesome and can&#39;t wait to go back for more yuminess!"

They both come with plenty of traditional side dishes which is awesome. The Galbi-jiim is not on the menu, but there&#39;s a photo of it hanging up. It was delicious and enough for left overs. It does take a little extra cooking time to tenderize the meat so be patient, and I appreciated the server letting me know that. The only complaint I have is that sometimes it takes a while to get seated, but I assume they are just busy. They also try very hard to sell you the combination platters A, B, or C which are good for 3 people and around $67 bucks, which is fine and they are tasty, but sometimes a smaller dish suffices."

He said it was fine and even asked if I wanted a side of rice which I had to kindly refuse since I am not into rice.

The food came fairly quickly and of course, he brought over little plates of other things which are common in Korean barbeque places.

We also got haemul pacheon (seafood pancake)-- it was okay! I feel like it could&#39;ve benefited for a little bit longer in the pan to get more crisp. They had a great selection of banchan though. Great kimchi. The complementary soup was really good.

Service was also really friendly and efficient. We might give it another try when we&#39;re in the area next, but initial impression isn&#39;t one that I&#39;d drive out of my way for to eat Korean. I&#39;d rate 3.5 stars."

5 stars for the quality of the meats and the banchan.  I&#39;ve been to a few places where the meat came out all frozen and stuck to each other or thawed out with a pool of blood on the bottom. Yeah, I know.  Yuck!  But you won&#39;t find anything like that here because everything including the banchan here tastes fresh.  The pickled cucumbers and kimchee radishes were still crunchy and the pieces of stir fry fish cake were my favorite! My date and I ordered the Combo B ( galbi, bulgogi, brisket and pork belly) and even though it was meant for 3 people, we ate every piece that was left with no trouble.  I&#39;m not saying the portions are small here, but if you&#39;re coming here with more than one serious eater than you might want to order one or the sides or soups.  It is pricey here but the quality was really good so it&#39;s justified in my book.  However, just keep in mind that some of their casseroles and higher quality meats are around $30 bucks on their own so unless you&#39;re rolling in dough, the combo may be the way to go.  (Rhymes are fun!)  

The service was very attentive with several of the different wait staff walking around every few minutes to check up on your cooking skills.  I will say that our waiter asked if we would like to cook our own meats, which we said yes because we wanted to enjoy our dinner slowly and cook a little bit at a time.  But when he saw that we weren&#39;t cooking the pork belly to his liking, he asked to see the tongs and took over.  He then placed the rest of the pork on the grill at once.  When all of the pork belly was done cooking, he then placed all of the bulgogi on the grill and so on until he finished cooking for us in just a few minutes.  I know he was just helping out, but we were really looking forward to a slower meal on our own but had to eat quicker before the meat cooled down.  Even with the overly helpful waiter, I would still come back for the food."

When they first opened, I would have given them a 5 star for a suburban Korean restaurant. However, their food quality certainly has gone down. I ordered the goat stew and they didn&#39;t season the soup properly, nor did it seem like they used a broth. It tasted like the just used water. Their side dishes are still pretty good. Their menu was also designed pretty nicely. It caters to the non-Korean demographic in that there are pictures, and a better description than most places. Going back to the entrees, it seems like they are cutting too many corners to help with their food cost. I understand that since the menu is (and needs to be) so large that food cost can be high...but still....

Their yukkes (raw beef tartar) one of my favorite dishes there, just make sure you mix it really really really well, because there&#39;s chunk of black peppers sometimes and it&#39;ll kill your nose like crazy! Great food, great service, and they don&#39;t close during the day between lunch and dinner."

Sorry to be vague on the entrée choices, but I can&#39;t remember the Korean names.  We had steamed dumplings to start and they were great.  I had a soup with rice noodles and thinly slice beef.  It was good, but I was jealous of my friends sea food dish.  It was some kind of spicy plate that was huge.  I will be back."

My family and I were visiting from out of town, and we decided to introduce Korean BBQ to a couple members of our group.  We were originally heading to another place with lower reviews, but I am very happy that we found 92 Town.  

The owner&#39;s son, Sam, was personable and created an experience that makes me wish I lived in the Chicago area.  He told my family and I about different Korean cultures, shared with us his recent travels and even cooked our food.  I live in Southern California and have been to 7-10 Korean BBQ&#39;s and have yet to experience a place like 92 Town. One of my favorite stories that Sam shared was about how alcohol is served and shared within Korean cultures.  He told/showed us how and who pours the alcohol, how to cheers in Korean and the order of drinking.  

The quality of meat was also great.  At AYCE places they are typically hit or miss, but 92 Town values quality, which is why they are NOT AYCE.  The difference in taste definitely makes up for the higher price.

Not only would I recommend this place, but if I was close to it, I would put it in your rotation of monthly restaurants."

This Korean BBQ place is open late, which definitely gives them a one up on other restaurants that close at 9 or 10. The service is outstanding, everyone is so friendly and SJ - our waiter was super friendly and gave us some suggestions on what to order. You definitely don&#39;t see this kind of customer service everywhere. He told us a lot about himself, and also learned some Laotian words from us which was super cool. 

Aside from the outstanding service, the food was so delicious. He recommended the Buckwheat spicy noodle - which was DELICIOUS, and I dipped our meat in the leftover sauce because it was soooooooo good. 

I would definitely recommend this if you like Korean BBQ, good service and great food. If you come during a busy time/ weekend, I&#39;d make reservations as they get super busy... 

Thanks SJ for giving my friends and I a wonderful and enjoyable meal."

It&#39;s a good size restaurant, probably seats 150 people.  The few times we went, we were seated immediately.  The employees here are friendly and almost &#34;shy&#34;.  I didn&#39;t feel like &#34;English&#34; was the first language here.  So at times, I was a little bit confuse as to if they understood what I was saying.

We got the menu immediately to look over the food.  This restaurant has tables, and bbq table booths.  Depending on what you want, would be where you were seated.

I was having a taste for bibimbap.  This is definitely not the right place to eat that, however they do have it on their menu.  They don&#39;t use the clay pot, but serve it in a metal bowl instead.  Overall the food was still very good.  Love the sauce.

The price for their menu is reasonable.  Bibimbap was under $10.  My husband ordered a bulgogi noodle soup, for him and the baby.  It was the next thing, that was not too spicy.  I don&#39;t recall how many banchan dishes were offered, but it was 4 to 6 of them.  Good variety.  Potato salad, pickled peppers, bean sprouts, kimchee, etc.

Overall, on weekends this place gets quite busy.  The workers here focus more on the bbq table booths..  If you are not bbq-ing, they will mainly forget about you.  Food will take longer to get to you.  Our glasses were not re-filled. Myy husband finished his rice bowl pretty quick.  We did not get a re-fill.  We sat at our table for over 15 minutes, before someone finally came over to pack up our leftovers and get us a check.

We&#39;ve also had other dishes here before.  Their food and flavors are pretty good.  
Would recommend this place, and we probably will go back here."

On a recent foray out to the &#39;burbs we decided to take a leap of faith and tried 92 Town Korean BBQ.  Boy, did our little leap pay dividends.  We ordered 2 orders of the BBQ meat (Wang Kalbi and Seng Kalbi) the Bibim Neang Min (cold spicy noodles), and Chap Chae, and we systematically demolished all of it (2 adults of normal size and one 3 year old of normal size) .  The quality of the meat exceeded all my expectations and rivals the quality that we get at the top-notch places in LA (e.g., Chosun).  I think the biggest testament to 92 Town is that my 3 year old string bean daughter probably ate one whole order of the kalbi by herself.  

Beyond the superlative food, it&#39;s really awesome to have authentic Korean food without a side of the surly service (yeah, I&#39;m looking at you overworked and possibly underpaid San Soo Gab San ladies).  We are a busy family with 2 kids under 3 and we don&#39;t often like to traipse to the suburbs, but we are already plotting another reason to have to visit Schaumburg so we can hit up 92 Town Korean again."

It was a little bit below average of the Korean food I had. The bulgogi had a LOT of onions in there and the beef was in very little pieces. The tofu soup was average.

I&#39;ll probably come back to try their other stew as many people ordered that I&#39;m the restaurant."

This time I came for dinner and brought my boyfriend with me. We were given a table quickly and ordered the Gyoza as appetizer and the galbi and bulgogi for our entree. There was some confusion as the waitress asked us if they could cook our bulgogi and we asked to cook it on our table. But that miscommunication led to having both galbi (B1) and bulgogi (B13) being cooked in their kitchen. Both meats came out nice and hot and cooked to perfection so we were okay with it. I liked their soybean paste soup that came with our meals. The service was good (better than the last time I came) despite the restaurant being busy at 7pm. The food was also good and had no complaints there. The restaurant even gave me a cute little coin purse as they were celebrating their 3 year anniversary. 

Overall, I would come back here. Being that I live in Cali, this is a pretty good Korean BBQ spot in the Chicago suburbs. Higher priced but quality of meats is good. I recommend to try this place."

SJ the owner came over and recommended combo B and a semi spicy noodle dish (see pics for the name). service was quick and friendly. Even though it was busy the waiters took time to show us how to cook the meat properly and what sides went well with what meat. After the meat came the yummy noodle dish, the servers saw us struggling with chop sticks and noodles (lol)so they brought us forks. We then got soup and rice which was also pretty good.

Out of all of the food we tried, I recommend the seafood pancakes the most.

The service is convenient as there is a bell right next to the table that notifies the server if you need extra water, or banchan (Korean side dishes that come free with the meal), napkins, etc. 

My only complaint was that the music was too loud at times almost as though it was a bar. It was too difficult to hear over the music."

As soon as we ordered, the meats and banchan came out, and our excellent and friendly service began - and never stopped til we walked out the door!

We ordered the Sliced Rib Eye + Wine Pork Belly.

The pork belly was first, and the waiter advised us to cook kimchi on the edges to soak up the pork fat as the belly cooked. This resulted in one of the best-tasting bites I&#39;ve had in a long time. Kimchi itself is already something that I love, but the pork fat enhanced the flavor to a level I&#39;ve never had before! The pork belly itself was on the fattier side, but the meat was very flavorful.

The Ribeye was unseasoned, well marbled and tender and delicious!

Banchans were good too - great flavor and all very complimentary to the proteins we selected. The kimchi was some of the best I&#39;ve tasted in a while. The soybean paste was good. 

Definitely recommend coming here for KBBQ."

Wanted to go somewhere new and saw nothing but good reviews for this place. Like others have said, the meat is top notch and priced fairly. We were pretty nervous about grilling correctly, but thankfully the owner mans that for you. The owner is a young guy with impeccable customer service and a great personality. He also cares a great deal about the restaurant and his folks who help run it, so you know you&#39;re getting quality food. 

We ordered the awesome rice pancakes, dak bulgogi, and Sam gyup sal. They also provide nice fresh lettuce so you can make Bossam. Banchan is very yummy too. Especially loved their in house kimchi, pickled radish, fishcake (surprisingly), and SO enjoyed the pasta salad and all the non fermented stuff. 

Due to the richness of the meat, got a minor tummy ache and ordered a Sprite for us, owner was nice and gave it to us on the house. 

TL;DR: Owner is awesome, food is fantastic.

Ps. If you have any room there is an awesome place called coffee haus where you can get patbingsoo"

The server brought the fried rice out late and stated that the cook forgot to make it so that&#39;s what took so long.  She stated they would take off the extra charge for chicken in the rice but I was never shown a receipt.  They told me the total, I gave my card, paid, and left.  I normally tip well but with subpar service, forgotten food, and unsure if the chicken was taken off our bill as a concession, I left a measly 10% tip.

Omg. Biggest rip off ever &amp; the service is sooooooooooooooooo slowwwwwwwwwwwwww. I wanted to walk out because it was so slow &amp; we were the only people that were in there when we ordered.

No banchan until our food came out. I&#39;m used to it coming out before the actual meals. I guess it didn&#39;t matter anyway because the banchan sucked. Everything had like a pound of sugar in it or something &amp; nothing else. No flavor in anything. Ugh.

We got  as an appetizer &amp; goat  (stew). Seriously regret it. Appetizer didn&#39;t even come out first. Everything came out together, including the banchan. Idk if it&#39;s from laziness or what?

The  , (water dumpling), was $7.99 and the portion was so tiny. The actual dumpling itself was smaller than my spoon. Wtf? They weren&#39;t the big, homemade ones that water dumplings usually are. They were the ones you can get at hmart for like $5.99 for a huge bag. The picture on the menu was misleading &amp; it was basically a huge rip off.

The goat stew was soooooooo plain. It tasted like water. We could swear the meat inside was half goat, half beef. Goat has a very particular flavor.... if you&#39;ve had it before, you know it &amp; some pieces def tasted like beef. There were also bones in the stew. If it had bigger bones, you could easily take it out, but these were crushed, tiny bones. Idk what kind of goat has tiny bones... and the perilla leaves in it were previously frozen so it didn&#39;t have the fresh, strong, perilla flavor. For $32.99, I expected way more....

The fried rice at the end was also very plain. No flavor. Not even really worth mentioning.

The service was so slow. Food came out super slow..... They weren&#39;t busy, but nobody ever checked in on us, they&#39;d just walk by until we flagged them down. 

The weirdest part was how people kept coming in to eat. I was so confused. Their food sucks so why would they be coming here?????"

Surprisingly, they sat us right away at the last open table.  The server was very helpful when ordering and overall, the service was attentive.  Someone always came around to check on our items while cooking on the hot stone and also refilled our water glasses frequently, which scores huge brownie points in my book!  

It was just me, hubby and our 7yo so we ordered the beef and pork bulgogi.  Both were marinated/seasoned well.  My daughter loved the beef, while my fave was the pork as it got carmelized brown crust cooking on the hot stone.  Yum!  The banchan was a mix of pickled veggies, kimchee (of course), marinated veggies.  The meal also came with soup and small salad.  It was a lot of food and all were tasty, appealing to every taste bud, sweet, sour, salty, savory and spicy.  So good!

It was very hot and spicy which was perfect for a cold winter day. 

My Bulgogi dish was incredible, and I would definitely order it again. What I was most impressed with was my friends dish which was served in a steaming stone bowl causing all of the rice to crisp up.

SJ spent a lot of time with us sharing his mom&#39;s life story (ran the Boston marathon once and was a waitress in other people&#39;s restaurants for decades). When he found out I make kimchi at home, he brought out a few family side dishes, like utterly unique seaweed salad with a recipe from his grandmother&#39;s village and his mom&#39;s unchopped kimchi. Really a great experience."

My mom has been seated for an hour, the rest of the table got our meat but an hour later and my mom is without her mool nang-myun. That&#39;s the last straw. I&#39;m done with 92 bbq town. 

Came for dinner on a Thursday night around 715pm. Had unmarinated kalbi and cha-dol. Meat quality was great. Service was not as attentive as I would hope for in a dinner service. Had to repeatedly ask for refills on banchan, garlic, and for a new pan to cook the meat in. Given that this is on par with most typical Korean restaurants what else can you expect. The banchan was fresh and tasteful in general. Much better meat quality than all you can eat places. 

Edited review- 5/26/16. Dropped my review due to extremely poor restaurant service. I&#39;ve been here many times before but extremely disappointed with the service execution.  If a business can&#39;t deliver well they should at least make an effort to rectify the needs and take care of their customers. Expect very poor service when they&#39;re short staffed."

When we arrived it was very busy, but since it was just two of us we were seated quickly. A young man SJ was our server and he kept apologizing about how short staffed they were. Both my husband and I could understand it was not his fault. He suggested an appetizer that was a veggie rice crepe style dish... It was very good. For dinner we ordered the Garlic Pork Belly &amp; Rib Eye. They bring the pan and burner right to the table... The smell is incredible. The salad they give you is delicious, I could not tell you what all of the side dishes were. We are adventures eaters so we tried them all. I thought the Kale salad with garlic was by far the best side they had. If you are looking for something different to eat, come here."

The food was eh and it really wasn&#39;t worth the price. We got the Bulgogi and braised beef (forgot the name) and it all came out to $49, but when we got the portions we were like &#34;???&#34; Simply too little for too much.

And the reason for the 1 star rating was the combination of the food and the service especially. Honestly idk if it was just us but the service we received was just bad. As soon as we got in there we had to wait a while to be seated even though there were plenty of tables open. After we were finally seated we placed our orders and were patiently waiting for our food...and waiting...and waiting. Then we noticed that several groups of people who came after us started getting their food ahead of us. By the time the third group who came after us got all of their entrees, we were pretty tee&#39;d off. We should&#39;ve left but we traveled a pretty long time to get there so we stayed. After we finally got out food, the Bulgogi came out with a bland taste...like the corner restaurant at the back of the Jong-Boo Market served better Bulgogi. My braised beef was just alright, and honestly the last straw came when I had to flag the server down just to get a refill on my WATER.

I know these things are bound to happen, but that experience was way too unpleasant. I am not the least bit regretful to say that 92 Town Korean BBQ will not be getting business from me again."

We&#39;re from Los Angeles and there are a ton of great Korean restaurants in Ktown. However, this was very comparable and the service was also excellent.

We were pleasantly surprised that they were open so late. We were looking to grab a bite past 9PM so there weren&#39;t too many options.

I ordered the galbitang (beef stew) and my fiance got the soontofu (spicy tofu soup). The portion sizes for both were huge and they also gave us 8 banchans (side dishes). There was a lot of meat in my soup and the soontofu was perfectly spicy (very spicy, but not overpowering). Although we just had stews today, we hope to return for their BBQ in the near future.If you&#39;re looking for some delicious Korean food this place is legit."

Fairly decent size helping with seafood for a good price at 9.99 - we&#39;ve been to places where it was double for the same amount, so huge plus there.  The only complaint on his end was that the egg was overcooked - other places wait until they serve the soup to you and crack the egg open then and there so that it&#39;s still leaky.

I ordered the dolsat-bibimbap.  Great flavor, huge helping, especially since it comes with a small soy bean soup.  Egg was overcooked too, but to be fair, I waiting a little too long before mixing up the rice and vegetables - rice stuck to the bowl and burnt =(.  When you first get the bowl, you&#39;ll hear everything sizzling.  If you want to give it 15-20 seconds, feel free...but don&#39;t wait a minute or so or you&#39;ll end up with some black inedible rice like me.  So sad...but the non-burnt portions were good.

We also ordered the tteokkochi (rice cake bar) for the appetizer - awesome!  We&#39;re used to it served soaked in a slightly watered down version of that sauce, but this looked like they also panseared or grilled it so that it had a crispness to it.  A little over-priced, but quite tasty.  

And of course with any Korean place, you have your endless side dishes.  Overall, we were happy with our experience and look forward to our return."

I have eaten there only once so far, since I live only about 10 minutes away, and was craving Korean food. I was alone when I went there, and had to wait a while to give my order and receive the soup, etc. There was a problem with communication, and the waiter didn&#39;t totally understand what I wanted. I LOVE eating at Korean restaurants, since they usually give you between 5-8 small dishes of kimchi, veggies, etc. with your meal. The prices were a little expensive also, yet worth it.

We stopped by on Memorial weekend.  Ordered a handful of dishes.  My favourite is their Galbi-jjim and Bossam. Short ribs in Gabli-jjim are very tender and succulent, and the sauce is irresistible! I definitely recommend to try Galbi-jjim for at least once.

Also Bossam here distinguishes from other places. Usually the bossam I know comes in one big plate with all side dishes together but this place has its own unique style. The pork belly comes in a pot and side dishes come separately so that the meat keeps itself warm while you eat. The pork belly is very tender and juicy with this good herb flavor. The lady working there was nice and friendly and she was very kind to bring more banchan (korean side dishes) when we asked.

I would say 5 stars for the taste and service (a few times, when not busy, the lady I assume was the owner would actually cook our dishes for us) but the price is a little bit high.  Nevermind, 5 stars, it&#39;s worth it!"

For those with an appetite, it&#39;s a clear decision but there is still value in non-AYCE places like 92 Town Korean BBQ. This was the old Solliphana but with new management and a different feel. Surprisingly, you could really taste the difference. 

I have always been a fan of AYCE Korean BBQ because for a few dollars more, you get so much more in return. I didn&#39;t think it was worth going to get kalbi unless it was AYCE. My experience at 92 Town proved me wrong. Even though I wasn&#39;t able to binge, I really enjoyed the quality in the meat and panchan (side dishes). The kalbi was well marbled and marinated even though the portion size was less than what I&#39;m used to. Shockingly, the most memorable part of the meal were all of the panchan. They all tasted better than anything I&#39;ve had at a kalbi buffet. 

If you didn&#39;t know, the side dishes are unlimited so you can get refills for no extra cost. I got three refills on my favorites which were the odeng (fish cake), moo (pickled radish), and the gennip (Korean herb). 

The service was typical of a Korean restaurant where you get your food and that&#39;ll be the last time you&#39;ll see your server until the bill. The trick is to call out to them if you need refills on drinks, rice, or panchan. It&#39;s cultural and not offensive at all - &#34;when in Rome&#34;, right? Overall, I left feeling full and content - a definite improvement from Solliphana."

Friendly service, but you may have to drink the sauce out of your tasty banchan bowls while waiting for that next cup of better than average tea. I&#39;ve  learned that the sauce in the banchan bowls is very good, and refreshing. I note that Candice has observed the same no teapots for roundeyes, what&#39;s up with that? Could be a solo diner thing.

Everything&#39;s good, just work your way through the lunch specials, excellent tofu seafood or vegetable soups.

Lots of seating options, tables, nooks, crannies, semi private rooms, no window views or booths. A little hard to find buried in the never ending strip malls on Golf in Schaumburg across from the den of thieves car dealer row. Go here, don&#39;t go there."

Instead of writing this review, I should have been writing a Fogo de Chao review, because I made reservations for my Dad&#39;s birthday dinner, but when we got there, the freaking power was out! So, we turned around and went here instead.

This place used to be Soliphana, which was another Korean BBQ place, but that place sucked. Now it&#39;s 92 Town. Now, I kept trying to figure out what the significance of &#34;92&#34; was. And then after sounding out a few times, I figured it out. I kept thinking &#34;Goosheep Ee&#34; which is Korean for &#34;Ninety-Two,&#34; and couldn&#39;t come up with a real meaning, but then when I said &#34;Goo Ee&#34; which is &#34;Nine, Two,&#34; I realized it sounded like the Korean word for, basically, BBQ. Clever!

GALBI (Marinated Short Rib)
Cooked on the table gas grill. Meat was tender and the flame gave it a nice smoky flavor. The sweet and soy-saucy marinade really shined, and it was thanks to the sugars that burned that the smokiness really came out. Usually the meat is a little tough, but I think they did a very good job tenderizing or picking out good cuts of short rib. Not better than New Seoul in Algonguin, but right on its coattails -- which is really impressive because New Seoul uses wood coals, and this is just gas.

CHADOLBAEGI (Thinly Sliced Ribeye)
They, like most Korean places, bring out a stone pan with some oil on it, and put it on top of a portable butane burner, and bring that to your table. They heat it for a while, and then start putting the pieces of chadolbaegi on. It&#39;s really thinly sliced, so they don&#39;t have to cook for long. Our waitress cooked this for us, but it was very empty (probably due to the weather) so she cooked it for us. She dumped it on each of our plates as soon as they were ready. They were pretty tender and perfect in thickness, which made chewing easy. They&#39;re meant to be dipped in the sesame oil + salt + pepper mix, so the meat itself isn&#39;t seasoned, but there should be a beefy flavor to it, though masked in sesame oil. It&#39;s not hard to do chadolbaegi, but I&#39;d take Cho Sun Ok over this any day.

BANCHAN (Side Dishes)
About 8 came out. Now, even though the meats got pretty high marks, I really have to say, the entire meal suffered greatly because of the banchan. The number was good, but it was the quality. The kimchi was not very flavorful, but it was sour, and not the &#34;fermented beautifully&#34; kind of sour either. The kkakdoogie was ok, but I think it needed a little sweetness. It too was a bit sour. They had marinated eggplant which was ok, some leafy greens, cucumbers in, basically, vinegar (which was also missing some sweetness), and odeng. The poor kimchi and kkakdoogie take the largest part of the blame for this meal though. None of their banchan was really good. 

DWENJANG CHIGAE (Fermented Soy Soup)
This came with our BBQ meal. It was pretty good. It can&#39;t hang with Morangak in LA, but it is one of the best dwenjang chigaes I&#39;ve had in Chicago. Served in boiling hot stone bowl, it&#39;s very pungent, and seasoned well. There is no thought of being watered down. The veggies are soft, but not mushy. It was very well executed and tasted great!

DAEGU TANG (Cod Soup)
The broth is very refreshing. Not fishy at all. You could almost pick out individual ingredients in the broth. It&#39;s so simple, yet the flavors are harmonious. You taste garlic, black pepper, and Korean radish (moo) in the soup, seasoned perfectly and it warms your core instantly, yet gently. Seasoning was just spot on too. While tasting the broth you know it&#39;s inspired by the sea, but it never tastes like the sea or fishy.

Honestly, I only had the broth. I just had a sample of what my dad got, so I can&#39;t really tell you about how the cod was -- but he said it was good.

12 TOWN
One, Two sounds like &#34;eerie.&#34; It&#39;s eerie because the 3 star rating makes it seem like a halfway decent place, but in actuality, I didn&#39;t enjoy the meal. The individual parts were greater than the whole. Banchan is very important in Korean meals. 92 Town had a decent #, but quality was kinda low. Kimchi is the glue that binds a Korean meal. If I had to rate this whole dinner, I&#39;d give it a 3/10. 

I definitely will not be back for BBQ, although I had their Gamja Tang before and it wasn&#39;t bad, so maybe for a quick Korean lunch. BBQ - go to New Seoul in Algonquin!"

Generally a big advocate of Korean restaurants for their value vs. price, but here at 92 Town, I actually felt ripped off.  Ordered soon du bu (tofu stew) and ttokbokki (spicy rice cakes).  Both items were prepared lacking proper ingredients. The rice cakes were combined with ones that should have been trashed (rice cakes are like 25 cents). If quality is bad, they should&#39;ve just thrown them away.  Maybe their beef items are better?  The tofu stew (soon du bu) weren&#39;t hot enough so the egg they put on top was barely warm and raw.  I just lifted it to the side in a small plate.  Also, never got one visit asking for water or anything else."

Most places will have good food but poor service or good service and sub par food. Step in 92 Town. It&#39;s been a very enjoyable experience every time I&#39;ve dined in. The meat they use is great quality, and their banchan is all quite tasty. 92 Town definitely is one of the better makers of Kimchi for restaurants. Their prices are a little on the steeper side, but the quality and portions justify the price IMO. To top it all off, they have great service. The staff is very attentive, and they engage with customers. Overall great experience and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend 92 Town to someone foreign to Korean cuisine or someone who has grown up on Korean food."

The environment felt relaxing and cozy, and I was immediately seated and given some warm tea, which was really nice since it&#39;s so cold outside these days. The menu had a good amount to choose from (which made me very happy)so I sat there for awhile thinking what I should get, but I settled for familiar food first since it was my first time there. I ordered beef bulgogi and tteokbokki. It came out pretty fast along with a lot of banchan! I never had so much banchan. The banchan was really good and so was the tteokbokki. It&#39;s some of the best I&#39;ve had in awhile. The beef was really good, not my favorite part of the meal though. However I really enjoyed myself and the service. I would definitely come back again and try more food. I feel like this place has a lot more to choose from than others I&#39;ve been too.

Restaurant is small looks like they cater to lunch crowd not ideal for dinner just quick fast food style tacos.

I was most impressed by the verity of the salsa they offered, there is an authentic house made cilantro salsa you can purchase by bottle.   I got one and used it on grilled fish, it was amazing!!!  

I didn&#39;t give 5 star as I was bit dissatisfied with service, slow and not attentive.  I cleaned my own table before meal, cashier forgot to add chip &amp; salsa on my order.   My Cilantro salsa bottle was missed until I reminded him on my way out...."

I&#39;d give the various tacos/burritos we&#39;ve tried 1-3 stars so I&#39;ll setlle on an overall 2-star rating.  The staff working when we come in have always been nice and our order is generally ready in 10 minutes or so.  They have a decent amount of seating if you don&#39;t want to do take-out.

The carnitas meat was our favorite for the flavor and tenderness.  The chicken &amp; pastor is good as well.  Their barbacoa was the least flavorful I&#39;ve ever had - not sure if it was an off day for that recipe but we only ordered it once because of this.  The cesina (thin salted steak) was a bit tough.  I think if you order the Burrito Belly Bowl (no tortilla) you get more than if you just ordered a burrito served in a tortilla.  The Burrito Belly Bowl is plenty big and it comes with a big bag the size of a brown-bag lunch sack full of their house made tortilla chips.

It certainly isn&#39;t the best Mexican take-out you can get in the area but based on their proximity we don&#39;t mind having them on occasion now that we know which meats we prefer there."

This is a former middle eastern spot, Pita Puff, I liked that place but worried about the location. Now they age gone and Cilantro is here, Cilantro is great...I hope they don&#39;t meet the same fate. This location is annoying to get into and the parking lot is aggravating, but the food was excellent. 
I&#39;m not much of a meat eater, especially somewhere new. With Mexican, it&#39;s easy to stick with a vegetarian order, so I did. I got a veggie taco and veggie tostada. Interestingly, I do not like cilantro, and despite their moniker, they omitted it from my order happily leaving beans, rice, avocado, tomato, onions and lettuce as the toppings (I nixed the sour cream too).  The taco was good, I only used one shell and it held together. The tostado was fenomenal, that&#39;s Spanish for awesome! I loved the shell; not at all greasy and it had been lightly salted. The crunch of the shell with the fresh veggies were a great combo. 
I don&#39;t find myself in that direction too often, but next time I am, I&#39;m definitely stopping in."

We are both huge fans of Mexican food and this place is great - not to mention, they are open late. My husband is a fan of their Chicken burrito, I tried their taco dinner with 2 steak tacos and 1 barbacoa taco. We also got their nachos &amp; guacamole.

The chicken burrito is great, it is my husband&#39;s go-to whenever he eats at Cilantro, the chicken is marinated well and perfectly shredded (no awkward chunks of meat). The nachos and guacamole were okay, the guacamole could have used a bit more lime and the nachos were a little on the greasier side (which could be a good thing because they fry them there). The taco dinner was great! I was not disappointed, the portions are great and tacos are the same size as you would get at any other taqueria. The steak was delicious, the barbacoa was a good consistency (no fatty pieces, shredded well) but the flavor was a bit bland - I probably won&#39;t order the barbacoa again in the future. 

All in all, we definitely recommend it to be tried at least once, it is not a chain restaurant - it is family owned &amp; all locations are in IL - it&#39;s definitely a place we will go to again."

Also when my sister and I couldn&#39;t figure out where everyone got their salsas. There should be some kind of sign or maybe someone should&#39;ve told us when they were handing us our food.  

I order the Tripas taco with cilantro and onion and it was fire. They cooked it perfectly because I do not like mine overly crispy. 
Taco number 2 wasn&#39;t anything to write home about but it was still good. (Chorizo with cilantro and onion) 
My last taco was the barbacoa taco and it was delish. It was soft and it pulled apart so easily. 
The last thing I ate was the pork tamale. I thought it was bland and rather dry, but I still ate it because the avocado salsa is amazing.
I think I destroyed my tacos in less than a minute because of the avocado salsa. It definitely put the icing on the cake for me.

In all honesty, the reason I&#39;ve lived in Elk Grove Village and 6 minutes away from this establishment and had never visited was because of the front of the restaurant. It&#39;s not particularly appealing...but don&#39;t let that be the reason YOU don&#39;t try this restaurant out! 

This restaurant is truly authentic Mexican food and I appreciate that. The hostess is always accommodating, the waiters are always friendly and the food is always on point. 
They always have drink and meal specials and both are great options for trying something new or saving a little bit of dough. 

Once seated you&#39;ll always receive on-the-house chips and salsa - spicy and mild. The menu is pretty large and mostly in Spanish so definitely ask if there are meals you may not be familiar with! I order cheese quesadillas (how adventurous of me, I know) which come with fresh guacamole and sour cream. They&#39;re simple but super yummy. From the other bites of meals I&#39;ve tried, everything was hot and delicious as well. One thing I MUST mention is their cream of cilantro soup. Oh my God. It&#39;s truly the one thing that stands out at this restaurant aside from the two men that play guitars a table at a time. My boyfriend had introduced me to it when it was a Friday special and I must order it every time. Fortunately, I found out it&#39;s not just a Friday special anymore! You will seriously not regret it. I&#39;m not sure what the special occasion was but one Friday night my boyfriend and I had gotten free Kahluá (?) dessert shots with whipped cream on the top when we had received our check at the end of our meal. They were so good the waitress brought us another one! Sadly, we had never received those again and never asked for them again but that was a nice surprise. 

Aside from the food, I think the ambience inside is what really allows for customers to have a &#34;true&#34; Mexican experience. It&#39;s colorful, fun, lit up, over decorated and truly resembles what a home or a restaurant south of the border may look like. 

Overall, Tapalpa is a must whether or not you live nearby like myself. The space is authentic and the food doesn&#39;t taste like just American-Mexican chain establishment. You will not be disappointed!"

I wanted a chicken fajita, but wasn&#39;t planning on spending $19. It seemed everything on the menu was over $15.

The service was great, but I don&#39;t think I will be back due to the high prices and small portions."

Went in for lunch with a small group of coworkers. We requested split checks but they said they are too busy and are unable to do so. (It&#39;s okay, I understand if you want to provide good service and are unable to meet all the needs due to the situation.) The restaurant did not look too busy, but maybe they had a lot of delivery orders. 

We then ordered our food right away. First they brought out the cilantro soup. It was revolting. I am not a picky eater by any standards, but this was something else. Gross pale green color combined with a flavor that I cannot even describe. Avoid at all costs. 

I ordered street tacos with steak. After waiting for over THIRTY minutes, we still did not have our food. 10 minutes later we decided we need to leave to get back to work on time, we asked for our food to go. They seemed confused and it took them another 10 minutes to get our food. Yes, 50 minutes total. Our order consisted of simple lunch meals like tacos and burritos. 

The food wasn&#39;t great either. I have had much better tacos that did NOT take 50 minutes to make. 

I and all of my coworkers will now avoid this place at all costs. 

Worst part is that they did not communicate that they were so behind. If they were proactive and let us know how long it might take to get our food, I would definitely reconsider how my overall experience went."

I came here a long time ago when I first moved here and I was underwhelmed. Now years later, I still am not a fan.

First of all, they are really pricey for what they serve. Their margaritas are small, weak, overpriced, and taste salty (even though I did not get salt on the rim). The plates are plastic, like something I would have had in college. They don&#39;t have regular queso (what?!). The steak tacos were good (small, but good), but the pork were too spicy and covered in a sauce concoction that I was not a fan of. Really the only things they have going for them are their outdoor area and the service. Beyond that I just don&#39;t get it. I gave them another try...but I think it will be my last."

After digging through Yelp for something we hadn&#39;t had in a while, I came across Tapalpa and was reminded of the good ol&#39; days of living in EG and frequenting this place at least twice a month, so we headed over.  I remember it to be very small and tight, so we decided to go early and beat the rush. 

When we got there around 5:30 on a Monday night, we were the only ones there.  Got seated, received the chips (yum) and salsa (eh) and the menus.  After learning that they only make spinach enchiladas on Fridays and Saturdays, which was odd, the wife decided on the Veggie fajita burrito.  I got the chicken enchiladas, and mom got the veggie tostadas.  There was definitely a LOT of food, which was deemed more than fair for the price.  

Enchiladas were tasty, as were the beans and rice that came with the dinner.  Mom and wife shared the tostadas and didn&#39;t have room for the burrito, which was fine by me because hey, that&#39;s tomorrow&#39;s lunch!

Service was super friendly, but minus one star for the slowness.  Had to ask 3 times for a sofa refill, and the grilled jalapenos came out when we were ready for the check.  No worries though, with our full bellies, we still left very happy."

With every meal you receive complimentary chips and salsa.  They have lunch specials as well as daily specials.  I always get the burrito suizo because it is pretty big.

All smothered in a wonderful salsa. OH did I say it was as big as my thigh. All our dishes came with a delicious home made creamy mushroom soup with huge chunks of mushrooms. Of course we had to get a pitcher of Margarita which was good and was served as a full pitch and half full glasses. What a nice presentation. The server was perfectly attentive. I love when a serve knows when you want something but leaves you alone otherwise.

One of my coworkers ordered the Pollo Relleno. HUH? Chicken breast wrapped around a chipotle pepper stuffed with cheese, battered, smothered with wine butter sauce and baked. WTF! He said it was as good as it sounds. I believe him.

I will certainly be back."

But we still say there unattended and hungry.  My sister said if one more waiter comes in and out without acknowledging us we will leave.  Mind you at this point, our chips are almost gone so we have definitely been there more than 5 minutes.  Sure enough I see my sister reach for her bag and say let&#39;s go.

I am celebrating my thirteen anniversary at work next week and I have been visiting Tapalpa since I started at this job. I don&#39;t think they were a brand new restaurant at that time, so I&#39;m thinking that they got to be doing something right to have such a long standing history with their doors open for business. 

Here are the things that I love!  It&#39;s a welcoming place. The owner and staff are so nice. The mole is dark and tasty - muy bien!  They are plenty of seating - both inside and outside. I used to actually take a lunch break and dine in. During the warmer months, I recall dining outside sometimes. It&#39;s a nice break in the day. After dinner, I&#39;ve always received a sweet dessert shot. I&#39;m not much of a drinker, but I sure enjoy that treat!  Plus, they have a lunchtime special now that is $6.95. Sounds like the perfect carryout lunch to me!

A few of my not so favorite things?  Their chips are boring. The salsa works, but the chips aren&#39;t worth the calories. I don&#39;t love the tomato chunks mixed in with the chicken. I&#39;m sure they do it to add flavor, but I don&#39;t like chunky tomatoes in anything. This is a personal preference. 

They&#39;re not a fancy spot, but the food is consistent.  And the people are great!  I&#39;m grateful that Tapalpa has lasted as long as I have in the area. Here&#39;s to many more years, my friends!"

Glad we saw this place. The decor both inside and out, scream authentic Mexican. We were sat immediately. Our waitress was very nice. She seemed a little frazzled most of the time though. Maybe she was new. We got a pitcher of margaritas for the table. They were delicious and strong. The menu has a lot on it which makes for a tough choice, but I opted for something different. I tried the pollito poblano. It&#39;s cheese inside a pepper, wrapped in a chicken... I know. Weird. But it was awesome. The other people had a burrito and the enchiladas.

The first round of chips were not too fresh but the salsa was great with the right kick of spice.  The second round of chips were definitely fresh...but I still gotta judge and knock off one star...for that and the fact the waitress forgot we asked for straws for our water..oh she remembered. .almost half way thru our dinner:-(
But here&#39;s the reason why we will be back....the guava margarita was strong , yummy and tasted fresh.. definitely not that pre made bottled crap. And margaritas for $2.25 on Mondays? Yes I said that. This one was $5 but regular lime margaritas were $2.25.
The fiance had steak chimichanga and it was ginormous. He said the steak was tender and full of flavor. 
I had the chicken flautas,which is my go to..and it was bomb. The crispy tortilla shell was not too greasy but crisp and had a good crunch..and the chicken was so tender..definitely not over cooked. The spices definitely tasty. Rice and beans were also BOMB.
So please do yourself a favor and go here. The complimentary after dinner Bailey&#39;s shot with whip cream didn&#39;t hurt, either."

The waiter was very attentive, probably a little over attentive, in my opinion. I wanted a regular margarita but he mistook my order and I ended up getting the $1.50 special margarita. It wasn&#39;t very good but I could certainly taste the tequila. I suppose if you are looking for a bargain for some drinks, this would be a good option.

The chips and salsa were okay, pretty standard for any Mexican restaurant. For dinner, I got the quesadilla with chicken. It was plated in a really interesting way, almost like a roll rather than flat. It was pretty tasty but the sour cream and guacamole servings were a bit small. I thought the price of the entrée was reasonable. However, as others have said, some other entrees and sides are a little bit ridiculous. For instance, 9$ for a small guacamole? I think the regular size was $15, that&#39;s about the same price you&#39;d pay for an appetizer at a swanky restaurant. 

They brought a mini-shot of Kahlua, I think, for dessert with the check. It was kind of nice, I&#39;ve never had a restaurant serve something like that. It was interesting but I won&#39;t complain about it."

Combinacion Tapalpa (skirt steak &amp; cheese stuffed poblano pepper dinner), the steak was tender and seasoned perfectly, the other favorite was the Mini Tamales Verde. I LOVE tamales and have never tasted ones this fresh and delicious. The pieces melted in my mouth. Mmmm I could go back for some again. 

The margaritas were great and they topped the night off with Carmel schnapps &amp; Kailua shots which were amazing. 

Overall an awesome night and a new place we will visit again in the near future."

If the spinach enchiladas are on the specials menu, get them!  Recently, one of my friends had the Tapalpa roll, which she liked but said it could have been hotter.  Food is generally tasty and well prepared.  Prices are reasonable.  The tables are a little close together, so if it&#39;s crowded, you feel it.

First, a little background - I work in Woodfield area, wife came to take me to lunch day after Christmas...tried to take her to a great little Mexican place I went to with co-workers, all of whom were off that day (found out later it was called Los Compadres) - got lost in Elk Grove (don&#39;t go that way often, all the streets there look alike - grey and dingy) and somehow stumbled into Tapalpa. 

Resurant is typical cheap mexican place in a strip mall - slightly tacky, plastic tablecloths, etc. etc. etc....no problem, that&#39;s what we were looking for. The prices however, were not that of a cheap little mexican place. Now - I like a good meal and am willing to pay for it...but this place was WAY out of line with the other tacky mexican places in strip malls in the area....lunch of an appitizer, a burrito, a quesedella and 2 diet cokes was $43.44....$52 bucks w/tip. Place I was thinking of (and about 3 others in area off the top of my head) would have been less than $40, tip included. Was it worth it? Comparatively speaking, no. But let&#39;s discuss the food:

Chips and Salsa - included as in most places in the area - not bad, but did not stand out.
Queso Fundito - again, uneventful - but I did like they served it in a taco salad shell - i think the shell soaked in a lot of the grease, which is nice.
Steak Burrito - Steak was tender, big pieces, and of good quality. But bland, as were the rest of the ingredients
Quesadellia  (SP)- wife ordered this, when asked how it was she said &#34;fine&#34;....which could mean a variety of things....none of which would be in the 4-5 star range.

In closing - not BAD, but nothing to write home about...and NOT worth the money."

Very nice atmosphere, great service and wonderful staff. The owner came over after he heard it was our first time being there and was very pleasant, he welcomed us and chatted with us a bit.

I usually go there to get my taco salad shells, which I find hilarious, because EVERY TIME they say, &#34;No meat?!? Just the Shell?!?! haha! yes please! For only $1 per delicious shell (or they charge my hubby $2 per shell which I find too funny), we are set!

We came here the other evening and sat in their outdoor patio, which was very nice.  Our waiter was cool and attentive and so were the bus boys!  I ordred my usual meal at a Mexican restuarant, cheese enchilladas...now Im very picky about my enchilladas, but they were delicious!  My hubby ordred the Pica Pica special, which seemed very similar to fajitas, and he really enjoyed it!

The chips and salsa were delish...we ate almost two baskets of the chips!  They have weekly specials on drinks and food! If you are the EGV area, check them out!"

I&#39;ve enjoyed Tapalpa&#39;s for many years now (10+), and their consistency in good quality food is something you can count on.  Others can disagree, but I like &amp; enjoy their chips &amp; salsa...if you&#39;ve ever been to Mexico you will find that most chips tend to be on the bland side.

Warning!  If you do go during the first part of February or late January (like we did earlier this year) you may feel like you are entering the heavily decorated den of Cupid himself...so it may feel a bit strange if there are non-romantic parties sitting down for a meal!

Not by a long shot.  I know they&#39;ve been here a while, but from what I saw people seem to like the booze more than the food.  I think they have a following, and good for them, it&#39;s just not for us.

We checked it out at the insistence of my sister, who had a great time here with her family recently.  But, I should have known, my sister doesn&#39;t know Mexican food.  And her kids, well, they raved about it - but the only other MX food they&#39;ve ever had is Taco Bell.

I have a more discriminating and experienced palette for this food, and I was not impressed.  The food is average to average plus, not bad but not remarkable, as it should be for the prices they charge.

Chips and salsa are weak, chips taste commercially made and the salsa reminds me of the jarred style.  I don&#39;t think it is jarred, but it reminds me of the &#34;Pace&#34; style.  Mild, which we like, but has that jarred consistency/flavor.  Salty, tomatoey flavor overwhelms the rest of the ingredients.

I got the carnitas, which I will say were NOT greasy.  However, they were borderline dry.  It was $15 and they gave me about 4 oz. of meat, with a bunch of beans and some other sides/garnish.  Not at all impressed.  My wife&#39;s tacos were equally underwhelming - and pricey.  $13 for a taco dinner.

Lastly, service.  The waiter was decent, except everything moved at SLOW MOTION.  Half an hour to get our food after ordering.  Both the waiter and owner (presumably) came by to check on us as we sat there, waiter gave us some lame excuse about too many carry-out orders.  Hey, that&#39;s YOUR problem - don&#39;t leave your dining room customers waiting.  The owner asked us how everything was, when we told her we&#39;d been waiting way too long she said she&#39;d check on our food - but instead went to the counter and started chatting on the phone and doing other things.  She never followed up.

The waiter finally came to tell us he would bring the check, he then proceeded to take food and drink orders from FOUR TABLES before he made his way to the back.  Next time we saw him he had a huge tray of drinks in his hand.  Maybe it finally registered with him that we were perturbed, so he set the tray down and brought our check.  Total wait for the check, about twenty minutes.

If you want MUCH better food and half the price, but no liquor or atmosphere to speak of, try Los Compadres on Algonquin.  If you want MUCH better food slightly cheaper with great service in a nice setting and liquor service, try Hacienda de Roselle.  I&#39;ve had Mexican food all over, they are two of the better places around."

It is quite fitting considering that every time I meet up with the NW Suburban Dinner crew I have a boat load of fun. And it&#39;s also fitting considering I was served a boat load of the aforementioned Queso Fundido with chorizo. Mami like.

From start to finish I was impressed with the service and the quality and quantity of the food. Our waitress was super sweet, sprinkling bits of Spanish in while we ordered. A &#34;gracias&#34; here, &#34;What would you like, Senor?&#34; there. She smiled politely as we butchered the names on the menu.

As it should be, they serve you chips and salsa before the meal. Some places like to get stingy and give you a small bowl of chips. Not here. They brought out pile after pile of chips. Good chips. Crunchy and not greasy. They went well with the fresh salsa and hot sauce.

It was a Tuesday, so I started out with their drink special: $1.50 margarita. Not a fan. Only thing I didn&#39;t like. Too salty. Blech. Switched over to horchata and was much happier. I don&#39;t even know that I needed that margarita to begin with because they bring you out cute little Kahlua shots at the end of the meal - at least for our group. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s typical.

My friend Mike and I decided to maximize our Mexican by both ordering an entree and splitting it. He got the red snapper with white wine, butter and garlic. It was topped with diced tomato, some cilantro, onion and olives. It was blow your mind good. There is nothing worse than having badly cooked fish and I was worried it might come out dry. It was moist and flavorful. I also dislike olives, but I overlooked it and enjoyed everything that it came with. My choice was one of their Tapalpa specialties, a broiled skirt steak covered in poblano sauce and cheese. All entrees were served with a side of refried beans, rice and a small bowl of vegetable soup. The soup would be perfect if you&#39;re sick. Heck, it&#39;s perfect if you&#39;re not sick!"

It means &#34;rice with chicken.&#34; To me, growing up eating a lot of Puerto Rican food, arroz con pollo means a specific dish: rice with bone-in chicken parts cooked in it, fragrant with adobo and saffron, small bits of veggies, possibly some ham and olives or capers.

I&#39;ve discovered, though, that if you order this at a Mexican restaurant you are likely to get something that contains both chicken and rice, but may not otherwise resemble the dish described above. At our regular haunt in Bloomingdale, the chicken is boneless and the veggies are large chunks, but it&#39;s similar.

At Tapalpa, you will receive something else entirely -- my arroz con pollo was large-diced chunks of chicken breast with tomato, onion and peppers, served over rice and slathered with cheese.

Which is not to say it isn&#39;t delicious. It is. And after eating too many chips and my delightful little cup of vegetable soup, I have about 2/3 of my giant plate of arroz con pollo to eat for lunch today.

I came here with my NW Suburban friends for dinner on a weeknight. Tapalpa is hard to miss though it is close to a large outdoor shopping area along Arlington Heights Road. 

We got a long booth out of the way of most of the commotion in the restaurant. Certainly our service was nothing to complain about. I ordered a horchata as my drink. It was a bit strong on the cinnamon, but not bad at all, though I prefer more of a vanilla flavor personally. I got the bandarilla special, which was a huge platter with two fried tortillas with shredded chicken rolled up inside, rice, beans and a scoop of both guacamole and sour cream on top. Looking at the serving size, it&#39;s easily two or maybe 3 meals, depending on how much you like to pig out. 

As we waited for our food, the chips and salsa kept coming. I particularly liked their hotter variety of salsa, which though it packed a punch was very flavorful.

While I didn&#39;t run my usual &#34;burrito benchmark&#34; test on them, I was very pleased with my choice of dinner. I got flan as my dessert to complete what was a fantastic meal at a nice Mexican place."

I&#39;ve kept the same basic criteria in the places I&#39;ve visited thus far:
1) Margarita tastiness (regular, on the rocks, with salt - I&#39;m keepin&#39; it real here)
2) Chips and salsa crunch and tastiness (I like a little heat but not anything obscene)
3) Chicken burrito awesomeness

They did really, REALLY well on 1 &amp; 2. 
The burrito was substantial in size and the chicken was moist but it seemed to miss the mark with the rice and had 0 heat but still tasty.

Tapalpa had an added bonus that blew my mind. A 2-man Mariachi band. I couldn&#39;t help but do the white man overbite and dance before, during and after my meal.

Check this place out. The chips are crunchy. The salsa was addicting. And the margarita (get the Cabo Wabo kind!) were so tasty and smooth. The best to date. But try something other than a burrito and you&#39;re bound to have a great experience."

I loved the chips and salsa, but the waiter was not really around to bring any refills. I ordered the Chimichanga Suiza with shredded beef and I really enjoyed it. The portions were huge! The meal came with a soup as well! 

I ordered a half pitcher of margaritas and was really disappointed. It tasted like a flavorless Icee. I really wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find out they forgot the tequila. 

I also really hated how the bathroom is a one person stall for such a large restaurant and bar.  I hate having to wait in line for the bathroom during dinner!

The soup they bring with the meal is always nice--I particularly enjoyed the cream of cilantro.

The margaritas are fantastic, but then it is pretty hard to mess up a margarita, I&#39;d think.

It is a bit pricey for standard Mexican fare, but as somewhere to go on occasion, I&#39;m willing to pay a bit more.

Came with my girlfriends one rainy December night, and we had the mariachis that wouldn&#39;t go away--one was flirting with my Spanish speaking girlfriend.  At first it was charming, but then when our food came and they still stood there and played, it veered towards awkward, and when they started another song when that song was finished, it became downright annoying.  

Also, if it&#39;s crowded, be prepared to wait awhile--and don&#39;t expect to be surrounded by shiny happy people.

Abraham, Judy and their entire staff are outstanding!  I recently had them cater an event I was having at work.  I use a lot of caterers but Tapalpa impressed me with all their special details.  You never have to question the incredible quality of their food but it was the little things, like bringing decorations, special table coverings, special festive dishes, brightly colored cups, etc. They had one person show up early to set up and the food came piping hot right on time for lunch service.  I have never received so many compliments from my coworkers about how nice the luncheon was and how great the food was.  I highly recommend using them for catering and with out a doubt at least visit them for lunch or dinner.  You won&#39;t be disappointed!!"

We choose to sit outside wasn&#39;t bad but way too windy. The waiter whose been there forever was awful. He was soo slow we ordered a few margaritas we had the lame chips and salsa which I could make better at home.  He never came back to take our order. It was not busy mind you he is just a horrible server. After about 30 minutes we paid and left and went to Good tequila instead and had a great meal and way better drinks.

Server never came back until we were finished and my enchiladas were Luke warm. This is the second time hot food was not hot. That&#39;s a basic. Taste was good. Prices are ok. May try one more time.

The waiter was nice but oh so forgetful.. the typcial chips and salsa were boring and without flavor and the food which were simple tacos were not appetizing at all. I have never drank so much soda to wash down the food ever. I see the ratings on here and I don&#39;t get it... I see the mention of liquor specials which I did see plastered all around but if you must have liquor to enjoy the food its not the place for me."

I went with a total of 6 people, and the service was still pretty decent.  The inside was pretty typical of a Mexican joint... Lots of decorations, color, and an all around fiesta-like atmosphere.

The girls had some sangria which they liked.  I had the house dish, which I don&#39;t remember the name.  But it had Tapalpa in it.  It was pretty good, but very filling.  The portions are huge.  The burritos are your typical football shaped variety.  

Our waiter was a wisecracker.  One guy ordered a veggie burrito and he brought back a burrito &#34;with extra meat.&#34;  When someone else ordered the same item (enchiladas) as another person, he said, sorry we are out, how about enchiladas instead?  It was more weird than funny.  

Anyway, it&#39;s still a good place to eat, and a nice gem in suburbia."

The second time we ordered enchiladas and were disappointed to get a plate of obviously microwaved (or badly re-heated) enchiladas.

Was in the mood for a burrito and needless to say, was not impressed at all. Not AUTHENTIC! Maybe authentic TEX-MEX, but not authentic. I ordered my burrito in SPANISH so I assumed that they would bring me a dry burrito, instead I got something I do not like, which is the SUIZO style burrito. I wasn&#39;t even asked if I preferred it dry or estilo suizo. No green sala. Guac was slightly browning. And the horchata, was horrible. Way too sweet and watered down, so it tasted more like cinnamon, vanilla and SUGAR.  

If you&#39;re American and grew up eating TexMex, you will probably like this place. I didn&#39;t so I&#39;m not a fan. I&#39;m not sure about the restaurant atmosphere, because I did carry-out, but it looks like a quaint little place to eat. I&#39;ll stick to Buenos Dias. That place is 10x better and there horchata and burrito are not hit or miss."

We have been to Tapalpa a few times for dinner and really liked it!
When it was time for my son&#39;s First Communion party and I was looking for caterers, I decided to forgo the usual chicken and pasta and look for something different.

I called Tapalpa and was fortunate to speak directly to Abraham, the owner.  He couldn&#39;t have been more helpful or accomodating.  I ordered the&#34; hot taco bar&#34; for 50!  No problem.  When I told him how much my husband enjoyed their chorizo, he threw in a small bowl at no charge for him.

He arrived exactly on time with his own tablecloth, wrapped settings and plates, colorful bowls filled with the freshest salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, and queso.  Four huge piping hot chaffing dishes of beans, delicious rice, ground beef, and chicken for filling.  Plus a huge basket of tortilla chips, baskets of warm soft tortillas and another basket of hard shell tortillas.

He asked nothing of me and was in and out in 20 minutes and was not intrusive to the party in the least!  He is coming back to pick up his materials. 

All of this for an amazing price.  
Probably the best catering we have ever had.  Our guests took home &#34;to go&#34; containers and LOVED the food.

Thank you Tapalpa and Abraham for a VERY successful party for my son."

The $1.50 margarita special is a nice way to get some alcohol without being overbearing on my wallet as well.

The food was out of this world too! I really didn&#39;t expect too much b/c Mexican food has always been Mexican food, where ever you go. This place is totally different. Everything was fresh, hot and super tasty. 

One aspect of the restaurant that really stood out to me was not the service and not the food, but the fact that they decorated the booth walls with pictures from their years of business. There are hundreds of pictures of customers there.

I usually get enchiladas with verde sauce (green) and ground beef filling. The dinner plate comes with generous sides of Spanish rice and refried beans. Their chips are average and the salsa has some good heat to it. Guacamole is pretty good too.

I&#39;ve always been stuffed after my entree and have only ordered dessert once. I was so full after dessert that I vowed not to ever eat that much food again.

But the past few times at the conclusion of my meal, my server came over with a complimentary mini shot of Bailey&#39;s and butterscotch topped with whipped cream. Ahhh, now that&#39;s just the right amount of sweetness I need for dessert!

Their menu is pretty extensive, so there are plenty of reasons to go back! Location is a little ways north of the intersection of Biesterfield Road and Arlington Heights Road.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, a three meets the standard; however, this--to me--is a little too Americanized. Very comfortable and decent food; but a four star has a certain vine and a five star simply UPS the ante in terms of food authenticity. So it&#39;s good...not wow good"

Tapalpa surprises me with their flavorful entrees, salsa and fantastic service.

The menu offers the usual fare, but there&#39;s a section that boasts dishes from the town of Tapalpa, hence the name. Duh. :)

We ordered the arrachera con salsa y queso (numero 49). It is a broiled skirt steak in a pool of Poblano pepper and sour cream sauce, covered with melted cheese. The steak comes nicely medium as requested and we can taste every fine seasoning in it along with the light sour cream Poblano sauce. It is definitely the more preferred dish. The burrito Suizo did not disappoint either but it&#39;s obvious which is the clear favorite.

Prices are steep. Our #49 costs $15.50, an ouch for lunch. And the supreme fajita (chicken, shrimp, steak) is a whopping $24.50. 

Good thing is the portions are enough for 2 meals so the price pretty much evens out.

They have specials every day. Check their web site for details.

Our server started the conversation in Spanish and was pleased we attempted the bare minimum He was especially wowed when I rolled my r&#39;s in the ordering of the arrachera.  

We will return. It sure beats Pepe&#39;s and La Magdalena. 

Note to drivers without GPS: it&#39;s not easy to find this place as it&#39;s tucked at the corner of a tiny strip. Coming from Busse woods, along Arlington Heights, it&#39;s going to be the first strip to your right as you curve around the bend."

I rarely write a review.  However, this place was so ridiculous that our experience there must be passed on.  The place was crowded, we foolishly assumed that it must therefore be ok.  We ordered the chicken fajetas.  They arrived; no seasoning on the chicken - bland.  That which accompanied the entree, chips, onions, etc. was equally bland.  We ordered drinks; weak.  On top of everything else, every menu item was very much overpriced.  The music was off key which was well-suited for the unpleasant evening spent there.   We have our own rating scale;  0 is 0, 2.5 is poor to fair, 5.0 is average, 7.5 is very good and 10.0 is excellent.  We give it a 1 for ample parking.  In reality, they deserve an empty parking lot."

We love it.  They have the best margaritas I&#39;ve ever had, and their Wednesday special &#34;Pica Pica&#34; is the most amazing thing.  Everything on the menu is great.

Their salsa is made fresh by hand every day, and the same can be said for their astonishingly delicious chipotle sauce.

The staff is friendly, helpful, polite, and will make you feel right at home.  They have regular parties for almost every holiday.  Sometimes they have a mariachi band playing.  On the weekends they have 2 guys with guitars walking around playing songs for people.  They&#39;re really talented and cool.

The place is clean, the atmosphere is fun, and they&#39;re open til 10pm every night (except Sundays because they&#39;re closed).

I believe they have raised their prices recently and if you are an avid lover of Mexican food, you will know that there is much better, authentic food available at a more affordable price. 

Their horchata is also terrible- they don&#39;t use a machine to make it but instead a powder, so the drink tastes way too chalky. The margaritas are cheap and for good reason- they are small and watered down. Their poor service added to an overall &#34;Meh&#34; experience. You do not feel like you are being waited on, but rather just waiting..and waiting to have someone, anyone come by."

So I said Mexican! Yelp helped me find this pearl in Suburbia. It is a Mexican Restaurant which they have in Austin Tx. Located in a strip mall. Kind of tacky inside and out, but very good food and excellent service. Strolling Mariachi&#39;s  too! The honey knew what she wanted as she peeked on line at the menu. She chose the combo of Bistec (steaak) and stuffed chicken breast with a great sauce. Of course it came with rice and refried beans. I chose on the the Friday specials, enchilleda&#39;s stuffed with spinach and cheese. Mine was great. Just enough of a kick to know it is a bit spicy. It comes to you slowly, not blowing  your mouth out with heat. The honey liked her entree. The portions were more than ample and at a reasonable price. The lady also had 2 (count them) Apple Martini&#39;s. I was a bit fearful of having to carry her out. As a little plus, the waiter brought a small teas cup of Baileys, butterscotch and whip cream topping. A nice finish. But the ambience was great and not rushed at all. Being two days b4 Xmas, the restaurant was decorated and the staff wore their finest and Santa&#39;s helpers hats. Cute. It is a local joint as there was a lot of conversation at the main door between patrons and staff. For all you Chicago food snobs, they have plastic tablecloths and good food without unbrellas in your drinks. Didn&#39;t even think of going to White Castle after dinner (LOL). Wait staff and busboys very attentive and personable. I&#39;ll be back....

The decor makes for a comfortable eating environment.  The soft pink glow of the place evokes the west coast of Mexico at the last moments of sunset (aren&#39;t I a freakin&#39; poet?).  To some people the atmosphere might be a little tacky, but to me it feels like the perfect place for Mexican food.

The service was quick and friendly.  One of the big points in its favor was the way the staff treated what appeared to be its regulars.  Some customers were enthusiastically gretty by name when they entered, others had waitstaff more than happy to chat at the tables.  Service that personal and attentive makes a huge difference.

But most important was the food, and it was great.  The menu is huge and includes standard Mexican favorites mixed with a few more specialized dishes from the region of Mexico in which the actual city of Tapalpa is located.  I got the Tuesday special, banderillas, which were essentially giant chicken flautas.  The chicken was that perfect taqueria style, cooked and seasoned to absolute deliciousness.  Great rice and beans too.

So overall Tapalpa is just pleasant.  Despite how close to EGV we live, we tend not to go there for anything, but when our travels bring us north, it&#39;s nice to know there&#39;s an excellent, friendly Mexican restaurant waiting for us."

I make drinks and cook at home for a lot less and just as good. Don&#39;t get me wrong great place but need to keep it afforadble. I do miss this place they have good prices at other places affordable to go and have a good time. This food is not that expensive to make.

I ordered the taco salad and the kid&#39;s meal taco for my son.  The meat was flavorless with green peppers in it I think?  My son picked around it and I spent $7.00 on a meal that he didn&#39;t even eat.  My taco salad had one dop of sour cream so I asked for more and was charged $1.25 for it.  Really? I had to go to the hostess and get my check come to find my waiter sitting there chatting it up with his co-workers.  I said Adios and left.  Looking forward to Good Tequila that opens soon in the Dominicks Plaza.  Maybe it will force Tapalpa to STEP it up and lower their prices.

I am personally impressed by the 1800 Reposado bottle craftfully recreated as a piñata.  $1.50 house margaritas weren&#39;t anything to shake a stick at, either.  I ordered the special of the evening, pork enchiladas and was surprised by the soup of the day: chicken noodle that smelled exactly like the pack o Lipton soup my Nana made everyone when we were sick.  Overall, not bad for Chicago Mexican."

This place has a casual relaxed atmosphere. I ordered the meat platter which came with beef sausage, chicken and beef kabob along with some bread. Food was amazing simple yet delicious. They gave you a wad off butter on the side a bit different but definitely well with the Bosnian bread. One of my friends orders a meat pie which was crispy and fresh. Price were reasonable with average entree around $10-$12 range portions were generous. If you are looking for something different this place is definitely the spot. Do keep in mind it&#39;s a family run business and not a fancy down town restaurant. That being service is friendly and prompt. Dining area can accommodate a 20 or so people we were a group of 6 and were seated comfortably."

Unfortunately, restaurants targeting a certain clientele usually get a higher rating due to the convenience that their food is &#34;halal&#34;.  This undermines the quality, quantity, and overall experience of the service.

The service was apathetic. The server failed to explain their menu, yet was rather pushy. So we ended up winging it for the spinach pie and the mixed grill.

The spinach pie was basically a soft pretzel filled with spinach and feta cheese. The taste was extremely bland.

The mixed grill was composed 4 different types of unidentifiable meats that all tasted the same. Looked like the Crescent brand style frozen meats that get thrown on the grill on 15 minutes and voilà! Eww!!! The platter also contained a handful of over salted Costco style fries, 2 raw slices of onions, 2 small slices of tomatoes, 4 slices of &#34;Bosnian&#34; bread, and an inexplicable scoop of butter.

We hated our dining experience at this location."

I have never tried Bosnian food, so I was excited about it. Anyways this is a small but comfortable place. The owner was real nice came over and talked to us. The wait staff was a little slow (we were the only ones in the restaurant). So we ordered the Grilled Meat Platter and the Spinach Pie, the spinach pie was massive, and overall the food was perfect, it was fresh and very filling. First experience with Bosnian food was good, definitely worth checking out"

The food is delicious, fresh &amp; made to order. I got the grilled meat platter, one meat pie and one spinach &amp; cheese pie. 

The grilled meat platter is definetly lacking value for $11 menu price. 75% of it was just greasy fries the meat sausages, hamburger &amp; bread was good. However, the chicken was barely half a breast and was not seasoned at all. The menu mentions tomatoes with this platter, however i did not get any with my order. 

The meat pies were good this time. Last time, the crust was burnt

Overall, this place has alot of potential but they definitely need to lower the price for the platter or add somethings to it like rice or salad and cut back the greasy fries

Also, they need to hire a professional company to design, write &amp; print their menu. 

Last but not least, since they are fairly new to the area they can attract new customers by offering coupons, deals, promos by advertising in local stores, businesses &amp; something like Groupon or Living Social. And they should consider adding lunch specials to get regular customers at lunch time"

Today at work I got the fever, and the only cure was Cevapi.  The place is very cute and has a nice comfortable vibe.  The staff was very friendly.  I ordered the Cevapi, Burek, and Goulash.  The bread was very soft and fresh and went amazingly well with the Cevapi which was also delicious.  The goulash brought an immediate sense of &#34;just like mom used to make.&#34;  Hearty, savory, and absolutely tasty. The burek was also exactly what I was looking for.  Nice flakey outside with very very flavorful meat and such on the inside.  The meat to curst ratio was also very satisfying.  10/10, will eat again."

The only brute spot was the waitress, she was very polite and really tried to help. She is the only reason I am even giving it 2 stars the food is no stars. 

So I decided to give them another chance and I warned the waiter that someone else needed to make my ChiliMac other the the regular cook. He decided to make it himself and he did a good job.

The food we recieved was good, but service was the problem. Soon after my boyfriend and I were sat down, a family with three children were placed directly behind us. Normally, this would not have been an issue - we don&#39;t mind being placed near families with children, as long as the children either do not act out, or, the parents try their best to calm them when they do. The children of the said family were routinely screaming, giggling,  talking very loudly, and even running around the restaurant. The parents did nothing to calm them the entire time we were there . We couldn&#39;t take it anymore around half way through our meal, and complained to the manager. The complaint was ignored, and he approached the family to keep up appearances (we could hear conversation from our seats - it was just small talk about the day) . We were not given any discount or credit taken off our check, and left without finishing our meals. 

The waitress was friendly and did her job, but the manager did not do his. We will not be coming back to this location, and will warn anyone who considers it. The customer service at this location gives Steak n Shake a bad name."

had the salad. The avocado pieces were so hard  My knife and fork tips would bounce off the hard avocado pieces, let go from about an inch above the pieces.

This is a warning. The experience was beyond disappointing, so much that I may not go here again.

It took a while to get noticed to get seated, and the coffee came quickly but it was cold. I flagged our waiter, Roberto, down and he seemed to know and said he&#39;d bring out a fresh pot.... I mean that they gave us the old coffee tells you something. He brought out a fresh pot and took our cups away.... Which seemed a strange way to handle it. The new coffee was hoy, and we asked for more cream as there was none left. Another guy came over and asked &#34;How may do you want?&#34; And I thought why are you asking just leave the handful ... The coffee though hot was foul tasting. 

I had the biscuits and gravy and eggs and everything was cold. The gravy was a salty congealed mess. Cold eggs.... My sister&#39;s California Scrambler was just strange tasting., they forgot her bagel and the waiter said he&#39;d bring it right out. Maybe ten minutes later I flagged him over and asked where it was. He said that the cook was stupid and forgot to make it. He brought it over with no butter or cream cheese.... I flagged him down and asked if there was anything to put on the bagel he looked panicked and  said &#34;What&#39;s on it??&#34; I said nothing but we&#39;d like some butter...

While waiting for someone to let us pay so we could leave the person cooking told the waiter something like Tell them if they don&#39;t leave I&#39;ll give them an extra sausage Patty. They didn&#39;t ask how everything was, they knew and why ask when you know the answer. But why serve a meal you can&#39;t manage to prepare.

On an amusing note, they did not cover their garbage cans and there were maybe a hundred grackles eating french fries in the parking lot, vegan worms."

Also, I work in the area, and my store gets shakes every Friday during happy hour. Most of the time if we get the proper order at all, we have to bring them back because they&#39;re barely half full. I didn&#39;t know half price meant half the product!

After discovering that most of the restaurants I&#39;d have liked to try closed at 10pm, we took our time finishing our third round at the new Bigby&#39;s and headed over to Steak &#39;n Shake around midnight. We both pretty much knew exactly what we wanted when we walked through the door, yet it took an hour to complete our meal.

A sign up front told us to wait to be seated. We waited 5 minutes before we were acknowledged, though there were at least three employees that made eye contact with us first.

Who appeared to be a manager or lead led us past booth after booth of tables covered in dirty dishes and condiments. We were finally seated at what seemed like the only clean table in the entire restaurant and waited another 10 minutes before our server came to take our order, and we can&#39;t decide if he was on something, purposefully acting strange, or if that&#39;s just who he is. It was somewhat awkward and uncomfortable interacting with him.

We ordered 2 Waters, a Cherry Coke, a Caramel Apple Shake, and 2 Burgers with Fries (mine with the Salt &amp; Vinegar seasoning).

The drinks and Shake took another 10 minutes to show up. Their Cherry Coke is Cola with Cherry Syrup, which we like. We also both enjoyed the Shake, which tastes like the Caramel Apple Suckers.

Another 10 minutes pass and the food arrives. I got the Garlic Burger, which had a Garlic Butter Sauce drizzled over the top. I knew immediately that it would be messy, but our server dropped it off and walked away before I could ask for napkins and none were at our table. I also found that my Fries hadn&#39;t been seasoned, but the receipt left with the meal showed I hadn&#39;t been charged for it. So I also have to assume it wasn&#39;t added to the order. Regardless, the Burger was tasty and the Fries were crap.

Our server never came back to check on us, which was both a blessing and a curse.

We finished our meals and used the disgusting facilities. Then, we waited at the register to pay our bill while the cashier confused tickets and took her sweet ass time. It took us over 5 minutes to get out of there and we were second in line.

I can only guess that this place is open at night solely to feed the drunken masses coming over from the local bars and clubs, but I&#39;d have to be completely shitfaced to give them a second chance. I&#39;d rather take my chances with the McDonald&#39;s drive-thru."

BF and I were hungry after our 5 hour flight from California without eating so my sister who lives in the area brought us here as it was one of the few spots open at 11pm in the area.  They have a very lengthy $4 portion of the menu which includes mini-meals of burgers and hot dogs. 

I ordered a something-royale which is a burger with a fried egg, and boyfriend ordered a foot long hot dog meal.  I wanted this other burger with avocado, but they ran out of avocado for the day.  I ordered parmesan seasoning on one of my fries which actually ended up being pretty nasty. Fries got cold pretty quick and a customer from the drive-thru came into the store requesting new fries because the fries he got was cold.

Service seemed to be OK until the worker overcharged me for my food.  It was an additional $15 more than what it was supposed to be and he was having trouble post-voiding or refunding the transaction and finally called for help.  The issue was resolved just as our food was being delivered. 

Food quality is OK, very reminiscent of Jack in the Box.  I&#39;m a fan of the $4 meals but not sure I&#39;d come back to this place if I were back in Chicagoland."

When we arrived there were maybe 5 occupied tables. We waited several minutes to be acknowledged. We were seated and waited about 10 minutes before our waiter came to take our order. The waiter made a comment about my boyfriend&#39;s hair, which is long and worn in a bun. The waiter asked if my boyfriend was religious, he said no, he just has to wear it back because it&#39;s long. The waiter then joked if he was into karate. It was awkward. After we ordered another employee came to ask if we had been helped yet. We said yes. I noticed our waiter was not helping or checking on his other tables and people were waiting with dirty dishes. After 20 minutes our waiter came by with our sodas and asked if we were ready to order. I told him that we already ordered and he played it off like he was joking and said to my boyfriend &#34;I guess she didn&#39;t think that was funny.&#34; While we waited for our food our waiter was in the kitchen and it looked like he was making our food, but I did not see him waiting a hairnet or gloves. He brought out our meals and our bill without asking if we wanted anything else. My boyfriend&#39;s sandwich was cold, which was not a surprise since I saw it sitting in the window for a while. My order was completely wrong. I ordered a chicken melt, no tomato, coleslaw and onion rings. He brought me a grilled chicken sandwich with tomato, fries, and coleslaw. He said my onion rings were coming up. I said this isn&#39;t what I ordered; I ordered a chicken melt with onion rings. The waiter didn&#39;t apologize, he just said oh shoot and said &#34;well you&#39;ll eat the fries.&#34; I said no, I wouldn&#39;t, I&#39;m allergic to potatoes. I dumped the fries on my boyfriend&#39;s plate. The waiter took my chicken sandwich and went to the kitchen. He came out shortly after with the absolute worst sandwich and onion rings I&#39;ve ever eaten at a Steak n&#39; Shake. No apology either and did not correct our bill. There were pools of brown oil on my plate from the onion rings. I ate one and a half onion rings. They tasted horribly oily and rancid. We didn&#39;t see anyone that looked like a manager, just our terrible waiter and two other young waiters. We decided to just leave.  When my boyfriend paid, he tipped 2 dollars on our 18 dollar bill and our waiter was working the register and asked if he was tipping 2 dollars, he said yes. We both had stomach issues later that evening. 

Our waiter was a white guy named Charles A. Worst waiter I&#39;ve ever had. Restaurant is also really dirty.

Save yourself the trouble and go to a local place like Portillo&#39;s. I am never going to a Steak &#39;n Shake ever again."

The waiter we (myself, my father, and a friend) had today was very rude at the end on our visit. We had left a tip in cash on the table, and went to pay at the register. The waiter also was our cashier, we paid and as we turned he yelled, &#34; you want to add anything to the bill!&#34; I almost went to the table to take back the tip. I would&#39;ve showed him the tip, and gold him his behavior had just made him lose it. I should have. But I will never return to a place where the waiter asks for a tip.

I said we needed a few minutes so he gave us about 20! We sat there and watched him flirt with the girl working there talk to a couple of buddies anything but notice that we were ready to order. Got a turkey club and fries my husband got a burger and fries took about 35 minutes to get those. Oh but he was prompt with dropping that check off.

We went inside and were seated and had to ask for a server after siting there for 15 min ( we were 1 of 3 tables).  Our food took a long time to come out and both of our orders were wrong.  We then had to go up front and ask for our check because our server&#39;s shift ended so he just left and we never got a check from him.  The 2nd time we came we used the drive-thru.  Once again it took a long time and our order was wrong.  I had a hotdog with just ketchup.  Upon opening it I noticed an obnoxious amount of ketchup.  about 1/2 way through I tasted mustard.  Upon further inspection it appears the cook put ketchup and mustard on it and then instead of making a new one they just wiped it off and covered it with more ketchup.  My boyfriend contacted the manager seeing as mustard is one of the top 15 most common allergies.  Unfortunately at this steak and shake I could see this negligence occurring again.  If you have any food allergies please avoid!

It took 30 minutes to even have our order taken. Then another 40 for the food to come. And it was incredibly sub par. Had to basically beg for the milkshake to go considering they never even brought it in the first place.

This was the poorest fast food service I have seen in quite a while. It is obvious why this location has the lowest rating out of other local stake and shake restaurants... We ordered our food three different times and they still couldn&#39;t get it right. After twenty minutes we still did not even get our water. The employees had no sense of direction and there was clearly no leadership to even ensure the most basic level of service.  The manager was completely unable to deal with the numerous performance issues there or to make matters right. There didn&#39;t appear to be any empowerment or proper customer service training at the management or employee level. We even noticed an employee at the grill use the same spatula with raw meat  to immediately pick up a bun potentially leading to cross contamination. I hope whoever ate the burger does not get sick. In fact, when trying to address the issues with the manager, we were aggressively antagonized and provoked by an employee in a hostile way.  What a terrible experience we had there. Will never go back!!!! After being a life long steak and shake customer,  I now doubt I will ever dine in any of their restaurants again after my recent experience at this branch. I am not convinced the company stands for quality or customer service any more. I will support other emerging businesses and forget about this restaurant that has obviously lost its way from what it once was. I am so glad I left and did not spend my money there...

While I still love going there (always after 11pm), this particular branch in RM is absolutely awful.  I live nearby, and visited there back in December.  The place was filthy (overturned glasses with pop all over the table), and the party near our table said they had been there 2 hours before getting any service whatsoever.  We promptly left.

I decided to give them a 2nd shot on Saturday (Jan 25).  We arrived at about 12:30am or so, no one in the drive thru, no customers in the store.  The store was quite dirty again, and it took forever to get our food.  Even after that, when we were ready to go, we didn&#39;t see anyone working in the store and waited a good 20 minutes to pay.

Either way, we&#39;ll never be back to this particular branch.  Avoid it at all costs.  If you need super late night grub, head to Denny&#39;s up the road, or anywhere else for that matter."

My partner and I arrived around 10:00 pm, with only 4 other tables being served. We stood for about a minute before a frazzled-looking manager came to seat us, apologizing for &#34;not paying attention.&#34;  Hmm...all right. 

We sat at our table with open menus, looking around for a good 10 minutes before finally seeing a server. Doesn&#39;t introduce herself, but simply asks, &#34;What can I get you?&#34;  She wasn&#39;t unfriendly, at least. I ordered a footlong chili dog with fries and a fruit punch, he ordered a regular footlong with fries, and a coke.  We waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive, then the food. What I saw on my plate was a hot dog with a pittance of chili and cheese, and a truckload of onions. I scraped away most of the onions, then attempted to pick up my hot dog. Well, what I discovered was very thin chili juice that had made the bun very soggy and caused the meat to fall through the bun and on my plate. Last straw. I pushed my plate away and told my boyfriend &#34;No. I&#39;m not eating this.&#34;  After waiting yet another 10 minutes, server comes back and asks if I want a box for my uneaten food. I looked her in the eye and said &#34;No, I don&#39;t want this at all,&#34; and told her what happened. She replied, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I feel bad now. Here&#39;s your check. Have a good night.&#34;  No offer for a replacement. No offer to comp my meal. I was so angry that I asked for my boyfriend&#39;s car keys so I could wait in the car. I just had to get out. 

After waiting in the car for a while, I saw my boyfriend angrily get in the car. I ask what happened, and he said that after waiting in a 10-person line with only one register, he told the manager what happened and how he felt. The manager simply said, &#34;Mmm-hmm. Have a good night.&#34;

Unbelievable. The only good thing about this visit was that our server was nice. But everything else was a complete disappointment. This experience was even worse than the one I had in Hoffman Estates, where the server asked me if I had something against kids.

It is a shame that this particular location is MANAGED SO POORLY.  I say MANAGED POORLY because my server was actually very professional.  Unfortunately the management at this location sucks.  My girl and I walked in at 8PM and were promptly seated by the waiter/host.  He then proceeded to take our order.  At this time it was just us and another table that was about to finish.  Three more groups walked in and he seated them and took all their orders.  He delivered the orders to the ONE cook there.  The one cook begins to make the orders but somehow forgets to make our milkshake.  The server comes by twice and tells us the milkshake will be done in 2 minutes and I hear him tell the cook to make the milkshake twice.  Why the cook didn&#39;t make it I do not know.  And why the manager was walking around at this time instead of managing I do not know either.

But basically, we get our food, which takes half an hour or more, and NEVER get our milkshake.  Then the manager tells me some BS about how the computer screens weren&#39;t working and the cook didn&#39;t see the order.  Uh....I HEARD THE SERVER TELL THE COOK TO MAKE OUR MILKSHAKE.....TWICE!!!!.  It&#39;s a shame that Steak n Shake has this location....it gives the franchise a bad name when this is just a pathetic excuse for a sit down restaurant.

The taste is unique with its 2 beef patties, Pepperjack cheese, Fritos, Chili and Jalapeno Pepper ingredients. It&#39;s also a bit messy so I cut it in half first. 

I like their shoe string French Fries with cheese sauce on the side. I prefer it to Portillo&#39;s.

I usually order the Frisco or Pepperjack Melt and upgrade my fries to the bacon cheese fries. Too much of it can&#39;t be healthy.

Yes, I do not disappoint my ancestors--I wish Reggie Miller had annihilated the NY Knicks during the &#39;94 playoffs, I believe the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is a religious temple, and I loves me some Steak n Shake.

California can have their &#34;In n Out&#34; burgers--aptly named, but not because it refers to a car--and Chicago can have their White Castle--sliders so greasy that I entered the nine circles of flatulent hell the first time I ate them.

Steak n Shake is just plain good food that&#39;s been served the same way since the 40s.  The menu is definitely a step up from typical fast food.  My favorite items are Chili 3-way and any shake on the menu.  I like this location; friendly employees and a clean, well lit dining room.

There&#39;s seriously soo many different shake flavors here, from mint oreo to cookies &amp; cream to peanut butter cup to the classics, and you can even do half and half and get strawberry side by side with banana (it&#39;s looks pretty cool if i do say so).

This is seriously the 5th SnS terrible experience I&#39;ve had after 11PM and at a different location each time.

My friends and I work in the restaurant industry so we tend to be a lot more sympathetic to severely understaffed restaurants.  It looked like there was only one server and one cook (which to us was ridiculous for a drive-thru location).  We figured we&#39;d have to wait a little longer than usual and that was OK.

In the 50 minutes we sat there (not even joking)...
-The server never even asked us for drinks, menus, or anything of the like
-We watched three other parties walk out
-One other party (which looked like the server&#39;s buddies from high school or something) got waited on multiple times while we were still waiting on being asked if we wanted anything to drink
-The server came out and yelled to either us or his friends &#34;I&#39;M REALLY SORRY GUYS, I&#39;M THE ONLY ONE HERE AND PEOPLE KEEP GOING THROUGH THE DRIVE-THRU AND I HAVE TO KEEP MAKING SHAKES&#34;.  OK, we can dig that but did you have to yell for the entire store to hear...and STILL not even wait on us once in the next 30 minutes?
-We literally watched 5 cars go through the drive-thru and get served.  We asked ourselves why we even went inside to begin with.

We ended up telling a couple folks what just happened to spare them the trouble, then went to Denny&#39;s down the street.

Once again, I&#39;m reminded why me and my friends haven&#39;t been to a Steak &#39;n Shake for years.  Now I remember."

It turns out a friend of mine gets food (mostly takeout) here pretty regularly and suggested this as our dinner adventure.

We ordered:
- Mushroom Swiss burgers, spicy sauce on the side
- Butter Garlic Fries

Drink options include bottled water, canned pop, and root beer. Oh, and shakes.

Just FYI: there really is no waitstaff service here beyond the food being brought to your table. You place your order at the front desk, pay, and find a seat. If you need napkins and cutlery, they&#39;re on a table by the door, and you need to help yourself. Oh, and clean up after yourself too. (And had I known all this, I wouldn&#39;t have tipped 20% when I paid..)


Fries: 3.5/5
They were good. Some in the basket were lukewarm, while others were piping hot. I didn&#39;t taste garlic, but they were buttery and the parsley on top was a nice touch.


Burger: 4/5
Nice size, good flavor, noticeably peppery, and onions were carmelized nicely. I enjoyed the bun: it was hearty and toasted (though a tad dry on the inside - cracked when cut). The mushrooms and cheese were disappointingly sparse, though for a $5  1/2 lb. burger, I guess I can&#39;t really complain!

If you order your burger &#34;spicy,&#34; I HIGHLY suggest you get the sauce on the side, as it&#39;s pretty potent and packs QUITE a punch!  It can easily overpower the flavor of the meat.


As far as decór.. one side of the dining room is kind of dimly lit/more dingy looking, and the other side is brighter (with shinier tables and centerpieces). We probably weren&#39;t SUPPOSED TO sit at the latter, but we did. Anyway, Faizaan&#39;s isn&#39;t really a place I&#39;d think is known for &#34;atmosphere,&#34; but then again, is that what we&#39;re aiming for with $5 burgers? Still, I&#39;d probably carry out in the future.

I know the focus is American/burger joint fare, but wish there was an option for, say, a side salad. Gotta round out the meats and starches!

I&#39;m seriously torn between a 3 and a 4. I would stop in to order another, but Take-Out only, and skipping that &#34;add a tip&#34; business. Gah."

anyways I ordered the Volcano Burger, Angry BBQ Wings and Butter Garlic Fries. The burger was one of the better burgers that I have had, the seasoning was on point, and the chili sauce gave it the perfect kick.

The food was delivered slightly late due to snow, but the people from Faizaan&#39;s kept in touch with us to let us know when to expect it. Honestly, with how bad the roads were, we were very pleased with the timeliness of the delivery.

All of the food was delicious. The fried chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The biryani was flavorful without being greasy.

My personal favorite for which I get frequent cravings is the Habanero burger. It comes with cheese, mentions and don&#39;t very addictively tasty Habanero sauce. 

The decor isn&#39;t anything to die for, looks like a hole in the wall restaurant but they have amazingly good food!

Try their fries as well, either garlic or regular, but are great. The gyro rice is amazing as well!"

You make your way into the restaurants by parking in an unsafe lot due to no lighting . You then walk into a cold, dark/dingy unwelcoming environment where you&#39;re disrespectfully greeted by kids working the register and serving. As you look around the floors while you order you see LARGE water bugs and small spiders walking around! Needless to say , we still ordered -My worst mistake was tipping them as I prepaid for my meal- little did I know what horrible service I was about to receive! Unprofessional, rude , stingy and disrespectful is what comes to mind! You&#39;re running a business here, treat your paying customers with respect.  After receiving horrible service I demanded my money back for an item they messed up and and a refund for the tip I left - they ended up calling the owner who was just as rude as the workers! She started getting loud with me on the phone and yelling stating they don&#39;t have any money to refund me ($10) and for me to come back tomorrow ! I live an hour away !

Save yourself the headache, stay away from this place . If you don&#39;t believe me, just step foot inside and you&#39;ll see for yourself . I will be contacting the bbb to make a formal report considering the restaurant was extremely dirty &amp; filthy all over -From the tables, the floors and the restrooms . You&#39;re better off eating inside a bathroom at a truck stop in the middle of Mississippi. Worst experience ever ."

The restaurant itself, inside &amp; out, isn&#39;t much to look at but was clean.  I like the options of either a 1/4 lb or 1/2 lb burger and their sizes of milkshakes are perfect - a small is truly a small &amp; just right if you want a little milkshake &amp; not feel guilty about it.  I had the Angry BBQ Burger which was very good and had just the right kick of spice to it &amp; the Hubs had the Mushroom Swiss Burger which he proclaimed was one of the best Mushroom Swiss burgers he&#39;d ever had.  We shared an order of their Garlic Fries - also quite tasty but boy, that garlic is gonna stick with you for the rest of the day so I wouldn&#39;t recommend those if you&#39;re on a date.

The service wasn&#39;t bad, but was devoid of any personality as the girl at the counter never greeted us &amp; barely looked up.  Oh well, the food was good so we were happy.

They have more on their regular printed menus than what is written on the chalk board so either look at their menu online or look at a printed menu at the counter.  They also seem to have a big catering menu as well with other foods as well."

We ordered like 7 burgers, fries, and a variety of shakes. I got the volcano burger, I would not reccomend that one. It really has no flavor besides the spicy sauce they put in that. However, last time I ordered the angry bulls eye and that was very good! It has onion rings, bbq sauce, and cheese. A few of my family members ordered the Pizza and the sunnyside and were not too pleased with it. The onion rings and fries are on point. I would highly reccomend the mango shake it was really good.

Service can be better, but you can&#39;t expect much sometimes from a fast food place not run by corporate.

I always prefer to take out because I am not a big fan of there seating, you can dine with a larger group if you want. If you are taking far make sure it is not a far commute because when the burger and bun get cold they do not taste good at all."

Appearance is a bit outdated but that doesn&#39;t mean a thing, I love trying out restaurants like these because usually they have UNIQUE recipes of traditional dishes. That was exactly what I experienced with trying their Volcano Burger, I didn&#39;t expect it to be so spicy but it did bring the heat which is something that I REALLY LIKE. If I&#39;m ever in this area again I would most DEFINITELY come back to try out other burgers on their menu because it was TASTY."

As a Muslim in America, it&#39;s very difficult to find burger places I can eat at because of them not being Zabiha Halal. This place changed that, along with the entire game! They have a variety of different burgers to choose from, which was unheard of to me (eating Fish Filet sandwiches from McDonald&#39;s my entire existence). They&#39;re fairly generous with their meat on their burgers and their sides are tasty (the wings especially) just like the name states.

It&#39;s not just their food that gets me coming back, it&#39;s their generosity. One time, I was craving chai/tea and, even though it&#39;s not on the menu, the person at the register made it for me and my mother at no cost! THAT is customer service.

The only downside of this place is that it&#39;s a little dirty. It always kind of looks like it&#39;s a half a violation away from being shut down permanently. Their bathrooms are just plain filthy, and I always have to think twice before using them. 

Other than the cleanliness complaint, I really do believe this is one of the best places for great tasting burgers, Zabiha Halal or not. I&#39;d pick it over any other burger place in Chicago or Chicagoland area every time!"

But...I liked it. I really, really did.

I got the Volcano burger and wings to share, while my friend got the Habanero burger with a side of butter garlic fries to share.  The burger contained a half-pound of beef that was perfectly seasoned, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside,  -- this was clearly not the frozen pre-made stuff.

Some fries, a couple of wings, and half of a burger later, I was absolutely stuffed and could not take another bite even if I wanted to.

Despite our gastronomical state and plentiful leftovers, both of us got another burger to go.

Customer service was also nice, as the kind man (I believe his name was Fayaz?) offered to give us his suggestions and checked up on our dining experience a couple of times.

I am docking off a star because I believe I was slightly overcharged and was not given an itemized receipt -- but I do understand that this was partially my own problem for not bringing this up then. There were some issues with the payment process where my card was being swiped multiple times and the bill had to be calculated a few times.  Also, while my expectations of the location weren&#39;t grand, I do wish it were better lit.

Overall, I can&#39;t wait to come back again! Definitely one of the best burgers I&#39;ve eaten in Chicago/Chicagoland, and customer service was kind and courteous."

We made quite the drive to try this place, so I was quite excited. I ordered the Bulls Eye burger and I absolutely loved it. The butter garlic fries were scrumptious as well. However, I do think the restaurant should focus a little on overall cleanliness and service. There were used napkins on the floor, and the dining area once you enter is poorly lit. Some brightness would really liven the place up. The cashier/server was polite, but she seemed to be the only employee on the floor, so it may have been hard for her to balance the register and cleaning at the same time.

We ordered chicken and we got undercooked beef. It was pink! We asked for a refund and were mocked by their employees. The girl went in the back and started laughing. When she came back front she gave attitude and started saying rude things while constantly mocking us. She handed a phone to us without any word and said speak. Turned out to be the manager Mrs Khan who kept yelling saying why are you yelling at my employees. We took out our phone to record the situation and the employee said she is underage and don&#39;t record her. Wth!? We then finally got our refund of $5 in nickels. I said give me bills and she laughed saying money is money. I then demanded my tip back and got $10 after 40 mins. Worst customer service ever. Do not go here! I repeat do not! People like this don&#39;t deserve to own a business and even the owner Mrs khan was disrespectful and rude. Very sad and very pathetic.

It&#39;s satisfying because it&#39;s something familiar but it&#39;s always a little off from what you&#39;re used to eating in the US. That&#39;s how I would describe my experience at Faizaan&#39;s Tasty Burgers.  

From the appearance, you wouldn&#39;t think they sold burgers and gyros but based on the name and reviews, I had to order a burger and went with a Volcano. The burger itself was different - different as in foreign. The bun was chewy and had a texture similar to the roll used for Italian beef sandwiches and the sauce reminded me of a Southeast Asian red chili mixture. I imagined this is what a burger would taste like in Pakistan or Arabia. Even though it was different, it was still good. And for the price, it was a great deal for only $5 for a  1/2 pound burger.

To top it off, this burger place also serves biryani. Lost in translation? It&#39;s an Indian fried rice mixed with vegetables, meat, and spices. Half of the dining area is set up for large parties where they cater lamb, chicken, and goat biryani. I tried ordering it but it is only served on the weekends. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back. Next time, it will be for their ethnic menu. Where else can you get a burger and a lamb biryani in the same order? (place ethnic punch line here)"

I really do not like to put down a family owned businesses because looking at the overall review of this place, they certainly have fans.

I went midweek for lunch.  The exterior needs work in the worst way, but not as shocking as the interior.  I was expecting more of a fast casual atmosphere.  I walked in on a dark, cold (literally), empty restaurant.  Just me, the young lady at the POS, one other lady waiting for a friend, and who ever was in the back of house.  Other than, the place was dead, pin drop dead, pin drop dead during lunch?!  The interior is in dire need of makeover, nothing about it was inviting: mix-matched furniture, lighting, darkness, and man was it cold.  The employee had a portable heater 3 feet away from her on the counter.

Despite all this, I tried to remain optimistic; maybe their gyro will blow me away? NOT!  My order was to-go, but it took 20 minutes despite being only 1 of 2 customers in the place, and all she had was water while waiting for her friend!  I ordered the regular gyro, with garlic butter fries.  The gyro was okay, but the big whiff was that they were missing the tomatoes and the lettuce was not looking fresh, wilted and brown.  The fries actually tasted great, but they were STALE, crack your fillings stale!  Inexcusable!

They certainly have a band of faithful followers based on Yelp Reviews, but I refuse to be one of them."

I ordered the Bulls eye burger.  It was a good burger, the price was right, the service was okay.  I was a little disappointed they were out of shakes.  It seems like this place might be better for lunch.  The place overall was average.  I felt it was a little messy.  The garbage can was overflowing and the bathroom was less than clean.

The place is located in a kind of shady place, lol, but it&#39;s nice and cozy-feeling on the inside. The name has changed, it&#39;s called Tasty Burger and Grill...we were a bit confused when looking for it. 

I was here today with someone - i got the buffalo chicken sandwich and he got the philly cheesesteak sandwich. Mine was tangy and spicy without being overpowering, while my companion&#39;s was cheesy, beefy and just oh-so-good. We also had mozzarella cheese sticks for appetizers and the garlic butter fries. Both were delicious. 

A lot of people are saying it takes time for the food to come out - I didn&#39;t think so at all. It was given to us in a timely manner and the lady behind the counter was extremely nice. She helped us pick good options.  

Love that it&#39;s all zabiha halal and can&#39;t wait to come back and try one of the burgers!"

After reading the reviews on here we decided to check Faizaan&#39;s out.  We live in the city and it took us 45 minutes get out to Hanover Park.  The interior was just plain weird but we weren&#39;t there for the ambience.  We placed our order.  We ordered two burgers and two orders of fries.  Our food was ready fairly quickly.  I immediately noticed a hair on my bun.  I called the waitress over.  She practically yelled at me about how it couldn&#39;t have been the cooks because they have no hair.  I told her it wasn&#39;t mine because my hair is really dark and the hair on my bun was light (the same color as the waitress&#39;s hair).  She grabbed the burger from the table and then went back to kitchen.  Some guy then came over to my table and asked what I wanted to do.  I told him I wanted another burger.  He brought another one out within 2 minutes.  I&#39;m sure it was the same burger.  They might have changed the bun.  Needless to say, I had totally lost my appetite.  We just wanted to get out of there.

We shouldn&#39;t have to lower our standards just because they have a halal burgers.  Customer service and good food are what bring people back to a restaurant.  Instead of apologizing to me about something that was clearly a mistake on their part, the waitress got upset with me.  If we would have received an apology, we would have returned."

I realized when we arrived that this place was different from your average Chicago area hot dog stand/gyros stand/burger place.  When I looked at reviews and saw the word halal, I had to look it up. It explained everything to me. Their italian beef is not season shaved beef piled high with hot or sweet peppers. It was a relatively small amount of chopped steak with mayonnaise and they had some giardiniera if you wanted it. The gyros didn&#39;t come standard with tomato onion and cucumber sauce. It came with lettuce and onion. They had hot dogs on the menu but not available when I tried to order one.
I&#39;m pretty sure the fact that these people haven&#39;t had non - kosher food prevents them from duplicating the non - kosher places I am used to. It just wasn&#39;t good for me. However if you are looking for halal/kosher food, I guess you could give it a try."

Had to wait for our seats despite reserving them very well in advance. Then, had a two hour wait for our food. We had to ask for cleaning supplies to clean our table because they were too lazy to do so. We had to write down our order for them because the staff were too incompetent to keep the order straight. Ridiculous.

After my initial review I received a message from someone [clearly on the staff on Faizaan&#39;s] saying that I should have made a reservation AND asked for a table. This makes me wonder what Faizaan&#39;s thinks a reservation is; if we&#39;re not calling to reserve a table, what in the world are we reserving? 

This same person, by the way, also left a 5-star review of Faizaan&#39;s saying that the staff is wonderful and the customers are rude and only leave $1 tips. How a &#39;customer&#39; knows what other customers are leaving as tips is beyond me."

The burger meat was cooked too long so it was a bit tough and the bun was a bit hard. I am not sure if you can request it to be cooked medium though so perhaps that is the solution to that. The sauce however was awesome.

The garlic fries were okay as well. A bit too tough, they would be better if a bit softer on the inside. 

As far as service goes, the two young ladies working there were excellent. They were very friendly and helpful in splitting our large bill for each person and allowed us to place our order beforehand and return around iftar time. They also informed us of the complimentary chai, chole and dates. A+++ for service.

Next time I will be sure to try something other than a burger just to see how they do their other dishes. The wings seemed tasty but I did not try them."

They serve 100% Zabihah Halal meat according to the owner. My wife got mushroom Swiss burger which was great and I got a spicy bullseye burger. Both burgers were delicious. We waited for them for less then 10 mins. Not sure what pterosaur reviewers were taking about waiting for long period.

Enjoyed the nice environment and comfortable seating. The owner came by asking how the burger was and how things were going.

In short, our experience was delightful. Our daughter had fun as well with Chicken tenders we got for her so as family we all were happy! Will Combe back here.

FGG serves more than just burgers, but on this day it was all about the burger.  I was impressed how juicy the burger was and not greasy.
They offer about a dozen types of burgers.  As other Yelpers have reviewed.  I ordered the Sunny Burger (fried egg) and added fresh jalapenos.  I wanted to add bacon, but this is a halal restaurant.  No worries.  The Sunny Burger was scrumptious.  The ingredients are fresh and the bun was unique, perhaps made of potato.  Not sure, but made the taste memorable.  The lady at the counter was very friendly and helpful.  The interior is a bit interesting.  Wonder if they turn this place into a disco after hours?  Go and check this place out.

They  didnt have that many drink options and Im trying to give up pop and really wanted an ice-tea.  The place could also use some sprucing up by brightening it up.  It felt a little dark in there.

I ordered a bulls eye burger with spicy BBQ. It was a good size and cooked well. The bun was delicious and really made the burger.  My buddy got the chicken Philly burger and said it was good as well.   We wanted to try the biriyani but its only available on sunday, so we assumed it must be good.  Instead, we split chicken tenders and they were also decent.

This place had fast service and good food at decent prices. A neighborhood hole in the wall, if you will. We are probably going to come back again post-gym."

I was just looking for a new place for food but I won&#39;t be returning to this place for a long time.

The biggest problem is service.  The place was empty except for one table with a family and the corner....Big Black Round Sofa Table Thing with a few people.  So imagine my surprise when an order for a sandwich and fries would take almost 30 minutes to come out :o .  So either the cook is extremely slow or lazy at delivering food OR they don&#39;t have a good food prep system in place.  The food I got in the end was mediocre and not worth the wait.  Fries were over-salted and the chicken in the chicken sandwich had too much sauce that overpowered the chicken taste.

All carbonated beverages are cans offered out of a fridge.  That should give you a clue about the restaurant as a whole.  The ONLY waiter/front staff there was nice to me but it&#39;s kinda sad that she works alone in the front.

Let&#39;s put all decor comments to rest by me stating what I saw: Black and Orange!  So half of the wall to bottom is orange, and the other half to the ceiling (including the ceiling) was all painted black.  No wonder the place feels dark.  There are not enough windows or they are sized wrong to be using such dark colors.  And the one long wall needs a better color choice...and perhaps more professional looking wood trim.

So yeah, this is a real review.  Not a biased one like so many listed below.  Compare the names of the reviewers to the name of this restaurant and you will see the bias."

So far it&#39;s always been a different restaurant each time, but I hope that Edelweiss makes a return.  I got to sample a few of their wares, and I want to enjoy them again without having to trek up to Palatine!

Out of several sausages (bratwurst, weisswurst, et al) I was most looking forward to the Thuringer, which was definitely good; but it was the Hungarian sausage which stole the show.  It&#39;s got paprika in it (duh) and I don&#39;t know what else.  But it&#39;s a damn fine sausage which doesn&#39;t need any condiments--a rarity among encased meats.

For sides, I tried the cucumber salad and kidney bean salad.  The former is a nice light accompaniment to these heavy sausages.  But the kidney bean salad...damn.  Again, I was not expecting much and they knocked my socks off.  With a nice roll or pretzel, would make a righteous meal on its own.  It seems simple but so damn delicious--besides the plentiful beans, there are celery, onion, red bell pepper, dill, and a medium-creamy savory dressing.  I&#39;m chomping a mouthful as I write this, and I just can&#39;t do it justice.  This stuff is outstanding.

We went in looking for a good deli sandwich and we discovered so much more. 
Now I am not German, so many of the wonderful items didn&#39;t mean too much to me, but I can say there&#39;s a lot to choose from. 
From pudding mix to German jams, they have it. They even have a boot beer glasses for sale!
My husband and I both ended up with a ham sandwich, on rye, and it was so delicious.They bake the ham right there and make their own breads and salads too. 
The owner and her daughter were running the show the day we went in and were extremely helpful and friendly. 
We will be back to explore other tasty meats and cheeses for sure.

If you are looking for an excellent German deli / grocery store, you&#39;ve found it in Palatine next to EuroFresh.

While they are touted as German, Edelweiss caters to most of the Eastern European deli and grocery needs as well.

I particularly like their deli ham, made in house.  Wonderful flavor!  Their homemade veal-loaf is also quite tasty.
Don&#39;t miss out on their cheeses as well.  A small but excellent collection of standards and really interesting and unique stuff.
From their salads case, their 3-bean salad is just like my mom used to make, no joke, and their herring in cream sauce hits the spot.

They have imported products from Germany and a number of other European countries to complement their deli case as well.

The owner and her staff are always helpful and a delight to work with.

I love this place and recommend it highly."

First- the deli part of the store is very good, all the usual meats to complete your aufschnit platter await.  Cheese selection is good as well, and the store does good business so everything is fresh.

All the extras are what make Edelweiss a 5star experience.  They carry all the Knorr and Dr. Oetker stuff, Fa shower gel, 4711, a great assortment of Chocolate and lebekuchen, stollen, etc (in season), even German Magazines!  And not just stern and ladies mags, they even have some good German Car magazines (German car magazines are much more technical and outclass US car magazines in every way).  Unfortunately no D&amp;W car parts catalog, but that&#39;s not going to be much use to US auto-enthusiasts anyway (except for the naked girl part of the catalog).

So Edelweiss is a great place to get all the German goodies you might dream up- great selection, tons of bilingual ladies ready to help you and no dusty old stuff on the shelves, everything is fresh!  Reminds me of how Meyer&#39;s in Chicago USED to be."

The ability to choose an endless combination of items with a guaranteed 5-minute cooking time works for those who are in a lunch rush or just really hungry for some fresh pizza. My criticisms do stand about how light the flavors are of the ingredients (guess it&#39;s so different ingredients don&#39;t clash in unusual combinations), how the crust could be more flavorful, and how it&#39;s a bit expensive for this (although with the price of other fast food rising, it&#39;s not as bad comparatively). Two items I tried here that weren&#39;t in the other review were the breadsticks and the apple pie. The breadsticks are fairly pricey, even when ordered in a bundle -- but true to their claim -- they really do melt in your mouth and have an addictive flavor to them. So much so that I might just skip the pizza and go straight to breadsticks next time. The apple pie was surprisingly tasty with apples that were still crisp and a nice cookie crust that really matched well with the cinnamon and gooey apple filling on top.

Overall, this place does serve addictive food and is a serious competitor to Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Little Caesar&#39;s -- but a little on the pricey side for fast casual cuisine."

The concept of picking your ingredients, &#39;meh so you see them and pick/point. Is this really a new concept? Not so sure, since I&#39;ve been ordering pizza for decades and picking out exactly what I want on it, maybe this is for people that like to pick out which lobster they want from the tank? 

As I said, better than I expected, I ordered the farmer&#39;s market on the artisan crust, it is a very thin crust. I&#39;ve been trying to eat a bit healthier and I&#39;m well aware that pizza really doesn&#39;t fit into that plan, I didn&#39;t feel as if I were going out of line, next time I&#39;d probably ask for a little less cheese, not only to cut down, but just because it was a bit much on such a thin crust. 

I did ask about the 5$ off on the Yelp check in, I did mention the personal pizza, well it&#39;s not 5$ off it&#39;s a particular pizza for 5$, so I was a bit surprised when the one I ordered wasn&#39;t the right one for the deal. Just some miscommunication, not a big deal, but nevertheless when I started ordering the other one, she should have said, that&#39;s not the check in offer. 

I&#39;d go back and tweak my order a bit, this is passable as pizza, not great but will do in a pinch to satisfy a pizza craving when you don&#39;t have the time. If you&#39;re looking for great, well as with most things, proper preparation and time are the key ingredients. This could be viewed as a pizza &#34;quickie&#34; you&#39;re okay with it, but really wish you did it right."

There are quite a few entrants into the category already, including Blaze, MOD, and Pie Five, which was started and is owned by the same group that owns the successful chain, Pizza Inn (I like their buffets).  I think that gives them a leg up on the competition.

It works kind of like Chipotle or Subway, you walk through a line, pick one of the specialty pies, or design your own, choosing your crust (including a gluten free option), sauce, cheese, and toppings, all for one price.  The pie is popped into a scorching hot oven and one in just a few minutes, as opposed to the quarter hour a conventional pizza deck or conveyor oven take to go through the same process.

I tried out two today, at a pre opening fete.  The &#34;Athenian&#34; comes with a thin crust, olive oil, herbs, chicken, garlic, olives, onion, peppers, feta, mozzarella/provolone blend, fresh basil, and sun dried tomato puree.

The &#34;High Five&#34; is their version of an all meat pie, on a pan crust, with marinara, pepperoni, Italian sausage, bacon, ham, and a cheddar, mozz, provolone blend.

The &#34;assembly line&#34; is fast and furious, as is the oven time.  At the end, they will ask you &#34;for here or to go&#34; and whether you want additional Parmesan or pepper flakes; if you&#39;re eating in, those add-ons are also on the table.  Pie Five has the &#39;magic&#39; coke dispensers, when you can crank out one or a combo of a hundred beverages, and also three kinds of ice tea, as well as some bottled drinks.

The 9 &#34; pizzas were excellent, I preferred the thin crust, bubbly and charred, to the pan personally. High quality and kudos for the processed pork toppings.

.The company has about fifty units open, and are aiming for five hundred, coast to coast.  

Pie Five people?  Great job.  Great pizza."

I ordered a five star (sauce, cheese, sausage, pepperoni, beef, peppers, olives, onions). I asked for the spicy marinara sauce which I highly recommend and some giardineira. My wife had bacon, sausage and spinach on the artisan thin. 

They may have been a little light on toppings for hers, but I didn&#39;t hear her complain. My toppings were plenty. 

The staff was all busy with various tasks which is nice to see even when it isn&#39;t super busy. One was cutting and weighing dough. Another was rolling crusts. One was clearing tables and two were ready to take our orders as soon as we stepped up to the line.

This is the Chicagoland area packed with extraordinary pizza places. This doesnt compare to them. 

I had the classic pan, tuscan mariana mozzarella and ricotta along with red onions and pineapple. 

I asked easy on the sauce. Lady still put too much for my taste. I could have made her redo but was curious what itll end up like. She skimmed on the mozzarella really put it in a measuring cup and it was not even spread out evenly and dumped it on her palm and some cheese fell back into the container while she transferred the cheese on the pizza. 

I asked for ricotta. She Skimmed on that as well. 

Result was alot sauce on edge of crust bottom and no cheese. Crust is not extraordinary. It is not heavy or too airy. Just a food I would not turn down if I am in the right mood for. I just know what to do for next time and be firm on specifications. 

Pizza was ok overall. Not a place to rush and gush about. 

Turtle brownie with pop bundle cost was 9.99.

One of my pet peeves is added cinnamon to chocolate desserts and it overpowering taste over every other ingredients and not saying anything about it. I do love cinnamon but not when carmel, other toppings are added to the mix. It is just disgusting and insulting missing point of a sweet dessert to enchance the chocolate with cinnamon fails in this case with excessive useage. And even can tell it was a cheap cinnamon that was used."

The pizza. So many options first off. It is like this place was made for picky eaters. I got the standard crust, and it was a mix between pan and thin.

At first, I was thinking it was just another pizza place, but quickly learned it is different in the fact that you get to create your own pizza and it is cooked very quickly. It is basically a fast casual style pizza place. Makes you think, why hasn&#39;t this been done sooner?

I went there for lunch on a weekday. The establishment looked pretty nice and it was well staffed and fairly busy. I took a look at the menu and was able to order pretty much right away.  I went with a pan style crust and picked out the ingredients. Wait time for it to cook was very quick! I would say it was ready to go in under 5 minutes as the name suggests!

So how was the pizza? Overall it was pretty good. The ingredients were fresh and overall it had a good taste. I figured I would be full after eating about 1/2 of it especially with the thicker crust, but I was able to eat the whole thing no problem.  

I would definitely go back again and try other options like a different crust and maybe a different sauce and ingredients. Overall I recommend it if you are in the mood for pizza and looking for a fast casual restaurant for a good meal."

Went in Sunday night, they have only been open a couple of days.  VERY well staffed (I hope they don&#39;t go out of business due to wages), and everybody had the right attitude.  The guy behind the counter at the beginning either was somebody from another store or a super-quick study:  he confidently took the order and did a good job putting together the Farmer&#39;s Market pie for my wife and the Buffalo Chicken pie for me.  Crusts were reasonably circular, topping distribution was excellent, and the pies did, in fact, pop out in a couple of minutes cooked.  Pricing for the &#34;deal&#34; is good (includes salad, dessert, and a &#34;fountain beverage&#34;), price for just the pie maybe a hair high... but then again, you get exactly what you want without waiting or haggling with people you are with for who likes what.

So, how does it taste?  Well, I&#39;m eating my leftovers now, so good enough to do that.  More seriously, it exceeded our expectations... it&#39;s good thin crust, so long as you like your crust very thin, and the toppings and sauce came together well.  My wife said it would be a 3.5 for her if it took awhile, so once you count the quick turnaround time in it becomes a 4.  I can&#39;t review salad or dessert, we just got the pies.

So far as the negative reviews are concerned, I fully expect them to be swamped by good reviews in short order - seems like the concept is sound, the staff is good (definitely a better open than the the next-door Jersey Mike&#39;s was shortly after opening), the food is good, and the pricing isn&#39;t bad.  We are definitely going to give these guys more of our business."

The pizza was cold (I had the pan pizza)...and the toppings weren&#39;t all that good. If they had a better pizza sauce it would have been golden. The other downside is that the entire place smelled like a fart. I don&#39;t know if it was a customer, the food or a bathroom issue, but it ruined the entire experience. I won&#39;t likely be back again."

However, there was a bigger problem this time. 

I ordered the high five, which is their meat lover&#39;s. 8 people came in behind me, so the manager cut in and took over my pizza from the regular girl at the topping station. 

I get home, and my sister steals a slice. She goes, &#34;Why are there all these different kinds of olives on your pizza? There&#39;s so much vegetable on this and little meat. Did you start a diet?&#34; Hah, yeah right.

So anyway, Pie Five, I know there are a lot of toppings, but don&#39;t make them unless you make them right. I want what I order, and not something I don&#39;t like."

Yes, your pizza is ready in 5 minutes because it is nuked by some high heat oven but the taste? Hmm, not sure about it. Kind of like me putting some cheese on a tortilla and microwaving it for 3 minutes. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I will take it if it&#39;s free but why wouldn&#39;t you just order a real pizza made in a brick oven and pay slightly more for a much bigger pie? I guess, the only benefit of this place is the speed. Again, I don&#39;t get the concept, sorry."

The menu of pre-created pizzas sounds good. If only the finished product came out remotely like the pictures or description. The pizza crust was not properly docked ( pricked with a fork to prevent excessive bubbling). Half the pizza was missing almost all of the toppings and the crust was evenly burnt throughout and inedible.
There were at least 6 high school girls working behind the counter who were more interested in socializing than trying to make a good pizza. I have nothing against high school kids, I just don&#39;t want to eat in a high school cafeteria at this point in my life."

But, I have gone a couple times here and am consistently disappointed.  The pizza is never hot in the middle, you practically have to beg to get enough cheese to cover the bottom part of the crust, and the toppings are used so sparingly it is disappointing. Also, for what you get, it is overpriced."

Went in right after they opened. I came in hungry and left hungry. :(
It was me, my wife, and daughter. There are a lot of good pizza places in the Chicago area. And unfortunately Pie Five is not one of the better ones. The pan crust was not good and was undercooked. I was thinking, &#34;Wow! They just opened and this is what they are going with? Good luck!&#34;. 
My daughters thin crust was just as bad. There was an &#34;off&#34; taste to it. My 3 year old could eat pizza 24/7 if allowed. I have never seen her turn her nose up at a pizza before.
I have heard comparisons of this being the Chipotle of pizza. That is funny. So is Subway the Chipotle of sandwiches then? Chipotle has a much higher standard to their food.
We got salads with our meal which were in a little pizza crust shell. The bowl, while edible, wasn&#39;t very good. 
All together we spent about $30 bucks. It is something I will complain about for awhile. If you are Chicago, and have $30 to spend on Pizza, there are 100 better choices.
The thing this place has going for it (which I still think is cool) is the customized pizza and the fact it takes 5 minutes. It&#39;s 5 minutes because corners are cut. True delicious pizza takes some time and some love. This is as pizza as the pizza lunchables.
2 stars because I might have had a bad experience. I still think it is a good concept if it gets done right. Maybe it&#39;s a hiccup from grand opening."

That being said, I love that they use NO MSG in their food.  Some menu choices are definitely better than others...and by &#39;better&#39; I mean slightly above average.  Owner is very friendly and deliveries are prompt (nice delivery guy too).  It&#39;s mandarin style Chinese eats..

What I do not order: (but would have, had they been good)..
Steamed dumplings.  Disappointing.  

What I do order and find to be OK &#39;edibles&#39;: 
Combo fried rice (lighter flavor, not much meat, but you do get a good amount of rice, heehee), Chicken lo mein (tasty with good veggies, but they use spaghetti noodles &amp; shouldn&#39;t) Crab Rangoon (also tasty but skimpy on filling), Egg roll (not bad, but like more fresh veggies and less peanut taste),  Szechwan spicy shrimp (decent, not spicy enough for me but that&#39;s ok...shrimp are not your fancy jumbo kind), Moo shu chicken (pretty good - average amount of chicken, lots of thinly sliced tender cabbage, fresh mushrooms, bean sprouts &amp; scrambled egg), Won ton soup (hits the spot on a chilly night).

In a nutshell - the dishes I order are pretty okay.   Meat (chicken or beef) tastes fresh &amp; tender.  Veggie&#39;s are always fresh &amp; not overcooked.  Sometimes I enjoy it more than other times.  Prices are on the low end , portions are sizable.  Establishment looks clean.  More of a take-out &amp; delivery place as there&#39;s no tables to eat.  I will continue to order from here whenever I need delivery."

At 1:20 we call for status since it had not arrived yet

Food finally shows up around 1:40, meaning they forgot about it until we called back

We were all starving at this point so the arrival of the food was exciting.....then we took our first bite

Egg rolls were burnt (what Chinese Restaurant doesn&#39;t know how to make an egg roll)

Our fried rice tasted burnt

Chicken tasted like cleaning products

Crab Rangoon was half way decent, maybe a bit dry/over cooked 

Gave us the wrong soup

We all threw our lunches in the garbage. No one really ate much. $49 down the drain. 

Panda Express is 1000 times better than this place and Panda Express is a dump

Really bad food, horrible delivery time. 

My suggestion, cook every meal like you are serving a first time customer, which we all were. And now none of us will ever eat there again. Nor will we ever recommend this place to anyone we know. 

Good work cook."

I recently moved to addison from so cal, and i had yet to find a resturant with good orange chicken and fried rice. I has driven bt this place day after day since its on my way home. I had tried stopping by once before but it was a monday afternoon and they apparently close. I stopped in today and ordered the dinner special, it comes with fried/white rice, one entree, choice of wonton/hot&amp;sour/one more choice but i forgot of soup, an eggroll and a fortune cookie. The price is almost set at 6.99 but there are a few choices that bump the price up a little bit.
I chose the orange chicken with fried rice and my brother chose broccoli and chicken with steamed rice, both with wonton soup. It took quite a bit of wait, but i dont mind, that just means it was being made fresh. As i waited for the food the place started getting packed, indicating to me a great go to spot. I got my food and went home..i opened the container to see a mountain of orange chicken and chicken fried rice. I have to say it was by far one of the best orange chicken ive ever had, it was soaked in sauce, yet still crispy. The sauce had orange zest in it which gave it a nice touch. My brothers brocolli was perfect, it was tender yet a bit crunchy. And the chicken was seasoned perfectly. 
There was definately a lot of food for the price..i couldnt even finish the whole thing, i left about a third of the orange chicken for later. This ks definately my new place for asian cuisine! Two thumbs up."

What I got was terrible and often violent digestive issues over the next two days.  The soup was standard, but when I started eating the main entree, it had a bitter taste to it.. I really think they used a cleanser on the cooking wok and didn&#39;t rinse properly.  Ever accidentally taste cleanser?  That&#39;s what I tasted and a few tastes at that.  Threw it away, and tried the eggrolls.  The wrapping was crispy, but the filling was soggy and looked like those Yu-Shan eggrolls you get at the store and plop in the micro when you&#39;re stoned or drunk and hungry (you can&#39;t be sober that&#39;s for sure).

On one side, you have fresh and healthy eateries, such as Friendship.

On the other side, you have cheap and fast holes-in-the-wall like Good Luck Chop Suey.

New China strikes a wonderful balance, using no MSG and quality ingredients, but keeping things quick and cheap. I ordered Mongolian beef and actually saw the cook mixing it up in a skillet.

The lunch specials run every day from 11 a.m to 3 p.m. and include your choice of fried or steamed rice, soup or drink, and fortune cookie. My entire meal cost $5.50.

The fried rice was firm and not swimming in grease. The beef was tender and tasty, and the green onions were fresh and flavorful.

The restaurant itself is tiny. I recommend carrout or delivery. Delivery requires a minimum order of $8 and costs $2-$2.50, depending on where you need it delivered."

The 1st couple of trips to Countyline were underwhelming. It seems that it took some time before everyone was trained up and knew what to expect. The last few trips have been great though.

The beer menu is certainly a highlight. They have a number of options and a variety of craft beers. 

I typically order the Big Ale Prime Burger when I go here, but I have also tried several other items (Cedar Planked Salmon, Fried Wonton Trio, Roasted Beet Salad, Cajun Mac &amp; Cheese) and all have been good. I wasn&#39;t impressed by the Bangers &amp; Mash when I ordered it. 

I love the Fried Brussels Sprouts as a side dish (I prefer mine without any sauce). What meal would be complete without dessert? I really like the White Chocolate, Apricot Bread Pudding. I am the only person in the family that likes it though, so we always end up ordering the Tollhouse Pie which is also great. 

I am disappointed that they discontinued the Sunday brunch buffet, but otherwise I recommend checking out Countyline."

They have a nice selection of Beers, Wines, and Mixed drinks, all very good. While I did not have a &#34;dinner&#34;, I had BEER AND CHEESE FONDUE
Cheddar and Smoked Gouda, Ale Asylum Madtown Nut
Brown Ale, Smoked Salsa Verde, House-Made Chips $8
The home made chips were excellent as was the Verde and Cheese combination. I also tasted the Calamari which was very good also. My main problem was the main course for me. For Dinner I tried COUNTYLINE GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD
Grilled Chicken Breast, Field Greens, Sautéed Apples,
Gorgonzola Cheese, Candied Walnuts, Cider Vinaigrette
Dressing $14.

I don&#39;t mind paying for a GOOD dinner salad, but for $14 it better be freekin awesome. This I harken to say is a best suited for a restaurant that would offer it for $7-$9.  If I get a salad the greens must be COLD and CRISP,( I note exception to Red Leaf and a few others). This was warm and wilty, and had some greens that had turned black. The Dressing was not cold either and was way over used contributing to the lifelessness of the greens. The Walnuts and Gorgonzola  were very good and plentiful, alas, but not so with the apples with pieces so small you need a magnifier just to see it. 

The dishs I did not taste but looked good and would probably be my choice(s) if I was to try this place again. were, SHRIMP &amp; SPINACH AGLIO OLIO
Shrimp, Spinach, Olive Oil, Garlic, Tomatoes, Feta Cheese
Pine Nuts $15/19  or the 
BANGERS &amp; MASH
Housemade Lincolnshire Sausages, Mashed Potatoes,
Caramelized Onions, Ale Asylum Gravy $17. 

Otherwise, I simply look at this place as a nice place to sit out and have drinks and appetizers or desert, but maybe a second chance would be worth it. I just don&#39;t know, how you can screw up a salad and get most anything else right. Time will tell. :-)"

Unfortunately, their happy hour is only from 3-6pm. We sat down at the bar a little before 6pm so we we all ordered burgers with fries or chips. The burgers came out perfectly cooked as we had requested. Maybe it was because I had gone to Sullivan&#39;s a few weeks before and I was hoping for the same burst of amazing flavor but it just didn&#39;t compare to the burger at Sullivan&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t bad by any means but just not as good.

The bartender was really helpful and made great drinks for us. She even let us order an app off the happy hour menu even after 6pm. I really enjoyed the decor of the restaurant. It was like an upscale cabin with a home-y feel to it. I would definitely recommend this place for happy hour with your co-workers/friends, a nice dinner date, or a family night."

This place is great for a date night or group of friends. Attentive and quick staff, great ambiance and fun music. Extensive beer, wine and cocktail/spirits list. Started with a house salad with their house balsamic, dressing was so good, not too sour. Fresh and hot bread also served immediately. Then fish and chips- crispy batter, perfectly cooked fish with fresh tartar and tasty slaw. Crisp, thin fries. Finished with a cocktail and the chocolate flan cake- delicious, moist and authentic flavor. Will be back! Looking forward to some of their weekday specials with friends."

The place is very clean and big. They&#39;ve plenty of chairs if there&#39;s a wait. 

I&#39;ve been here plently of times and I&#39;ve tried the Cajun Mac n Cheese, Smoked Salmon Reuben Sandwich, Cheddar aged soup, Pork Belly BLT, and Turkey Burger. All the food has been amazing and cooked perfectly. Everyone loves the Pork BLT though and the Cajun Mac n Cheese. Must haves when coming there. I will be trying the black bean burger tonight. Everyone is saying it&#39;s amazing. 

Their beer/bourbon/whiskey/rye/cocktails selection is amazing. They&#39;ve many well known companies to choose from. The servers/bartenders are really nice here and are very knowledgeable of the menu. 

Also, they&#39;ve happy hour from 4-6 everyday! Not too many bars have happy hour during the weekend. 

They also have a good lineup for Sunday brunch at $25 per person. I would like to try it out sometime."

Enjoyed a Nitro Chocolate Coffee stout. Glad to see the nitro offering on tap - I think the nitro beers go better with food in general. The had a wrapped date appetizer that was pretty good - I&#39;ve had better, but this was worth the try. Cajun macaroni sounded a little different and it was - a pleasant entrée from the ordinary!

Went back with a smaller group a few months later.  The food was good, I got the special tacos with a side salad on the side.  I&#39;m gluten free and they are sensitive about certain and other things not so much.  For instance they will not give me salad dressing because of cross contamination but other things they don&#39;t care about cross contamination.  Bottomline I do not get sick when eating there so it will be a good place to go when I&#39;m in BG.

The special tacos were really good.  I think they should just make a taco section on there menu and if they did that id go all the time as I love unique tacos.  So I upgraded my review by 2 stars 

Last review:
Went there with a party of 8 people and the service was really bad however I thought the food was pretty good.  

Here&#39;s why I gave them a generous 2 stars.
1. They are in the suburbs and expectations are low
2. It&#39;s not a chain restaurant
3. The food was upscale bar food
4. They have a gluten friendly menu

Now the service, clearly they were under staffed and as a result lunch took 2 hours, which is insane!  I had to physically get up to get water because our waiter disappeared for 20 minutes.  He was very nice person but either he sucked as a waiter or the restaurant was understaffed.

The ambiance was pretty cool, exposed brick, TV&#39;s throughout.  Would be a good place to watch a Blackhawks game.

In regards to the food, I had the smoked chicken wings which were good!  I also had the hummus and Mediterranean salad and both those were okay.  Everyone else said there food was good not great, like I said, better than bar food but not amazing. 

If the service was better, I would give them 4 stars.  I would go back if I was in the neighborhood for the wings and try some other things.  But I would not make a special trip to them.  It was okay."

First of all, there is a ton of seating both indoor and outside. The bar area is ample as well. Their drinks are great, I got &#34;Twisted Ballini&#34; which was amazing. They have a variety of food options. There are small plates (like appetizers) that you can just share the whole night. Or full plate meals such as salmon, &#34;the best grilled cheese ever&#34;, bangers and mash, and so on. All the food was well cooked and came out quickly. 

We had their small plates - Calamari, Chicken Wings and Chicken Tostadas. All were very yummy, mild spiceness.

I would definitely recommend coming here for a casual Friday night or Saturday night."

There are fireplaces and large leather chairs and ottomans to relax, which we were able to do after our meal was done.  As the middle is a large horseshoe bar that is well-stocked, we got seated in one of the bright side rooms named after the nearby counties.  

There is a wide variety on the menu from appetizers and main plates along with their charcuterie.  I went with the salmon reuben which was well seasoned and on marble rye toast but they have shoestring fries which were quite inconsistent from crunchy to flabby.  A lot of places like this have multiple burgers but they are quite limited here and are not considered their standout.  The kids&#39; menu is quite strong as my friend&#39;s daughter had salmon while their son had the chicken tenders.  Service was very attentive and not intrusive.  Overall, a place I would return for the environment and to enjoy a nice lunch and some small plates."

The inside of this place is quite nice looking. A bar area when you first come in with some hi-top tables and then there are some side rooms of tables. Interesting  menu. All sort of different items. Cannot really call it a specific cuisine since the menu items vary all over the globe. I guess that gastro pub would be the closest description.

Ordered the fish and chips, and also their corned beef sandwich. Both were pretty good.
The fish was cooked just right and was not greasy. I do not like greasy. I did like the fish. The accompanying French fries were OK. I&#39;m not a big French fry person but they tasted pretty good to me.

Service was efficient and friendly.

Now here is what I did not like and it has an impact on how I rate. The prices.They were unnecessarily high. $17 for fish and chips?? At lunch?? I think that they are about $5 too high. Prices that are up there can affect your business as in making it or breaking it. I hope they make the necessary adjustment or they may have a hard go of it which would be a shame for such a nice looking place with an interesting menu.

Cheers to All"

The atmosphere was super comfortable and relaxing with the fireplace and couches and wood smell. 

Definitely sit down for a drink before dinner! 

However, my complaint that set the tone for dinner was the extremely pushy server that kept asking if we wanted another drink, a salad, a soup, anything extra, dessert, coffee, cappuccino... And not just asking the table, but asking each person in my party repeatedly. Felt like we were speaking to a salesperson.

We came for an early dinner with some friends around 5ish and I was surprised that their &#39;green house&#39; area overlooking the outdoors was so packed but we were able to get a nice table not in anyones way. I went on the website prior and was super excited to see their happy hour menu that was available everyday of the week. Upon sitting, I asked them about it and they said &#34;It doesn&#39;t include any cocktails and you have to sit at the bar.&#34; That&#39;s annoying. Why advertise something and say nothing online that you have to sit at the bar. And you can&#39;t even sit at a table near the bar, you have to literally sit at the bar. And if that is the case, you would think that the bar cocktails and drinks would be included. But nope, just a few appetizers and entrees. That&#39;s annoying. 

I thought the menu prices were decent a little pricier than I would have liked but the food was overall good. We started with the calamari appetizer which was tasty, a little too much cheese on some parts, but overall good. Then we got the burger to share with the french fries as well as the cajun mac and cheese. Didn&#39;t love the mac and cheese and thought $14 was a little pricy for the small portion since it was mostly noodles and not the other stuff they advertised. I did love the burger and french fries especially with their honey mustard dipping sauce. I would come back just for that. We shared that but kind of wished that I got that for my entree since I loved the fries. They get their stars just for the burger and fries. The service could have been better as I felt like I was trying to get the attention of our server a few times which shouldn&#39;t have been the case and I was annoyed with their unclear happy hour terms that I think they should edit on their website.

I may still be back and sit at the bar bar if I&#39;m just wanting a glass of wine and a good burger."

The space is nice, but not quite as &#34;blow me away&#34; nice as I had hoped. I would almost call it &#34;non-descript/modern&#34;. 

We started with their Cheesy Devils On Horseback appetizer (bacon-wrapped dates, essentially) and they were good.

For entrees, I had their hamburger. This was a good half-pound, greasy burger...but, as is too often the case, came with lame fries (like potato sticks). Why can&#39;t restaurants get this right? Serve good, fresh-cut fries with a good burger and you&#39;ll never disappoint. Ever.

My wife had the Shrimp &amp; Spinach Aglio Oglio and &#34;Houston, we have a problem&#34;. Some/most of the shrimp were raw. While she said the dish was good, overall, serving potentially raw shrimp is not. 

For dessert, we had the Chocolate Flan Cake. It was a big piece that came with a big dollop of whipped cream alongside. Quite good, but adding a mint leaf or strawberry slices would give it more flavor and a bit of a visual pop on the plate.

They have an interesting beer menu, too.

We&#39;re willing to overlook the shrimp &#34;issue&#34; and return to try other dishes."

Entrees were roasted chicken thighs in a caramelized onions and mushroom gravy, talipia gumbo ( tender and delish) pork loin and pasta. All for $25 per person coffee included. (Bloody are $5 and Mimosas are $6) very excited to have this so close to home. Get on over and check this place out!"

However the food is just simply average.  You would expect a lot more given the high prices but I guess they are trying to pay for all the nice upgrades they have done to the place.  They basically earned 3 stars for the nicely remodeled inside and how clean the place is. Other than that it&#39;s a nice place to hang out and drink but just be prepared to shell out the money for an average meal.

There is no better restaurant in town, and I say this with strong credibility as I have been in the industry for years.  This place has a solid menu with unique options and FINALLY an eatery in these burbs with charcuterie!  I would&#39;ve been satisfied with just that but we continued to order food for over 3 hours and there were only empty plates at the end of the night.

The drink list is extensive and their craft beer options are actually interesting and well chosen.  When I go to restaurants and the only &#34;craft beers&#34; listed are from Lagunitas or Goose Island, I am vastly unimpressed.  County Line had a wealth of options from local and non-local alike along with descriptions and even Ratebeer scores where applicable.  Well done!

I am so happy this is no longer the same old blah blah boring &#34;if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it&#34; establishment.  Prices are reasonable for the quality and the decor is warm and inviting.  For the people who think this place was over priced I would say you are probably more accustomed to eating at chain restaurants with $14.99 3-4 course meal specials - and with Outback being right next door, you should keep going there and stay out of my way.  For four people who had 12 drinks, 3 apps, 4 entrees and 2 desserts $238 + tip was a steal!  Especially for the quality and quantity.  My only negative critiques would be the following:

1) The staff needs to explain the different offerings on the charcuterie, cheese, and smoked fish boards.  Coming from that sort of background it was easy for me to decipher what was in front of me but most people would be at a loss.  BTW, the Bourbon Cherry Duck Terrine was awesome!

2) The staff should be better educated about basic restaurant information, i.e. when i asked about the hours of operation, our server had to go and ask someone.  That&#39;s 101 stuff.

Other than that I was pleased with our experience and I will definitely be back.  It was also nice to see at least 3 different tables filled with people I knew.

I would recommend County Line Tavern to anyone and everyone.  An absolute welcome addition to the Northwest Burbs!"

Tried a couple of beers from the big selection. They weren&#39;t crazy expensive like some places. I had the beet salad and the turkey burger. Nothing I&#39;d change.

The beer selection was really good.   There are about 40 beers on tap.  More in bottles.  We were happy with every item we ordered.  From the appetizers (calamari, chicken wings and chicken skewers) to entrees (fish and chips, short ribs over pasta, pork belly BLT and all American burger) and the desserts (cheese cake and ginger snap crumble).

The prices were fair and the service was very good.  We&#39;ll definitely go back.

In some ways, I would consider Townline tavern a beer equivalent to Cooper&#39;s Hawk.  Similar prices and good food."

I tried the honey mustard chicken sandwich. nothing special, kind of plain, and the brioche bun wasn&#39;t that tasty. we also thought they could have built a few more tv&#39;s in the bar area for sports fans. we won&#39;t be going back any time soon."

Beautifully renovated, neighborhood casual spot. This will be in our regular rotation for dinner. Food is good. Service is solid and will improve as everyone gets in the groove. New owners are very open to constructive comments and have already made tweaks. As to food - we&#39;ve tried the burgers (excellent), the fried calamari (excellent), the mussels (which is a small plate and which I had as my entree) (also excellent), and the S&#39;mores dessert (too sweet for me but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a winner). You can charge your phone or iPad at the bar (for every 2 seats there is an outlet) and purse hangers under the bar - which I love. A couple of familiar faces from the former Winberie&#39;s (Rachel ain&#39;t coming back) and on-site managers who are running a tight ship.

I like both their food and drink menus which offers a good variety to fit any dinning mood.  The service was great.  Our waitress was always checking in with us, and what I presume to be managers were regularly walking the floor.  The food was good, but across the board it was under seasoned.  We started with the calamari and fried chicken tostada.The calamari was cooked right and the chicken was very juicy.  For main course I did the Italian burger and my boyfriend had a cheeseburger.  Both were cooked perfectly and the fries and chips were good.  If they just kick up the seasoning on the food, this could be a great regular spot. I&#39;ll give it a couple more weeks and be back in again."

It was awful. In fact, I didn&#39;t taste anything else. There was also a small piece of bone in it that I picked out of my mouth. This was the worst burger I have ever been served. The cole slaw tastes below average as well. 

The kitchen served an entree to the most important person in our party of 10 15 min after all of the rest of us... We were not happy about that.  

Our server, while nice, was clearly new to waiting tables and appeared very lost. Disappeared for a long time in the middle of our meal. Brought us one appetizer when we ordered two. Same with the bread. We had to repeat things a lot. We want one plate per end of the table. It&#39;s troublesome to pass around a plate with 10 hungry people... 

Tried several appetizers and desserts, which were good. 

We were there 50 min before our order for entrees was taken.  

The interior design is nice, but this restaurant overall has weak food and service, and at its price point is just not worth visiting."

Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience.  My husband ordered a burger that he had to send back twice and finally just said to take it off the bill.  It was so bloody that the bread was soaking red.  Ugh. I had the grilled cheese that was not even warm inside.  The menu is way too all over the place and extremely overpriced.  I mean $16 for a burger!!! 

I will say that the place looks great.  The decor and bar are amazing.  Our drinks were really good.  And the selection of beers is great.  I will recommend this place but only for drinks.  I think that is what the should stick to."

I went with a group of people and we all ordered different things. One thing that was ordered was the fish and chips that was very doughy and undercooked.The fish was good though. The next thing ordered was the Italian burger. It was dry and tasteless. And then I had the &#34;Best damn grilled cheese ever&#34;. The reason I use the quotes is because that&#39;s what it&#39;s called but it is definitely not the best damn grilled cheese I have ever had. They used cold tomatoes which made the cheese not melt and it was very watery and cold. The bacon was overcooked and hard. The next thing ordered was the Ale burger. The friend that had that said it was very good. We did all order French onion soup and that was very delicious. Their drink menu is great and I suggest going to Countyline Tavern just for the drinks.  Their beer selection is great and their cocktail menu is very good and sophisticated."

I felt that the prices were still kind of high for a small plate.  We ordered the polenta fries, chicken skewers, and the fried chicken tostada.  We loved the polenta fries definitely the favorite - I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the &#34;sauce&#34; it should have said Harissa aioli  not sauce IMO - I could taste the mayo and I am just not a big mayo fan.  The chicken skewers were good, I liked the sauce it was just weird to have skin on the chicken for a skewer so it tasted fatty and I was looking for something lighter, my mom didn&#39;t like the sauce it came in.  The tostada, the fried chicken is in a beer batter and when I looked at it I thought it was fish and after tasting it I think it should have been. All the accompaniments tasted like fish tacos.  On the menu it says that there is avocado on it - it is more of a guacamole there were tomatoes and onions mixed with the avocado - I asked for the pico de gallo on the side because I don&#39;t like raw tomato and onion so I had to scrape the &#34;guacamole&#34; off, easier said then done.  The tostada part was really soggy in the middle and I am not sure if that was from the guac or it was sitting a bit, the skewers were taking longer then the rest of it so the waiter came out to ask if we wanted to wait for them to be done, we declined just said bring it out when ready.  The pico that I asked for on the side ended up just being chopped up tomatoes so not sure what happened there.  Overall it was decent my biggest critique would be to cut the portion sizes in half along with the prices for them and I would have been much happier.  Not sure if I will be back due to the pricing.  I typically like to stay under $10 per plate for my meals and there were only one or two things that were under that but not something that I would order."

     The building is beautifully decorated, both inside and out.  The parking lot is accessible just north of Lake Cook Rd., with the entrance away from the main drag in hopes to avoid any traffic congestion along an already-busy road.
     Other than the attractive entrance just inside the doors, the rooms of the restaurant haven&#39;t changed much from the previous restaurant that was there.  We were put in the semi-private room to the right, so we could watch the Cubs playoff game (game 3) on the flatscreen (the restaurant isn&#39;t intended to be a sports bar, but we noticed a few TVs and a lot of guests watching right along with us).
     We started with a few appetizers for our group of 11- TAVERN NACHOS (a small order of potato chips topped with melted cheese, scallions and a few small bits of bacon), SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS (approx. 10 wings coated in a chipotle honey glaze) and CHEESY DEVILS ON HORSEBACK (a small order of Medjool dates stuffed w/ Gorgonzola cheese and wrapped in bacon).  The &#34;nachos&#34; were good, but the cheese was really the only topping present, the wings were just okay, but not worth the $12 price tag, and the dates were surprisingly tasty.
     The restaurant has a large selection of craft beers, wine, and other alcoholic beverages.  The soda is limited to a couple of standards (Coke, Diet Coke and one other), but you can get some of Sprecher&#39;s sodas (Root Beer, Cream Soda, etc.) in bottles.
     For meals, most of our party chose to split entrees/sandwiches so we could all taste a variety of dishes.  We had: the CAESAR SALAD with GRILLED CHICKEN, the CAJUN MACARONI &amp; CHEESE, the SHORT RIB &amp; WILD MUSHROOM STROGANOFF, the CHICKEN POT PIE, the BANGERS &amp; MASH, the BIG ALE PRIME BURGER, the BEST DAMN GRILLED CHEESE EVER, the PORK BELLY BLT, and the KIDS PENNE PASTA and KIDS CHICKEN STRIPS.  I&#39;ll comment on only the dishes I tried or those sitting near me tried and commented on.  The Caesar salad was &#34;delicious&#34;, the Mac &amp; Cheese was very good and not overly spicy (we ordered the smaller of the two sizes and still had plenty to share), the Pork Belly BLT was dry and of the four of us who tried it, no one was a fan.  The pretzel bun it was served on was good, but the sandwich itself didn&#39;t have much taste and wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d order again.  The prime burger was, unfortunately, cooked wrong twice (it was overcooked the first time and never served to us, then was remade and came out quite undercooked- our order was for Medium Well).  Only two bites were taken out of that $15 burger.  The Grilled Cheese sandwich should have been good and I have high hopes for that one.  It was extremely spicy with a large jalapeno and spicy sauces (eventually, I had to remove the rest of the pepper, as my lips and mouth were burning a bit too much).  Unfortunately, the cheeses weren&#39;t melted, so the sandwich looked like a slice of bread with two only-warm slices of cheese and the pepper and sauce.  I would love to see the restaurant perfect that sandwich and serve it with melted cheese, the way a great grilled cheese sandwich is served!
     A few people in our party tried dessert; the kids&#39; meals were to be served with an &#34;ice cream treat&#34;, which was a scoop of some sort of berry sorbet.  Neither of the kids liked the taste of it, but their parents did!  The SEASONAL NY STYLE CHEESECAKE was &#34;good&#34;, I&#39;m told (but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s such thing as bad cheesecake anyway!).
     Overall, I think I could become a fan of this restaurant, and I&#39;m hoping to give it a try once it&#39;s been open for some time and gets any kinks out."

I went yesterday for lunch with my two small children and parents. There was no wait - although it did fill up quickly closer to noon. We ordered a few different dishes for the table and we all agreed that everything we tasted was delicious. Some of the highlights were the black bean veggie burger. The chipotle mayo that comes with it is excellent. The trio of a half sandwich, soup, and salad is a very generous portion size. The &#34;best damn grilled cheese&#34; is really delicious due to the smoked poblano pepper in it. The only reason this restaurant didn&#39;t get five stars is because some of the items are priced a bit too high, but the majority of the item prices are right on target. We will definitely be back!"

No backs on the chairs which makes it uncomfortable if you&#39;re sitting at the bar. Food very overpriced. We bought the chicken sandwich which came in a huge bun making the piece of chicken even smaller than it already is. Only craft beer for choices that alone makes my decision to not go there again. Staff was pleasant, but this place clearly overpriced the food, and with very limited to no choices for beer. There are those of us  out there that do not like craft beer, and expect at least a few popular domestic selections you can choose from. Miller Lite- that&#39;s it??"

Great beer selection and like the tasting option, but the service and food was less then desirable. The grilled cheese was not melted and the inside was still cold, the fish and chips was also undercooked and the beer batter was still like dough. If want to eat, don&#39;t go here, but if you want to go somewhere to have some drinks, highly recommended. It&#39;s still a new place, we do not plan on going back I till they figure things out."

Their Sicilian Chicken IS TO DIE FOR!!

Fast forward to the event day- the driver was on time and very helpful. As expected, the food was perfect temperature and just as good as in the restaurant.

I wish I would have taken a picture because I have never in my life seen such sad fries. I mean who doesnt love a good slender deep fried potato soaked in cheesy goodness right? These were more like shriveled leftover peels that had gone to the queso river to die.

The pieces of chicken breast where tender and flavorful the sausage was not spicy but had a good flavor to it and the veggies where still crunchy but cooked. I would of liked to seen a side of pasta served with this dish would of rounded it out. The minestrone soup was also good but the capper for me was all the bread they serve you. When you sit down they put some focaccia pizza bread on the table I drizzled it with olive oil and cheese yummy.

I immediately called the restaurant and while saying I would still pay for the salad- asked to please not be charged the extra for the chicken.  They only offered me a &#34;credit&#34; under my phone number for the next time I order (which I thanked her for but in retrospect- I&#39;m never going to order from them again b/c of the customer service).  
The woman on the phone made the comment &#34;the girl who packed up your order said it didn&#39;t look Too bad&#34;.  Well, I have pictures of it to prove otherwise- not very good customer service to tell the customer they&#39;re wrong if you haven&#39;t seen it yourself.

Seeing that we are always up for trying new pizza we decided to venture out on a rainy Friday night. I was pleasantly surprised by the inside of this restaurant, it had that comfortable atmosphere that had you inside but convinced you were in a courtyard. We came for pizza but decided to try a few things to see what else they had to offer. 
First we had some of the focaccia bread they had to offer and I could have made a meal out of that and a bottle of wine! 
We started out with stuffed mushrooms, out of the norm for us, and both found them to be above average. Simply stuffed with sausage and drizzled with oil, they were a hit but not a light app. We then had a pizza and gnocchi in vodka sauce. The gnocchi was as good as you are going to find and the portion was perfect for 2 with some pizza or just for someone alone. The pizza was some of the best we have found in the area, generous (but not too much) of all the toppings and great cheese (even better the next day!) 
What tops the whole experience was the excellent service we got from George. All the regulars seems to like George and we could see why, attentive but not over bearing and extremely pleasant and cheerful. 
I honestly would never have found this place but I am so glad were heard about it and went. We will certainly return and be more adventurous on the menu in that I have no doubt they will be able to execute anything they have to the highest level!"

But taking a chance and going for White Cottage was a gamble that paid off. This is the best stuffed deep dish pizza I have ever had.

Of course, the sauce and the toppings (or stuffings, if you like) had great flavor. The cheese wasn&#39;t overbearing over extremely chewy. But what made the pizza amazing for me was the crust. Unlike other deep dish pizzas, this one had a very soft, bakery-like crust which was tasty, and tasted like it had a slight hint of butter. Usually with deep dish pizzas the crust is cast off to the side. Not with this pizza, the crust helped make it a complete pizza.

The only issue that I had with the pizza, as well as my beef with Giordano&#39;s, is that the &#34;toppings&#34; seemed a little skimpy. If you are looking for a Lou or Gino&#39;s East amount of sausage, you aren&#39;t going to get it. In hindsight, I would have scrapped the pepperoni and added extra sausage. That is, and always will be, a downside to a traditional Chicago stuffed pizza.

Still, it was absolutely amazing and has restored my faith in stuffed deep dish pizzas!"

I just started to convince my co-workers that they like bacon on their pizza (as that is my favorite) and White Cottage does that up right, too.  Their delivery times are accurate (even a little early sometimes) and their employees are pretty nice.

i&#39;ve had most items off their menu over the last 4-5 years and with a few exceptions I&#39;ve enjoyed them all.  i will say i&#39;m not a fan of the calamari &amp; some of their other appetizers because they either undercook or overcook  some of them, and they drown their sandwiches with sauce...  which makes the bread soggy &amp; picking it up and eating it almost impossible and a fork &amp; knife has to be used... but for pizza &amp; pasta... 5 stars across the board

the big downside to this place... and why i&#39;m not giving them 4/5 stars is they are pretty expensive for a pizza place...  also they don&#39;t deliver a &#34;small&#34; pizza, so when I&#39;m alone and in the mood for their pizza, I&#39;m stuck ordering a medium and eating off it for two days....  which can cost $25+ with a couple soda&#39;s and a tip... if it wasn&#39;t for those two issues I&#39;d probably order from them exclusively... but the money i have to put out to have their pizza delivered has made me order from another place in the area... the pizza isn&#39;t as good in my opinion but they do deliver a small and i can save $10-ish

I have not even had the opportunity to try the menu in its entirety. The past four times we have attempted to enjoy a meal from this place, the service has been absolutely horrible. two of the visits were in their dining room. The first time, our waitress was not very interested in helping us at all. The wings I ordered were not what I was served but they took so long that I did not send them back because i was starving. We let her know and was not offered a small discount, a free soda...nothing. i don&#39;t expect anything for free but there was no attempt to fix the problem, not even an apology. At he end of the same visit, we ordered the Italian Ice and were told that she doesn&#39;t recommend it because their freezer has been on the fritz and it was not good! Our second visit to their dining room was just as bad. It just seemed that because we went there with a larger group, the gratuity was going to be added and preset according to the bill. This made our waiter just disappear. Our wings came out wrong again and this time they were sent back. Again, no attempt to fix the situation. The next two experiences have been through delivery. We thought that maybe we would just try to eat at home since the pizza we did get to try was good. That was a huge mistake both times. The first time, I ordered 24 traditional breaded wings along with a few other things. I asked for the wing sauce to be on the side along with the bleu cheese dressing. For a 24 piece half pan of wings I was sent a 2oz cup of wing sauce. The delivery took forever so I did not want them to send someone with more wing sauce because everything would have been cold and greasy by the time I got the sauce so i did not want the order. I traveled there myself and returned all of the food. They offered to remake everything but after my two dining experiences there already, I did not want it. I was told that i would be refunded my money to my debit card and have yet to receive the credit.

I yelped &#39;pizza delivery&#39; in Wood Dale, Il and found this lovely gem. I needed some pizzas delivered to my BF&#39;s work as a surprise 5th year anniversary gift for him. There&#39;s no website so I had to call and have a menu faxed over. The man on the phone was very friendly and had the 5 page menu faxed over before I could even walk over to my fax machine- now that&#39;s service! 

The prices are a bit high but I&#39;d heard raving reviews about their pizzas. I settled with a 20&#34; cheese and a 20&#34; buffalo chicken pizza (has buffalo sauce, bleu cheese, bacon, chicken, etc. The cheese pizza was $21 and the buffalo chicken one was $40- yikes! But I knew my meat eating bf would love it. 

I called back to place my order and the young girl that answered the phone was also very friendly. She took my order, answered my questions, allowed me to pay for it over the phone and leave a tip for the driver, along with following through with my special request to write &#34;Happy 5th Anniversary&#34; on the pizza boxes. 

When the pizza arrived to my bf&#39;s work he was totally shocked. In fact, he thought someone was pranking him and he argued with the pizza man that those were not his pizzas and he was not paying for them... the pizza guy then said that they were from his girlfriend. My boyfriend, who had not totally remembered our anniversary (we never really celebrate them), was confused. The driver then says, the pizza boxes say &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; and were paid for by Candice. He then smiles and tells the man he&#39;d be more than happy to take those pizzas off his hands. 

My BF and his work raved about the pizzas and the 20&#34; giant pizzas were more than enough food for his company to have for lunch, take home leftovers for dinner, and lunch the next day. My BF said that everyone agrees White Cottage is the best pizza place around there and the Buffalo Chicken was insane- my Bf said that it would make me want to eat meat again. 

My lovely man was kind enough to bring a piece of the cheese pizza home for me to try and it was quite delicious, even reheated. The only reason I&#39;m not giving them 5 stars right now is because I want to try more than one reheated piece for myself before I give out the 5 sexy stars. 

I will defo be heading to White Cottage soon to get my pizza on and hopefully upgrading to 5 stars."

I am just reviewing the take out / delivery operations of White Cottage today. 

White Cottage has the best pizza around (and I think the freshest ingredients); they even have Italian beef and giardiniera for a topping! I personally love that they have capers (another favorite).  Their thin crust is superb; slightly salty, buttery and crispy. 

Another reason why I love White Cottage: they will give you plenty of freshly grated parmesan and red pepper and even paper plates (delivery) if you ask! 

Why I didn&#39;t give them five stars:  50% of the time the toppings are incorrect on delivery orders. I have come to learn that I will probably get all the correct ingredients but mixed up. For instance: last night we ordered half sausage and onion, half pepperoni and mushroom but we received half sausage and mushroom and half pepperoni and onion. 

Why the incorrect orders don&#39;t bother me too much: It&#39;s delicious."

We keep meaning to try other things on their menu, but we keep going back to the pizza. (And occasionally the cheese-stuffed garlic breadsticks.)

Someday we&#39;ll go inside, sit down and order some asiago gnocchi or a sub or some other delicious-sounding entree from their menu. See if it lives up to expectations.

But for now I can tell you that the pizza is quite good. Taste in pizza is subjective, and I&#39;m not even sure I can tell you what my &#34;perfect&#34; pizza is, but this is really, quite good. Solidly 4-star pizza. Lots of cheese, good sauce, tasty crust. Served hot and ready when they say it will be. What more could you want?

Oh, and the garlic-cheese breadsticks are pure stuffed garlicky greasy deliciousness. Probably bad for us, but since they only come 3 to an order I don&#39;t feel too bad about it.

On a side note, I will say that trying to turn north onto Wood Dale Road from Irving Park can be a giant pain in the butt at rush hour when there is a train... blocks both roads and nobody can go anywhere for 10 minutes and then trying to turn left into White Cottage... alas. The pizza&#39;s still worth it though."

My office used to be located closer to White Cottage so we would order pizzas all the time, the Italian beef being one of the variations. I haven&#39;t had it in a while so we decided to get one the other night.

It is a lot different than your normal pizza. There is Italian beef (naturally), giardiniera, green pepper and onions. If you don&#39;t like spice, this isn&#39;t for you as it can get pretty spicy. I think I had to blow my nose a few times as this completely opened up my sinuses. We got a 14&#34; and it was $20 so not terribly bad. When you order, make sure you mention &#34;italian beef special&#34;. It is listed on their menu as such. We placed the order and just asked for Italian beef assuming we would get the special....had to make some adjustments when we arrived.

The baked clams are ok but they usually get mushy during the delivery and the top of the clams are not baked to a crunch.

The toppings, sauce, cheese, and crust are all great.  This is definitely quality pizza.  As others have said, it&#39;s a bit greasy, but I can live with that.

The reason for the down-ranking is because of the value (or lack thereof).  Maybe I&#39;m spoiled with lesser-quality chain pizzas, where you can usually get two large pies delivered for roughly $25 with a coupon, but every time I order from White Cottage, I seem to be spending $50, even with a 10% off coupon.  Maybe I&#39;m using the wrong coupons, but $50 for two pies is a bit tough to take.  Am I the only one?

Even the plain cheese is fantastic! Something about their special blend of cheese, its just amazing. Buttery, gooey, flavorful, and they always make them piping hot!!

The place is real close and much better than anything else in the area but still not blow your socks off pizza. 

The crust is real good and crispy, good sauce, too much cheese(and the cheese tastes a bit fake). But quality pizza none the less.

If I dont feel like making my own(which is the best) then I can come here once in a while.."

The crust is nice and crispy, the cheese has an excellent flavor and texture, the sauce is just about perfect.  All around it&#39;s just a thing of beauty.  The only thing that keeps it from being the tip-top is that it&#39;s a bit on the greasy side.  Have a paper towel ready to soak some of that up.

The food is good, without necesarily blowing you away.  (Obviously way better than that ubiquitous &#34;Italian&#34; chain which fortunately is nowhere near WD, Bensenville, or Itasca.)

But alas, since I moved, I have found no good reason to return now that I live near Hillside and work in Oak Park, where there are equally good, in fact better options at a much closer distance.

I tried the Portillo Hotdog and the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers. I enjoyed the taste of both items.

Bathroom was clean. Which i hate going to eat places with dirty bathrooms. But it was clean in here.

The only bad thing is we ate in restaurant and we could not find a clean table. I had to clean one off with napkins. While 2 bus boys were in corner chatting. 

One more thing is they do not support the military active or veterans! How disappointing they do not provide a discount for military.

Well, since you asked.... the answer is: &#34;Italian beef.&#34;

Personally, I am not the world&#39;s biggest Italian beef fan, but my husband probably is. Nearly every time we come back to Chicagoland, we order some Italian beef from Portillo&#39;s to bring back with us. You can call ahead (at least 24 hours, I think?) and order several pounds of beef, which comes with gravy and peppers (if desired). The bread can be included, too. It&#39;s the perfect arrangement for us to bring a cooler and fill it with frozen beef instead of shipping it out (expensive) or missing out completely.

Occasionally, we eat here too -- just to get our fix of beef and hot dogs. There&#39;s nothing like this in Kentucky at all. The beef is pretty darn tasty. Juicy hot dogs, delicious fries, gut-busting beef sandwiches, so good.

This location is one of the better locations in the area too. It&#39;s busy, but not ridiculous, and the staff seems to handle crowds well. Clean, spacious, packed with memorabiia, etc. You&#39;re good to go."

I love for Portillo&#39;s continues to grow each visit. Their burgers are always fresh and Italian sausage is amazing. I wish they would not charge for the peppers but their great addition with any Italian sausage. The best though is their cheese fries which are quite addicting.

This is the worse Portillo&#39;s I have ever been to. I should of known from the moment of walking in and seeing it practically empty and food on the floor and not one single person working on cleaning any part of the place that it was not going to be a good experience. After ordering my food i moved to standing to the pick up line where me and my co-worker started talking to another person who was waiting for their order. She mentioned that she had ordered through the drive thru but her order came incomplete and she was waiting for it to be fixed. Finally after some time a manager came with her food to the counter and started questioning her about who brought her the incomplete order and what was missing from it. The manager was very rude in the way he spoke to her, making it seem as though he was blaming the customer for the order being wrong and not apologizing at all. The manager was roughly opening each bag of her order and even put his hand in and was touching her food. Me and my coworker couldnt believe how he was speaking to them and acting. As the lady took her food and walked by us she shaking her head and said she couldnt believe it. As she walked by us the manager rudely said &#34;dont listen to her!&#34; And then he walked away. Of course the lady heard him and turned around to confront him. He ran to a back room like a coward and she ended up speaking to another manager who simple shook his head and shrugged. All this is going on while im waiting for my food. My coworker notices the young employees behind the counter are roughly throwing bags of food around and she asked a young girl working if that was normal, she replied &#34;no, they are just being funny&#34;. Fun throwing paying customers food around? Wow. finally after waiting over ten minutes for a hotdog and onion rings i finally got my order which was cold and looked like a mess. I didnt even bother to say anything to a manger cause clearly it wouldnt have made a difference. I through the food out, wasting $8. And not to mention after being in the place for over 15mins now, that food on the floor that was there when we walked in was still there and no one around cleaning. The managers her clearly dont care about customers or know how to manage employees, the food was cold and sucked. Worse portillos i have ever been to.

Most importantly was the recognition of how important customer service can be.  No matter how good the food is, it can easily be spoiled by a poor experience, but it can quickly be turned around as long as the attention is given and situations are addressed and rectified.

Go across a dangerous parking lot to wait and wait.  Watery drinks by the time the food comes.  Managers dont care.  Its worth a trip to a different Portillos even if it is further away!!  This location just figuring people come back for the name.  It used to be service too.  What a shame.  Original owner would be ashamed of this one!!!

The decor successfully aims for a 1950&#39;s feel, vinyl booths etc. 
There are usually lines for both dine in and drive thru as this place is really really popular. In my opinion the lines are worse in the drive thru during weekend peak dining times, but the difference can be slight.
The ordering is done at a counter and there is no real waiter service. When your order is ready they call it out and you bring it to your table. Alcohol is ordered at a separate window, and the choices are very basic. This is not a place for drinking.
Nothing is really poor here but the strongest menu item are the  polish, the Chicago style, and the Italian beef. the beef comes wit or without cheese and peperoncini. Be careful with the peperoncini  as a little adds wonderful flavor, but too much will overpower the sandwich. It&#39;s difficult to find a better Italian beef anywhere. The onion rings are crisp, and the shakes are cold and oh so sweet. Alas the fries are just average, but the rest of the menu more then makes up for it."

We had a large order and not only after it being reviewed 2 twice they still managed to mess up the order missed several items.  When 2 of my family member&#39;s came into the restaurant to ask for the correct food to be included.  He persisted to poor the food out of the bag and then open it all and complain he had to remake it all.  First off we never told him to do that, we only wanted the extra items we ordered.  He remade the items he poured out and never properly completed our order.( This was known when we came home and looked again to find items still missing.) Before we left based on hearing how my family was treated I went into the restaurant to ask the Manager if he had a problem.  At this point he was now being polite after seeing I was a upper class white male.  My family is mixed.  I asked him for the owners phone number and name to speak with him.  He wrote down a number and a name.  I told him if he was writing down the wrong info I would go even higher in the company to explain how this manger is presenting the company.  If he is treating customers like this, I can only imagine how he is treating those poor employees.  If the owner does see this review please contact me through linked to privately chat.

This time I switched it up from my normal (two jumbo dogs, fries, large lemonade) and went with a full slab of ribs.

First, there was no line at the drive-thru, which should have been a clue. At 12:30pm on a weekday that is not a good sign. Second, my hot dog was not a typical Portillos hot dog. Nowhere close to the one I had last week in Bloomingdale.

What&#39;s up with the nuclear green relish at both locations? It&#39;s nasty and a turn-off.

On every occasion that I&#39;ve set foot in here, there are multiple tables that haven&#39;t been cleaned off, the floor is always filthy and strewn with used napkins and food, and the garbage is filled to the top. Even as I type this review, I can count 6 tables that need to be bussed and the thing is, there aren&#39;t even that many people in here. 

The food quality is also subpar to what I expect from Portillo&#39;s. On this occasion, the bread on my Italian Beef was stale, so it seemed the staff had toasted the roll to the point that the bread was hard, burnt and bitter. Halfway through eating, my sandwich fell apart completely. That has never happened to ANY Italian Beef sandwich I&#39;ve ever had. I also happened to notice a couple standing and waiting for their order for the duration of the time I had my entire meal.

When you order a cheeseburger, an Italian beef and an order of fries without any special requests, the food should flow smoothly out the window and into my car.

So I talked to a VERY nice man on the phone, and we set up 60 hot dogs, cooked, with condiments on the side so everybody would be able to build their own.  Later in the week, I added on ten more to the order with no problem.  

Good thing I did, because they went like hotcakes!  They were a HUGE hit!  The entire spread was well-packaged, was hot, and most importantly, insanely delicious!!  It was ready right at 1:30 as promised, too :)

Where do I even begin with their food, everything is amazing! Of course the italian beef, dipped, with mozzarella and hot peppers is my all time favorite, and this location always does it right (extra dipped).  Their chocolate cake is TO DIE FOR and I have just recently discovered their chicken caesar salads are awesome.  Their caesar dressing makes the whole thing! Of course the chop salad is good as well.

I like the beef and cheddar but I prefer it on Italian Bread with hot peppers. It&#39;s a little more expensive but it&#39;s too greasy and soggy in a Croissant. 

Don&#39;t be afraid to ask: they will cut your sandwich in half! 

For as many times as I&#39;ve dined here and other locations, tonight was the first time I wanted to try their Italian sausage. I liked it well-done with mustartd only. The sausage was full of flavor from their use of spices.

I love their chicken chopped salad and side of bread. It makes me wish this place had a Barnelli&#39;s for more options. I could use a pasta dish to compliment the salad. There would be enough for shaing at dinnertime.

My boyfriend is partial to their char-broiled chicken sandwich. He&#39;ll eat fries when I order them. 

We ordered large cheese fries tonight and that was a dissapointment. I wonder why they don&#39;t offer chili cheese fries on their menu. I&#39;ve never had their chili by itself but I do like to order the chili cheese dog on occasion.

I haven&#39;t figured out why they don&#39;t have buns without poppy seeds. My Nephew won&#39;t eat them and there&#39;s no substitute for someone who likes hot dogs but is allergic to poppy seeds."

I remembered that they put Gorganzola Cheese on their salad and I&#39;m not a fan, but it&#39;s just so yummy with all the real bacon crumbles and noodles and the yummy grilled chicken, I figured I would ask if I could get the salad without the gorgazola, and whaddya know, they can do it! I was beyond excited. I got mozzarella cheese in place of it and it was perfect. It may officially be my favorite salad in the entire world and I eat alot of them. 

I did glance at the receipt when I was back at the office and noticed they charged me $.50 more for the changed cheese and it kinda upset me, but it was whilst I was indulging my salad, so I really didn&#39;t think I had room to complain.

Almost as cheesy as a cheesy beef and the song put together. I have the Super Bowl Shuffle stuck in my head.

I&#39;m not a Chicagoan, but finally tried Portillos. My husband is from the Chicago land area and has told me all about Portillos. Funny thing is, is that he doesn&#39;t even eat meat. I however, love meat and order some whenever I can.

Two trips ago he drove to Portillos and came back with some ribs. They were alright. Maybe it was an off night. My ribs didn&#39;t have a lot of meat on them. The fries were so- so.

I hope to try the famous cheesy beef that I&#39;ve heard others rave about along with some of the other famous beef items. I have driven by on my own and noticed that it&#39;s always packed. So I will try it again."

Typically, I&#39;d expect to wait about 10 minutes for my food after I order, but this time it was out in about 4 minutes. I was shocked and surprised.

Poor Service:
The cashier refused to greet us or talk first even after I asked if she was open for orders.  So I just started ordering anyway. I had a question and wanted to know if they offered a grilled veggie sandwich on facacia like other locations offer through the salad place that is sometimes connected. (I meant Bernetti&#39;s Pasta Bowl, but couldn&#39;t think of the name.)

The cashier immediately acted impatient and condescending.  She held both her hands out to stop me from talking and said &#39;whoa whoa whoa, now your asking me two questions at the same time. Stop and ask one question.&#39;.  She spoke loud, cold, and slowly.  After we got through placing my order, she didn&#39;t review it and just stood there as I read the menu screen myself."

I have been a Portillo&#39;s customer for 50 years and have been going to the Streamwood location since it was built. Great food, great service until......I was wondering if it was going to change and sure enough. I have waited in the drive up line up to 20 minutes for lunch. That is something that never happened before. The food ( except for the hot dogs ) has changed too. I&#39;ve thrown out 3 salads that I ordered there because they were not fresh and tasted bad. I&#39;ve had other friends say the same thing. I never see the familiar faces that once worked there so I&#39;m sure that the staffing changed when Mr. Portillo sold the chain. Streamwood had better get their act together. My husband said that they were taking a survey about the place. Sans the survey and pay to have better management. Then the service, attitude, cleanliness and hopefully quality will improve. Until it does though we aren&#39;t eating there anymore."

I love Portillos because the food is sooo tasty and is perfect for lunch around the Schaumburg area. It really isn&#39;t a fast food place because you still have to wait to get your food with your ticket. The parking lot fills up pretty quickly and cops usually control traffic coming in from Rt.58, thats how great Portillos is! I&#39;ve tried their chocolate cake which is the best chocolate cake ive ever had. Had it once and will have it again, just be aware it is quite rich.

I wind up with a plain hot dog with ketchup on it, or a maxwell street sausage, or a beef sandwhich..etc. They really need to hire people who know how to take orders, and check them before they are given to the customer. Ridiculous.

Portillo&#39;s is a Chicagoland classic for a reason. Their food is flat-out fantastic every time, no matter the location. My top five faves:

1) Charbroiled cheeseburger! It might be sacrilege to favor the burgers over the dogs, but my-oh-my, what a burger it is! Charbroiled to juicy perfection, topped with fresh lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle, I can always count on Portillos to deliver.
2) French fries!! They do it right every time. Hot and crispy with just the right amount of salt, I never pass on the fries.
3) Of course, the dogs! Portillos was built on great hot dogs and they continue to deliver one of the best Chicago dogs around. Chain-restaurant or not, their dogs easily compete with the most famous names in Chicagoland.
4) ummmm ... the first three items are so good, in the 15 years I&#39;ve been visiting Portillos, I&#39;ve never actually ordered anything else. I am covered in shame.
5) See #4."

as usual Portillos you did me right and filled the tummy

Highly recommended for either drive thru fare or sit-down meals, the inside is decorated cute with 60&#39;s theme like an old diner.

The line went real quick inside.  They took the order in line and you just had to pay at the counter, quick...the wait for the food....not as quick, but not awful at all.

The retro music was what it was...made the &#34;older&#34; crowd happy probably, not my cup a tea, but no worries...music is always better then no music I guess.

The food was above average for a fast food place.  Everything was hot and what was expected.  The fries are always solid, you forget they have decent fries.

*Note - Parking will suck on a Saturday afternoon, its by a Chuck E Cheese and they share the front lot.  Just park in the Walmart lot or whatever, dont waste your time looking for a spot there, unless you see one right away.  You&#39;ll thank me...

Their onion rings are great. I&#39;d rather get those over the fries, but for me, that&#39;s true of most establishments.

My orders are ready when promised or even before. I&#39;ve inly had one problem in the past with an order, followed by very poor service from the staff. I spoke to the owner and he was very apologetic and promised to make changes. I&#39;m guessing that meant staff training because I&#39;ve never ever had poor service since

We normally get the pan pizza and an order of Jets bread. Love the Jets bread. I&#39;ve also had the Turbo bread which is tasty but I prefer Jets bread

I&#39;m indifferent on the various crusts that are offered. I&#39;ve had the turbo crust on my pizza and didn&#39;t really think it enhanced the flavor that much. Maybe it is better on the round pizzas. I&#39;ve actually never had a round pizza from here so I can&#39;t say if this is the reason why I&#39;m underwhelmed with the crust

My pepperoni sausage and green pepper pizza seem to be thrown together..as the pictured slice shows no green pepper on one slice and too much on the other

No attention to detail...  I am willing to try again but my first instinct is to stick to Lou&#39;s. For what Jet charges it&#39;s not something I can think of as a deal"

The manager was very apologetic and promised we would have a pizza in 10 mins if we would wait. We were given the pizza at no charge for our trouble. It was a prime example of how to gain customer loyalty by turning a customer&#39;s experience around for the good.

Kudos and thank you to the manager and staff at this location for their much appreciated customer care.

When people at the party commented on the pizza- we told them the location and how much we have enjoyed Jets pizza since way back when they started in the Detroit area.

The employees at this location are very nice and always smile.  Have always gotten our pizza to go as we live just outside their delivery area and it is airless ready when promised even on a Friday night.

So if price doesn&#39;t bother you this is the best pizza in town.  Little Caesars is a good second (for one topping deep deep but they kill you on all the additional ingredients)

Come to Jet&#39;s Pizza if you&#39;re looking for something different.  Although they do have the more traditional round pizza cut into triangular slices, we come here for their square cut pizza.  The square cut pizza is deep dish style, although it is not a traditional deep dish pizza.  The top of the edges of the pizza have a nice crunchy texture from what looks like caramelization.  The cheese is nice and gooey, and they have a wide selection of specialty pizzas.  We&#39;ve tried the Hawaiian and the Chicken Parmesan and have not been disappointed. 

The only thing keeping Jet&#39;s from receiving a full five star rating is the price of the pizza.  For a one topping square cut, it&#39;s already $10.99, and the pizza is not that big (10 slices).  If you want to up it to a specialty pizza, you&#39;re looking at $13.99 or $14.99, depending on what kind you get.

Overall, Jet&#39;s comes highly recommended.  The pizza is delicious, and it comes out fast."

Good pizza, but confused staff. I will have to preface that you need to order the deep dish pizza that is simply delicious. It reminds you of the little ceaser pizza that use to have the burnt cheese surrounding the edge before little ceaser was bought out and became a cheap 5 dollar pizza joint. Jet&#39;s Pizza is no doubt expensive compared to papa john even with coupons. The secret is not to the get the supreme that has like  toppings and just settle with 1 because you end up paying a whole lot more for the same amount of pizza except for the toppings. The flavored crust on the non-deep dish pizza is a bit overrated. My most recent experience was a mixed bag. Somehow the staff was super confused that two people could order pizza with the same name at the same time. They gave me pizza to the guy in front of me who asked why it was so expensive after he paid and walked out. He didn&#39;t realize it was my pizza so they had to toss those in the garbage. I ended up waiting another 20 minutes for my pizza. This clearly was an issue as the next person in paid for another person&#39;s pizza with the same first name and asked afterwards why it was so expensive and they had to the cancel that transaction. With coupons the deep dish is tasty and is better than papa john, but if you like toppings then go to papa johns.

Pro- great deep dish pizza (the burnt cheese edge is amazing)

Con- poor organization, toppings are expensive

Hidden deal-
1. Go online to get coupons
2. Check your local mailer for coupons"

To me, they can do no wrong like another reviewer said. The pizza is to my liking: thick crust (I prefer the turbo crust), lots of cheese, easy on the sauce, and fast delivery. I strongly dislike thin or square-cut pizzas; so if you&#39;re into that, maybe this place isn&#39;t for you. I&#39;m the odd man out; I can&#39;t stand Lou Malnati&#39;s; in fact, I am not a fan of most Chicago pizza (BLASPHEMY!). 

I recommend the turbo &#34;stix&#34;,  jet&#39;s boat, and the medium pizzas. The 8 corner pizzas are great as well, but I prefer crust.

As Chicago natives, we were very skeptical about trying pizza in Michigan, of all places. However, we were very pleasantly surprised! We had gotten the deep-dish (a rectangular shape), and as crust-lovers, fell in love with this pizza. We were SO excited when we found out they had opened restaurants in our area, we thought we&#39;d never have Jet&#39;s again after that short stint in Detroit.

We have been long-time fans of Lou Malnati&#39;s, and still are, but we now like to rotate between Lou&#39;s and Jet&#39;s. If you go here, I HIGHLY recommend ordering the deep dish. The crust is almost like a garlic-bread consistency, it&#39;s buttery, crispy and flaky. The edges also get crispy with the cheese. Yum! Their pizza is ready SUPER fast (usually only 15 minutes until it&#39;s ready to be picked up), and we love that it is a cheaper, but still delicious, option compared to Lou&#39;s.

My family&#39;s favorite is the BBQ Chicken pizza, but we also add pineapple to it."

We tried the thick crust square pizza that boasts a crispy crust for each piece. It hit the spot so good, we live in Elgin but it was totally worth the drive. Definitely decadent and not to be eaten daily! Or not even weekly if you don&#39;t want a heart attack! I appreciate that they do not skimp on the cheese. The pizza sauce is pretty good (mind you I&#39;m the girl that orders pizza with no sauce because I&#39;m so picky with pizza sauce!) this sauce I can definitely live with, a hint of sweetness that isn&#39;t overpowered by tanginess.

The &#34;deep dish&#34; pizza looked strangely like Little Caesars, so I thought I&#39;d compare the two. Sometimes I think I&#39;m really a teenage mutant ninja turtle because I love pizza SO much that I could really just eat it every day.....
 I got the small deep dish pepperoni with garlic crust. It comes with 6 pieces, so it&#39;s enough to feed 2 hungry people. We also got the Jet&#39;s Bread- 10 pcs. The website allows you to choose a sauce to go with it, but when ordering on the phone- they don&#39;t ask. So we received marinara sauce.
Ok so..order aside. The employees at this location were nice. We got it delivered and received it on time.  No problem with the service at all. The pizza however....different story. It really is pretty much identical to Little Caesars..obviously. You can tell just from pictures that they&#39;re the same. The taste is definitely NOT identical. The pizza didn&#39;t wow me..nothing special. I actually prefer Little Caesars over this. I totally forgot the crust was garlic until I got a tiny HINT of it on one bite. Honestly I think that&#39;s what threw the flavor off even more. Plain crust probably would&#39;ve helped it out a little. It just wasn&#39;t...good.
The breadsticks, I was not a fan of either. They were quite dry for having so many toppings on them. The Romano cheese threw the flavor off for me..that&#39;s all you could taste. I think if they got rid of that, and just stuck with mozzarella cheese and a bit more garlic butter sauce on top- these would be great. The soft yet firm texture of them was fine, but that romano cheese left a bad taste in my mouth..we didn&#39;t even finish them.
I will most likely never order anything from jets pizza again. Honestly I don&#39;t see anything unique about them that would make them stand out from other pizza places. The fact that their pizza is SO comparable to Little C&#39;s shows they&#39;re not really trying to be unique in any way...I&#39;m actually quite surprised that this pizza got so many good reviews. That&#39;s what I based my trip off of and I&#39;m never trusting you people again! Just goes to show people will put anything in their mouths these days...(that&#39;s what she said).....

I think I can break it down for you. The Chicago area is divided into two pizza realms: those who grew up here and consequently understand that real &#34;Chicago pizza&#34; has nothing to do with deep dish, that it really refers to the succulent thin crust available at innumerable neighborhood joints in both the city and suburbs, where pizzas have very little sauce, abundant cheese, are cut into squares, and are to be eaten only two ways - either with sausage or without. Those folks should avoid Jet&#39;s like the plague, unless they&#39;re interested in trying Pizza Hut (right down to the deep-fried crust) under a different name. The other pizza realm - people from out-of-town, who believe it&#39;s possible to find great pizza in places like Saginaw, Omaha, New York and Iowa City, and who seem inexplicably to prefer beginning paragraphs with the word &#34;so,&#34; will find the bland offerings at Jet&#39;s to be positively delicious. As for me, I will never forsake Giordano&#39;s again."

One thing I did not like is that the base and edges of the pizza seemed oily and it seemed the oil deep fried the edges of the pizza to give it a crunchy texture. Maybe it was intentional, but it did not appeal to me.

Staff at this place was friendly and that is always a plus point."

Me &amp; a couple friends ordered up the 2 medium pizza &amp; Jets bread combo.  I guess the 2 medium pizza deal limits you to the round style, which wasn&#39;t a problem.  When the food arrived, the pizzas looked similar to Little Caesars, but wasn&#39;t as enjoyable.  I&#39;d give a 2 or 3 star rating for the round pizza.

Because the Jets bread is so delish, we wanted to give the square pizza a try since that seems to be more of their specialty.  As soon as I laid eyes on the square masterpiece, I knew that it would taste better, and it was a night &amp; day difference compared to the circular style.  Every piece has an edge &amp; the crust is light, buttery &amp; amazing.  The boats, jets bread, square pizza &amp; cinnamon bread all taste phenomenal, you found a repeat customer Jets, keep up the good work!"

I work in Schaumburg and was getting tired of the local lunch places. I decided to check yelp to see if there were any local places that served some &#39;za by the slice, and Jet&#39;s came up. It&#39;s a bit further than I like to go for lunch, but it will be worth the occasional drive.

Now this could come off as bad depending on who reads it, but the pizza is sort of like a high-quality Pizza Hut style pizza, with crispy/oily/buttery crust. I really don&#39;t eat Pizza Hut anymore because it tastes so processed these days, but this was sort of a nostalgic thing for me; it&#39;s an much better version of what I remembered I liked about PH as a kid.

Open one close to my house, please!"

I have been talking about Jet&#39;s Pizza forever, but I dont live around the area so never got a chance to go. I was super excited when I got there and they said they served it by the slice, since there was only 2 of us eating we didnt want a whole pizza, they even had a special were you got 2 slices and a 20 oz soda for 5 bucks. You cant go wrong!! The crust is thick and usually I dont like thick crust, but this was crispy on the outside and garlicy soft on the inside.....AMAZING!! They had just enough sauce and cheese on it to satisfy me.

In my book this was one of the most perfect pieces of pizza ever.  The slice came from one of their rectangular pies.  It was thick, but not too thick.  The cheese was slightly burnt, but not a lot.  The crust was so crispy it made me wishing I had gotten a corner slice.

Burritos filled primarily with lettuce, food like Chevy&#39;s: Americanized and bland. The first indicator of a bad Mexican restaurant is the default presence of lettuce on the tacos. 

Anyway, I was in the neighborhood and chose to take a flyer on Señor Tacos today. Called ahead for 3 chicken tacos, cilantro and onion. Guy says 5-10 minutes. I get there 10 minutes later and they hadn&#39;t made it yet, despite only about 5 people inside. No biggie. I&#39;ll watch some NBA talk while I wait. Paid the surprising $7.50ish and went to chow. Sure enough, 3 chicken tacos with lettuce, tomato, and cheese, and two very bland salsas. The more things change, the more they stay the same. 

Here&#39;s a thought: if you operate a Mexican restaurant, make the tacos Mexican-style, and only drop a salad on top if the customer asks for it. Bam! If you&#39;re just hungry, do as I will certainly do and stick with the taco special at Los Laureles. Huge, hot grilled tacos and a cola for a full buck less than this suburban shack. And please, please call ahead. The locals jam that place at lunchtime."

It&#39;s so fresh and the texture is perfect. It&#39;s not the goopy, uniform puree I&#39;ve found in a lot of other places. They leave a few nice chunks of avocado just how I like it. Lots of cilantro, too. I ordered one asada taco and two lengua tacos. In terms of Mexican restaurants, guacamole and lengua tacos are pretty much how I decide whether or not to visit regularly because lengua is my favorite and I&#39;ve seen them way overcooked or under-seasoned many times before.

The steak was very good. Seasoned just right, tender enough with a little bit of chew. I&#39;m not a huge fan of steak tacos generally, but I was curious because I know it&#39;s standard fare for most people.

The lengua was one of the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. It was meaty without being tough, and tender without basically being pudding. I&#39;ve seen both happen, and I&#39;ve also seen lengua chopped into such large cubes that it&#39;s near impossible to fold the tortilla. These tacos were perfect. I would like to add that Senor Taco&#39;s offers the option of cilantro/onion on your tacos as opposed to the iceberg lettuce/tomato we see at a lot of places that cater to the severely Americanized--something maybe one wouldn&#39;t expect from the lighthearted, kitschy name. I&#39;m a total cilantro addict, so this bodes well for me.

They also make the tortilla chips in-house, with each order! It&#39;s just salty, fatty, crunchy goodness. Perfect with the guacamole.

The food is wonderful, but part of why I want to give them a five star rating is the customer service. The guy at the front is just sweet and wants you to leave happy. The first time I went there, there was a rush of customers and I could see that the kitchen was busy. I bought a carne al pastor dinner (also delicious!) with guacamole, but didn&#39;t see it in my bag when I got home. Normally I&#39;m not the kind of person to call a restaurant for anything besides takeout, but I just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t charged. The guy confirmed that I hadn&#39;t been (I did the math too), and promised a free order of guacamole next time I came in.

Now, anyone with a brain should have the common sense and decency to think about what goes on in the kitchen on a daily basis when they order food and make complaints. I&#39;ve worked in food service. I&#39;m not at a restaurant anymore, but I&#39;m still a pink collar worker and it sucks. When tickets pile up, stuff sometimes happens. The people making your food are not computers. It&#39;s how the staff handles the issue that matters.

The fact that this guy was so polite to me on the phone (which was probably still during a lunch rush) and then promised to compensate for something I didn&#39;t even have to pay for? That was really nice of him. And then when I went in today, he remembered me and offered to give me the guacamole for free, or a drink or something. It was completely unnecessary because I would probably put up with a terrible attitude just to get my hands on their awesome food anyway, but it&#39;s definitely noteworthy. I don&#39;t know if he just works there or runs the place, but he&#39;s a legit dude. I will definitely be back for my next taco craving."

The not so good:

I highly doubt I&#39;ll be back here, unless I&#39;m literally starving. I came in a few weeks ago and ordered the eggs and ham. it was seriously disgusting. the eggs are supposed to be scrambled, which means cooked for a few minutes. they were runny and gross and not cooked at all. I ended up trying to pick out what was salvageable. the rice was halfway decent, but how do you screw up eggs?? the only thing that was good here, were the chips and salsa. however, they give you the most ridiculous serving of salsa. it was the equivalent of one tablespoon...what??why??how?? makes no sense...stay away...there are way too many other good choices out there, with better food and prices."

The decor is authentic to the their culture.  Good service and a friendly staff.  I really enjoy their tamales as the dough stays moist and tender.  I have tried several items from the menu over the years and everything come out with consistency.

The enchiladas are very good, I have had better though. If you eat there you also get complimentary chips and salsa which are delicious!

I always forget about Senor Tacos since it&#39;s such a small unassuming place, which are always the best for great tacos.  The dining area was recently renovated &amp; had a nice homey feeling.  Both of the guys behind the counter were real nice, I could tell my food would be made correctly just based on how they took the order.  Our tacos were brought to our table along with complimentary chips &amp; salsa within 5 mins of sitting down.  There were a couple flat screens that both had the nba game of the day playing which was a nice touch.  They had music playing when we walked in &amp; ordered, but they put the audio for the basketball game on after we sat down &amp; were watching for a bit, awesome!

The floor was wet around 3 of the floor toilets. Paper towels and toilet paper on the floor. 
My food was good. I had the salmon and rice with vegetables. My salmon was cooked perfectly. The veggies were just a little crispy, which is how I like them.

Afterwards we went to Woodfield mall so my stepdaughter could visit the Rainforest Cafe. When we got there no one was there to greet us and it took 20 minutes to be seated even the restaurant was nearly empty. 

Once seated we put in our drink orders and told the waitress we needed a minute since it was our first time there. After another 20 minutes, our waitress showed up with no drinks and tried to take our order. 

We told her what the problem was and said we were leaving she shrugged her shoulders and walked off without apologizing. 

My wife emailed corporate and they were quick to call and apologize and said they would send us gift cards for our troubles. It is now nearly September and we haven&#39;t received a thing. Horrible."

We had a decent sized party and when we were called up to be seated - we waited some more as our table wasn&#39;t cleaned off or ready. We eventually get sat down in a nook of a booth that&#39;s positioned under some really hot lights. The kids get situated, we look at our menus and a very disinterested waiter attends to our table. Maybe he was ready for the day to be over, maybe he didn&#39;t want a table with 3 kids - I don&#39;t know but he was not jazzed to be there. 

We asked for the kid meals to be put in as appetizers to get them faster. 
They took at least 15 minutes. And the grownup food took another 15 after that. 
As someone who&#39;s worked for RFC before, I know the amount of time it should take for it to get from kitchen to table is a lot shorter. It was just amplified by the fact that the kids were hungry. 

Lastly, it&#39;s really sad to see all of the fish gone. The kids look forward to seeing them. I understand that it&#39;s expensive to keep up but still sad to see. 

All in all, the kids enjoyed themselves but I could think of better ways to spend my money on overpriced food with the hopes of more endearing service."

Being that we were already in the mall, our friends opted to eat here.  They have the card for the restaurant so we were seated with no wait.  We were sat in a corner area that helped a bit with the young kids, but we were seated at a round table top which in turn was not helpful as they kept wanting to get up and play with the water that was falling near the table.  We asked if the food could be rushed as we were on a time crunch and it actually happened.  (at other locations we are usually there for hours!!)  They kept the drinks full and checked on us in a timely matter.

We also visited during the day on a Saturday, so being that we were taken care well, and received our food pretty quick i would definitely recommend this location!"

The cheeziest kids restaurant you can find in the Northwest suburbs!
Parents who love their kids who love animals?  You&#39;ve been hoodwinked!  Go anywhere near this place &amp; being the &#34;aww shucks&#34; parents like us, acquiesce when your little girl asks to see &#34;Coco&#34; (the crocodile up front).

We brought our 1 year old here. She loves animals. She saw the fake crocodile and snake in front and went &#34;Coco? Coco?&#34; Being a daddy&#39;s girl, daddy could not say no. (Well played, Rainforest Cafe. Well played.)  Off to the host we went.  Table for 2 and a baby, madam?  Yes, sir!  Right away!  Come follow me!  (It was 5PM on a Tuesday. We were seated right away.  The restaurant was not crowded at all.)  

Baby girl was giddy!  Oooh!  Fake animals that made noises and sorta moved every once in a while. Ooooh!   Bubbles in the aquarium that did NOT have fishes.  Ahhh!  She was saying hi to every fake bird, gorilla, dolphin, and tiger near us.  To this one year old, the rainforest party has started!  Huzzah!

Our waitress was super nice and on top of things. Refills? Voila!  Anything else you want? Will get it in a jiffy!  

Waitress asked if we were celebrating anything today. &#34;No, our kid just saw Coco the Crocodile while we passed by and well, here we are!&#34;  Waitress said &#34;Wow!  This is rare. Most people who go here usually celebrate something.&#34;  Well, we&#39;re not most people, Ms. Waitress.  We&#39;re gullible parents who can&#39;t say no to our baby.  Some might call us &#34;Millennial Parents&#34;.  (#Selfies were taken with Mr. Coco the Crocodile that day.  Could we BE any more stereotypical millennials? But I digress....)

Bathrooms? Clean!  Changing table? Present!  Also clean!

Overpriced food!  Yes, siree!  My husband did not like the idea of paying $16.95 for something that would be $6 in a regular restaurant but for his baby girl?  He was willing to pay.

Overall, we had a good time.  Baby had a good time.  I think she was dreaming about it coz I heard her say &#34;Coco, night night,&#34; while half asleep.  Come back here often?  Maybe not so much because of the food prices.  Next time, we will take Ms. Waitress&#39; advice and only come here for special occasions.  

We are wiser now.  We will go to the zoo if baby really wants to see animals and get a chicken nugget for $9 at the zoo foodcourt.  Still expensive but not as expensive as Rainforest Café.  Nope, learned our lesson.  We will spend our money wisely from now on.  

Oh wait....Is that a Rainforest Café Birthday Package for kids, I see?  Ooooh!  Maybe we&#39;ll spend our money wisely AFTER I plan this birthday party for my baby.  Mr. Coco, do you charge talent fee if we hire you to take photos with our kids for her Rainforest Café Birthday Party?  =)

PS: For those parents who are about to have a breakdown, there&#39;s a bar area!  Go get some of that &#34;mommy&#39;s grape juice&#34;!"

I squealed and he didn&#39;t really know why. So, I love Rainforest even though I think their food is quite average.  It really just appeals to the kid in me.  We ended up having lunch here and a great time catching up. 

I ordered one of their promotional menu items: Maui meatloaf. It was quite tasty and there was a surprise in the middle; a hard boiled egg. It was an interesting take on meatloaf but it was quite delicious, nevertheless. I think I actually liked it more than any other menu items I have had during my past visits to a Rainforest cafe.  He had the burger and said it was pretty good but he is really picky and plucked everything off the burger except the cheese.

Lastly, the service was good. Our waitress was attentive and came to check to make sure all is well every so often.

Overall, it was a pretty good visit."

She had just turned 10. We were eating our meal and my youngest daughter noticed of few drops of water on my shoulder. I thought it was from the effects of the moisture. Minutes later a pipe burst over our heads! We jumped off of our chairs. My daughter&#39;s head was covered in some sort of waste. My wife and a kind mom helped my daughter remove that waste from her hair and clothes. I had it all over my shirt. My daughter was mortified. They offered her some clothes from the clearance section. We waited for the store manager to arrive. He assured us that corporate would do right by us. That was a lie. Corporate offered us $50 gift card?!? Wow. After all my daughter went through on her birthday. Thanks Rainforest for being so generous. My daughter cried all the way home. Her birthday had been ruined. $50 gift card is a slap in the face. Will not be returning. They should have just closed the restaurant while they dealt with the issue but decided to just close that section. I should have called the health department.

    First, it&#39;s so very apparent that they are struggling. The first thing we noticed were the big empty tanks filled with bubblers. Where did the beautiful tropical fish go? I remember staring at those tanks for hours and while waiting for a table in the past. That was a favorite part of mine! :(
    There was no wait to be seated which was a plus. Their employees were all very sweet. The booklet menus with the wide variety I was so used to, was now a single piece of paper with just their most popular items. I guess that&#39;s a smart business move. But I can&#39;t seem to get over the cheapo factor of it. 
     What isn&#39;t cheap, is their entrees. They are delicious. I honestly do like them. They aren&#39;t bad at all. But they are expensive. So much so that while we were celebrating a birthday -- my waiter actually felt bad when I said we were considering the mega dessert called &#34;the volcano&#34; and offered a free birthday cupcake because they felt bad that the volcano was $15. I was taken back by their honesty. I ordered it anyway. 
  I just left feeling sad for this once super busy and popular place. I couldn&#39;t shake the empty and depressed vibe. I felt for the amount of money I paid I should have had a better &#34;experience&#34;. It&#39;s not to say the staff wasn&#39;t great or that the food wasn&#39;t good. The whole rainforest experience lacked any sort of cool vibe. The fish were gone. The fun was completely gone. All I was left with was expensive food and cheap animatronic animals (which some, by the way, don&#39;t even belong in a rainforest?). Meh. I wish they could revive this place. I did enjoy it back in the day. Here&#39;s hoping they know how to bring the fun factor back!"

I have a 3 year old and 1 year old who wanted to eat here over and over again. Every experience was good but my last one was  great. My server was Heather S. It was just me and my girl. Once we sat down she started her speal and then stopped and asked if I was okay. She noticed the tired exhausted Mom in me trying to wrangle my 2 kids into high chairs and booster seats without loosing my mind. I looked at her and took 30 seconds to vent and it was amazing. Something so little but she noticed I was stressed and took a second to make a personal connection which I truely enjoyed. She explained how she gets it because she a little one of her own and has been there before. After our short conversation I just felt less stressed. Everything with our meal was perfect and she was a very sweet girl but what I really noticed about her is she busts her a** at work. She was constantly checking on her tables, running back and forth back and forth and checking in with every. I would hear her pass by 2 tables and say &#34;this on the way&#34; &#34;thats on the way&#34;. She never keeps her tables guessing and waiting on when there food or drinks will be coming. Mainly, the restaurant and food were good but I really just wanna brag on Heather S. and what a great server she is :)"

And what happened to the fish?!!!  Sorry but air bubbles don&#39;t really cut it. I get it, tropical fish are expensive to maintain... especially salt tank fish... but really? Air bubbles?

Food... we did vegetarian... portobello wraps had slimy diced mushrooms vs. The expected sliced steak grilled...  the natural burger was okay but needed more than avocado to make it decent.

Food was meh and service was slightly better... but there are a lot more places to go to get something tasty in the area."

It used to feel magical. My husband and I brought our kids to the rainforest cafe last night to let them have the same experience of wonder.

We walked in and as soon as we got to the bubble towers to enter the actual dining area it had an odd smell like old wet nasty carpet. My kids were already pointing out dust, cob webs, and how dirty things were inside the restaurant before we even got to our table but I ignored them thinking once we sat down they would be more excited by the experience. NOPE! On the way to our table a man was showing his wee one the leopard on a rock up high moving its tail and blinking. Showing the baby not to fear the fake stuffed moving cat... Mean while, here comes a waitress full strut with plates of food trying to get passed. Instead of going around or waiting patiently so he could step to the side or even saying &#34;excuse me&#34; she simply rolls her eyes and barrels passed them. Though, as she passes us shes huffing and puffing about that being a shit place to stand with major agitation. My feeling is if you can&#39;t keep yourself pleasant and respectful in a family based restaurant even for some thing so simple then you need another job! That was completely rude to complain over a paying customer whose visit is helping you make money... Even if that wasn&#39;t her table its the point. Plus its a baby and you have hot food! How about kindness and understanding that the baby was frightened?! Just a glance at them standing and you can clearly see the situation.
So... Back to our experience... We were seated by the tiger family (which is also by that leopard) and right away the weird carpet smell turned into the smell of a zoo. My husband and I looked at each other thinking the same thing &#34;the smell is realistic isn&#39;t it?&#34; haha laughing about the animals. Well yeah it was, because around the corner 25 steps was the bathrooms and the smell of urine was SO BAD we had to get up and leave. I would NEVER eat at a place where you can smell that while eating. It makes you question the over all cleanliness of the kitchen and restaurant. Plus with mouthy waitress moving like an angry train it makes you not feel good at all being there. We walked out before a server even got to us. Even my kids who are 4 and 6 said it was stinky and yucky. Bummer for us because we were excited that they would love it. Oh well... We won&#39;t be back."

The food is overpriced and tastes horrible. They have removed all the salt water fish. The place smells like a zoo but without the animals. Our server last night was decent I guess. It was hard to hear her clearly with the constant gorilla growling in background. I waited until my daughter was old enough to go but we will never return. There where barely any people eating there during what I assumed would be a dinner rush. My suggestion to Yelpers would be to dine at any of the other many places nearby. The only good I can say is that Wed they have kids eat for 2.99 with paying adult and he balloon guy was really nice.

I have a theory that if you go to a restaurant and the menus are sticky you&#39;re going to be disappointed, well lets just say the menus were pretty gross. 
I can not believe the prices for this mediocre food! The prices are absolutely insane! One kids meal, one beer, one soda, philly cheese steak and a chicken meal: $60 with tip. This was lunch! And no there is not a lunch menu. For dinner we went to Uno&#39;s pizzeria and grill and spent exactly half for way better food and service. 
Oh and as of today (7-13-16 there are zero fish in the fish tank)
Do yourself a favor; go to Cheesecake Factory for over priced food, at least it will be tasty."

We had to find someone to seat us. There were only 3 other customers in the place. We ordered from the tiny overpriced menu. Appetizers were gross and pretty sure they were microwaved. Took  20 minutes for appetizers with no one else there and they were cold when we got them. I&#39;ll stop the rest because the service was horrible. We both ended up not feeling well most of the afternoon.  Will never go back again.

This is from the next day. The chicken had to be under cooked. We both ate the same thing and both of us are now dealing with the same thing. Never again. Ever.

It should also be noted that most of the animatronics are looking like 20 year old teddy bears that have seen it all. The beautiful saltwater tanks we used to enjoy? Gone. Everything great about this place is now gone."

That&#39;s the only plus to this visit. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait but it was over 30 minutes. The food was terrible and over priced. I found a coupon online with no expiration date for a free appetizer and the manager, Alex would not honor it and insisted it was three years old. Did I mention that there was no expiration date?  They seemed very under staffed. I felt like everything was sort of thrown on the table as they ran by. The fish tanks were all empty.

This is a pretty neat place for children. It&#39;s loud, dark, they have thunder and rain sounds going. They have huge fish tanks with exotic fish and have a gift shop in the front of the restaurant. I even thought this place was a cool place when we first got there.

After we got seated, we met our waitress who was the worst waitress ever. The service was absolutely terrible. It was 7 of us at our table and we ordered a lot of food that came up to about $300. You would think the waitress would be nicer right? WRONG. I even asked if she could take a picture of us as a family and the waitress seemed annoyed by it. They weren&#39;t even that busy! Every time we would need a refill, we would have to flag her down. She just seemed like she was in a hurry all the time and we still stayed nice and friendly to her.

She then gave us our check and we stupidly just glanced at our receipt and didn&#39;t really look at it too long and just immediately gave her our credit card to pay the bill. My husband decides he wanted to pay the tip with cash and put cash on the table, we signed the receipt and just got up for a little bit and started taking pictures in front of the fish tank that was next to our table. 

While we were taking pictures, I could see the waitress cleaning our table off and pick the tip up and that was the last time I saw her before we left. Later on that night, I decide to look at the receipt and realized they automatically included gratuity with our bill which was a hefty amount. I was livid that we left her EXTRA tip for the worst service we&#39;ve ever had. I ended up telling my mom about it... Not knowing she would turn around and call RainForest Cafe&#39;s manager to complain about the service. The manager ended up telling us to come back and have the extra gratuity we left refunded back to us. (My mom went back, I was too embarrassed to lol) I guess good service isn&#39;t required when you are guaranteed gratuity!

As far as the food goes, it was OK. Everything was pricey. I got the chicken alfredo and the toast smelled like straight feet. My husband got strawberry lemonade and when he asked for a refill, she gave him plain lemonade and just set the cup in front of my husband and left. He flagged her down again to tell her he ordered strawberry lemonade and that&#39;s when she decides to tell us, &#34;it&#39;s going to be extra If you get strawberry lemonade refills&#34;. Um, why did you fail to tell us that when he ordered the drink?? You could have at least told us when you rudely brought him back plain lemonade! I didn&#39;t say that to her, but I wanted to. Lol 

Anyways, I will never go back to this place. I might go to the one in the city one day to see if it&#39;s any better there."

The burger was eeh, but the mac n cheese was pretty good, but once the food did arrive we did not see our server, even as he walked past our table many times with my empty beverage glass. 

What happened to the fish tanks? We went there expecting the fish, my cousin, who has never been there was super excited for them after I explained the awesome tank to her. And then we get there and they&#39;re empty? 

Also, it was my cousins birthday and I told the host when got to the front of the host line and nothing. I would have paid for andessert, no problem. But our check was just brought to us and I had to bring to his attention that we were there for a birthday. They DID bring her a cupcake with a candle on it which was appreciated.

My husband and I were far less impressed with the menu, which was not very original. Before my food came out I had a sense that everything we would be served would&#39;ve been frozen and pre-portioned. 

But, to be fair, this is not a restaurant for foodies, but parents with small children. The only complaint that I cannot rationalize away is about the prices that are on the menu. This café charges an exorbitant amount for an uninspired menu of pre-cooked frozen fare. I do not blame the cooks in the restaurant, but I do blame whoever created the menu and made negotiations with suppliers. That is on a corporate level."

The aquariums are pretty, and I am a fan of the Mai Tais. 

If you come here on purpose without children- you are a glutton for punishment. 
Plan on arriving well before you want to eat so you can check in and then wander around the mall for a bit before getting seated. It works perfectly, because by then the kids are worn out from playing and are ready to sit, chill, and eat. Hell yeah.

Fast forward. We arrived at 3:45pm and had a 35 min wait. Okay... Seems fair. UNTIL we are seated and the restaurant is maybe 30 to 40% full. Why the long wait?? Is it just to create hype with lots of people hanging around in front of the restaurant making it look busy?!

This place is not staffed appropriately. They could really be filling those empty tables with guests if they had enough servers on the weekend shifts.

As for the food, where are the waffle fries from my childhood memory?! Big let down. The house made veggie burger was really good though! 

A child in our party was served warm-ish milk and threw up before our food arrived. Not good...

The food we got was supreme. The portions were huge. I got the reuben with a side of chips. Best reuben I&#39;ve ever eaten. Lots of meat and stuffed full with just the right seasoning.

I had a burger the other day, and it was really good. I&#39;m talking Red Robin good, and maybe (for the portion) even a shade better than that. And the service has always been top notch here. I think they make it a hiring practice to make sure there&#39;s always an experienced waitstaff here.

If the prices were a little more reasonable, I would give this restaurant chain 4 stars. I get that it&#39;s in a mall, but so is Cheesecake Factory, PF Chang&#39;s, and Red Robin. Rainforest Cafe would be a no brainer if it dropped about $5 off each entree.

Forget the 2 hour wait to be seated. We came early and checked in first before doing our shopping so the two hour wait was not the end of the world.

Fast forward 2 hours..they will still almost 15 minutes late seating us and I  am not sure why because there were quite a few open tables. This of course was after we watched a group of 6 walk into the bar area and seat themselves.

We were seat in what felt like the middle of the dining area. Really not that a big deal only worth mentioning because all of the wait staff and managers congregated in from of our table and gossiped.

Again I noticed at least 7 open tables around up and wait and support staff just standing around.

We watched a waiter pull a ketchup bottle out of the garbage  and give it to another table without wiping it off. Garbage cans overflowing and no one bothering to take them out.

Our food was ok. Portion size is decent. The food came out hot but not so hot you could not eat it.

Our waitress quite possibly was one of the worst I have ever experienced. Not only did she not ask if I wanted my leftovers wrapped but she also did not check in with our table or refill our drinks in the more than 60 minutes we were there.

We did not see her for a solid 20 minutes and when I asked for the check she disappeared for another 10 minutes.

Kids wanted to go to this gimmicky place. Waited in line 15 min to be put on waiting list. Then they estimated 1.5 hours to be seated. I actually walked in and third of tables were empty and clean. Tried to talk teenager hosts to accommodate us a few minutes early at least (we were done killing time in the mall) but they showed zero effort. Actually they sat us 10 min late from estimated time (altogether 2 hours). And food is junk (mix between McDonalds and pub food). If kids force you into it ... at least try to plan to kill some time in the mall or pick workday, perhaps (I didn&#39;t try nor will I but maybe less busy ...)."

Although there was no line, we waited about 5 minutes to be seated.

Such a niche restaurant, but I am sad to say that we enjoyed it. The atmosphere brought out the child in us as we took in the fish tanks and special forest animals. I really liked how the ceiling turned from &#34;day&#34; to &#34;night&#34;.

Moving on to the food, I have to say I was delightfully surprised. My fiance had the porkchops w/red beans and rice. He demolished his entire plate, so that must mean it was good. I had the cocnut shrimp with a petite steak. The shrimp was great. It was jsut the right portion for what I was craving.

Overall, it was a great expereince. The food was better than I had expected. You do pay for the atmostphere, but I think the food was good enough that it didnt hurt.

Next time we are nearby, I will have to try their flaming lava cake!"

Seeing it was part of her birthday celebration I took her to Rainforest Cafe for our lunch. We waited in line and got our ticket with our time, which was 1:21 PM and on this ticket was written B-Day, so she would receive her free birthday cupcake and some of the staff would sing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; to her. I was told to leave it on the table so the waitress would be able to see it. Well the larger parties that came after us were seated way before us. Now remember my ticket said 1:21 well at 1:30 I went up to the check-in and told it would be soon, at 1:45 PM I went up to the desk again and of course was told it would be shortly, now at 2:00 PM I went up again and was finally seated about 2:15 PM which from the time I signed in was over an hour wait. We ordered our food and had to ask when was it coming and our waitress replied Let me check and had to wait again. There was approximately 4 to 5 birthday celebrations around us. We ate got our bill, I paid and was still waiting for her cupcake. The waitress never came with it as I was walking out I mentioned it to the manager on duty, I believe his name was Alex and he said I am so sorry, let me get her a cupcake and my reply was it&#39;s to late as we already had our coats on. On Monday I called the restaurant and spoke with a manager named Jim and he said he would look into this and get back to me and guess what I am still waiting. This past Saturday I took the other twin because that he wanted to go where his sister went, well we didn&#39;t have to wait the hour for our table and the food was good, but again no birthday cupcake or singing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and again Alex was working and as we were walking out I told him NO cupcake again and now &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and again he wanted to give him a cupcake after we had our coats on. My advise to anyone going with just two of you keep an eye on your time and don&#39;t let the larger crowds go ahead of you, especially when you are hungry.

Over three weeks ago and still waiting for the general manager to answer my call because every time I call he isn&#39;t there, I left a voice mail message and still waiting"

Male host who seated us (Indian?)(manager?) was impossible to understand because his English was horrific - honest - couldn&#39;t understand one word - and while I truly applaud everyone trying to learn a new language, placing them in a key position of any business is a dumb place for them to practice and presents a bad face for the business.  Music was often a bit too loud and heavily Spanish.  Reggae okay but how about a little Belafonte, eh?  The food was awful ($40).  Daughter and I shared the appetizer plate consisting of a few mozzarella sticks/marinara dipping sauce, a few chicken fingers, buttery coconutty dipping sauce, colorful taco chips and a spinach-artichoke dip.  Everything on that plate arrived &#34;warmish&#34; (gag) and tasted as though it&#39;d been made a couple days ago and was  popped into a microwave. Granddaughter had mac-n-cheese, apple juice and vanilla ice cream. The restaurant itself smells like it needs to be dusted and there were zero fish in any of the tanks that used to hold beautiful tropical fish (making me wonder if they were added to the menu someplace?), however, someone felt those tanks were pretty enough to just have a bubble display.  Prices for what we ate were ghastly but we knew that when we went in.....and we were there purposely to enjoy lunch with my granddaughter who is 2-1/2 -- and that we certainly did.  There&#39;s nothing like watching the wonder in a child&#39;s eyes!  Watching the monkeys and tigers and hearing the jungle sounds, especially the thunder and rain and dimming of lights, was great fun.  For that reason and only that reason I will probably return.  Upon leaving, since we had been seated by three noisy animated apes, I asked her if we could sit by the tigers (4 noisy ones) next time and she said, &#34;Tomorrow?&#34;"

Sorry to be such a butt, but this place is really just for the  aw kids get from it. There is nothing adult about this place, from the tacky animal face prints everywhere to the water mists getting your seat wet....just tacky, 

My kids of course enjoyed the themed place, they looked around until the seen it all. 
The food was less than mediocre, extensively expensive in my opinion, An entree was easily $20 for chicken. The kids meals weren&#39;t inexpensive either and had no healthy options. 

We went to celebrate one of the kids birthdays and waited 15 mins to be stated in a nearly empty restaurant, no greeting from staff just the abrupt..follow me and your service will be with you. 

Our server came 15 mins later, and anytime we needed anything it took another 15 mins to get it as we watched her chat with her less enthused colleges. The food came out warm and in less than 5 mins time was cold...it was very irritating to wait and wait to get anything from our server. And when we asked anther employee for something they blew us off and said your server should be here soon. 

Our family of four meal was over $85.....better service at the DMV than this place. Food not worth the price and if your into the decor..just order something small and get out."

It was a really difficult experience.  You need to reevaluate your policy re: the giant tree frog.  My husband is an Army veteran and suffers from combat related PTSD, and when said giant frog snuck up on him and started patting him on his shoulders - your frog could easily have lost both of his arms.  It took every ounce of self control that he has to keep from attacking the frog.  This triggered a really strong PTSD experience - he was unable to sleep most of the night.  The grand kids thought it was funny, but I knew it was anything but.

The &#34;Volcano&#34; ice cream dessert was so ordinary! A &#34;rich chocolate brownie cake&#34; doesnt even describe this. The brownie was given to us quite cold. To top it off, there was only two scoops of ice cream, and on the top which I expected to be ice cream was actually just whipped cream. The firework lit on the top of the dessert was already lit before giving it to us, giving us only a few seconds to take a picture. I wouldn&#39;t order this if i were you. $15 wasted.

The service was bad, with bored waiters and waitresses. They had to rush to give us our food, and they never saw us when we wanted to ask for the check, or some condiments.

The food is not good at all and extremely overpriced for what you get. I don&#39;t even know if I would call my nieces dinosaur nuggets chicken... Maybe it really was dinosaur? I&#39;m kidding. But really, they were gross. I ordered steak, ribs and shrimp,my dad ordered Italian beef and my sister also ordered steak and shrimp. My dad is usually not a complainer but he said he couldn&#39;t even eat the French fries. Our food came out lukewarm. 

We waited well over a half hour on a Monday night. Their seemed to be barely any tables. I was starting to think they had us waiting around just to entice my niece to want to buy things in the restaurant store.

We were sat in the very back of the restaurant where all the screaming kids were. Our baby (1year) didn&#39;t make a sound. Not even when the frog came around to take pictures. There were kids running everywhere. Our server was more concerned about getting off of work than serving us. Never informed us about meal details even when taking our order and double ordered us food and when we confronted him he ran and got him manager. Who said they couldn&#39;t discount anything for the mix up but could bring us more food..?! The food was way over priced for the portions served. All around it was a very disappointing experience and I doubt I will be back. I have it two stars because if it wasn&#39;t for the photo booth and fish tanks we would have left well before our wait time expired.

He thought they would have fun at the Rainforest Cafe. Unfortunately it was a mess from start to finish. We arrived at 3:30 on Saturday and were told there was a 45 minute wait. We walked around the mall and came back and were seated at 4:20. 

As we were walking to our table, we noticed that the restaurant was half-full. It was hard thinking that we had waited 45 minutes when there were lots of open tables. I&#39;m wondering if they don&#39;t have the staff to service a full dining room. There just seems to be no explanation for that kind of wait when there was so much available seating.

When we got to our table it took us 45 minutes from ordering to receiving our food. Luckily, we ordered the nacho appetizer and they were delivered promptly. 

The animatronic animals from the gorilla, the crocodile, the monkeys, and the tigers never moved. We asked our waitress and she said that every 20 minutes there should be movement. Well, we didn&#39;t see anything move. Only the fish in the tank. Again, if this was my restaurant and the animatronic machines stopped working, I would call someone to come immediately to fix it because it&#39;s core to their business.

Thank goodness for the fish tanks because they kept our ravenous kids partially distracted for the 45 minutes it took to get our food.

My husband ordered the Chimichanga and he told me that it was the worst chimichanga he has ever eaten. I had the Cobb salad. It cost $14. It was absolutely terrible. I probably would have not thought it was so bad but randomly the day before I ate the Cobb salad from another fast food restaurant from P***** Bread for about $8 and it was delicious. I paid double for a worse-tasting product. My dad ordered a wrap and a soup. He couldn&#39;t finish the wrap because he said it tasted bad.

The bill was big. When you go to a place like this, you know you pay more for the &#34;entertainment&#34; factor. With none of the animatronics working, we paid extra for nothing, just bad tasting food and a long wait.

Weirdly, we all had headaches the next day. Not sure if it was the food, but I&#39;m thinking it was the high sodium that got to all of us.

I can&#39;t imagine ever going back."

Got there at 6pm on a Wednesday to a nearly empty restaurant, get told there&#39;s a one hour wait if we&#39;re not members of their &#34;club&#34; which we could join for $25. Maybe this sort of nonsense cuts it inside a Disney Park in Florida, but in a suburban mall that also has P.F.Chang&#39;s, Cheesecake Factory, and several other options? I don&#39;t think so.

Food was OK, big greasy TGIFridays or Chili&#39;s kind of stuff. A step or two down from Elephant Bar.

The kids meal options were unimpressive considering that&#39;s the main reason to come here I think. Dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets on a plate? Really?

rainforest-cafe-schaumburg,Claire M.,jtSv4Bx8GcGvVK2LSeLn4A,"Forest Park, IL",1,1,1,136,953,5LIMiePMOuBzopSNjIAFKA,2.0,2013-01-01,"Ohhhhhhh boy where do I start?  Full disclosure here.  I have always disliked this place regardless of location.  For some ungodly reason, my husband (who will be 33 in a month) enjoys it.  He says it reminds him of Disneyland because we used to go to the one at Downtown Disney in Anaheim fairly often.  I think it is INCREDIBLY overpriced and just way too over the top themey.  The emphasis is obviously not on the food - which I understand - but the price they charge for what you get just makes me feel angry and ripped off when I leave, which is exactly what happened tonight.  

The husband had been begging me for a couple months to go here with him.  He said it could be his Christmas present.  The last we ate at a Rainforest Cafe was for his birthday two years ago so tonight I finally agreed.  

We got there at about 4:20 and it wasn&#39;t very crowded (I arranged that on purpose) so there was no wait.  Our &#34;host&#34; wordlessly and very unenthusiastically led us to our table right by one of the fish tanks.  Oddly enough, it was the exact same table we&#39;d sat at two years ago. 

Everything was very slowwwww.  It was tolerable tonight because we actually had something exciting to talk about but under normal circumstances, we would&#39;ve awkwardly been staring at each other.  Instead I stared at the fish.  I think I got to know every single one of them in the two and a half hours it took us from the time we sat down to the time we paid our check.  We sat through like FOUR of those goofy &#34;thunderstorms.&#34;  

My husband usually orders water but tonight he decided to be dangerous and order root beer.  It was IBC in the bottle which I should&#39;ve figured wasn&#39;t a &#34;free refill&#34; but I wasn&#39;t really paying attention.  We got the chili con queso as an appetizer which I must say was good.  

As I did last time, I ordered the tomato basil soup with the chopped house salad.  Here&#39;s where our waiter goofed me up and cost us an extra few dollars.  I&#39;d already given him back the menu so when I ordered my soup for $5.99 and my salad for $6.49, he suggested I order the Journey something or other which was some sort of soup/salad or sandwich combo.  I figured he was offering this to save us money so I said okay, sure, whatever.  Well when we got the bill, mine was charged at $14.49.  Had I have ordered them separately (as I had originally done) it would&#39;ve only come out to $12.48.  Turns out, what that deal is SUPPOSED to give you is a half order of one of the $15 salads and soup or half a sandwich.  Ohhh was I mad about that...  I want my $2 back!

The husband was going to order something more exciting but I&#39;m allergic to shellfish so he decided against shrimp or lobster and just got the bbq chicken wrap with fries and coleslaw - with a caesar salad.  

Thank god our food came out pretty staggered.  Our appetizer first (that actually came out pretty quickly), we&#39;d been done with that for awhile and along came his salad.  He finished that.  Then finally came our food.  We were done with that for awhile and I couldn&#39;t stand sitting there anymore.  I had to get up and wander around their little store (nothing at all that I had any interest in buying, I just needed to walk around).  Like 15 minutes later the husband emerged after paying the bill.  $55 BEFORE tip!!!!!  I thought I was going to have a heart attack.  We could&#39;ve gone somewhere and eaten really well for $55.  That&#39;s when I looked at the check and discovered (after checking with the menu board posted out front) that I&#39;d been charged $2 more for what I ordered AND also that the IBC root beer refills weren&#39;t free.  The food wasn&#39;t even all that good (it was okay) but it was absolutely NOT worth $55.  $60 something after the tip.  Insane.  And I thought I was eating on the cheap by ordered the soup and cheapest salad.  Ha!  

And come to think of it, I overheard the waitress at a table near us tell someone that the strawberry lemonade refills were 99 cents.  Our dude couldn&#39;t have casually informed my husband that the root beer refills were not free?  Maybe he figured we should&#39;ve known since they were served in the bottle.  I also think it&#39;s tacky as hell that there were no prices listed on the menu for the soft drinks (the root beer is listed right next to the diet coke).  Their website doesn&#39;t list any of the menu prices either!  Gee I wonder why.  If we had kids, our bill would likely be a week of my salary.

It&#39;ll be at least another 2 years before I let him drag me back here again.  I just want good food that matches the price I&#39;m paying for it.  I don&#39;t need to be distracted by animatronic gorillas and fish tanks.  I do think the sky with the stars is pretty."
rainforest-cafe-schaumburg,Laura N.,LFzCNWu8tIxGNPk358QVJg,"Georgetown, KY",1,1,1,1113,18,G3k3PCOK1SaZnDJ4xEopnQ,1.0,2012-12-19,"It&#39;s hard for me to like a place like the Rainforest Cafe. On many trips to the mall over the years, I&#39;ve stopped to look at the nearly life-like alligator that sits in a misty pond outside the entrance. And that&#39;s about it. I browsed through the expensive gift shop once but never had any desire to eat here. It seemed over-decorated, full of expensive stuff, over-priced, and probably had average food that wasn&#39;t worth the prices. Any restaurant that focuses way too much on commercialization and consumerism just isn&#39;t my kind of place at all.

When I found out a few classes from my school would be going here for a field trip a couple weeks ago, I knew it wouldn&#39;t be a fun field trip for us staff members. (Note: I work with elementary students with autism and special needs. Many of them love to grab other people&#39;s food and go look at things that make a lot of noise.)

We arrived to a nearly empty restaurant only to end up waiting about 20 minutes for them to set up the tables. They knew we were coming. They knew we had a lot of people. And yet, they weren&#39;t ready. We had to be on our toes -- watching all the kids dart back and forth between the attractions and stopping them from grabbing all the toys for sale and chewing on them. When we were finally able to sit down, we could barely get in our seats. The chairs were RIGHT next to each other; as in, you had to pull out one chair completely to step over the seat so you could get into the gap between the chair and table to finally sit down. Or you could just sit at the end of the table and scoot down from one chair to another. But even if you pull a chair out, you end up pulling it out into the chair of the table behind you, which is so close that you&#39;re pretty much trapped where you are for the entire meal. When you have kids that don&#39;t like to sit still or a strong desire to go to the bathroom, that makes this kind of difficult.

SO. The kids were given color pages and some crayons. That was cool, I guess. And the waitress my class had was pretty nice and took our orders rather quickly. That&#39;s good too, I suppose. Our water and drinks arrived quickly although one kid&#39;s apple juice never showed up, but we had dozens of kids. So that&#39;s OK. The kids loved their meals. Awesome. I ended up shelling out $11 total for a small plate of cheese sticks that weren&#39;t really that good. I gobbled them down because I was so hungry. It&#39;s the kind of food I would have considered &#34;drunk food&#34; back in my college days. Meh.

After the kids finished their food and were writhing back and forth with impatience and boredom in their oh-so-cramped seats, we took a few of them for a quick walk around the restaurant to check out some of the attractions -- the dolphin things, the fake tigers, the aquariums, etc. They LOVED them. The rainbows, the lights, the animals, everything. However, our students are still learning how to behave appropriately in public (which I assumed was the point of the field trip) so they weren&#39;t really considerate of other diners in the restaurant as they clambered over to the exhibits. Tables were placed right in front of each thing the kids wanted to see, so it made it kind of difficult to get up close. I&#39;m not really sure what genius designed the layout of this restaurant -- why put cool things to attract attention if people can&#39;t really go right up to them and look at them? Why place the tables so close? I felt bad that we were distracting other patrons, but at the same time -- this place needs less tables!! The furniture made it too damn crowded and uncomfortable. I spent half my time pulling the kids away and telling them they couldn&#39;t look at the fishes because people were eating right in front of them. My kids didn&#39;t want to listen. Some people stared at us. Oh well.

The moment that everyone started putting their coats on to leave was wonderful. Our checks were processed quickly, the tables were cleaned fast, and we were on our way. Whew.

Even if I was just with my husband, some friends, or oh-my-goodness, my own kids, I still stay far away from this place. There is just no appeal. None at all."

We got to the restaurant and I told the host my name and our reservations time, they sat 4 walk ins with children before us and it was now 5:20 pm. We were finally walking to be seated and the host asked my mom a question but didn&#39;t respond well to her answer cut her off and didn&#39;t care about customer service? She asked if we need anything I said yes a high chair as this is what I asked for in our reservations and she said ok. My sister held my nephew for 20 minutes still no high chair! We saw the manager asked him for one within a minute he got it! 
The food was ok over priced for the place. The kids had fun and that&#39;s what matters most, but had a few toys made by balloons for my nephews and kids from other tables came to ours to take our things, a little irritating.. Kids running around doing whatever. I spent $150 for all this crap! I&#39;ll never go there again not worth the money for the food, and customer service blows! I&#39;ve never been treated so poorly."

They wouldn&#39;t give my daughter the free meal bc nachos are technically an appetizer.  So stupid!  Reason enough for me not to return for their basic and unimpressive menu.  The entertainment is kind of cool, but my kids were over it after 10 minutes, and the service was very slow!!"

Totally our fault. We were standing on the wrong door way for a few minutes waiting for the hostess. There was no clear marking on where to find the hostess station. We were standing by the door way, closes to the front entrance, which was not the right place. 

After getting that sorted out, we sat down and the waitress came right away to get our food order, my husband got a pasta dish, with added chicken, which tasted like rubber chicken. i had their appetizer combo (no complains on fry food), my daughter had kid&#39;s popcorn shrimp. My son had their kid&#39;s mac n cheese, which he did not finish. My husband did get a cup of soup as an appetizer. The food took more than 30 minutes to come out to us. The family of 4 sat next to us 15 minutes after we sat down, finished their meal at about the same time. Not sure what happened there. They had an appetizer too. 

Needless to say will not be coming back to here. Will read my reviews before trying a place."

The line to check in was extraordinarily long even given the fact it&#39;s spring break for many surrounding schools. The girl at the check in station seemed completely preoccupied with talking into the microphone clipped to her shirt and looking back into her dining room that was 3/4 empty, despite the number of people waiting for tables. It took 25 minutes to reach the front of the check in line to be greeted with absolutely no greeting at all, the girl continued to talk into her shirt microphone and look at her clipboard rather than greet a customer. After a few minutes she looked at me and asked &#34;how many&#34; upon telling her 4 she told me it would be an hour wait and wrote down 2:03 p.m on our check in card and said &#34;come back at 2:03 and we will be ready for you.&#34; We walked the mall for an hour, came back at 2 pm and waited until 2:15 to inquire about our table. At that time we were told there were 2 parties ahead of us and as soon as they were seated we would get a table. After 5 other parties and another 20 minutes had elapsed I went back to the check in station and it was as if they had forgotten me entirely, but in the face of their own check in card with a check in time 40 minutes past their own original estimate they said I would get the next table. The next named called was indeed mine and we were asked to go stand in yet another line to wait for the hostess to seat us. We waited an additional 10 minutes in this line and upon coming face to face with the hostess she said nothing and merely stuck out her hand for my check in card. The hostess seemed annoyed to even be working and having to seat us. She kept looking back into the dining room and said &#34;they are working on your table it will be ready in a minute, go stand over in the corner and I will get you in a minute.&#34; The hostess then proceeded to sit three other parties, with two of those being parties of 4. At this point I could take more my family and I walked out and went to The Cheesecake Factory where we waited 5 minutes and were seated promptly by an extremely friendly staff. The Rainforest Cafe provided me with the worst restaurant experience I have ever had bar none. Do yourself a favor and skip The Rainforest Cafe in Woodfield Mall, there are many other restaurants in that mall that ACTUALLY value their customers."

This place is fun for the eyes but that party ends there. With the amount of people we had eating there you would think one person would have throughly enjoyed their meal but that just wasn&#39;t the case. The food is just not very good. The problem with that is, you are paying for the decor. Sure the alligator and the fish tank are super kid friendly. But after that all settles in and the kids have seen it all, you still have to eat the food. Slow service too, pricey to top it off. This was a once time only visit."

I got a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger which was huge and good, though at $11 or so, I can get a better burger at Red Robin (also in the mall) for less money and those come with unlimited fries and a much nicer atmosphere. The appetizer sampler we got and my son&#39;s chicken fingers were both good, but again, I could get better food for less money elsewhere.  Most other items were $15-20 for average lunchtime choices.

Speaking of the atmosphere, it&#39;s weird.  Very dark with extremely busy animal prints on the chairs AND tables, along with a strange plastic sculpture of dolphins doing tricks.  On the bright side, most tables are situated very near a number of huge fish tanks with beautiful and large fish in them.  It occasionally gets dark with lights flashing in time with sounds of thunder.. for a few seconds at a time.  This is clearly meant to entertain children but my 2 year old was more distressed than entertained.

In summary, the food, atmosphere, and service were all not nearly as bad as some reviewers say, but if you want to spend that much money you can do a lot better."

Our experience was anything but fun. This was quite honestly the worst meal I&#39;ve had in a long time. It took 10 minutes before our server even came to greet us and take our drink orders, and another 10 before our drinks hit the table (we had water and tea). We placed our food order and proceeded to wait 35 minutes before our food arrived. When we finally received our food, my steak was considerably over the medium rare that I ordered and my shrimp were rubber. Everything on my plate was cold. When the server came to check on us and we relayed our dissatisfaction in regards to the lengthy wait, she said she would have the manager come over. It took another 10 minutes for the manager to stop by, at which point I explained that I didn&#39;t want anything else for fear of having to wait another 35 minutes for that to cook. I left a full over cooked steak and 5 shrimp on the plate,and in the end she took a whole $15 off the charge of my meal. 
The food that was edible on our table was barely so just because it was so bland, and most of that was left behind as well.

Upon receiving the check, it took another 15 for me to pay. They weren&#39;t even that busy. I should have taken that as a sign. Don&#39;t waste your time and money on terrible service and overpriced crap that is barely passable as food."

I have been too busy lately with Midterms, Birthday Party, Finals, work, Anime Central, Flying to Korea, Going to Lollapalooza... Well, I am back! I guess I am a bit wee old to be reviewing Rainforest Cafe, but I tried to tap into my inner child for this one!

Atmosphere:
I digged the rainforest environment actually. It didn&#39;t feel cheesy at all, and it felt like the place could be explored for a good while. I love how awesome their fish tanks were. Seeing all the tropical fish in the big, illuminated tanks were quite a treat. I also enjoyed the timed rainforest events that occurred in timed intervals. I won&#39;t spoil any of them for you. Overall, I feel that the environment is great for kids, bad for dates. It feels really tacky bringing a girl for a date here to be honest. The tables are uncomfortably moist and the bathrooms are horrible.

Food:
For the prices you pay, you will end up being very disappointed. The portion nor the quality is there. I almost skipped on an entree after suffering through the appetizers. The burger I ordered was very lackluster considering it was priced more than traditional gourmet burgers. I would not feed my kids this &#34;food.&#34;

Service:
Our waiter was rather friendly and got into the spirit of the restaurant. Service was fast and prompt. I can really appreciate the enthusiasm he provided us. However, what made this visit worth it was the performer in the fish tank! We so happened to have a table right next to his performance. He was even able to communicate his name to us behind the glass! Aqua George just kept making us smile with his tricks and antics in the tank. It was very hard to ignore him, and I wish the restaurant allowed us to tip him somehow. I can see kids having a great time watching Aqua George do his thing behind the glass with the fishes.

Overall, I would not go back, not even I would take kids here. I&#39;d probably take them to Medieval Times instead. The food is too unsatisfactory and I question the sanitation of the place too much. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and Aqua George. I&#39;d give Aqua George 5 stars if I could, but even he cannot save this place for me."

The sound effects were up loud and the kids enjoyed kid night Wednesdays with a man who did tricks and made them balloon monkeys.

I frequent many types of restaurants from all cultures.  This little shop is near my home and I decided to give it a try after driving by it for years.  It was a Tuesday afternoon around 2pm.  I was the only dine in customer; there were a few takeout orders while I ate.  I can say I was not disappointed!  I ordered their #1 combo that came with a few small dishes, rice, &amp; naan.  All was very tasty!  I told the server I like spicy; the dishes were spicy, but, I could have used more heat.  All in all very good dishes and service was good as well!  4 stars for now and I plan to eat here again!

***Update.  Now 5 stars!  I went here again and wow, the service is amazing!  I went at 2:30PM on a Saturday.  The Buffet goes until 2:30 and the restaurant stays open till 3:30 (then opens later for dinner).  It was the end of the buffet so even though it was offered to me, I decided to order off the menu.  I got their combo #3.  This came with some shrimp, sausage, chicken &amp; naan.  Let me first say, all were very good!  Now, all these dishes are dry, not curry soaked meats.  They let me know that when ordering, but, I said, &#34;that&#39;s ok, I&#39;m happy with this&#34;.  So while waiting for the food, the very friendly server brought me an appetizer (from the closing buffet).  He said, &#34;here is something to eat before your meal comes out&#34;.  Very nice of him!  I also ordered 2 drinks while there.  Both Jack &amp; Coke; however, after the first drink the man informed me they used up the last of their Jack on my first drink.  I said, &#34;That&#39;s ok, Bacardi &amp; Coke is fine&#34;.  He came back with my drink and mentioned he gave a little extra pour due to not having the Jack.  Again, very nice service!  Now, back to my &#39;dry&#39; food.  As you all know, lots of Indian food is in a curry or sauce.  Mine was all dry.  About 2 minutes into my meal my server brought me a dish of what I believe was butter chicken and said something like this, &#34;Here sir, your dish is dry, here is something to dip your naan in&#34;.  Wow!  Just great service.  I will be back and thanks for a great dining experience!"

I thought of it, talked about it, told my friend I would bring him here to eat their wonderful food. 
When we did go there, I was dismayed to see they were closed with a sign on the door saying they wouldn&#39;t be reopening &#39;til mid-month. I was so disappointed, because I thought we wouldn&#39;t be in the area long enough to come back then.
As it turned out, our departure was put off so we were there on the day they reopened and I brought us there for lunch. 
They have a lunch buffet, and I guess they assume that is what someone wants when they come in at that time because they didn&#39;t bring menus, just said, &#34;Go help yourself.&#34; We did, and it wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t marvelous or memorable like the dinner I had had previously.
I suppose the buffet is designed to satisfy the broadest range of customers, we however prefer things really spicy and hot, so the food seemed bland to us. It was a mistake for us not to order the menu item where we could specify the desired level of heat.
Unfortunately, we did leave before getting the chance to go back and give them another try."

The food here was ok overall. We had the vegetable samosa, chicken makhani, chicken keema, aloo paratha, garlic naan, vegetable biryani, and mango lassi.

Vegetable samosas I enjoyed, chicken makhani good, chicken keema not so great I was expecting ground chicken meat not diced and not spicy at all, aloo paratha not much potato filled either, garlic naan ok kinda dry, vegetable biryani was decent aromatic, and mango lassi ok.

Nothing made me want more or enthusiastic about the meal. I asked for chili peppers and I received sliced jalapeños not hot enough.  Our waiter forgot our drinks they came out after our appetizer."

Having a craving for Indian food, I searched for a lunch buffet and found this place on line.  I arrived early for lunch 11:40, shortly after opening but there were still 4 other tables seated already.  I waited by the front for 5 minutes waiting for someone to come out and seat me.  Finally someone emerged from the back and point to a table for me.  I waited at the table for a menu, drink offer... nothing, I finally just got up and served myself at the buffet.  

The buffet was weak, iceburg lettuce with some onions for the salad, naan bread, rice and a few other options then a separate container with tandori chicken and another chicken entrée.  The tandori chicken was dry, had very little flavor and the temperature was not hot.  They were slow on replenishing the buffet.  

As far as service, while I was at the buffet, my water glass was filled.  That was the last time I received any service at all.  I drank my water and spent 3/4 of my lunch with no beverage, no one ever came out from behind to flag down.  Finally, no one brought my check, I stood at the front desk for 5 or 6 minutes when someone came to answer the phone, took my outstretched card and swiped it.  No where was there a price or sign for the buffet, at no time did I receive a menu, never received a check.  Just kind of sketchy over all. 

Summary, service was terrible, food was...meh.  I would not return."

They came in the flimsiest tin containers with cardboard lids. Everything was saran wrapped and the contents still leaked out. It was a huge mess dealing with the saran wrap while these containers held the curry. I understand trying to cut costs but this was beyond cheap. You can&#39;t even hold the tin containers without them warping in your hand.

The food was decent, but the butter chicken was missing something and didn&#39;t taste right. The chicken tikka was good and the rice they served was decent as well. I just can&#39;t get over these containers..."

I&#39;ve never had any luck finding a good Indian restaurant in the area. Years ago, I lived in Scotland for a bit and believe it or not every little town had an Indian restaurant, and a good one! All over the U.K. it&#39;s like this. Here, not so much.

Anyway, based on Yelpers decided to give this place a go and see how their food measures up.

Ordered Chicken curry, Shrimp curry, Tandoori chicken, Saag Paneer, and Naan bread.
The food was..........only OK. I think that the chicken curry and the naan bread were the highlights. Neither of us cared for the Saag Paneer which is sort of like a spinach with cheese. We each only had a couple forkfuls of it and then left it.

Prices are not cheap. Why is Indian food so expensive, I wonder.

Service was friendly.

Still looking for a knock out Indian place so if you have one, share the info please.

Cheers to All"

I have skipped this place so many times going to woodfield mall  , it seems like hole in the wall of a place but go inside and it&#39;s pretty nice and beautiful I would say it needs a modern touch but once I get to the food that won&#39;t matter. 

Food: 5 out of 5 THIS HAS TO BE THE BEST INDIAN FOOD I EVER HAD. So let me explain , the butter Chicken (a staple in North Indian food) has to be the best I ever had and I have been eating Indian food my whole life from across different countries. For vegetarian people out there try the panner makhni. 
The lamb and shrimp were great to. My boyfriend ordered the fish ... Which was okay but both of us were so pleased with every other dish we had , we are never going to any other Indian restaurant as far as north India goes. 

Service: So on both occasions I had different experiences there is a lady , which is very sweet but her service could improve (probably the owner) 
But there is also a young server who is always there and he rocks !! He gave us a 5 star service on a busy Friday night! 

Overall. If you are in the Schaumburg area I would highly recommend this place if in the mood for Indian or even just in general."

The Chicken Makhani (aka Butter Chicken) is great.   The Naan bread is freshly baked to order, not like other places with stale, day old bread.   The prices are reasonable, but it works out better if you come in for the buffet.   The only down side is that the rice and naan are not included with the entree and have to be ordered separately."

They helped us pick out something we would like based on our preferences, and even gave us a free dessert. I would recommend take-out versus dine-in, however.

I&#39;m not a Butter Chicken guy, but wife and kids loved it. The Lamb Rogan Josh... GREAT!!! And it may seem a small thing, but the Naan was GREAT too. I&#39;m a bit of a bread snob, and so most places just have &#34;ok&#34; bread to me.

The restaurant was slow, but carry-out was pretty busy.  Service was a little slow, especially with the lack of in-house diners.  That said, the server was very friendly, responsive to questions and had no problems offering suggestions and achieving the right spice &#34;level&#34;.  I asked for medium to hot.  It could have been hotter, but was close.
I started with two samosas, potato and veg filled and fried to just the right crispy.  Properly spiced and very tasty.  I would definitely order again.  I ordered the lamb do piazo (onions and tomato in a thick, well-flavored, tomato sauce.  It seemed like a small portion, but I was quite filled when I finished my meal.  I got the naan instead of the rice.  This was absolutely the right choice and was as good as any I have had anywhere.  The pic in the copper bowl here on the Yelp site appears to be it.  I would return and try several more dishes."

I&#39;m giving it 4 stars only because I prefer a sit down restaurant with no TV, however the server did turn the volume down once more guests came in.

The most important part is the food, and which is why I gave them five stars. The lamb pasanda, rogan josh and butter chicken , by far if not the best I ever had. My wife and I licked the plate clean. The naan is even the most perfect naan I have had to date.

We had decided on kabob&#39;s and a couple sides but our waiter (Raul) very politely suggested we try a couple dishes with their gravy&#39;s and seasonings as that was their specialty.  We took his suggestion and ordered the Rogan Josh and Chicken Makhani with rice and Naan.  Absolutely incredible.  Raul regularly checked in on us to ensure we enjoyed the food and it met our expectations.  Needless to say the service was as good as the food which made the entire experience fantastic.

We got there and they were closed, despite the internet saying they&#39;d be open. So we decided on Indian and went to Clay Oven and THEY were closed - dang! So our third choice was New Delhi, which I had eaten at years ago. It turned out to be an inspired choice! 

One woman in our party had never had Indian food before, so our server (the owner&#39;s son) took great pains to explain what she might like. He brought us free appetizers and a little dessert so she could taste them. A great way to make customers for life! 

I got the #1 vegetarian thali and it was outstanding. One friend and I had eaten at Gaylord in Schaumburg a couple of weeks ago and New Delhi blew them away in terms of quality, taste, presentation and service. I will never go back to Gaylord after eating at New Delhi. 

My friends each got chicken dishes and naan and they were all very satisfied. I will go back here again and again.

I&#39;ve been struggling to find a go to Indian restaurant since the heartbreaking closure of Himalayan Restaurant on Army Trail Rd. Thankfully, I think my search is over. We had the chicken tikka masala, a lamb dish, and a lentil veggie. Everything was delicious, and the lamb was super tender. Also, the garlic naan may be the best I&#39;ve ever had.

I have given this place a fair amount of chances and sampled multiple items to date on their menu before writing this review. Their curries (veg and non-veg) are merely a gradation of the orange color made with varying amounts of heavy cream and tomato. So bad! I do not recommend this place to anyone. You think you can pass this fare as food to customers for money? My taste buds have died after tasting your food. I had to trash my to-go entrees.

Since my mother is from Delhi and having spent quite a few of my childhood days there, I had to try it out, if only for the namesake.  
It was Diwali night,  so a very good occasion to go out for some Indian cuisine.  The restaurant was quiet, it was still early as far as indian dinner time goes, but did get quite busy towards the end.  Im not sure If I can attest to the restaurant being busy for popularity or because of it being an indian holiday.  Anyhow, we ordered the non veg platter appetizer to start, and to drink they have few indian beers in the real size bottles, yes the big ones, so that was a plus.  The appetizer was good the samosa was great, crunchy and flavorful and the meats, boti kabab and shiekh kebab were really good too.  Was not too impressed with the pakoras, doughy and a little salty.  For mains we had chicken tikka masala and goat curry along with garlic naan, roti and rice for accompaniment.  The goat curry was absolutely delicious, just like you find in the good restaurants of new delhi.  The meat was tender and the sauce was perfect, not too oily and very scrumptious.  The tikka masala was good too.  We ordered the tikka masala spicy but it was more of a medium level.  We will now know that if we need spicy to ask for very spicy, each restaurant has their own way of gaging spice.  The naan and roti was very good fresh and hot.  The service was polite they could use more hands, too many people doing too many things, Diwali night could not have helped.  The price resonable and the ambiance decent, nothing too elaborate and not shabby.  I will go back there for the goat curry alone...and of course the name."

I walked into this restaurant hoping for a dinner takeaway. I was craving Indian and didn&#39;t want to settle for a frozen meal, but I also didn&#39;t have the time to whip one up from scratch.

I have NEVER encountered such rude service in my entire life. This is no exaggeration. I said I wanted to get a carryout, and the man (manager? owner?) barked, &#34;What do you want?&#34; and spent two minutes glaring at me rather than handing me a menu.

They had some decent-sounding dinner offer taped on the entrance, so I asked for that. &#34;No.&#34; .... No? Why no? &#34;No.&#34; Ooookay. I finally got a menu, but the way he had behaved really sank in while I was looking it over. He walked away and wasn&#39;t paying any attention to me when I was about to order something, so I just walked out. I was not about to be sponsoring this jerk&#39;s behaviour.

New Delhi Restaurant unfortunately isn&#39;t one of those, but that&#39;s not due to a lack of quality; in fact, it may be the best Indian food I&#39;ve had so far in the northwest suburbs.

I won&#39;t pretend to be an Indian food connoisseur; I usually get some kind of korma or curry and call it a day, and I couldn&#39;t tell you the difference between Murg Jalfrazi and Rogan Josh or Northern and Southern cuisine if my life depended on it. With that being said, the dishes I&#39;ve eaten here have all been excellent. The Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Curry, Chicken Keema Masala &amp; Paneer Makhani were rich, oily and generously spiced, and with 4 dishes I still haven&#39;t had a bad experience.

I would recommend ordering it takeout though, and it seems that&#39;s what most people do - service can be slow and the ambiance can be a little weird (re: empty). Still, at this point it&#39;s the best takeout Indian north of the Elgin-O&#39;Hare."

But oh well, I decided to give it a shot. I ordered a to-go since I was not convinced in trying the place.
The very basic paneer makhani, biryani and naan. The quantity seemed pretty good portion. The paneer makhani looked a little funky, and the taste almost felt like instead of adding Indian spices they added Italian. I could taste the parsley and some flavours of ragu pasta sauce. Disappointed!!
Biryani was not even great I felt the biryani was a simple veggie pulav since there was no biryani masala.
My only surprise is how are these folks still managing to be in business since they do not classify as an indian food restaurant."

The food overall is rather bland, which for Indian food is saying a lot. We have had the chana masala, dal vanjara, lamb vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, etc. all very bland. They do make it hot if you ask for spicy, but then it is about the equivalent of peppery water. The only food worth going back for was the samosa which are very good. The naan, both garlic and plain, are mediocre. Last night, which was a Monday, took almost an hour to get a takeout order, which they had said would only take 35 mins.  There was hardly anyone eating in the restaurant, so they weren&#39;t busy. Won&#39;t bother again, Cool Mirchi is much better, just wish they had better hours."

In terms of staff, I thought they were quite attentive, so there were no problems with service.We had samosas to start with that were too doughy, and not samosa like. 

Food was a bit pricey as you would think that your main would come served with rice, for which it doesn&#39;t. They didn&#39;t tell us this, I just said I presume that comes with rice to which they answered no. So $9-$14 for mains without rice is a bit pricey when rice is a minimum of $4. We had the chicken tikka masala and chicken makhani which I felt served their purpose. We wanted indian food, we got it and left quite full. The naan bread was nice too and as we left the place was getting busy.

 I&#39;d recommend if it&#39;s indian food you want, be prepared to pay though. I think the lunch option could be good as it&#39;s a buffet for something like $7.95."

My mother and I walked in to have lunch at the end of the lunch rush. We walked in with a group of men and women behind us. When we walked in we were ignored because the manager knew the group of people behind that were just coming in. He shook one of the men&#39;s hands and told them they could have anything off the menu because not much was left for the buffet. He waved in our general direction and asked if we were with them. Obviously we weren&#39;t so he told us to look at the buffet and whatever was left in there was all they had after about 5 minutes of standing there. That was it. He looked at us as if we were dirt on the bottom of his shoe. I will never go back there again, there are far better places where I will take my business.

As usual with corporate places where there&#39;s a large building leasing out to different companies, there&#39;s a cafe. Don&#39;t get me wrong about the 4 stars, its really about 3.5 Like all the other cafes this place serves what is essentially nothing more than corporate-grade school food. There&#39;s hardly any seasoning, everything is way overpriced, portions are small, etc. 

I ordered a meatball sub which was a little over $6 and came with no sides or drink. I chose sweet peppers instead of hot peppers. What really drives it up to about 3.5 is that they really perfect the little things, the sandwich is put in a toaster where the cheese is melted to perfection and the bread is just warmed enough so that it feels like it just came out of the oven.   

As always with these, they&#39;re great every once in awhile or when you have to scarf down food quickly before a meeting, but there&#39;s plenty of other places out there with better food and lower prices."

Yes most of it is bland and tasteless, but it is at least edible.  The amazing thing is the process.  I have always thought they were overpriced for what you got, but their recent revamp of the menu had pushed me past my limits.  I haven&#39;t gotten an omelet from there for breakfast in months, but today I was hungry so I got one.  Wow is all I can say.  It is miniscule.  I weigh my food daily because of dietary reasons, so I know my omelets previously ranged from .81 to .94lbs.  Today it was .49 lbs.  Note this is still right at half a pound, so I am not complaining that I will go hungry, but....the price still remains the same.  So a half pound omelet and a large drink cost me $7.41.  AND THAT IS THE LAST TIME THAT WILL HAPPEN.  

What looks me is their lack of selection.  Nowhere can you just get a hard boiled egg there.  How about a cold plate that is a hard boiled egg and avocado?  That would be a great option...but it would also probably cost $10."

It&#39;s a really nice location, with a ton of seating surrounded by indoor trees and a glass ceiling. Definitely a nice work place food area. 

Food is overpriced (3.50 for 1 hot dog, $7 for whatever the special is) but the food is not bad at all. Their paninis are yummy, my coworkers are obsessed with the cheddar cheese soup (they think it&#39;s some kind of aphrodisiac I think), I would die for their fries (a single order is quite big for under $2), awesome cookies albeit way overpriced.  The service is great, I love all the workers.

We get catering from them for clients quite often. They are always on time or a few minutes early, set everything up, the food is always good (we&#39;ve done sandwiches, wraps, veggie &amp; regular lasagna, chicken alfredo pasta)...it&#39;s all super tasty and I&#39;m a happy camper when there are leftovers I can take home like a scavenger. 

I would never venture here just to eat, but if you work in the Schaumburg Corporate Center it&#39;s a great option for lunch. Pro-tip: Buy a drink from Matt &amp; Dennis in the convenience store for $1 instead of buying one from Deli Time for $2. :)"

We most recently spent New Year&#39;s Eve and it was probably the worst experience we have ever had. Once seated it was 35 minutes before our drink orders were taken, another 40 minutes before we received the drinks and another 25 minutes before our first dish arrived (this was a 6 course dinner). Around us every table was complaining and we saw at least one large group just get up and leave because of the service - we wished we had done the same.

My food was good - excellent soup, ri b - eye was cooked well, the berry sorbet was a pallette cleanser and the creme brulee was better than most.

We have eaten here about half a dozen times and always walk away feeling that it just should be a better experience than it actually was. I think this will probably be our last visit."

When they have enough staff to help, it seems like things go pretty well. Something tells me though from the mgmt side of things that the business aspect needs help.

We get there and there is no host.  Very confusing. After waiting around for about 5 minutes, the harried host arrives and tells us it will be about a 25 minute wait (even though we arrived on time for our &#34;reservation&#34;) TIP- a reservation means nothing here.  The host explains it is so busy he has to wait tables.  Many other confused people arrive to no host and I am practically forced into that role.  Finally we are seated and the (very nice) host is now our waiter.  Food was just OK, nothing wowed me.  Bread was a bit doughy; almost seemed undercooked.  My chicken cavatappi pasta dish in a cream sauce was a bit too heavy and buttery.  My husband enjoyed his steak.  Only went to this weird place because we had a gift card. They need to get it together here. Will not go back."

I went there with family for their Sunday brunch. Totally worth it. I really loved their buffet style but they also personalize and cook in front of you. My omelette was so good. If i didn&#39;t fill up on other things I&#39;d have gotten two. They even had a pasta station which was yummy. I liked it. We got a table right by the window and my daughter loved that she could look outside while eating. The pond view was frozen and pretty. The bill sounds high but you eat all you want so i feel like its completely fair! I had maybe 3 dishes myself which at any other place may have been $10+ a dish. The men got prime rib twice! (And a pile of other yummies) I believe it was really worth it. Like a buffet you just get up and grab more food. It was about $140 for 4 adults and 2 kids. And for the adults it comes with a mimosa! Loved that! It is like vacation in a glass. All that said, Id go back for brunch :)"

We had a reservation made and called in to change it from 730 to 8pm. We were told &#34;no problem, it is taken care of&#34;

And then when we get there at 8pm, they said &#34;it is a 30 minute wait for your table&#34; -- wait what? We made a reservation! And when we called literally 30 min ago you did not tell us about any wait?!

They said &#34;it is like any reservation, it is not guaranteed&#34; - I don&#39;t know what planet you operate on, but do not allow a customer to make a reservation for a table if it would be no different than a customer walking in without a reservation and waiting!

After finishing my workout at the neighboring hotel I decided I wanted to have something light to finish up the evening. I reviewed the menu here and it sounded like it had some decent choices, so I went. I started off with the beet salad and that was my first mistake. It not only took them 45 minutes to get me my beet salad (Were they roasting the beats to order?) but when the salad came to the table the &#34;balsamic syrup drizzle&#34; was more like a &#34;balsamic syrup WATERFALL&#34;. Yikes! After scraping away the waterfall disaster I tried one of the beats. That was my second mistake. The wrinkly, overcooked and squishy beat was not appetizing what so ever! I decided to stop with the salad at that point. Next for dinner was the Roasted Artichoke Ravioli. This only took them 30 minutes. We can call this my 3rd mistake... The ravioli was filled with a mushy textured undecipherable puree and then covered with canned artichoke hearts, un-rehydrated sundried tomatoes and the worst textured pesto I have ever had in my life. It had a texture almost like peanut butter. There was no way I was going to try a dessert. 

Atmosphere = 22 out of 25 
The dining room is nicely set and the view I had over looked a nice fountain that lit up at night. The music was ok but a little out of place for a &#34;fine dining atmosphere&#34;. Tables were set nicely set and all silverware at my table seemed to be polished.

Service = 6 out of 25
The service was SLOW. Both drinks and food took forever to get out to the table. Being a 1 top in a restaurant with only a 3rd of its dining room filled  I expected to get done with 2 courses in less than 2 hours.

I too made the mistake of ordering King Crab rolls.  Lesson learned, don&#39;t order such a thing from a hotel restaurant.

Service was good and the bread was fresh but that&#39;s about it.

The pasta with shrimp pappardelle was - MEH.  it&#39;s rehydrated pasta with canned artichokes.  there is really nothing else around so I guess you have no choice but to eat here.

I looked around the website to see who the executive chef was but couldn&#39;t find a name. perhaps its because it would be embarassing."

I even asked our waiter if I could but the dressing but he said they make their own so I was outta luck. Next i had the filet medallions with shrimps on top of them and my gf had the stuffed salmon. Both of our entrees were deeeeeeeelish! They actually made a mistake on my order and gave me 3 filet medallions instead of 2 so it was even better! Yummmmmmy! The steaks were soft and tender just how i like it. Lastly we had the passion fruit creme brulee and praline ice cream for dessert. I really enjoyed my creme brulee and the only reason i couldnt finish it was cuz i ate my entire entree. Our waiter (i think his name was Dale) was super friendly and funny too!

I was expecting fine dining being that its with the Hilton resort and from a quick peruse of the menu online.  The appetizer we ordered was the king crab rolls.  Fresh from the frig these tastless rolls were served with an overpowering sauce.  Whomever cooked the rice was clever enough to make it both over and under cooked.  The bread course came with four topping options served in a candle holder.  Butter, garlic butter, tapenade (very dry), and hummus were the options.  The hummus/tapenade combo made me think of 
someone wearing stripes and polka dots at the same time.  We all know 
this only works for clowns so I can only assume our chef was busy making balloon animals instead of watching our food cook.  The jokes continued with my entree.  The mashed potatoes were so thick that I could lift them all at once with my fork and they still held their oddly extruded shape.  My husband had a chicken dish that was covered with a think slab of cheese hiding the bones and gristle that lay in wait underneath.  His meal was also served with cafeteria potato triangles.  Tasty but not classy.  I do love a good juxtaposition but this missed the mark.  Dessert was microwaved bread pudding with ice cream and a giant spun sugar disk.  Perhaps the giant disk was a visual prepared by our clown chef meant to warn us like a sugary stop sign.  Did I mention my iced tea was from a powder mix? I was so shocked that they couldn&#39;t be bothered to brew a tea.  61 dollars and 2 hours of mine lost forever at the Shiraz big top."

Asked waiter to take our dinner order right away because we had plans for the evening. He took our orders and then we waited. Soup and salad were served after about 15 minutes.  And then the long wait began. After having been seated for an hour and forty minutes, we called over the front of the house person and requested that our orders be cancelled and we be given the check. Not surprisingly, our food appeared out of the kitchen. Cold where it should have been hot, plates just kind of thrown together. After the long wait, we were rushed through our meal, no apologies were given and we were promptly presented the bill. One in our party had convinced the rest of us to stay put and wait to be served, or we would have and should have left. Terrible service, kitchen can only have been total chaos. The restaurant was only half full, no excuse that they were too busy. The pretty much have a captive audience with resort goers, and their attitude represents that. Hilton should be ashamed.

I ordered the jumbo steak burrito, which is the reason of the -2 stars. I asked to have rice put inside also, which was fine. The burrito was lukewarm, which also isn&#39;t a deal breaker since there were plenty of &#34;cold&#34; ingredients inside. The biggest issue was the meat. It was like a shredded beef type of deal. I was expecting diced steak like carne asada style. It was extremely dry since it was shredded. I couldn&#39;t eat more than half of the burrito, which was a total let down. 

We also had a vegetarian burrito, chips and salsa, and horchata. I didn&#39;t try the vegetarian burrito, but you can&#39;t really mess the rest up either. Very sad that the size of the salsa is much smaller than I remember. I would&#39;ve ordered two if I had known.

On the bright side, a generous three stars for the best salsa I&#39;ve ever had and for the same friendly workers. 

Will come back to order a large salsa in the future."

You can tell the quality of a Mexican joint by its menudo. This is a traditional Mexican soup usually served only on weekends. Not for the faint of heart. Theirs is top notch. All the rest is just typical Mexican rice and beans you can get anywhere. Great friendly service.

The service was decent. Not the best, but was fine.. My real issue was with the actual food.

I ordered Enchiladas Poblanas with chicken, my wife ordered steak tacos. I asked the waitress if the mole was homemade, she said yes, but her body language said, &#34;I&#39;m not really sure.&#34; I went against my better judgement and ordered anyway.


The food came out fast.. Too fast. When it arrived at the table there was an overwhelming aroma of beef broth.. The food smelled like someone mixed hot water with beef broth powder. I brushed it off until I actually tasted my food.. The mole came straight out of can or pouch.. There is no way it was homemade.. If it was.. That&#39;s just wrong. I took a bite of the rice and it too had a strange flavor profile and texture.. Like a granulated chicken or beef powder.. It was bizarre.

I took a bite of one my wife&#39;s steak tacos and it tasted like roast beef!!!! She agreed. What&#39;s up with that! Appalling.

Friends, if you are looking for a true Mexican food experience, look elsewhere, the flavor profiles here are WAY OFF. If you&#39;re a real Mexican food fan, there&#39;s no way you can think this is good food."

I would give this place 3 1/2 stars - 4 stars for food, 3 for service/atmosphere. Many people seem to take out from here, and I can understand why. The atmosphere is very...&#34;hole in the wall&#34; (not quite that bad). It&#39;s not fancy by any means. However, these are the places that usually have the best food. 

Our waitress came by to take our drink and food order, but never came back. They got really busy and she was basically doing everything (aka they need more people). They have quite the extensive menu - authentic Mexican and &#34;Americanized Mexican&#34; choices. I ordered the taco dinner - 3 soft shell tacos with your choice of meat and it comes with beans and rice. You can get it Mexican or American style...Mexican! Duh!! Why would I ever want Americanized food at a Mexican restaurant?! People who order that...for shame! :)

Anyways. The food was great - flavorful, came out fast, the horchata was wonderful, no complaints. We had some leftovers, but needed to ask for boxes at the counter, as well as our check. So, if you order to go, you get some great food for cheap. If you dine in, you&#39;re not going to get the best service."

My family and I have been going here for years. I recommend this place to everyone I know. It is a nice, good old fashioned family owned business, and that really makes a difference. The owner, Francisco, is a really great guy, he always greets me with a handshake and even a hug. The employees here always remember regulars and are very welcoming and polite to newcomers. 
Their food is the most delicious and fresh Mexican food I have ever had. It has an authentic taste, and all the ingredients are fresh. This place puts other Mexican restaurants to shame. Not to mention the prices are great, and eating here isn&#39;t going to break the bank, even when you bring the whole family. 
I am a vegetarian and sometimes it is hard to find good food locally that is meat free. They have an entire section of their menu for vegetarian and even vegan options. I recommend the Jumbo Veggie Burrito! Vegetarians and meat eaters alike will be satisfied here!
Their hours are great too, in high school this was a great hang out for my friends and I, as they are open late on weekends, and friendly to young kids. When you live in the suburbs it&#39;s sometimes hard to find somewhere to hang out for underage kids late at night.
This restaurant, while not the most glamourous in decor, is always clean and neat, and the wait to be served is never long.
There is literally a Taco Bell located in the same parking lot, and yet business at La Taq does not suffer at all.

The modest dining room has 18 tables that would be at home in a diner serving pancakes and eggs. But here, the food is surprising refined. The ubiquitous chips and salsa brought to the table were fresh, flavorful and crisp. I started with horchata (finally - with actual spices) which was delightful. 
I&#39;m a sucker for flautas so I ordered one chicken ($2.00). It was surprisingly large and was crisp, hot and flavorful. 
For my entree I ordered mixed steak and chicken fajitas. Apparently, the tortillas CAN come to the table piping hot as they did here. (Take note Chili&#39;s - you lied). 
The chicken steak and veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly in a lightly seasoned sauce. Rice, beans and cheese rounded out the ensemble. 
In a word - sublime.

Delicious chips and salsa starts you off. The meal came very quickly. A large plate of 3 nice sized double shelled corn steak tacos with generous toppings and choice of house sauces. The steak is moist and flavorful and not much grizzle. The rice is actually good here, which I find is rare. The beans are excellent topped with cheese melted in.

I basically refuse to get tacos from anywhere else in the area because they just are not as good or authentic. 

Their tacos, tortas, and jumbo burritos are my go-to when craving quick, cheap Mexican food.  I usually go with the al pastor (absurdly good pork shoulder cooked slow with chilis, spices, and pineapple) or carne asada (grilled steak). If you are going to get tacos though, you have to get them Mexican style (cilantro and onion) with a squeeze of lime and the salsa of your choice (green or red). Their guacamole is pretty delicious and salsa is good too, which if you dine in you get a free basket of chips and salsa.  

Side note: They also offer &#34;american style&#34; (lettuce, tomato) for those that have sadly been brainwashed by poor excuses for Mexican restaurants like the near by Taco Bell.  

The owner is also almost always there and will remember you if you go back a few times which is always nice.  Go to this place if you like real Mexican food and you will not be disappointed."

I don&#39;t agree with other reviews about the atmosphere, as I think it is quite comfortable and relaxed. I like the painting on the wall a lot. The owner usually comes out to welcome you and shake your hand. I&#39;ve had the three taco combo dinner (carne asada) and the chimichanga  (also carne asada). I honestly enjoyed both and found them both flavorful, but I usually just get the chimichanga now. The prices are average compared to other Mexican sit down places, about $10-$12 per person. I&#39;ve had the ground beef tacos, but found that they could use a bit more seasoning, though not worth dinging this place a star though because I&#39;ve been satisfied every time I go."

The flavor was off and this &#34;meat&#34; had been sitting all day. The Milanesa for the tortas was tough and lacked flavor. I felt like I was eating cardboard. My sons quesadilla was greasy and burnt. Service was awful as well. No one came to check on is after the food hit the table. Major disappointment. This is very comparable to Taco Bell."

Since my regular Mexican joint was closed already, I thought I would give another place in the area a try. I ordered a &#34;chicken&#34; torta with everything on it over the phone. I was pretty surprised at the size and weight of the torta when j got it. But was pretty disappointed after my first bite. 
1.) I guess a chicken torta at this place = chicken Milanesa torta (fried chicken piece)
2). Bread was dry and slightly stale tasting.
3.) Big chunks of onion, not a lot of cheese 

On a positive note, it was $5.25 with tax for the torta and that included avocado on it, which is usually considered &#34;extra&#34; at other Mexican restaurants. 

But overall, their chicken torta was not up to par with my all time favorite Mexican late night joint, El Burrito Fanastico in Roselle."

I come here pretty frequently, but sometimes I take a few months of a break from this place...and every time I come back the owner remembers me and shakes my hand every time.

The service is great. You start off with chips and salsa while you wait for your food. The salsa is extremely good. The chips are pretty decent, but sometimes we get chips that seem older and more stale. Your meal comes out within 10-15 minutes even with a whole group of people! It&#39;s really quick! 

My personal favorite food which I get 80% of the time are the lengua Mexican style tacos. Their tacos are absolutely delicious and are extremely affordable. I highly suggest either or both the lengua and steak tacos.

Pros:

+ The prices are great
+ Portions are generous 
+ Menu selection is decent

Cons:

- Guacamole that came with a side of chips we ordered tasted like it has mayo in it, not real avocados, yuck

Our group ordered avocado tostadas (which had real avocados) chicken hard shell tacos. Both were excellent. For three people including a soft drink a a side of chips we came to just over $20!

This place has decent food. The burritos are large and filling, and reheat well the next day. 

My daughter likes their quesadillas and the guacamole, and the child&#39;s size is pretty decent. Enough to reheat the next day.

My husband usually gets the tacos or a burrito, but he&#39;s not really set on anything.
He says my problem is that I compare everything to Lomeli&#39;s. It&#39;s hard not to! They have the most amazing mexican food I have ever had. Everything else just pales in comparison.

It&#39;s not La Taqueria&#39;s fault. Their food is good, and better than some of the other places we&#39;ve tried in the area. Whenever we have a taste for mexican food we always get it from here, but if you have the time I highly recommend driving out to Lomeli&#39;s. 

So, overall, good mexican food for the immediate area, but it doesn&#39;t hold up against other restaurants in the chicagoland area as a whole. The prices are easy on the wallet, and the amount of food is plentiful enough for more than one meal."

Found out about this place from my son&#39;s neighbor. The husband brings tacos home from work every Friday. Sounds good to me...always out to find good food.

We have had carry out from here about 5 times and have never had anything mediocre. Everything is full of flavor! My family loves to eat and we are not shy about trying anything. So far we have had tacos, mexican and american styles: chicken, beef, tongue and tripe. Our favorite taco is the tripe. I think they fry it after cooking it so it is tender inside and crispy outside, and not chewy....very delicious!

We have had the burritos too: they are filled to the max with everything you can think of and there is no additional charge for the toppings. Steak was juicy tasty and plenty. My husband could only eat half. My favorite was the chile relleno burrito. It was soooo good, I could not stop eating it. Licked my fingers when I was done. Would have licked the plate, but my husband stopped me.  The red and green sauces were both good, but realistically, the food was so flavorful you didn&#39;t need to use them...but of course, we did!

Tortas were excellent: big, flavorful, gooey sandwiches. Included all the toppings you wanted.  The al pastor torta is definitely, by far, our favorite.  Of course we could not skip having the tamales...perfect too.  Menudo...this is usually found in restaurants only on Saturday and Sundays...this place has it every day.  It was so good for dinner, but just as good the next day for breakfast...yummy!!!

Before I forget...the owner is a super guy. He makes a point of welcoming you and thanking you for coming. When I went to pick up my first order, he introduced me to the guy in line ahead of me...told me he has been coming by for the past 10 years...even knew his name. Now that is some owner...who takes the time to know his customers and treats everyone like family.

This has been a neighborhood favorite of mine for about 6+ years. Every time I go here I feel welcomed by the great owner. 

Food:
I love their gigantic food selection. I have enjoyed a variety of things over the years from their quesadilla to the tacos. You really can&#39;t go wrong with their Mexican selection. Though, I have never and probably will never try their American selection. My favorite however are their burritos! They are always full of flavor and packed with all the ingredients! The tomatoes and Avocado taste ripe and juicy. The meat is tender and flavorful! And the rice isn&#39;t bad at all with not too much sour cream. Every chew is a fusion of Mexican flavor that I thoroughly enjoy. The free chips quality always varies from stale to fresh, but their salsa is always good.

Pro tips:
Their Guacamole sucks, never get it. I think they put mayo in it :(

Never have a Jumbo Steak Burrito and Horchata together. It won&#39;t feel good coming out lol.

Service:
Service is always fast and friendly. Food usually comes out within 5 - 8 minutes even with groups of 5. I have also never have met such a nice owner! He always takes the time to stop doing what he is doing to shake my had and say hello. He even calls me &#34;Brother.&#34; I have never in my whole life felt valued as a customer. Even if I am gone for 6 months he still remembers me. If you start to come semi frequent, he will remember you!

Atmosphere:

Hole in the wall place. It got a lot bigger with the remodeling. Not much to look at, but the place is always clean with plenty of space. Place could use a little music, but it doesn&#39;t matter unless you go alone. Which I rarely do. The free wifi is also very fast.

The price was really good as well for the amount I got.  I was full after eating only half the sandwich.

It was 9:00 on a Monday night, and I was thisclose to pulling into Taco Bell as my default taco option, when I saw &#34;TAQUERIA&#34; lit up on a sign practically next door. Never wanting to lose an opportunity to try something new (without having the wife complain about the food) I walked in and grabbed three tacos.

I ordered an asada (steak), chicharron (pork skin) and chorizo con huevos (Spanish sausage with eggs). I also decided to have them with sour cream and cheese.

Excellent, all around. The red and green salsa is very flavorful but not terribly hot, and I&#39;m glad fresh limes were thrown in for free. All of the meat was cooked well, although I thought the chicharron would be crispy for some reason (it wasn&#39;t, which was fine). Abundant amounts of cilantro and grilled onion. And, the guy that was there shakes your hand as he hands you your meal.

The store also passes the &#34;do Hispanic people eat here?&#34; test with flying colors, as even at 9:15 there were quite a few Hispanic people in the restaurant.

I&#39;d like to try their horchata and chips as well, and their desayunos. But I think I may have found my preferred near-Carol Stream authentic Mexican food place... and gone to Taco Bell for the last time."

I like my meats and the Polish and Italians know their meats (Polish Sausage/Polish Ham - Italian Sausage/Italian salami and pepperoni). 

This was my second visit to this place. There still have many products from Italy. That is pretty cool. They serve good meats and cheese. They also carry Boers Head! This is, in my opinion, the best top meats you can buy.

Located in a strip mall, this very clean deli had great service and people. Definitely KD&#39;s (Polish) in Schaumburg and Felicia&#39;s has a lot in common when it comes to meats. They take a lot of pride in them.

FYI they also make sandwiches. Order an Italian sandwich and you will not be disappointed. With Boer Heads meat."

Not only is all the food wonderful, they are the best kind of people. I ordered Thanksgiving dinner and then one of my employees called out of work so I was never able to leave and pick up the food. The owner, Jim came and found me at my other job then he drove all the way back to the deli, got my food and brought it to me! I am sure after a crazy holiday week that it was the last thing anyone would want to do but he went above and beyond to make sure we had food for the holiday. I am forever grateful! Shop small/family owned! There is no way Walmart would have done that!"

Went in today, they didn&#39;t make any soup because it had been too warm out. The older woman (possibly owner?) oddly looked annoyed with me for asking. Deli&#39;s generally always have soup no matter what the weather. So I just went with a simple tuna sandwich on wheat bread. I asked if they can toast it, but they said they didn&#39;t have a toaster. No problem there. The sandwich was nice and large, however the tuna had very little flavor, almost bland and the tomato to sandwich ratio was way off. One very small, thin piece of tomato, when three or four would have sufficed. I took photos for reference. Quite disappointed."

This morning around 11:30 am I came into the deli looking to try a nice fresh and homemade deli sandwich.  When you walk into the store you&#39;ll notice it is quite tiny, but the way it is setup it allows for you to browse the entire store.  The best way is to walk in and to keep to your right and work your way around to the deli and meat counters where you&#39;l be greeted by someone behind the counter who will get you what you are looking for, offer advice for best meats or grilling techniques, and offer any assistance you may need.

So anyways, I walked around and then made my way around and was asked how I could be helped very quickly and friendly. (A smile truly does go a long way! - Love it).  

I decided to order a 6&#34; cold deli sandwiched called THE BEAST.  It came with Swiss cheese, freshly sliced imported ham, turkey, and roast beef, giardiniera, honey mustard dressing, oil, mayo, and finally tomato and lettuce. This was so big I only ate half for lunch and the sandwich costed just under $7.00.

In addition I also ordered a half pound of the vegetable macaroni salad, which was under $2.00.  I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of it because I felt it lacked seasoning of some sort and it was pretty heavily coated in oil...but I still ate it.  It wasn&#39;t bad at all, just needed something flavorful.  

All in all, I definitely recommend this place!"

One of my go to items in life is a ham &amp; cheese sandwich. I was craving an amped up ham &amp; cheese for lunch this week, so off to Felicia&#39;s Meat Market I went. And boy did they deliver! My sandwich was packed with so much meat! I got the 6&#34; and had my choice of a couple different breads. I also got to choose from any of their cheeses so I went with Muenster. I&#39;m a cheese fein so loved being able to pick a slightly less popular cheese. For layer upon layer of fresh ham, my choice of cheese &amp; mayo, it ran a bit over $5. Way better quality than a chain sandwich spot so worth the ever so slightly more cost. I found their prices to be completely reasonable.

I had a look over what else they had to purchase and boy do they pack a lot into a tiny space. There are freezers filled with various items for purchase - most being $9-10 and I&#39;m sure would make a fabulous dinner.

Pro-Tip: Sign up for their email list on their website and get 10% off your next order.

I think I may go back for lunch again tomorrow - the BBQ Pork is sounding really darn good!"

Sure, you could go to Burger King across the street and get a value meal that consists of everything reheated, or you can come here, get stuffed on a phenomenal FRESH sandwich, and pay less...your choice.

They also have an awesome selection of homemade salads, deli meats, prepared foods, steaks, chops, etc.  It&#39;s a small, cozy shop with people who have been there for as long as I&#39;ve been coming here.

This year, my sisters and I surprised my mom with a small dinner party and we took care of the food/cake, etc.

My sister and I decided that a &#34;thanksgiving&#34; type meal would be fun and DELICIOUS!!! My sister ordered a fresh turkey from Felicia&#39;s and we cooked that birdie up good! The bird was fantastic. A fresh turkey is definitely the way to go. Frozen turkeys will be my second choice from now on. 

Now after my sister told me where exactly the store was, I tried my hardest to try to envision it and was not able to. It wasn&#39;t until she told me it was in the same strip mall as Bistro Dragon and Pasta Mia, that I could figure it out. A few days after our mini-thanksgiving meal, I stopped here on my way home from work. I had no idea what I was going to find, but I went in there with an open mind. 

You walk through a wooden framed screen door like you would at grandma&#39;s old house into a small shop. It&#39;s a bit cramped, but it has charm. They have a full meat counter and a small deli. They make fresh sandwiches that I would pick up for lunch if my office was closer. They also have meals premade to-go. Actually everything is to-go, there is nowhere to sit down and eat. They carry Turano Bakery bread which is my personal favorite and I picked up some fresh Italian sausage I used in my pasta sauce that same evening. I got mild sausage and should have gotten the hot, looking back on it. Guess I&#39;ll have to get hot next time. And there will be a next time. I&#39;ll be back soon!"

A small little shop appears to be family owned. The butcher took time to explain his shop and cuts of meat and I was impressed with the staff. 

I tried the baked clams that were frozen , was given perfect instructions and the were very good.  

The real winner are the baby back ribs.. I can cook but was never good with rubs... UNTIL now. Perfect rib and great taste. He even took off the silver skin for me

I higher recommend this place for streaks and ribs

Monday I think I&#39;ll try a sub and some of the pastas

We bought a few frozen soups but have not tried them yet


Great place and good staff.

It&#39;s nestled in the south-west corner of a plaza at Meacham and Biesterfield (Wise) roads and from the moment you walk in, you can tell that their specialty is fresh meat. From classic cuts to Whole-Foods-style marinated items, I&#39;ve been quite impressed by their effort to offer more upscale products that people can cook the moment they walk through the door at home. While Whole Foods charges about $9/pound on shish kabobs, Felicia&#39;s is around $6.30/skewer, which hey -- that&#39;s a $3 savings and adds up fast over repeat visits.

I&#39;ve also started coming here for the sandwiches at lunch time; my favorite and full disclosure -- only sandwich I keep getting -- is their standard roast beef. There is nothing more amazing than LOTS of fresh-sliced roast beef with the classic trimmings on french bread.

So why only 4 stars and not 5? Mainly just because of that extra &#34;oomph!&#34; factor. My favorite sandwich has no seasoning; at the least, I would LOVE if their staff asked &#34;Would you like salt, pepper or oregano (whatever)?&#34; on it. The answer would be yes and also give them 5 stars.

I got their tomato/mozzarella salad with a sandwich and that too needed some &#34;oomph!&#34; to taste perfect. I added some parmesan cheese at home, which lent it some salt without that osmosis effect that salt (added at the deli) would have caused to the fresh-cut tomatoes.

So! Awesome place. Great quality. Just needs a little TLC from the spice rack and they are the perfect example of how to run a successful business that makes me WANT to come back.

FYI: Not a fan of their order-line process. Twice now, I was standing there and they asked people behind me for their orders when I was already waiting for a little while (quality takes time, lol). They need to ask &#34;Have you been helped?&#34; BEFORE going down the line and asking someone behind me (or you, anyone really) &#34;What would you like?&#34; -- otherwise, there goes that ordering opportunity when you try to be nice/polite and not say anything."
