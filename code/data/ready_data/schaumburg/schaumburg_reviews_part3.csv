This was a lunch for a coworkers last day. Ordered two chipotles chicken salads with soups and two buffalo chicken sandwiches. Both sandwiches were completely wrong. 
We ordered one to have blue cheese and the other ranch, cheddar cheese on both, both no tomatoes, one no lettuce. 
Even though this order was placed online they managed to get it wrong. 
Both sandwiches got blue cheese one should have had ranch, no cheese on one the other got American instead of cheddar. No lettuce on both (one should have had). 
Attention to detail is not taken seriously at this location. Ample time was given to prep the order. It was placed via chilis.com using options that chilis deemed understandable by its employees. So I expect it to be made correctly. I am a very easy going person when it comes to food but when the order is placed online I don&#39;t understand how someone can get it wrong still. There is no possible way that there was a misunderstanding like there would be if I was placing a phone order that I could understand maybe I said something wrong but this was clear as day. This is one of the reasons big chain restaurants like chilis are losing business. 
Will not be ordering from chilis again."

The order was just a bowl of chili and an order of onion rings. The lady said it would be 15mins. I got there a little early so i sat in the car for 5mins. I was on my lunch from my retail job. I paid for my order and waited and waited. Now it was 710pm when i told the lady i only ordered a bowl of Chili and onion rings. My order was sitting there the WHOLE time! I told her i wanted my money back. She had to get the mgr at which no customer service no above and beyond service, he didnt even try to make things right! I was checking out the chili for our office party for Black Friday... I guess that is NOT happening! 

Update**** The GM has contacted me and heard my complaint and has rectified this experience. Thank you"

We didn&#39;t feel like eating in so we ordered it to go, so that we could enjoy the family that came in for my sons graduation.

We got the food home and I was quite disappointed with our meal. Usually it&#39;s pretty  tasty but this time it seemed a little rushed or something. Maybe because they were so busy or because it was late (dinner rush) whatever the case I was extremely disappointed and didn&#39;t even finish my meal. 

My potatoes had some sort of film over them that at first I just scraped off. That was probably disgusting enough to do. But then when I put the fork into it again they were like on the fork but a string still to the plate.. uummm yeah I don&#39;t think potatoes should do that. So, I decided to just throw them away. Even the meat looked funny. Not just my food was horrible. Everyone&#39;s was. We won&#39;t be dining here anymore.. too bad it was my favorite :-("

Pasta, salad, flat breads, burgers, steaks, fajitas, etc. The portions were huge I had to ask for a box right away because I knew there was no way I could finish. Server was attentive. No wait for a table but the wait for food was a little long -- we came on a Sunday late afternoon. I like that you could pay at the table via tablet -- I didn&#39;t like that we had to complete a survey instead of just leaving after we paid.

Some good, some bad but for the most part, good. Came recently which is what I&#39;ll base this review off of. First I noticed that the booths, floors, and atmosphere are getting outdated and old. Maybe it&#39;s time for an remodel? I only say that because the booth I was sitting at moved every time the person behind me moved, and that was some teenage girl who wouldn&#39;t sit still. Pretty annoying. I just sucked it up and didn&#39;t complain about it. Another small thing that bugged me was that iced tea was the same price as a soft drink. But that&#39;s not really their fault, just Chili&#39;s in general I suppose.

Did the 2 for 20 with my mom which I think is a great deal, so props there. I got the Margarita grilled chicken and my mom got the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadillas and we got the chipotle chicken flatbread app. I&#39;m trying out a diet, don&#39;t judge me. I used to always get the baby back ribs which are delicious and I miss so much.... But anyway the chicken was pretty good. Good flavors with the tomatoes mixed in and then also adding the crunch with the tortilla strips. Didn&#39;t care for the beans, it looked like soup. Quesidillas were good but that is what it is pretty much, nothing special. My dad got the chicken fajitas which were pretty good, but again that&#39;s pretty straight up, just give someone all the ingredients and let them make their own fajita. Overall fine night besides the certain booth I was at."

They have your standard appetizers, flat breads (new), soups, salads, and pizzas now! Of course they also have burgers, ribs (I want my baby back), chicken, and seafood.

I love how they have lighter options, combos, Mexican fare (tacos, fajitas, quesadilla). They also have a ton of dessert options.

Again, this place has OPTIONS! You as the consumer ARE IN CONTROL!

If someone is picky (see children), this is the spot to hit because they have everything! Much better than TGI Friday&#39;s and Applebee&#39;s IMO!"

Here I had the mango-chile tilapia, while the wife and I shared jumbo soft pretzels. The pretzels weren&#39;t bad, but I was impressed by the tilapia, which was flavorful (and being on the &#34;light&#34; menu, I would hope so), flaky and a just a little bit spicy.

What&#39;s really nice is being able to pay right at the table, saving the trouble of having to sign paper receipts and being able to e-mail myself the receipt.

The hostess was a bit... distracted, or maybe just disposed to other things... and service was average, but overall the experience was positive."

I mean, there&#39;s only so many Chicken Crispers that a person can watch go down another high schooler&#39;s pie-hole before they have to take a break.  Now that I&#39;m back, and have a man who is Chicken Crisper free, Chili&#39;s isn&#39;t a bad place to dine.

Chili&#39;s has definitely made some improvements since the nineties, but I still wouldn&#39;t call it a fave.  Some things that are pretty decent include the skillet queso, the fire grilled corn guacamole and salsa (and all you can eat chips!), the fajitas (the trio isn&#39;t bad but steak is my favorite), and the margaritas.  Seriously, I ONLY come here for these things.    

Everything else is just alright.  Alright service, alright atmosphere, alright food, alright bar menu (NOT including beer.  None of their beer is good.  Beer snobs beware!).  Overall, I like coming here for a change in the restaurant rotation, but I&#39;m not planning on becoming a regular."

We ordered two pizzas. In the past, their pizzas were very high quality, similar to those you get in Italy. Recently,however, the pizzas we ordered were below average. The mushrooms on my pizza were a gooey consistency and absolutely tasteless. The prosciutto was half-heartedly thrown on top in the form of huge chunks. 

Shortly after ordering, the server told us that we must move to another table bc her coworker had to set up for a party the next day. 

To top it off, the server dropped our leftover pizza, so we had to wait past the closing time for them to make a new one."

We wanted to keep an open mind and were prepared for some kinks as they try to iron out some details in the first week or two. However, we were quite disappointed despite the low expectations.  Menu was very minimal, no soup options, no bread on the table.  Entrees portions were very small, and my pasta dish was extremely spicy (and I can normally take a lot of spice)!!!  I think our waitress tried her best in terms of service, but it was a little slow, which we understand given that it&#39;s the first day.  It did take a long time to get our food, and again, we didn&#39;t mind it too much.  The most disappointing thing was that not once did our waitress or any of the owners come by to ask if everything was ok.  I would have thought that the owners would have wanted feedback from their new customers.  Instead, they were busy chatting and hugging people that seemingly were their friends.  Overall, we were not pleased with the quality and quantity of their offerings, and most of all, their lack of interest to attract new customers to their new business.  We may give this another try but really hope their menu and attitude will improve."

If anything, it&#39;s worse. With a great neighborhood location and proximity to the Village Green (free concerts Friday nights), the positive remarks end there. This restaurant is universally bad. Let&#39;s start with the bread. You might as well get some cheap bread from Jewel. I don&#39;t expect bread baked at the restaurant, but at least get some from the several excellent bakeries, Italian and otherwise, nearby. Sangria special was watered down. Our appetizer of mussels smelled funky. As I am still alive, I can only assume it&#39;s the preparation (although at least two seemed undercooked). We ordered 2 pasta dishes, arrabiata and puttanesca. Not only were both sauces thoroughly blah, the puttanesca had the same funky smell as the mussels. As for the pasta, it basically was old, re-dipped in water pasta. Not one enjoyable aspect of the meal. To make matters worse, the service was terrible as well. Missed beer, slow between courses, not especially personable. Mount Prospect is not dining mecca, but go to Mia&#39;s, Mrs P and Me, Tankards and Tokens, Emerson&#39;s (new owners, much improved), even Subway before you stop here. Awful."

My wife and I had a night out there about a year ago and I got the Lasagna (on special) and she got the Chicken parm. It was inedible. My lasagna was a mess, it looked way undercooked and sloppy, on the plate was this pile of a mess, but I figured looks aren&#39;t everything and ate it. As soon as I cut off a chunk I knew something was wrong, the pasta was way underdone, and when I took a bite I knew this was not right. The pasta was thick and too chewy. I was disappointed. My wifes chicken was a bit better but the sauce there seems somehow processed, its super thin, no flavor, and as smooth as ketchup, there no hint of good flavor, its was so boring. I told myself it was just a bad night so went back again over this past summer. The service was terrible, they just don&#39;t seem to care about anything, the waitress kept walking away if we took more than a few seconds to order something, even drinks. Food took over an hour and a half and the restaurant was only half full! The food was universally disliked, the Alfredo was thin and watery and was more like Alfredo pasta soup there was so much of the thin tasteless &#34;Sauce&#34;, my pizza, which used to be excellent, was terrible, and I&#39;ve eaten very authentic Neapolitan style pizza but this place lost their touch by far.
I actually feel bad about complaining because I used to love their food but the quality is gone, the staff doesn&#39;t care yet they are still in business... Im sorry they&#39;ve lost me as a customer permanently."

Not really, the makings of a good pizzeria is much harder than just having a wood fire oven. Canta Napoli Pizzeria, it&#39;s neopolitan style pizza for those who don&#39;t really know what neopolitan style pizza should taste like. 

It all starts with the crust. It simply wasn&#39;t the right texture. There was too much dough that resembled a pan pizza rather than the thin and chewy crust that is expected in neopolitan style. Granted that we are in Chicago and thin crust may not always be the pizza of choice so maybe a happy medium was decided. If this was their intention, then they are doing a great job. 

On the plus side, the prices were reasonable and we found a groupon that knocked off $30 so the meal hardly cost anything. We were able to try three different pizzas for only $10 plus tip. If you are able to find a groupon for Canta Napoli, then it would be worth trying.

Here are some suggestions for management: 
* Work on the crust to resemble a true neopolitan style pizza
* Cross train the staff: for small operations, each staff member (i.e. hostess, wait staff, manager) should be able to assist one another
* Don&#39;t use button mushrooms. For an Italian restaurant, baby portabella at the very least"

We started out with a couple of appetizers, the vongole (clams) in a marinara sauce and grilled octopus. The vongole were outstanding and a great portion,  although the octopus was prepared well, the portion was not. It looked like they literally took a single baby octopus and cut it up on a plate with a spring mix and a balsamic mixture and called it a night. From experience, other Italian restaurants that serve this, give you a much larger portion, so for $12, it was not worth it.
 
We then ordered our entrees, my wife split a chicken dish with the other couples wife, the husband ordered chicken parmigiana and I ordered the Mahi Mahi which was one of the specials for the evening. It came on a bed of linguini prepared with grape tomatoes, capers andkalamata olives in a white wine garlic sauce. Now you would think this dish was screaming with flavor.....NOT!  This was the most bland fish dish I&#39;ve ever had, as I&#39;m dousing it with salt, just so it had a little flavor. Also, whatever sauce they made for this was so watery, it didn&#39;t stick on the pasta, so I had to add parmigiano cheese just to make the pasta taste like something....very disappointing as it was $27. 

If it wasn&#39;t for the good appetizers and good service,  I might not consider this place again, but I always believe in second chances."

We had an antipasto tray with prosciutto and two cheeses, fried calamari, MARGHERITA PIZZA, salad, two types of pasta, veal with potatoes and veggies, and finally, cake.  All the food was very good, except the pasta was overcooked, which was an unexpected disappointment.  The standout was the pizza, baked in a wood oven.  We thought it was excellent, not really sure where you could get better Margherita pizza in the local area.

Like many others who have posted here, I too had a Groupon - $15 for lunch. I had never seen or heard of this place prior to the Groupon, so I was looking forward to a new adventure.

When I arrived around 1:45 PM, I found the place to be nearly empty - just one table of two outside. I sat inside and was waited on by someone who also appeared to be a manager/host. The menu looked interesting - a little pricey and not a load of variety, but at lunch, to be expected. I flipped to the back and noticed a whole bunch of personal pizzas, so I asked my server if pizza was kind of their specialty. She kind of indicated it was, also telling me that it was a personal 8&#34; sized pizza. I asked her of there was a specialty pizza among the group (I saw several different types not often seen, especially a couple with prosciutto). She asked me if I like meat on pizza, when I said I did, she said I should get the Nonna pizza - Italian sausage w/ peppers and onions. Kind of an old standard - was hoping for something new. But I figured if this is supposed to be among their best offerings, let&#39;s give it a shot.

Honestly, it was quite good - one of the &#34;freshest&#34; pizzas I&#39;ve ever had. Everything on it had a robust taste, though I did ask for some oregano as the pizza lacked that. One downside to the freshness - the crust near the center became a bit soggy. The outer crust however was outstanding. 

That and a cola was all I had - with the tax the bill totaled $3.15 after the $15 Groupon discount. I had a $20 and five singles. I wanted to leave about $2.75 for a tip, so instead of using the ones, I gave her the $20 and left it sticking out of the check booklet. The server came to the table and asked me if I wanted change back! For a $20? Did she think I was going to tip her 100% or something - geeze! I said, &#34;of course&#34; and she returned the book - not paying the bill mind you, she gave me a $10, a $5 and five $1&#39;s. That kind of aggravated me. 

I might try it again - as I said the pizza was good - but the menu overall was a bit expensive for what the offering was."

I was on the verge of giving 5 stars for the excellent experience we had, however two small things limited my rating to 4, and hopefully upon a second visit the fifth star will find its way up there. 
The first little thing was placement of the tables on the patio, to enter the restaurant, patrons must pass through a gauntlet of their dining peers and navigate through tables to find the door. Although we didn&#39;t sit outside, we felt really bad for the couple that sat at the first table which was somewhat jutting into the walkway, they must have heard &#39;excuse me&#39; or &#39;sorry&#39; 50 times during their meal, but perhaps they didn&#39;t mind...
The second little thing was our server, and I hate to harp on it, however Yelp is a place of honesty, and accurate feedback is a helpful tool. Our server was friendly and  attentive, but after dinner she seemed to have forgotten us. A larger group came in and they received wine and soup/salads before we got the bill, then it took a while for her to pick up my credit card. I can look past it because we did have a great overall experience, but we clocked over 35 minutes just waiting for the check. I guess I could have flagged her down and asked for it, but I&#39;m not that type of diner...It&#39;s just not my style.

All negative aspects aside, the meal was great. We were seated promptly and immediately enjoyed the atmosphere/decor (we went around 6:30pm) while we snacked on bread and oil. As mentioned we did have a Groupon which incliuded two glasses of wine, two soup/salads, and two entres and of course we had to splurge for the lava cake with ice cream (ohh baby). Needless to say the Groupon was a really good deal and an awesome way to sample the menu for [relatively] cheap. I had Minestrone soup, Penne Vodka with their house red, and &#39;m&#39;lady&#39; had the white wine, House salad, and Beef Mostaccioli in a mushroom sauce. We were definitely satisfied. 

We will certainly be back to try their pizza and/or other options but may wait for another Groupon to save some cash. I&#39;ve already recommended Conta Napoli to others, so I suppose I&#39;m just following suit on Yelp. Enjoy."

He barely even came by again and a lady who I assume was the owner kept checking in on us and she was amazing.

I do want to point out the good, first, so I&#39;ll begin by saying that the busboy busted his butt making sure that we had plenty of water. I also liked the taste of the crust on the pizza. The texture was fine and not tough to cut or chew through. I did like the sauce. It reminded me of something out of a Spaghettios can, but I really savored the particular blend sweet and meat flavor. It was different and enjoyable.

The dough was entirely too thick on the pizza; they really need to thin it down. It reminded me of your average pizza-joint&#39;s fare. The prosciutto was not prosciutto. It looked like it, but it had neither the texture nor flavor that prosciutto should have. Prosciutto has a very unique flavor that is both distinct and detectable on just about anything that it is served on. Whatever was on one of the pizzas we had exhibited absolutely no flavor even on its own. It may as well have not been there at all. Just thinking about it makes me angry.

I normally don&#39;t complain about service, but it was a mess here. The restaurant was nowhere near busy, and things took forever to get done, and I don&#39;t mean the cooking time for the pizzas."

The chicken was over cooked and the pesto tasted like nothing.  The second time I went I order carry out.  Basic spaghetti and meatball dinner.  They gave me what looked like an overpriced kids portion, 2 slivers of bread and the soup was pasta fazoli.  The sauce was ok, but the soup was bacon flavored water with beans and cut up spaghetti.  The last time I went was the worst and dont want to even mention it.

We had hoped they would  eventually open another spot and they finally did. Well they did not disappoint. We had the eggplant appetizer and bruschetta. For the main meal our party had various pasta&#39;s and a few pizza&#39;s which were excellent. 

The service was attentive and very good. 

The spot is great in that there is plenty of parking and it looks as though they will have outdoor seating for the summer months. 

We definitely will be back."

I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34; It&#39;s true. This Italian place is nothing special &amp; over-priced. I would recommend Armand&#39;s in Arlington Heights or Little Villa in Des Plaines over Canta Napoli.

It is nice to be in &#34;downtown&#34; Mt. Prospect &amp; eat outside if it&#39;s nice out. Food is okay-not great, not bad.

I would say that you should take a look at the menu (on their website) &amp; decide if average food &amp; their prices is worth it for you."

However, the service is terrible.  We have been there numerous times and they just don&#39;t get it.  It takes forever to get service and your entree.  The most recent time we visted, there was a 20 minute wait.  We sat at the bar.  The bus boy asked if wanted water and bread.  We said yes.  He brought one glass of water and looked surprised when we asked for another.  We never got bread.  The bartender (the server behind the bar) never asked if we wanted anything to drink.  They missed an opportunity.  We were finally seated and it took our server over 5 minutes to even approach us.  We asked for 2 glasses of wine and ordered a salad.  By then the busboy had given us two baskets of bread.  We finished our salad and the server finally showed up again after about 10 minutes.  The server took our dinner orders.  The soup came out quickly, but we waited over a half hour after we finished that for our entrees.  The server came to our table twice after the half hour to say the food would be out shortly.  The server then brought the entrees and we didn&#39;t see her again for another 5 minutes when we then asked if we were supposed to get sides of pasta with the entrees.  The server said the kitchen was making them and ran off.  The server obviously forgot.  We got the sides shortly after and the server disappeared again.  We noticed that the other servers were equally challenged.  They all seemed to be distracted and lost, many spilling cocktails as they walked to tables.  One squeezed between a column and the wall to serve the table behind us.  The manager seemed busy chatting up a few tables.  We finished our meal and waited again.  We had to ask the busboy to ask our server for the check.  We made sure she took our payment before she ran off again.  This lack of service has happened every time we have been there.  It&#39;s too bad because the food is really very good.  Yet another poorly managed business in downtown Mount Prospect.  Sigh..."

Predictably, we returned to Canta Napoli for our Valentine&#39;s dinner this year.

As a tangent, our Valentine&#39;s evenings rarely go off without a hitch. Last year we came to Canta Napoli, and were surrounded by badly-behaved kids. Clearly NOT the fault of the restaurant. 

Back to Valentine&#39;s Day 2013. As we drove up, my wife noted the &#34;Under New Ownership&#34; banner hung outside. We hoped nothing had changed.
 
As we walked in, we were greeted by a new hostess. She was nice, but not as nice as the former hostess. 

When we were seated, a new waitress immediately checked with us. She was nearly as good as our old waitress, who wasn&#39;t there. She appeared to be responsible for more than half the restaurant, while there appeared to be two identically-dressed hostesses. 

We noticed there were three families with kids surrounding us. Thankfully, these kids were well-behaved.

We kept hearing a bell ringing. Then, I looked over toward the kitchen. The pass-through was open and every time the dishwasher sprayed a dish, a ring on the sprayer would jingle like ringing a bell. That got quite irritating through our dinner.

A busboy immediately served us a small basket of bread, and began to serve us butter. There was already olive oil on the table, so I said that wasn&#39;t necessary.  Even though we were ordering bread entrees (pizza), I expected the bread to be refilled, or at least checked.

As we looked at the new menu, there was NO TRUFFLE PIZZA! The food we came for was gone. There were also a couple Italian dishes listed, but with no translation. I&#39;m Italian, and speak a little, but had no idea what they were. We didn&#39;t think it was the waitress&#39; responsibility to translate.

We kept a positive attitude. Change isn&#39;t always bad. I ordered a potato rosemary white pizza, and had them add mushrooms. My wife ordered Quattro Formaggio (4 cheese) red pizza. 
There was no Caprese salad with imported buffalo mozzarella that we ordered every time. There was a regular Caprese with beefsteak tomatoes that we chose not to order. In fact, there was nothing on the appetizer menu that appealed to us.

In the past, whenever we strayed from the Truffle Pizza, and ordered a tomato-topped pizza, it would arrive with a soggy middle. This was one thing that hadn&#39;t changed from the old Canta. My wife&#39;s pizza had a soggy middle. It took me a while to figure out how to make my home-made pizzas without a soggy middle. Simply watch the amount of liquid you put on top. I would expect the same from someone who cooks for a living.

My potato rosemary pizza arrived, and I was a little surprised to see chunks of potatoes, instead of the expected slices. No big deal. While my pizza wasn&#39;t also soggy in the middle, the thin pizza was only crispy on the edges, where it was burnt around about 1/4 the edge. My pizza was also sliced in quarters, which I thought were too big to eat with any grace.  

The potato rosemary pizza with mushrooms added was good. The olive oil on top added a butter-like flavor. I would have preferred a bit more rosemary to taste. I believe the mushrooms nearly made this as good as the Truffle Pizza.

The new Canta Napoli is still a good restaurant, but not exceptional as its predecessor was."

One of my favorite Italian restaurants has lost it&#39;s touch. The service that used to be friendly is now just mediocre, and the comfort of the atmosphere has diminished along with it. Pizza that was once delicious now has a flavorless crust and sauce. It was also undercooked. Grilled calamari that was once well balanced and delicately flavored was simply swimming in oil. It is truly a shame that such a nice establishment, one of a kind in Mount Prospect, has been sold. That fact might just be the restaurant&#39;s downfall."

What used to be a nice friendly and welcoming neighborhood place is now an unfriendly and cold environment. The food is good, not great.  Our server was ok, although not friendly. I don&#39;t even think he looked at us once and could barely stop and stand in front of the table for more than 10 seconds.  Dirty plates stayed on the table, while the bus boys were huddled in the corner paying more attention to their phones. But the WORST part of the whole dining experience was the constant bell ringing from the kitchen! This alone is enough reason for me not to go back! The kitchen is open so I believe, after reading other reviews, the bell rings every time the dishwasher sprays soap. Good God, it was awful!  Sad to see this place change."

And now I want to figure out Canta Napoli&#39;s sauce. It&#39;s nice and sweet with the San Marzano flavor, and is probably as simple as tomatoes + olive oil + salt &amp; pepper. It was the best thing about the pizza, which was a good, solid B/B+ in my book. Had the Margherita DOC, with buffalo mozz, sauce, and basil, and was definitely satisfied.

Nice environment, definitely a place you could take a date for an inexpensive meal (pizza + 1 glass wine + tip = $25) prior to hitting The Blues Bar for some live music just down the block."

My son had the veal special and it was fantastic.  My husband had the seafood pasta.  The sauce had a kick which he liked.  I had the roasted veggie pizza.  The crust under the toppings was very thin.  I didn&#39;t eat the ends of the crust they were a bit crunchy. However the thin crust seemed to absorb all the flavors from the sauce, fresh mozzarella, and roasted veggies. This was definitely a knife and fork pizza. I wasn&#39;t sure at first if I cared for it, but as I started on the second slice I was truly into it.  I&#39;d definitely get it again.  It&#39;s just  d i f f e r e n t.

The interior is OK; nothing amazing, but nice enough; we were under some overhead lighting that felt a little bright, but rest of the place had nice low-key lighting. Pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms, and artichokes was fantastic, as was the mushroom pizza. I was even craving those mushrooms the next day; rich and meaty, almost trufflelike. The quality of the ingredients, especially the prosciutto, was top-notch. I used to think prosciutto was too gamey, but apparently I&#39;ve been eating the cheap stuff, because this was really tasty and it blanketed the entire pizza. Yum! It wasn&#39;t a cheap night, but it was worth it for a pizza-and-wine lover like myself, in addition to supporting a downtown business. What was disappointing was the waiter; he said almost nothing and practically threw the plates down and bolted away. It was noticeably strange behavior for a waiter, and it came across as rude, as opposed to someone who maybe doesn&#39;t normally wait tables or was busy elsewhere in the restaurant. I had brought an out-of-town friend with me, so it was a little embarrassing. Probably wouldn&#39;t bring guests there again, but would go there with my family, and would try the rest of the menu, which is a little bit higher in price point than the pizzas but looked pretty good."

The complimentary bread didn&#39;t taste fresh at all, had no flavor nd was almost rubery.  We had space for dessert and had tiramisu and that was not worth the calories.

The only reason I went for a third time is because I had a $10 gift card and a coupon for $5/$25 making for a cheap dinner.

My husband asked for a side of angel hair pasta instead of penne pasta with his chicken parmigiana and was told no.  It was too busy for them to make that for him.  Really?!? It&#39;s on your menu and takes less time to cook than penne pasta!!  And it&#39;s a small venue!!  He switched his order to chicken vesuvio and it was horrible.  The chicken was dry.  The potatoes appeared to be at least a day old and recycled...burnt and rubbery.  My orrechetti cabrese was over cooked in every facet and contained a ton of onions which was not listed on the menu.  You&#39;d have thought when I asked for a salad with no onions the server would have at least mentioned my entree included onions.  But that would require the server to know the menu, which clearly she did not. For the record, several at our table enjoyed their meals.  The risotto special was great...as was the chicken parmigiana my husband didn&#39;t get a chance to sample.  That said, we will never be dining there again.  An Italian restaurant that won&#39;t swap out a side of pasta better be damn good and Canta Napoli is mediocre at best.  We&#39;ll be spending our money at a number of other fine Italian restaurants in the area in the future."

I am a pizza lover - and having lived many places around the country enjoy most all styles - pan crust, deep dish, NY style, wood over fired, thin (almost burnt) Connecticut style...  What is most important is crust with a good taste that is not soggy, a tangy sauce with some Italian seasoning, plenty of fresh cheese, and other quality fresh ingredients.  While I suspect that the ingredients were fresh and of reasonable quality, the pizza was almost tasteless and the toppings were sparse.  The crust did not have a very good flavor (cardboard-like) and there was no apparent herbs on the pizza or in the sauce.  I have had several higher quality frozen pizza that were as good and cost $6 rather than about $13.  The Rigatoni Cosa Nostra sounded great &#34;Woodfire roasted sausages with porcini mushrooms, tricolor peppers and touch of cream topped with arugula&#34;, but there were only a couple of very small pieces of sausage, the sauce barely wetted the pasta, and the flavor of the sauce was boring - a little Italian herbs/seasoning, garlic, or something was desperately needed to wake up the bland flavor.  I would rather have opened a jar of Prego on some rigatoni at home than pay $14 for this.  This restaurant has nice decor/ambiance and has looked crowded on the weekends, but either we both got very unlucky with our menu selections or this place is not worth your effort if you like flavorful Italian food."

I was seriously disappointed and down right upset by the time we left. I went there once before when they first opened with a bunch of neighbors, yes, we had a decent sized group and requested separate bills. I ordered a margarita pizza with ONE leaf of basil and 3 small slices of mozzarella on an entire pizza! Unfortunately for us is that the service was lacking as well and the waitress had our credit card for over a half hour while they tried to figure out how to use the machine and ended up signing a handwritten credit card bill. Since they just opened, we took it with a grain of salt.

We recently purchased a Groupon since we live in the neighborhood so we went again and this time with my 1 1/2 year old son. He is used to eating out as he goes out regularly for breakfast during the week and is very well behaved for his age. The waitstaff at other restaurants are usually friendly and he smiles and says hello unlike here he picked up the animosity in the atmosphere and was started to act up, very unusual for him when I noticed that the busboy stood close by to our table glaring at him with a big frown. Oh he smiled quick enough when he noticed that I saw him. Interesting, until I caught him doing this on a couple more occasions. Our appetizer came very quickly placed within reach of my young son and the grilled appetizer calamari is more like sauteed but it was well cooked but bland. We were not offered a salad choice for our dinner, only hot soup which also was placed within easy reach of my son. By the time, I had a few spoonfuls my son who is looking around began shrieking and was suddenly silent and there was that busboy once again. I packed him up and they were nice enough to allow us to take our meals to go. By the time we got home the food was cold with no steam on the lids of our food. Normally, hot food causes steam to accumulate on the lids, right? I ordered the Tagliatelle Bolognese which was a bland tomato based sauce with ground beef."

It took practically 15 minutes to get each of the 3 items.. The worst part was seeing the table next to us come in, order while I was eating the mussels, and get soup and the same pasta before we did! Did you forget my order?? If so, it would&#39;ve been wiser to serve the pasta to the guest who ordered first! Poor judgement.

It&#39;s on past with little ceasars, sabarros and the pizza at Sams Club, Costco. I wasnt expecting much when I ordered it but it was surprisingly good. No frills pizza - sauce, cheese, meat.

More like, Pizza Not Unless You Lost Your Sense of Taste, Foo!

I don&#39;t want mean to be a stickler when it comes to food, because what is food?  It&#39;s a means to an end, and the end being the ceasing of hunger, Pizza Now can be considered a reasonable means.

But life is not about eating whatever it takes to make you full enough to be satiated.  Why else are there culinary schools teaching eager beavers the art of making a beurre blanc, or how to deglaze the fond off of a pan, or why the Maillard reaction = tasty goodness?  Otherwise, we&#39;d all get a choice of gray gruel or brown gruel in food dispensaries, rather than eating cuisine in restaurants, right?

So I was driving up Rt. 59 and passed a billboard advertising a $10 deal of a pizza with 2 toppings, 2 liter o&#39; cola, and 10 wings.  Sound promising right?  I call in the order for sausage and pepperoni and pick it up.  Pretty hungry, so I crack the box in the car.  I thought that someone put a smaller cardboard box into the bigger cardboard box, topped it with weird sausage &#34;balls&#34; and greasy seemingly uncooked pepperoni topped with flavorless sauce and cheese &#34;food&#34; and tried to trick me!  

You ever hear the saying that pizza is like sex?  As in, When it&#39;s good, it&#39;s great, when it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s still pretty good?  I really think there has to be a low limit to that school of thought, and this has got to be beyond the threshold of not-so-good.  HOWEVER, you do get a lot of pizza for the price.  Whether it&#39;s a good pizza or not is totally your subjective observation.  The wings?  Kind of flavorless, just not memorable......The 2 liter?  Probably the best things out of the whole meal deal.  I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t enjoy it more, but I love pizza and this didn&#39;t meet my expectations, however, that&#39;s not to say this wouldn&#39;t feed a family of four, if need be.  Brussels sprouts are like a $1 per pound at Aldi you know....."

The pizza taste is distinct, just not like the usual chain restaurant pizza you might be used to. Breadsticks are average, just dough with garlic and butter laid on top of them. Depending on when you order, you might get your pie made to order. Only complaint is that the cheese is laid really thin.

If your poop turns green from the Little Caesar&#39;s down the road or you hate the fact they give you virtually no cheese, this is the place for some cheap pizza."

They almost always have someone standing outside with a signboard.

The menu and idea is as simple as it gets.  14&#34; Large Pizza - $5, cheese, sausage, or pepperoni.  They also have breadsticks, chicken wings, and bottled soda.  You can add extra toppings or purchase sauces too.

The pizza was hot, and was ready when I walked in the door.  I am pretty confident it was fresh, because as I was leaving, the guy working started making another pie, so I assume they keep only a few ready.

I found the pizza to be acceptable, but completely unremarkable.  Same goes for the breadsticks.  I realize the notion, you get what you pay for, but I&#39;ve had Domino&#39;s and Little Caesar&#39;s for about the same price, and you get more at those places.  I got sausage, which appeared to be process-made sausage balls.  The cheese was definately where they cut the corners, as it was probably 2&#34; from the edge before there was any cheese on my pizza.  The sauce and crust were fine, just a bit bland.

In the end, the price was right, and it got the job done, but I&#39;ll likely keep to the other two or a frozen pizza for my $5 pizza fix in the future."

I should almost make a blog about visiting every Portillo&#39;s in existence right now, because I am well on my way . 

Walking up to the building, it was very unique, almost peach in color, but didn&#39;t have a ton of architectural design to it as I have seen at other Portillo&#39;s either driving by or visiting. 

Entering the restaurant more than made up for the lack luster building. Maybe that was the plan? Totally blew me away walking in. It was like a mix between 50&#39;s style, and picnic benches at the park. Very cool setting on the inside. The tables on the raised level included metal chairs with a rounded seat, which I feel could have been bigger. One size does NOT fit all, and even a medium sized person would have difficulty. I mean yes, I am 6&#39;5 over 300, lineman build, but I saw a couple of people much smaller than I am having difficulties. 

I started to order my food, and by walking up, it seemed as if the lady taking my order was a bit annoyed. I&#39;m not sure if she was having a bad day or what, but I didn&#39;t appreciate the musty TUDE!

I ordered a double char burger, with a large fry and a large root beer. I was dining in, and getting my  order after my number was called, I noticed it was in a bag? Why do they ask if I&#39;m dining in or carrying out if they are just going to give me a bag anyways. It wasn&#39;t a big deal, but just kinda odd. 

I sat down, open my sack of deliciousness, and knew immediately by looking at my awesome-looking meal, that I was in for a carnivore treat! The burger was so flavorful and juicy that it almost made me jump and shout....it was THAT good!!! The &#34;taste&#34; of the fries were good, but normally they are VERY hot, and this time just lukewarm, which was slightly disappointing and surprising as they were pretty busy. 

I love Portillo&#39;s!!! Seriously....they have one in Indiana (Merrillville), but they need to expand even more!!!! Always delicious, and always a treat visiting the Chicago area. Overall, it&#39;s a 5 star studded meal for me!!! Keep it up Portillo&#39;s!!!!"

But I was roaming the neighborhood in search of a salad and this looked like the place.

I was there midday, but probably a little after the lunch hour, on a weekday.  There were definitely still a lot of folks there, but no line and very little wait for the food.  I ordered the Apple Walnut Salad and, while there was nothing wrong with it, it just didn&#39;t do much for me.  None of the ingredients in the salad had much personality, and you would typically think that the combination of cranberries, goat cheese, and candied walnuts would give it a little flavor.

I&#39;ll definitely give them another try when I&#39;m itching for hot dogs (and in the neighborhood; that part might be a while) or if I need my salad fix while I&#39;m with a crowd in a more carnivorous mood.  But I probably won&#39;t pick them out as my first choice for green things."

I love the atmosphere in the restaurants.
I love the amazing efficiency they have in moving that many hungry people through their lines both inside and at the drive-thru.
I love their hot dogs and how they allow me to order ketchup without shame.
I love their malted shakes.  MALT, people!
I love their fries.  My kids are hopeless over their cheese fries.

But mostly I love how they are THERE FOR ME when I&#39;m having a supremely fatty moment and I MUST have...

Their Double Cheeseburger.  It&#39;s a must.  It&#39;s big...it&#39;s juicy...it&#39;s full of flavor and whatever combo of fresh ingredients you desire...  omg.  SO good.

I&#39;ve been here countless times, and it almost never disappoints. The beef and cheddar croissant is my personal favorite. Sometimes this and their Italian beef sandwiches come out too wet for me, but if you&#39;re afraid of that, you can always just order them dry. While not their specialty, their 1/3 pound char-grilled burgers are also tender and juicy, a more filling option. You can&#39;t forget their chocolate cake for dessert either, moist and rich flavor. A delectable treat.

The drive-through is always wrapped completely around the building during peak lunch and dinner hours, but their service is very speedy thanks to an efficient system of service attendants stationed a long way ahead of the outdoor menu, where you typically order at fast food restaurants. They&#39;re constantly busy and know how to handle it properly. The lines are there for a reason. I highly recommend Portillo&#39;s any time you&#39;re near one, if you&#39;re looking for a quick bite."

They have most definitely decreased the meat portions  on the sandwiches and I can pretty much pinpoint this to POST sell-out. I was really hoping that wouldn&#39;t happen, but it did.
I gave them another chance last night and got the same result.. I have been to some small mom and pop places that have better and cheaper sandwiches , so I guess I will get out of my comfort zone and start venturing out to other places when I&#39;m in town.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, the sandwiches are good, but no longer worth the price considering what you no longer get."

Love that they still write the order on the bag with a pencil like they did decades ago.  

And - oh - that Italian beef.  I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so amazing to me, but it&#39;s just the perfect balance of taste and texture.  Mmmm.

I don&#39;t know why Portillo&#39;s doesn&#39;t deliver - I think they would greatly benefit from such a service. A good reason might exist, but I have yet to hear it. Lord knows we could use more delivery options in the suburbs aside from pizza and Asian-something. 

After two years of living here, I&#39;ve learned that, for a most-times clean freak like me, it is best to order your beef sandwich &#34;dry&#34; and then get a bowl of gravy to dip it into; the bread retains its structure and you can control the sogginess of each bite. (This will appeal to control freaks as well.) But sometimes, I get in the mood for a soppy, drippy sandwich and order it &#34;dipped.&#34; The bread nearly disintegrates and the beef and peppers start to plop out, and I don&#39;t look the least bit attractive eating this soggy mess. Oh well, it&#39;s not like eating Big Beef sandwiches was ever sexy to begin with.

I made the innocent mistake of ordering the charbroiled chicken sandwich on two occasions when I didn&#39;t feel like Portillo&#39;s (let the horrified gasping ensue) and wanted something lighter and helfier but was overruled by people who actually have a car. I knew getting some Weight-Watchers-approved sandwich at a beef-fueled chain in the Midwest would be a gamble, so the fault falls mostly on me. 

Stick to the beef. And sausage. And chopped salad. And chocolate cake. 

I can&#39;t vouch for their allegedly exemplary Chicago-style hot dog cos I only like ketchup on my hot dogs. (You&#39;re going to make yourself faint from all that gasping.)"

The extra diss was that they don&#39;t have alcohol. I think I&#39;ve only had beer at Portillo&#39;s once but it&#39;s a nice option. The cashier said that this location chose not to serve alcohol a year ago. Maybe it doesn&#39;t work with this market or something.

Kind of the same idea of why you go to a chain restaurant on a road trip, you don&#39;t know what local places are good so you settle. I should have checked my Yelp app for some help. 

Anyhow, got a burger and small fry. Received a large one, my guess is that it&#39;s what was ready and they thought it might be a bonus. Well they were lukewarm at best and no longer crisp. The burger&#39;s bun fell apart and was a big mess, I didn&#39;t add any extra condiments on it, so I don&#39;t know what the deal was with that.

I have no idea who designed this location, with some of the seating up on a platform and curbing. An attempt at an outside street scene? Just odd, because they have signs about the hazard, and it&#39;s blocked in a couple of spots. A definite trip hazard for any senior citizen. The only thing I liked decor wise is the flowers sign that was from a florist on North Pulaski, I remember that sign when it hung in place over the business.

The food, meh&#39; I think I may be one of the few in Chicago that doesn&#39;t like the food. My husband is the other, he doesn&#39;t get the Italian Beef love, I take his word for it since he&#39;s Italian and he also used to work at a beef stand and knows how to make it, and I&#39;m not talking about just the sandwich. He won&#39;t even go to Portillo&#39;s anymore, I&#39;ll go when there is no other option.

As for the staff, no one was sassy. One was a little creepy, she sat at one of the booths by the entry door, maybe she was the greeter, do they have a greeter now? Anyway, she sat there and watched people as they ate, nothing like being watched. IDK, the employees need to be doing something or get out of sight. IMO.

Speaking of the entry, watch out if you park across from the entrance, I was nearly taken out by a vehicle rounding the building for the drive through. 

There are many beef and hot dogs shacks in the city that serve up much better. The star breakdown, one because you have to, and one for the florist sign."

Why?  Well, in the past, you order a beef sandwich and it is loaded with beef.  And, I mean loaded.  However, for the last number of months, not only has the portion size dwindled to an almost laughable amount, the cost for the same has increased by about 10%.

After finally spending $10 today on a &#34;big beef&#34; sandwich and drink, I have come to the realization that there are better places, with way better value, to spend your hard earned lunch dollars.

If the &#34;new&#34; Portillo&#39;s management are reading these posts, it&#39;s time to go back to real value and give customers what they have come to expect at Portillo&#39;s, and that&#39;s certainly not what&#39;s currently being served.  Increase the portion size like it used to be and maintain some consistency, which seems to be another major issue at this time.

Yes, chocolate cake. Try it. Try all of it! Portillo&#39;s does its best to minimize the wait, maximize your order-to-eatin&#39; ratio and make you smile.

There are purists who would argue for other dog places, I totally understand that, especially in the city. But the further you travel from the heart of the city, the suburban landscape becomes littered with hot dog joints, some decent, some nothing more than strip mall place holders selling crap.  Portillo&#39;s stands as an oasis in all that noise. Big, noisy, packed with cool memorabilia and decor...you can go and never wonder if the quality is there. The kitchen is always run by a manager keeping the pace up. The order takers are pro&#39;s at microphone short hand &#34;2 flang flapper skiddly bops in a garden Prndld.&#34; I swear thats what she said once but my order came out 5 minutes later,perfectly. I know I didn&#39;t order any Prndl&#39;s. How they know that in back is kinda magic.

Come, eat, enjoy, return. It&#39;s more than a dog. it&#39;s a meal on a bun."

I finally got a chance while visiting a friend. As I expected, the place was packed with a line towards - no surprise there. Once I finally got to the ordering window, I got my usual: a double bacon cheeseburger, large cheese fries and a small chocolate cake shake. Although the prices are a bit steeper than I remember, it was worth every damn penny! The staff is hella friendly and fast with the orders and it was only a matter of time until I found myself devouring this monstrosity of a meal in the dining area. 

My burger was delicious - just like I remember with grease and cheese dripping off onto the wrapper. Excuse me while I clean up the drool off my keyboard. OK, I&#39;m back - the fries were crispy on the outside and soft and velvety inside with the gooey cheese sauce, I dunno what else could be a better combination. I washed all this down with my super thick chocolatey cake shake. It&#39;s incredibly rich so make sure you order a water as a chaser haha! 

All in all, I had an awesome lunch and can&#39;t wait until I can go back again!"

They didn&#39;t have a lot of time so we decided on some Chicago-style fast food at my neighborhood Portillo&#39;s. 

Everything I&#39;ve eaten from Portillo&#39;s often looks, feels, smells and tastes better than their competitor&#39;s offerings. Do I think Gene and Jude&#39;s makes a better Chicago-style dog? Surely. Does Paradise Pup make a superior cheeseburger? No doubt about it. But try to find a place that makes both items extremely well in addition to having killer cheese fries, Italian beef and the delightful anomaly known as a beef-n-cheddar croissant (I spike it with spicy giardiniera) and you&#39;ll quickly realize why Portillo&#39;s is so special. There aren&#39;t many fast food restaurants that make everything they offer taste awesome. No visible weaknesses.

This is a medium-to-smaller sized location. It doesn&#39;t get as crazy busy here as say, the Schaumburg or Arlington Heights branches. What was planned to be a quick meal lasted a little longer as conversations went on. The fries went by fast. My chocolate malt disappeared. I tried pushing chocolate cake shakes on my haplessly full cousins. I made room for a little beef-n-cheddar after polishing off a chili-cheese dog.

No one wanted to leave."

This Portillo&#39;s is in a great location!  They are right on Lake Street in Bloomingdale. They&#39;ve been there as long as I can remember. At least 16 years, but probably much longer. Their staff is a friendly group of swift moving, Italian beef building, Chicago hot dog slinging folks that I appreciate. They have a way of ALWAYS getting my order exactly right. They don&#39;t serve cold French fries - bonus!  Finally, there is a salad counter right in the se building if you&#39;re looking for something a little different. 

I love the cobblestone type flooring throughout the restaurant!  The neon signs and unique retro decorations give you something interesting to look at in between delicious bites. I notice something new every time. 

Stop in for a beef and sausage combo or a chocolate malt!  I&#39;m convinced that you will find the perfect meal for you."

They also have a really good, inexpensive burger (you don&#39;t get to tell them how you want it cooked, but for that price, you can&#39;t complain). Their chicken sandwiches are likewise fantastic. I also probably don&#39;t need to tell you about their chocolate cake shake, unless you&#39;re from out of town and haven&#39;t experienced it yet. (And if that&#39;s you, GET ONE NOW. A regular. The large is a meal by itself.)

No, friends, I&#39;m going to talk to you about two other Portillo&#39;s offerings that I feel they do very well, but that may get overlooked in favor of their more popular offerings that I listed above.

A new item on the menu is their grilled vegetable sandwich. They had one before, but they changed it a couple months ago. While it wasn&#39;t bad before, it is now AMAZING. It has seriously shot up to the top two of my favorite sandwiches list. Why?

The bread is a lovely multigrain ciabatta. It is soft and pillowy and very tasty on its own. Then, it&#39;s piled high with grilled eggplant, red peppers, zucchini, and mushrooms. These were not only grilled; they were marinated in something yummy, and all that juicy goodness seeps into the sandwich and makes it even softer and nicer. Finally, they top all that goodness off with a slice of Havarti cheese -- which they then melt. It&#39;s like the nicest grilled cheese sandwich you will ever have (well, that doesn&#39;t involve any sort of pig meat). And then they slice it diagonally, wrap it in handi-foil, and send you on your merry way to nom. 

That sandwich is love. I don&#39;t know if all Portillo&#39;s offer it now, but they should. I&#39;m getting hungry just thinking about it.

The other sandwich I want to talk up is a Lent-only offering: their pepper and egg croissant. On Fridays during Lent each year, this is a Portillo&#39;s staple. 

You don&#39;t have to observe Lent to enjoy this sandwich. For one, it&#39;s a Portillo&#39;s croissant. I&#39;m not sure where they get their breads, but the croissants they use for their sandwiches are fantastic. (Seriously, get the beef and cheddar croissant if you haven&#39;t already. Just do it.) Then they fill it with beautifully seasoned eggs and sweet peppers. You get protein and a vegetable and hey, if you are avoiding meat, I&#39;m pretty sure you won&#39;t miss it. (Pretty sure the eggs are real eggs, too -- not those powdered ones that some places reconstitute.)"

The sign references each day of the week with  different food items with the heading being  FEATURE OF THE DAY.  Example: Monday 2 Hot dogs, large fry, small coke. Thursday, Jumbo chili Dog, onion rings small drink. (Just to name a few ).

One would think it appears the feature items are a package meal. However when they ring you up you notice they are charging for each item separate. When I questioned the cashier she said this is not a special but only a &#34;SUGGESTION&#34;.   Again the heading of the sign says &#34;Feature Of The Day.&#34;

My friend and I asked to speak to the Manager. He used the same phrase,&#34; it is only a Suggestion&#34;. We explained to him that this was misleading and they already have a menu posted while you are in line, and at the cashier. This large sign posted shows a different food suggestion for each day...... to us and several  other customers in line agreed it is misleading with makes it look like a package deal. More of a trick signage.

Dick Portillo is  pretty much on top of running his establishments....this is one aspect he fell behind on ..my suggestion to the Manager since he was going to bring our concern to Corporates attention..... he change the signage from saying Feature of the day to SUGGESTION OF THE DAY.  I think it would be worded more precise and not misleading."

There is always a line at the drive-thru and there are always lots of folks dining in. Longer waits during the lunch and dinner hour of course. The food is always consistent and never disappoints. The restaurant is clean and the decor is not the 50&#39;s diner-decor like other Portillo&#39;s. It&#39;s park benches, cobblestone streets and brick walls. Like you&#39;re dining in a park but they brought it inside. They have a separate line for the salads and those salad portions, like the Beef or combos, are quite big also. 

What I like most about this location is that they have a separate section and cooler where you can purchase pre-cooked/packaged beef by 1 lb packs, tubs of seasoned au jus, and fresh bread. That way if you can bring it to tailgate, to a small party, or in my case--bring it home so we can make beef sandwiches and try my brother&#39;s homemade giardinera! Service is so friendly.

Portillo&#39;s can do NO wrong.

This review is two-fold: one part for the location and one part for Portillo&#39;s itself.

First, the location.  Bloomingdale&#39;s Portillo&#39;s (with a Barnelli&#39;s) is themed like the rest of the locations.  I recently attended my Fiancee&#39;s bridal shower there.  Their event staff was amazing.  They accommodated about 40 women and even had a space to put all the swag we got.  The apps were great and the choices we had for entrees were Italian Beefs, Pasta with Vodka Sauce, and the chopped salad.  Everything was hot and delicious and the service was quick and unobtrusive.  They accidentally forgot to bring out the fruit platter and when this was brought to their attention they offered to give it to us or give us a gift card for difference.  We took the gift card because while I&#39;m sure their fruit is great it&#39;s not Italian beef.

Now for the Portillo&#39;s franchise.  OMG you&#39;re the best thing ever.  I&#39;ve got an uncle who lives in Florida and when he comes back he eats two meals a day from Portillo&#39;s everyday that he is in (this is not strange behavior for a Portillo&#39;s junkie).  They started as a hotdog/beef stand and have stuck to there delicious roots.  Get a dog with everything and they know the only thing you don&#39;t put on a hotdog with everything is ketchup.  

The Italian Beef get&#39;s it own paragraph.  It is some of the best in the city and probably the best in the burbs.  If you&#39;re a noob let me tell how to order: HOT &amp; WET.  That&#39;s what you want.  This means they put hot peppers on the beef and then dip your sandwich in the beef gravy.  It requires a knife and fork but it&#39;s sooo worth it.  For those that believe the Italian Beef might be too healthy don&#39;t worry they&#39;ll put it on a buttery croissant with cheddar cheese. YUM.

I know what your thinking: all that cow and pig, I wish there was something lighter to choose from.  BAM.  Tuna Fillet.  BAM chopped salad.  The Tuna fillet is a recognizable cut of fish topped with tomato, lettuce, onion, and mayo on one of their fantastic buns.  The chopped salad has everything you could possibly want in a salad and then they throw some lettuce in, bacon? Check. Gorgonzola? Check. Chicken? Check.  Then they top it with a most awesome house dressing.

Lastly, the chocolate cake.  I would kill a kangaroo to get a piece and I like Kangaroos (animal and shoes).  I&#39;ve heard that the secret ingredient is mayo, I&#39;ll let that sink in.  Just when you thought that it couldn&#39;t get any better they took a piece of cake and shoved it into a chocolate shake thus creating the monolith of gluttony: The Chocolate Cake Shake.

Now for the mystery.  Portillo&#39;s is a fast food place.  They hire from the same applicant pool as a McDonald&#39;s or Burger King but Portillo&#39;s has ALWAYS gotten my order correct and they are actually fast.  How do they do it?  It&#39;s like they found a way to factor out a high schoolers stupidity.

Clearly I love Portillo&#39;s and if you&#39;ve got a mouth you should too."

I think it might just be that my taste buds have changed, but every time I go there I feel ill shortly after eating.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the service because the employees are very fast, friendly, and efficient.  No.

Perhaps it is also the total for the bill.  Portillo&#39;s isn&#39;t cheap.  Anytime I go there I expect my total to be somewhere around $8-9 and that&#39;s just for me.  I&#39;d almost rather go to a mom and pop joint and spend half that for hot dogs and fries.

They said they weren&#39;t, I asked if it was just the meatballs that contained dairy or if the sauce did as well. They said they both did (however, online shows the marinara is, so not sure who to believe). I ordered noodles with NO butter, plain. Food came out, noodles looked shiny, asked if there was butter... staff was pissy saying NO and brushed me off... I look at my sons face grinning cause he LOVED the &#34;dairy free butter&#34; they used. Ummmm, NOT ok. I wiped the bottom of his bowl with a napkin and showed the staff all the butter on his plate. They said.. &#34;Oh the cook mist have made it wrong..&#34; Really?.. thank god it wasn&#39;t an anaphylactic type of reaction, but what if it were?! 

Please.. educate your staff and chef about the importance of, not only preparing food as it is ordered, but about food allergies. I do enjoy your food but no longer feel as though I can bring my whole family to your establishment and eat safely.

The Indonesian Peanut Sauté with chicken has captured my taste buds each time I&#39;ve been there. It&#39;s made with rice noodles, spicy peanut sauce, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, sprouts, cilantro, crushed peanuts and lime. Had a nice kick to it, but not too overwhelming.

I showed up one time when they were busy filling a large order and waited maybe a minute or two at the front counter. The lady who took my order apologized that I had to wait so long and said there would be no charge for my drink. Wow, I didn&#39;t expect that but appreciated the gesture. I ordered a cookie too, since I didn&#39;t pay for my drink.

I used to work near this location and can&#39;t recall having very many issues at all, but today was very disappointing for me. 
Firstly, I hardly consider 230pm on a Weekday much of a prime rush time. I was one of two customers ordering and there were only one or two other people in the restaurant who weren&#39;t even necessarily eating but conducting business. 
The young man behind the register was very short with me as though he had better things to do with his time. Being a healthy water as well as gluten sensitive, I ordered my usual with the gluten free pasta alternative. Now I don&#39;t know if it varies from store to store on protocol, but I was charged $2 extra for gluten free. The past 2 times id ordered tubs from other locations, zero upcharge. And if a thing, I&#39;d read online from another reviewer that it was $1 upcharge. Not to nickle and dime, but at least a little consistency would be nice. On top of that, when I got home, my med salad was missing feta, thus simply becoming.. Some lettuce, very little cucumber - onion - and tomato, and less olives than I have fingers on one hand. 
Needless to say, disappointing. For something I had been feeling like having if for awhile not having it meet previously set standards. I write this review because I sincerely hope service here improves. I didn&#39;t call the store or rush back because I&#39;m already exhausted from my day and frankly do not care to come across as one of those individuals who are ultimately seeking free crap, I just want what I paid for the way it&#39;s always been served up. Besides, they can handle a direct complaint by throwing free crap at you, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily solve the service issue that might be more noticed based on noticeable free speech such as this.  Better luck to me next time, or at a different location I suppose?"

I like how all the ingredients are listed under each item.  They have good variety with sizes and combinations so you can get a small bowl with a protein plus a soup or a salad.  Now they also have sandwiches that you can add a soup or salad.  Plus, it&#39;s organized by cuisine.  The portions are decent value.

The sauce tasted homemade and they gave you a lot on the noodles(which i like so the noodles dont all stick together) They also put 5 meatballs on the speghetti that are pretty good in size(about golf ball size) the meat had a good seasoned tasted, which is always nice to get a flavor and not just meat!!!

We did not have the typical experience here, as instead of ordering at the counter, we had an employee bring us out a variety of dishes, two at a time, for us to sample. Over the course of an hour or so we had probably 5 or 6 different dishes, all of which were amazing (even our daughter&#39;s buttered noodles were amazing). Our server was great too. Even though there was a mix up in the communication and he wasn&#39;t expecting us, he didn&#39;t miss a beat and made sure we were well taken care of, even throughout the 3 or 4 rushes they had while we were there.

It was definitely spicy, as the description says, but spicy the way pepperoni is. Kind of like I was eating a pizza in pasta form.

None of the employees seem to care. They were still not cleaned by the time we left. They were out of some of the ingredients in our dish and failed to tell us.     We tried to eat and get out quickly."

I think people are just excited to have more options in the area thanks to the new Arboretum. Best to go after 12:30 or 1pm. At least that&#39;s when I have the best luck. The meals are moderatly priced, I always choose the smaller portion since it&#39;s so filling. The seating area is somewhat small so it&#39;s not good to come in big groups if you expect to sit together. You order at the front register &amp; servers bring you your order. They have some desserts to choose from like a huge rice krispy treat that is the size of a big honking chunk of cheese. Or a Snoodledoodle or a Chocolate Chip Cookie, both huge in size. Overall the food is good &amp; staff is friendly. I too work in the area &amp; will be coming back!

Like going to a non-Thai restaurant and ordering pad thai.  It&#39;s a chain, I reasoned...with all those locations I&#39;m sure they can pull it off.  Not so much.  It was greasy, flavorless, and it took about more than 10 minutes to prepare.  So much for fast food.  

If you must come here, it&#39;s probably better to stick with the American menu and get the Wisconsin mac and cheese.  Otherwise, there are better places to get your carb fix."

I came here with my son and, since I love pad thai, was looking forward to it.  The place is located in a nice upscale shopping center and was clean with friendly service.  My pad thai was delivered quickly to our table . . . maybe too quick.  The noodles were okay, the chicken was bland and rubbery, there were more spouts than noodles,  and absolutely no peanuts.  Even after mixing everything together, it was still tasteless.  But it gets better.  After digging into my bowl of blandness, my pad thai contained several elbow macaroni pasta shells!  Maybe it was telling me that I should&#39;ve ordered the mac and cheese?  I should&#39;ve known better than going to a chain for a pad thai but I never expected it to be this bad.  Needless to say, I will stick to authentic Thai restaurants for my pad thai fix.  As a final comment, I will embrace my Filipino heritage and say, &#34;My experience was berry berry pad!&#34; ;)"

Many older men come in.  I think it is a great spot for them.  Where they all know you.  I don&#39;t mind simple decor like Danny&#39;s.  Here is not my cup of tea.

Fried ham. Very good and added to your plate no charge.

Liver and bacon and onions if you crave it. 

A very well made patty melt. 

Sweet rolls warmed up with butter.

Orange or apple juice.

Hot coffee or would you prefer tea?

The decor is very homey and with a country theme. They have pictures of chickens and statues of them too.

The only thing that stunk was the fact that they only accepted cash. I would probably of dropped a star for this but considering the hospitality and great food I received, I will let it be.

I had the french toast, eggs, bacon, and hash browns.

The french toast was soft and tasted great. It was covered in butter, powdered sugar, and cinnamon. Syrup was served along with it and I just added a small amount.

The eggs were cooked just right and must have been a couple of big eggs. They also came with a couple pieces of ham and that was also very good.

The bacon was crispy and done just right. It had nice flavor.

The staff was very friendly and efficient. It was busy and the person waiting tables did an amazing job checking with everyone seated in the diner.

The interior is all diner, and that&#39;s a good thing. It was clean with a classic feel to it.
The only thing that could be worked on was the ventilation. The frying bacon or ham was a little strong in the place, I think it&#39;s just a matter of boosting the ventilation by the grill.

Great breakfast. I will return when in the area!

My concern with L&amp;L is the customer service.  The daughters are great, prompt, and courteous, but the mom is a different ball game.

The older woman is a very bad waitress.  She is very slow with coming back for orders.  She overcharges and thinks no one notices.  They are a cash only establishment.  It&#39;s clear that the attempt to cut corners is extreme.  We didn&#39;t use our jelly and put half eaten pieces of bread on top of it, and she comes back and takes the jelly that was unopened but had already touched food with my germs on it and just took it back to serve to another customer touching their food.  Obviously they will probably just wipe it down with a napkin, but still, am I the only one that thinks that&#39;s a little much?

I don&#39;t know what the tax rate for restaurants is in Cook County, but I think she charges more tax.

There are no free refills, not even on coffee, so be prepared to get charged for an entire cup again.

I don&#39;t know what the sales tax for restaurants in Cook County is, but my estimate is around 10.25%.  She will typically add $1.50 to that amount.  Then of course the receipt is illegible so you can&#39;t even tell if you were charged extra.  

I wish this wasn&#39;t an issue.  I just hate to feel like you&#39;re being cheated for being a loyal, trusting customer.

The food is the only reason why I go there, but if it keeps happening I don&#39;t think I will continue."

The staff is really friendly and even if you come by yourself or dine with people that you aren&#39;t realling conversing with, there is plenty of people watching and eavesdropping to be had with the wrap-around counter making home to most guys in workwear garb.

Bottom line: If you want homemade breakfast from a lovely couple, service that makes you feel like you&#39;re family without having to break the bank, come here. 

I would definitely come back here again :)"

Dude, they give you ham with everything!!! and its laced with crack. They do this thing where the eggs are really rich...and small, so if you order two eggs...they give you 4 small ones...and they are the bomb! The prices are low and the portions are huge. Another thing is when you order bacon, you get a big ass pile of bacon. You order coffee, you get a gravy boat container of cream, and while most diner coffee is forgettable...their coffee is almost hipster like, delicious. This is the ultimate breakfast place.
I dont need mimosa&#39;s and crab cake benedicts...I need a gyros omelette, with gyros sauce and a big ass bottle of hot sauce...or steak and eggs with buttered Greek toast. This is true Chicago breakfast. Service is kinda hot and cold....you get one of the old ladies versus the daughters on a busy day...then its kinda pffft. Food is great though."

The food is still fantastic, portions are over-the-top, and the service is exceptional. 

The standard one egg with bacon and toast is one of my staple breakfasts at the L&amp;L. It can&#39;t be beat. You get a lot of food with your meal, which always includes two big pieces of ham-off-the-bone. I&#39;m also a big fan of their French toast, which comes with either sausage or bacon, orange juice, and ham. 

The owners of L&amp;L are really nice people and treat us like family. They take a genuine interest in their customers and it shows. 

We&#39;ve been to all the breakfast places in our area and L&amp;L still takes the top spot on our list.

The plate was overflowing with food and came with a few extra hunks of good tasting ham.   I think the reviews that portray the Mom as a poor waitress are accurate.

One of the better breakfasts I&#39;ve had in a while.  My dad used to take me here when I was a kid and I hadn&#39;t been back in like 20 years.  My work recently moved to Des Plaines, and I had forgotten about this place.  Place is small, not really an issue that I saw.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s way different on weekends.  I was the only one there at around 6:30am.  Had 3 eggs over easy with a side of sausage.  Came with toast and potatoes.  If the potatoes aren&#39;t cooked well, I won&#39;t eat them.  These were definitely cooked well.  A lot of food for the money.  Talked with the owner for a while.  Great lady who&#39;s run it for like 25 years, and who also cooked my breakfast.  She gave me a paper to read, which was a bonus.  She also threw in 2 pieces of ham on my plate...again, bonus.  Food, coffee and an oj was under $10.  Great food at a good value.  Not many breakfast options in that area, but who needs options when you can get the breakfast I had this morning.  Decorated nicely, and they have a tv.  I did not use the facilities, so I can&#39;t comment.  Will definitely be back sooner than later.  My new go-to breakfast spot before work."

Be forewarned, this isn&#39;t a trendy little place for crepes, eggs Benedict, lox, bagels and such.  No, Skippy, this is a good old &#34;greasy spoon&#34; diner.  A dozen stools at the counter, about six booths, and that&#39;s it!  I do, however, have to warn you that you&#39;ll probably leave with the smell of the place on you, but that&#39;s part of the charm.  But the breakfast....my, oh my!  Eggs, as you like them (they use small eggs.  If you order one, you get two.  Order two, you get four... kind of a double-yolk kinda&#39; thing), pancakes, french toast... all cooked by Teddie (the owner) right in front of you on a well worn grill!  No frills here-- only a hot, wholesome,meal (albeit a tad greasy).  

If ham &#34;off the bone&#34; is your passion (I can&#39;t NOT order it) this is your place.  As a matter of fact, even if you order sausage, bacon (or neither), Teddie will slip a slice or two on your plate.  Served on a mound of always fresh hash browns (I have mine with onions and pepper added) this is a &#34;belly-buster&#34; of a breakfast!  They &#34;wait-staff&#34; consists of family, as all little Greek joints do.  Teddie&#39;s daughters, son, and wife all serve you with a smile.  I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here, and that includes an occasional cheeseburger for lunch (served, of course, with a complimentary slice of ham on the side).  Damn, I&#39;m getting hungry.  I&#39;m on my way over there to see my &#34;Greek family&#34; and have a cup o&#39; Joe and eggs over medium with ham."

We were brought freshly made bread which was cut into thin slices. Not bad.

For an appetizer, we had oysters in a sort of italian herb crust. It was good, but bigger oysters in the shells would&#39;ve justified the price.

For dinner, I had their half-baked chicken with roasted potatoes. It was good and filling. The potatoes could&#39;ve used a little more love, but nothing to quibble over.

On to dessert. We had two....the tiramisu and a Nutella chocolate cake on special that night, if I&#39;m not mistaken. 

I didn&#39;t try the Nutella cake, but was told it was good. The tiramisu could&#39;ve used more coffee-flavor and/or more chocolate flavor, but was fine overall.

By the time we finished up (around 6:30), the place was packed and the bill (with a total of four cocktails) was solidly in the mid-$100 range.

When we walked in, we were told there would be a short wait, so we decided to have a drink at the bar. A few minutes later, a family came in and was told the same thing. As we waited we saw a table being cleared thinking we would be the next ones seated. Unfortunately, they say the family first. It would be a different story if they were waiting for a smaller table for us, but we were seated at the same sized table. We were ready to leave but since Irene was so kind and felt horrible she had to seat them before us, we stayed.
I understand the place was extremely crowded, and it is very small, but that&#39;s no way to treat your customers. 

My grandma had been here a couple months earlier with a reservation but they gave her table away to someone else. So when she arrived, she and her friend were put at a tiny table near the entrance to the kitchen.

My wife emigrated from Puglia so I was a bit concerned about whether the restaurant could live up to expectations.

But we went in anyway and were one of only two  customers, but greeted warmly and seated right away. 

The menu has everything we wanted and we looked it over while snacking on a very nice crusty loaf of bread and awaiting an appetizer of panzerottini. 

The helpful waitress addressed concerns about portion size and preparations. I ordered a grilled seafood platter and a baked rice, potato and mussels dish and my wife chose to help me with mine and also ordered a sausage and peppers dish.

The baby panzerott&#39; were delicious,  5 nice sized portions.  The grilled octopus was tender and gorgeous,  served atop broccoli rabb and beans.  My wife grabbed the huge prawn so I tackled the cuttlefish and calamari. Wonderful. 

The rice dish is on the menu as Tiella Barese but I learned of it by its dialect name Rees, Patahn e cotes and it was delicious. Very basic food,  I think,  but we&#39;ll prepared and delicious.

A very small restaurant that had a very large, extremely noisy party. So noisy, in fact, that we were unable to talk to the friends we were dining with. 
But here&#39;s what bothered me the most. We had reservations and when we arrived we asked to be seated outside because it was so noisy. The hostess said you had to make that request when you made your reservation. They never asked me about that when I made my reservation. I didn&#39;t even know they had outdoor seating. When we were getting ready to leave I asked the hostess if I understood her correctly about requesting outdoor seating when you make a reservation. She said no, not really.

This place did NOT live up the hipe. We had high hopes for an awesome Italian Rest in our neighborhood. I&#39;ll stick with Francesca&#39;s and Salerno&#39;s.............Consistently good and service is always on the mark. Our server was nice, and seemed knowledgeable, but was not attentive. The food was good, but not &#34;downtown&#34; quality. Just because it&#39;s homemade doesn&#39;t make it Delicious. Bolognesse is a meat sauce, so why would you ask me if I want a meatball or a meat sauce. High hopes for the brick oven pizza. (they burned it, after the chef served me raw sausage) I suggest less ingredients on the Za and focus on an awesome dough. (Italian Style) I do not recommend and I will not be back."

First impression really cute place, nice remodel. Second impression we were dining in a sauna and although not a rowdy crowd the acoustics are so bad you can barely hold a conversation. As for the food our waiter who was friendly enough but never once came by to see if we wanted a drink refill said the sea food is the specialty. So we started with baked clams tasty but i must say its the first time I had clams that were smaller than mussels. One of us had the grilled octopus which had to be sent back because it was so chewy it was inedible. One of us  had the veal chop it was very dry. I had the giant prawns over pasta, the size of the prawn was incredible the taste not so much a little fishy and the spices were very bland. My wife had the eggplant the side of pasta was 5 I&#39;m not kidding 5 pieces of  spiral pasta under the eggplant that was so soupy you needed a spoon to eat it. And all this for the bargain price of 170$. Not at all impressed  and sad that it is taking space near my house that I have no desire to go back to."

When you walk in it is unexpectedly small, but the owners optimized the space they had with the dining tables and the bar- as we go to sit down our server, Marion, comes up to us in the first two minutes and introduces himself, we order some drinks and start to scroll through the menu. We immediately notice that the menu is based on Italian fare from Puglia, as Vito and his family are from Bari, this was a real surprise considering you don&#39;t typically see restaurants specific to that area! We ordered the meat and cheese platter and the fried calamari as appetizers, and the orecchiette con ossa e bracciole for our entree that we shared. The only reason I&#39;m giving this 4 stars out of 5 is due to the fact that the calamari was really bland- no taste at all- and the drinks we ordered were over priced ($10 for a Titos and water) - when it came to our entree however- it was food literally to die for. I have worked in a million Italian restaurants, my family is Italian- I have eaten Italian food my whole life, here and there and everywhere- but this Bracciole was hands down the best I&#39;ve ever had. The best. It was simple, extremely tender and the flavors were just excellent. Thankfully no raisins or pine nuts (I hate all of that stuff jammed in a bracciole)  I would go back there specifically for that meal and likely will. Our server was fantastic, I really enjoyed the atmosphere- all in all we were were very pleased. Do yourself a favor however and make a reservation if you&#39;re going to go - I don&#39;t exaggerate when I say the size completely inhibits them from taking any walk-ins, if any at all."

Staff was great and our food was so delicious!  The Calamari Fritti was raved over by my husband and father in law - I don&#39;t like calamari, but I got to taste the sauce with some of the wonderful bread - beautifully smooth marinara with a hint of spice, not too spicy for me at all, and I would eat just sauce and bread if I could! My vegan ravioli dish was wonderful and the sauce creamy and rich.  And Thursday night is free dessert night!  We were able to try the Tiramisu, which was lovely and such perfect texture and sweetness, and the Panzerottini Dolci con Ricotta  with a cinnamon sauce and the gelato cold and creamy with the hot pastry was heavenly!

What a gift to have a small family owned restaurant rather than a franchise to choose from. There&#39;s something about the warmth and attention you get from these cute places that you just don&#39;t get from chain restaurants...not to mention how great it is to support local businesses.

I always like dining in the downtown Barrington area.  It has an old school small town feel but it also has an upscale feel to it because it is a very nice area.  I had been to a few breakfast spots in the area &amp; I finally decided to give Bread Basket a try.  This place is a good option on a Saturday or Sunday morning &amp; especially in the summer when you are out early &amp; walking through downtown Barrington.  

Bread Basket is located on main street right by the antiques store.  Once we walked in it was bigger on the inside than I was expecting.  The decor &amp; booths were nice but there wasn&#39;t anything that made it seem like it was trying to be something that it wasn&#39;t.  It had a nice small town feel to it which is what I like about suburban breakfast places.  

I ordered a biscuits &amp; gravy.  It arrived in a timely manner &amp; was pretty hot just how I like it.  The gravy for the most part was tasty but I was not too impressed by the biscuits.  They were dry &amp; not that tasty.  

Overall the service was good &amp; I liked the small town feel.  The restaurant also was clean which is always a big plus.  With all of that said I would eat here I would eat here again."

So it was off to the Bread Basket, one of the two old standbys for locals in the village. (The other being &#34;The Canteen&#34;).   Been here dozens of times, back in the day, it was a favorite of my daughter when she was coming up.

I opted for the corned beef on rye, and the waitress told me &#34;some people like it cold,&#34; to which I retorted, &#34;no, it&#39;s supposed to be warm.&#34;

End of discussion.

It was a good sandwich, lean corn beef, probably from Vienna, many restaurants in the Chicago area use that supplier, and they have a great product.

My only &#34;beef?&#34;  The restaurant uses &#34;extruded&#34; fries. That&#39;s a potato product, a slurry of  mashed potato-like batch is whipped up, and then &#34;fry-shape&#34; pieces are shoved through a mold and flash frozen. They get a certain crispness on the outside, and are smooth and soft inside.  Just not my favorite.

But!  I was there just before closing, so the waitress gave me a go-cup of coffee, gratis.  Score!"

Overall food/ingredient quality seemed sub-par, which would force me to talk someone out of going here, unfortunately.

The food here can be good, but not always.  Decor is old, kinda medieval or maybe gothic.  I do like the large murals on the walls at the back of the place.

My last time there the waitress was grumpy and rude.  She insisted on holding an empty table that we wanted (after telling us we could sit anywhere) for a group of regulars and squished our party of three including two large men into a booth.

No one ever came for the table that she said we couldn&#39;t sit at, the restaurant was mostly empty and we didn&#39;t appreciate being treated as second class to people that weren&#39;t even there.  I thought most breakfast restaurants are first come, first served...

I generally like the place, but this one waitress is consistently bad and unpleasant and I will think twice about going back. (I think that she might be the owner&#39;s daughter or an owner because there is a photo of what looks to be her when she was much younger on the wall.)"

However, the &#34;cheese&#34; was slices of American cheese; disappointing. The selection of fruit for my side was okay: honeydew melon, pineapple and about one strawberry. The pancake was okay.

People always talk about the other breakfast place in town that is bigger and spends more money on advertising, but the food here is twice as good as at that other place...

I had the Eggs Benedict.  OMG!  I loved it!  The egg was cooked really well and the yolk was nice and runny.  The Canadian bacon was flavorful.  The English muffin was toasted well.  The Hollandaise sauce is really good and creamy.  The hash browns were tasty and are like comfort food to me.  Next time I will order them a little more well done to get some crunch.

My mom had the spinach and feta omelet.  She really likes this as she gets it every time we go there.  She also gets the hash browns well done and rye toast.  I like this, but I am not a big feta person.

My tip - Dip your hash browns in the Hollandaise sauce!

The waitress that I got this past Monday was incredibly rude and awkward from the very start. I came in with three of my family members and we felt rushed to make an order after just sitting down and not knowing what we wanted. The food was mediocre, service was terrible (she never brought my cousin her soup that she ordered), when my brother ordered a Philly Cheese Steak she came back to our table and asked if he had ordered a Philly Chicken Sandwich. (How do you get that from what he ordered?). She also kept standing right next to our table for extended periods of time while we were eating. Talk about AWKWARD. She kept bringing us water glasses when none of us were drinking water, by the end of it all we had eight FULL water glasses on our table. There were FOUR of us. Overall, another bad experience. I have never and will never recommend this place."

Sam usually thinks he knows what I want when I walk in -  - and his suggestions are usually right. 

This is a great place for the basics - burgers, BLT, and similar things. But the daily specials - usually with a Greek foundation - are also worth considering. Most sandwhiches come with fries and soup at a reasonable price for a lot of food.  I especially like the fries - they have a little extra something on them that adds some crispiness and taste. If you  don&#39;t want the fries you can have fresh fruit.  

I am a big fan of the Tuna Melt sandwich on rye.  I&#39;d prefer something other than American Cheese, but that&#39;s how it comes.

There&#39;s nothing fancy about the place, but  it is good for a basic lunch, with good food at a good price. 

Breakfasts are also good and I like Bread Basket a whole lot more than Egg Harbor because the place is friendlier, family run (Egg Harbor is one of a number of a group of restaurants), and never has a wait for a table."

The food is good, though as one reviewer mentioned, the bisquits &amp; gravy leave a bit to be desired.

The thing we particularly like about it is that it is quick to get in and out of, when we arrive [around 8 am].  The service is good and fast!  I like the place, and give it 4 stars.  If the bisquits &amp; gravy were better, i&#39;d give it 5 stars."

For $6.95 I got a cup of the most amazing chicken noodle soup (perfect for the cold I am currently nursing), an amazing open faced turkey sandwich with amazing light gravy, mashed potatoes, fresh buttered corn, and cranberry sauce. It was the perfect meal and the best value. They have such an array of dishes and their breakfast specials are killer. Everyone is so friendly and many of Barrington&#39;s key figures dine here when they want to get away from it all.

golden shrimp on fried rice -- it doesn&#39;t get much closer to heaven on a plate, in my opinion. 


downside -- be ON TIME for your reservation.  Especially if you have other parties. they won&#39;t seat you until everyone is there.. and if that one person is caught in traffic in chicago.. they get 15 min, then you might be out of luck for your table. :("

And our clothes smell so strongly of cooking oil that I think it&#39;s going to be a month before I get the smell out of my jacket. 

But overall, it was a pleasant dining experience, and I&#39;d come back here again. Just perhaps wearing less-favored clothing. 

Mind you, neither we, nor our friends who joined us were newbs when it comes to the teppanyaki experience. It wasn&#39;t our first rodeo, so when the chef arrived to start the show, I think he was a bit surprised to find we were more engaged in our own conversations than in his performance. The three marinated women on the opposite side of the table who appeared to be indulging in a girls&#39; night out also seemed a bit disinterested in the performance. 

I remember when we were kids taking dates to a dance it was always a popular option to take your date to a Japanese steakhouse beforehand. Why? Because you didn&#39;t have to make awkward conversation and could instead focus on the presentation. But now 20 years later, things are a bit different.

Our chef did a nice job working the teppan with the presentation. He didn&#39;t drop anything and he pulled out a few tricks we hadn&#39;t seen before. The food was good, albeit a bit on the salty side, but our drinks were refilled quickly. 

My one major complaint was the staggering prices. I don&#39;t remember other comparable teppanyaki restaurants being quite this expensive. Our dining companions alleviated this with a Groupon, as did the ladies opposite us, but we weren&#39;t aware that there was a discount available and had to swallow the full cost. I&#39;d highly recommend looking for such a discount should you choose to dine here.

But otherwise, everything was just fine."

Order the Kampai Special, sub filet and fried rice. You will not be disappointed. You will get, shrimp appetizer, Flambeau shrimp, filet and teriyaki chicken and vegtables along with your friend rice, salad and soup.  Oh and ofcourse your ice cream at the end, all included. Only one salad dressing to choose from but it is really good. Kind of like an ice cold spicy thousand island minus the cream. Hard to explain, but one of those dressings you can only eat there. Bring it home and it taste like you know what. There it works...

This was three years ago, and we absolutely loved it. After awhile though, I started getting stomach aches after we would go so we eventually stopped going. We moved into Arlington Heights then and started trying other sushi restaurants, but tonight we decided we&#39;d stop in and relive the fabulous floating sushi bar....
Environment- fun! It&#39;s a freaking floating sushi bar!!! Love the concept and they do a good job keeping it looking nice and clean.
Service- good. The chefs are accommodating and the wait staff is speedy, friendly, and helpful. We had a $10 off coupon for the birthday club and the code wasn&#39;t working, but they honored it anyway without hesitation.
Restroom- alright. It seemed clean, but my only concern was that the timed aerosol air freshener was just sitting on the sink counter, instead of mounted on a wall. This worries me because it&#39;s at the height of a child&#39;s face, so if it sprays, it would get them right in the eyes! 
Food- (only had the sushi) pretty good. Like I said previously, I usually get stomach aches afterward. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m eating an obscene amount of food or anything either. Their sushi is pretty good, not out of this world, but absolutely not dreadful. I would go again, but wouldn&#39;t necessarily go out of my way. I used to love this shrimp in a yellow sauce that comes in a black bowl, but I tried it today and only had one bite since it was very greasy/oily (I posted a picture of it). This one sushi roll is topped with salmon in a sauce, scallions, and diced carrots, and inside is crab and cucumbers- it&#39;s seriously, ridiculously delicious (I posted a picture of it!). The rainbow roll is always a yummy choice too! Just keep in mind some of the rolls are slightly different if you do carry out verses if you dine in!"

It&#39;s a shallow stainless steel canal with a bunch of tiny wooden boats chained together so that they travel in a circle to offer their sushi cargo to hungry patrons who ring the perimeter. As strange as this sounds, and looks, it works. My wife and I actually started laughing when we saw it but we went with it and now we&#39;re fans. 

The sushi is great! It&#39;s made by sushi chefs who are in the middle making fresh sushi to fill up the ships whose tiny cargo has been eaten. They charge by the color of the dish which is a pretty clever scheme. We spent $57 for two but we way over ate. We were stuffed.

We both had the Kampai Special (sirloin, chicken, and spicy garlic shrimp). We also had a spicy tuna roll. Some of the pieces were wrapped a bit sloppy, but it still tasted good. The onion soup and salad were good. My boyfriend was disappointed by the fried rice, due to non-traditional veggies added (lima beans and corn). He even asked for some teriyaki sauce to mix into his rice. It helped but not enough. I liked the horseradish dipping sauce a lot!

Tables are somewhat cramped. I think there are 1-2 too many hibachi tables in this place. It&#39;s not that large. Chefs are good but they only have 5 and the only trick they do is the onion volcano. Not as impressive compared to Benihana.

Dinner for 2 (granted we got a bottle of cold sake and the spicy tuna roll) was $84.00. Too bad we couldn&#39;t have used the $50 for $80 Groupon offer that&#39;s out there.  You have to have a party of at least 4. I think we quickly decided that for that price we could go to Benihana, Tsukasa, Ron of Japan, or Hanakawa in Libertyville for much less and a nicer atmosphere."

The Hibachi Chefs are always very friendly and accommodating to the way you want your meat cooked. I always walk away with a full belly when we go.

It would be understandable IF it was during thier busy time however there was about 8 people in at this time. After ordering a few rolls we waited for a long time and when they came out it was so disappointing. The rolls would fall apart as I tried to pick them up. The chef makes them so brittle that I had to use a spoon to pick up the fallen mess. He also drenches the rolls in sauce so all the food tastes the same.

Our reservation was for 7:30 and we were seated just a few minutes after checking in.

Our waited named Calvin was great and was constantly refilling all of our beverages.  I really like not having to ask for my water to be refilled and he was all over it.

We had a chef named Ruben and he did the customary entertainment that all teppanyaki chefs do before cooking.  Unfortunately, as he was spinning the large fork utensil thing around the spatula, he lost control and it flew right toward my face.  It missed my face by a few inches and landed on the floor next to me.  I laughed it off and didn&#39;t complain, but now that I think about it I&#39;m pretty heated because I easily could&#39;ve lost an eye.  If he isn&#39;t 100% confident in doing those tricks, he obviously shouldn&#39;t have been doing them.

I ordered the garlic shrimp and sirlion combo which came with soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, and ice cream.  I wasn&#39;t fond of the steak which wasn&#39;t well seasoned and sort of tough, but the shrimp was great and I&#39;d definitely order it again.  It is quite greasy though so be prepared for that.  This combination and everything that came with it was $30.50 if memory serves.  It&#39;s not a bad deal given how much food you get, but I don&#39;t think I could recommend this place over Benihana."

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because it&#39;s familiar to me that I&#39;m so enamored, or that I&#39;ve eaten here what feels like a bajillion times, but regardless I&#39;m in love. 

I have to admit I&#39;ve ordered the same thing every time I&#39;ve eaten there: filet (medium rare) &amp; golden shrimp with fried rice and 2 soups, no salad. The food has been consistently delicious and I&#39;d eat it any day [though the egg sauce is a heart attack waiting to happen, so I probably wouldn&#39;t eat it every day, because, well, I want to live]. But, if I was going to choose my last meal, it would almost certainly be this.

The service is generally pretty smooth, but I&#39;ll admit it can be hard to get a refill on water or a drink when it&#39;s busy. 

Bonus Tip: If you&#39;re drinking, the Blue Hawaiian is my favorite."

Recommend the Kampai special if you like shrimp, steak and chicken.

The golden sauce is outstanding (probably not the healthiest but treat yourself). The miso and salad are good starters and unless you are super hungry you won&#39;t need another appetizer.

I do recommend ordering extra golden to share if you are with a group.

Drinks are good but can be a bit pricey. Try them once (get the souvenir glass) and then stick to Sapporo or whatever you like the second or third time.

The place can be a bit crowded on the weekends. Early Sunday is an ideal time to go. 

The green tea ice cream is a great way to end the meal."

I had lunch with my boyfriend at the sushi bar during our trip to Illinois. Initially, I was a bit skeptical since we were the only two guests. However, our servers were still very polite and patient with us. They promptly sat us at our table and gave us water, and since we were the only two guests, our food came up extremely quickly as well. I was also very thrilled to learn that there was an entirely vegan sushi roll, since that seems to be fairly rare at sushi bars. Unfortunately, the roll did slightly come apart, but it was still pretty good.
We also ordered a vegetable tempura, which was a little bit of a disappointment. My boyfriend and I have had sushi and tempura at many places (all across California) and the tempura just didn&#39;t meet our expectations. 
We were too nervous to order a lot of raw fish, since it is a hazard if not properly cleansed--and we had no idea how reliable the restaurant was, especially as the only customers. However, we both ended up just fine with no food poisoning--yay!

I probably will not return just for the sake of geographic location (all the way here in California), however I do wish I had the opportunity to try to other side of the restaurant. Overall, the food and service were not bad and I do recommend!"

You get about 6 little shrimp, a salad with yummy ginger dressing, an amazing soup, and what I thought, was a lot of food in addition to your choice of ice cream at the end. I got the salmon and filet combo and it was cooked perfectly and my salmon was delicious. Golden sauce is so good! Our friend got it and I tried his and it was killer. Our chef was excellent and entertaining and put on a little show for us which was cool. He tried to get a shrimp in my mouth and missed but that&#39;s not his fault, I probably could have helped out a little bit. We had a lovely time!

Just got an obnoxious &#34; compliment&#34; from Josh R., a restaurant guru, obviously:

&#34;I like that you gave Kampai 1 star for always being busy, I guess you would give them 5 stars if they were always empty and on the verge of going out of business.&#34;

Yes Josh, because that makes perfect sense. I would rate a restaurant with nobody in it and a going out of business sign FIVE stars. Can&#39;t really &#34;rate&#34; a restaurant when you can NEVER eat there. Maybe you have stock in Kampai, but ratings aren&#39;t just about the food. It&#39;s the whole experience. Having finally eaten there once, it&#39;s just an okay experience in a pretty &#34;dirty&#34; looking, needs updating room. Service is meh. Not even ordinary. Very forgettable. Even the GroupOn didn&#39;t entice me enough. BUT clearly you are the foodie with the tastes of Kampai. Maybe you should save your sarcastic energy and get out of Mount Prospect to try some actual 4 and 5 star rated restaurants.  Sorry, Josh, but you&#39;re wrong. Thanks for the opportunity to let you know. I really cannot believe I wasted my good writing skills on the likes of you. Argh. Why are humans the worst species on Earth?"

First off, it&#39;s pricey. You do get quite a bit of food (soup, salad, ice cream, a shrimp appetizer, rice, veggies, and your entree), but the taste is really mediocre. They have a variety to choose from (I ordered the scallops and chicken), including lobster. My friend ordered the lobster and filet. They said the spicy garlic was not spicy, but it was. I&#39;m also not a fan of the yolk that they put on top. We also ordered the Philadelphia roll. One of my pet peeves is a poorly constructed sushi roll, and this was one. It was very hard to pick up with chop sticks, because it fell apart. The soup was unlike any other miso soup I have had (it had something crunch in it that eventually got soggy), not an improvement. The salad had way too much dressing on it. 

The service, overall, I was not impressed. They were good about filling up water (some places are terrible about that), but our waitress was not friendly at all. At one point she got a little sassy...which I didn&#39;t appreciate. The chef was nice, but he only interacted with the guests at the other end of our table, not with us. He did a good job with the &#34;performance&#34; part of the meal.

The atmosphere is very loud (it does get crowded in here). At one point they were banging tambourines (for someone&#39;s birthday maybe?). Very loud and distracting, and basically annoying. I also kept getting whiffs of a...not so pleasant smell. I don&#39;t know if it was the oil/grease from the food, or what it was. But it seemed to overpower everything.

We both left disappointed with our food, the service, and the atmosphere. I would recommend many other places before returning here."

The atmosphere was decent, though some music to add to the background noise would&#39;ve been nice.  The service was consistently attentive and exceptionally friendly.

The food was overall pretty tasty.  The salmon nigiri and ikura were my favorites, and the fish/egg portions were truly generous, notably more than another nearby revolving sushi restaurant.

It&#39;s really nice and clean.  You see the chefs making sushi in the middle of the room surrounded by wooden sushi boats on water.

The sushi is fresh and they also make hibachi items as well like fried chicken wings, golden shrimp on these little white ceramic cups, etc.

Each person who sits at the sushi bar gets a number or if it&#39;s all under one bill, then your group will get just 1 number (Green side you&#39;re still eating, flip over Red you&#39;re done check please).  

There&#39;s not really personal space here.  You can literal eat with the person next to you and get into their conversation even though you don&#39;t mean to over hear them.

You can also order off the hibachi menu like fried rice or steak.  

It&#39;s kind of pricey, they charge you by the plate.  If you don&#39;t see what you want in terms of sushi, you can order off the menu.

You&#39;re paying for quality and presentation.  

At least they offer you a stamped card.  The amount of you bill you get a stamp.  When the card is full, then you get a gift certificate for your next visit.

It&#39;s a nice place for a quick lunch if you have a taste for sushi.

It was my first hibachi experience, and frankly, I wasn&#39;t impressed. I was overwhelmed by the menu and all the options, the heat of the fire made me uncomfortable, and I was alarmed by the cost to dine there.

Fast forward to now, and I wonder WTF I was thinking. Hibachi is too incredible for words, and I wish I could eat it once a week, but my waistline won&#39;t allow it.

I would call Kampai a hidden gem, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really the case. Most people who like hibachi know Kampai. And for fun, search &#34;how to make golden sauce&#34;. You&#39;ll find a blog entry (Cookistry) from someone in Colorado referencing Kampai! Speaking of, do yourself a favor and order a side of golden sauce/egg yolk sauce with your meal. It doesn&#39;t matter the contents of the meal - golden sauce is a home run. When you go to hibachi, you gotta know you&#39;ll be stuffed with greasy food, may as well put it over the top!

Tapanaki - 5 star
Sushi - 3 star

Today i am going to write about the sushi.  I actually ate in the Tapanaki side with my friends but ordered sushi, I had the tapanaki many times and wanted to try the sushi.  Well it was kinda goofy.  At first they just handed me a sushi ordering form.  Sadly I don&#39;t know what roll is what (Ie dragon vs caterpillar) off the top of my head.  So I had to go ask for a more thoroughly explaining menu that listed ingredients. Sadly their site doesn&#39;t have anything either...

Volcano Roll - 6.50 
A spicy roll with eel and a spicy mayo sauce - very good!  

Spider Roll - 16 
Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab.  This was horrible, the first time I got it, it was burnt to a crisp and no meat survived the frying.  I asked the waiter about it and she said that&#39;s how it comes and people complain a lot.  Eventually she offered a manager and the manager said that&#39;s how it comes but if you want it undercooked I can get you another.  So they did.  It was better but not good at all still.  Very sad.  The most expensive thing and it wasn&#39;t that good.

Dragon Roll - 8 
Eel as well but not spicy and I think this one was fried as an entire roll.  This was pretty decent.  Not as good as the Volcano though.

Considering these prices, I would think that the rolls would be amazing.  I get the same rolls for cheaper and better made at a sushi house like Sushi Ya or even an all you can eat at Sushi Para.  And I would pay less in both cases for better quality.  So sad :("

We&#39;ve been to many in our area and we always use this place as the barometer to judge all other hibachi places we go to.  The food is consistently good.  The staff is friendly and the food is great.  If i had to complain about anything, and I&#39;m reaching here, I&#39;d say that sometimes the service for refills isn&#39;t the best.  Aside from this rare issue this place is great.  Look for a groupon and give it a go, you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.  I recommend you try the golden and garlic sauces."

The Golden shrimp is a one of kind, melt in your mouth entree from heaven. Teriyaki chicken and filet are also excellent. The Chefs are very skilled (John is the most fun) and the staff is great overall. Definitely 5 stars. Try it and you will never stop coming back."

The kobe steak was sooooo tender and delicious. My mouth waters just thinking about it....my fiancé and I hate seafood so the chicken and steak was a nice option for us. My mom and stepdad had scallops and shrimp and really liked the food too. 

It was a fun experience and our chef was spot on. It was a fun night. Except for the check....but we were paying for 4 people so it was not cheap. That being said, we got TONS of food and I was officially in a food coma the rest of the night.

My only minor complaint was that we had a reservation for 7 and we had to wait once we got there (we got seated about 7:15) but considering the structure of the place, I guess that&#39;s bound to happen. 

We will be back again!"

I made Father&#39;s Day reservations at Kampai...upon arrival the inside was well over 90 degrees.  Kampai failed to call and tell people that the air conditioning was broke.   Instead they seated us and had floor fans blowing hot air back and fourth.  There weren&#39;t even any cold waters waiting for us at the table.

Kampai would not offer any type of compensation or discount for the inconvenience that they caused us.

We left without eating, drove 5 miles down the road to Yu Sun and had a delicious lobster meal with Air Conditioning and no wait!  Same type of food and well worth the 5 mile drive!!!"

I love supporting independent establishments - however this one should be passed because it went stale a long time ago.
We arrived on a Tuesday evening for dinner.  There were three of us and the place was 1/4 full.   We were greeted by a miserable hostess, Michelle.  She had a stone cold look on her face and simply looked at us and said the wait would be at least 30 minutes - handed us a buzzer and went back to her book.   
As we were sitting waiting for our table we noticed a man at the bar opening up paper umbrellas for drinks.   One fell on the floor and instead of throwing it out he tossed it right back into the pile - I would not want anything that touched the floor in one of my drinks - just my personal preference. 
Once we were seated we were told by the waitress that we weren&#39;t allowed to order until more people were seated at our table....we were going to order appetizers, but didn&#39;t since she didn&#39;t even offer us an opportunity to do so. 
The food that we were given was terrible - the chicken was dry, the shrimp were rubbery and over cooked and the worse was the egg yolk sauce served on burnt toast.  We wanted it on our fried rice - but told that wasn&#39;t possible because there was too much oil.  I figured out why there was too much oil when I tasted it - it didn&#39;t taste like egg yolks, but rather a disastrous mixture consisting of 90% margarine.  It was a greasy burnt mess - that should never be ordered.

I&#39;d stay away from this place and go elsewhere - the service was terrible, the food over cooked and greasy and the prices high.   Not worth the time or money."

I have tried hibachi style cooking all over the country and locally, but none compare to Kamp-pai!!  You know exactly what your getting every time you come!  
The spicy garlic shrimp is the best thing known to man.  NO PLACE comes close to making anything like it.  I have tried and tried from place to place and no one can duplicate that spicy garlic sauce.  
The portions are huge and we never come home hungry.  Actually sometimes there is enough to make another meal the next day.  And it is just as good.  
I will NEVER try another hibachi place other then Kamp-pai again.  They all FAIL after you have tasted what a real cooked hibachi meal should taste like. 
One other thing I forgot to mention is, their HORSERADISH dipping save is the bomb.  Pour it over your rice or dip your veggies in it, UN-REAL!!!  That also cannot be duplicated by ANYONE!!!
So please if you head there, try the spicy garlic shrimp with the Kobe cut filet and the teriyaki chicken.  They have the Kamp-Pai special which comes with all that.  It a nice sample of all their best.  Please try that garlic shrimp and you won&#39;t be disappointed!!"

I absolutely love the set up of sitting around a hot grill and watching your food being prepared for you in front of you... And this place in particular is especially good. Their starter soup is full of flavor and perfectly salty, just the way I like it. And their speciality shrimp is to die for. If you order right... You will leave this meal SO incredibly full but only because you will keeping eating until you can&#39;t eat anymore and there seems to be endless food!

They know what they are doing here and what it takes to survive. I usually go to the sushi bar and I am never disappointed. It&#39;s an oval shaped bar with floating boats that have the basic rolls going around. If you want the real deal then the sushi chefs there will create a variety of specialty rolls for you. (You can also order some non-sushi items and they&#39;ll make it fresh without have to spend more money on the restaurant side). As far as the hibachi style actual restaurant side, they are great as well. Used to go more frequently but it can get pricey. If you see a Groupon get it! Forget hu hot or whatever other places cook in front of you. This place trumps all. Egg yoke shrimp to chicken teriyaki it&#39;s all good."

First- the two restaurants is confusing- and they are not connected so - steakhouse on right- they need to redecorate- it looks old/ dusty. Went to other side- w/ sushi boats- it looks like a cafeteria- I was wearing a dress &amp; heels bc they said upscale &amp; the menu says lobster is $50. Somebody please  help these people remodel. The sushi was good &amp; fairly priced but the sake seemed watered down &amp; pricey. Service is polite &amp; attentive. If you are looking for upscale atmosphere try bluefish in park ridge. This place is more fun for kids. Wear jeans &amp; bring the kids. Don&#39;t try to takeout the boat sushi - it&#39;s a separate menu &amp; about .50 more per plate.

We scheduled our visit that day, and it took three calls to get through to someone! There needs to be a better way to get to a person after 10:30am (Reservations supposedly open at 10am) to ask for a table since they are &#39;required&#39;. I called at 10:30am, 1:00pm, and then again at 5:00pm when I finally got hold of a person. Plan early!

Our chef was polite and skilled, having some fun with our table of all adults. I think they enjoy &#39;showing off&#39; for kids more, but he did well in demonstrating his skills. The usual volcano and spinning spatula. He really shined with balancing the spinning egg for the Fried Rice, cracking it perfectly at the end of the bit! That&#39;s a tougher one.

We started with Salad, Soup, Shrimp Flambe and a helping of Fried Rice. The salad was fresh, with an ample serving of Ginger dressing and a cup of soup. The Shrimp Flambe with vegetables and Fried Rice (upgrade) were good, though the Fried Rice lacked much flavor while being slightly salty. We added some of the dipping sauces to liven up the rice, but then it was way too salty. Linda had the chef add some teriyaki sauce, and seemed happy with that.

Linda ordered Teriyaki Steak with Golden Shrimp, and I ordered Garlic Shrimp with Teriyaki Salmon. The steak was done well and prepared with flair. The Golden Shrimp was a hit with Linda, too. She was all smiles when our chef spread the Golden sauce on thick! My shrimp were excellent, with an equally rich application of garlic sauce. Nice flavor and nicely cooked shrimp. The salmon was a nice piece of fish, prepared well, but a bit salty - not untypical for teryiaki.

For desert (included) we got a bowl of ice cream. I&#39;m always partial to the Green Tea ice cream, and it was very good. We were even brought a cupcake (nothing special, but nice touch) in honor of our Anniversary. If you come for a celebration (birthday, anniversary...) they even sing to you in English and Japanese.

Overall, for the price, it was OK. Serving sizes were adequate, but lacked some of the polish of other similar restaurants. Conveniently located if you live in the area, and the Sushi is supposed to be great, though we haven&#39;t tried that here, yet."

The first was two weeks ago when we visited with a $80 groupon.  The waiter asked for our groupon once the chef was already preparing the food and told us that the groupon ionly applies to four adult meals.  So we had to come back yesterday with the whole family.  On a Monday evening the restaurant was half full so that&#39;s a good sign considering it was 10 degrees outside.  First time here we ordered two Filet Mignon and Lobster dinners so this time around with our kids we order one Sirloin with Lobster and three Sirloins with Shrimp. I have to say that we liked the Sirloins more because they tasted more juicy.  The egg yolk sauce they put on the shrimp and lobster was delicious however I&#39;m really worried about how many points my cholesterol has gone up since last night?  We were lucky that we got the same chef who was pretty talented and working there for many years.  The food was really good and flaverable.  The waiter keep checking up on us so I&#39;ll have to give them 5 stars for the  seafood and meat, 5 stars for the service, the salad had way to much water and dressing on it so I&#39;ll give it 3 stars for that.  The two issues I had was that house Sake cost $9.00 and didn&#39;t have any kick to it.  Also it seems that many of the people are there using groupons so the menu prices are jacked up knowing that many are getting the discount.  On the plus side they don&#39;t charge extra for fried rice and dessert.  The place is far from us so its not very convenient...not sure if we will be back for that reason.  But if happen to be in the  neighborhood or driving down I-90 and have a groupon available we might visit them once again."

We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated and took a seat in the bar and had a drink - the bartender is a great guy and his strawberry daiquiri was delicious!  When seated, we were at a really fun table with younger people and one woman and her young daughter.  The guy next to us was a James Franco look-a-like and he and his girlfriend were great.  I went with the single order sauteed shrimp and husband got the filet.  SO MUCH SHRIMP!  We had three drinks again and the two meals, and this time the bill was only about $80 (compared to last time)- how that happened,  I have no idea, but that is pretty much in line with what I am willing to spend here.

Left and I realized the strawberry packed a whollop, so husband had to drive home.  At only $8, and after only having two, you can&#39;t ask for much more!"

It&#39;s not someplace we go all the time, probably 1-3 times a year, but boy is it good!  I highly recommend trying the golden and garlic shrimp (if you ask, they&#39;ll do a half and half for you)  I usually get the chicken &amp;steak, or sometimes the Kampai special.  (side-note: I&#39;ve been itching to try either the golden or garlic lobster, I&#39;ll report back when I do. it looks so good!)  

The food tastes great here, but that&#39;s not why you come you come for the show!  The chefs are always very good, and the incorporate a bit of humor.  I think for the money, you actually get quite a bit of food: soup, salad, rice, veggies, meat, then ice cream.  If it&#39;s your birthday- they&#39;ll come out and sing and bring you a little cupcake.

We don&#39;t usually drink- but they have a pretty good selection of mixed (re:fruity) drinks, and beer/ sake. 

If you&#39;re patient, you can usually pick up a groupon at least once a year which makes it a little bit more affordable.  They also have a birthday club, so you can get a free dinner in your birthday month."

Yea, it&#39;s the same as any other sushi except on boats but I&#39;m easily amused! Let down when I got there...we were going to the Steakhouse not the Sushi half. Either way, it was a fun time. One coworker was visiting from the UK and they don&#39;t have Japanese Steakhouses like this there where they cook at the table and put on a little &#39;show&#39;. 

I started with the Sushi Combo Small for $11.95 which includes one piece each of Tuna, Shrimp, Salmon, White Tuna, and three pieces of California Rolls. Overpriced for what it is. Rolls were okay though, neatly done and sushi was the sashimi was fresh.

I had the Sirloin Steak with Chicken Teriyaki combo for dinner. It comes with a shrimp appetizer covered in a buttery egg gloop but sadly I&#39;m allergic to shrimp so couldn&#39;t eat that at all. My coworkers thoroughly enjoyed the goop on top and loved that they got to have mine! These steakhouse dinners always come with a bunch of veggies which I could do without. Onions are gross! The chicken teriyaki was good but not amazing. The steak was a bit dry and didn&#39;t have much flavor. Green tea ice cream to end the meal, you can never go wrong with that.

I left with my tummy packed to the extreme, but I&#39;m just not a fan of these places really. It&#39;s one of the better steakhouses in the area though. Our bill for 4 people was $250!!! Thank goodness I had the company card, but would never go back here at the crazy prices."

The food was GREAT!  The only reason they are receiving one star is because of poor training.  The same person cleaning the grill was also acting as our server at the end of the night.  The bust boy came over and asked if we were done with our dinner.  Before I could allow him to throw away my 3/4 full bowl of fried rice and barely eaten steak and salmon combo, I had to stop him.  As he was packing our food, he shook his head with frustration.  First off, you&#39;re not our server.  Second, you failed to ask if we would like to take the rest home.  So don&#39;t take your frustration out on us.  

Kampai needs to train their staff better.  Poor training results in a one star.  We plan to return, but they need to train their staff better.  Bust Boy = Bust Boy.  Server = Server."

When you arrive at Kampai, you are assaulted with warning signs, regulations, and rules about each of the above.  Don&#39;t forget the sign to like them on Facebook!  The hostess seemed particularly put out by our presence, even though we were fuil-paying, non-Groupon-carrying customers with appropriate sleeves.

The chef was great and put on an engaging show. We especially liked the onion volcano.  The food was plentiful and delicious. The dinner combos include soup, salad, rice, veggies, meat/fish, and ice cream, and it felt like we got our money&#39;s worth.

Service was overall chilly (except for the chef, who was the only one who didn&#39;t ask us if we had a Groupon deal), but the food was great."

For me, the sushi and hibachi is edible, satisfies hunger, and has never made me sick, but I personally would never come here if it wasn&#39;t for my coworkers who tend to greatly enjoy the standard Americanized kaiten-sushi and hibachi. Overall, this place would satisfy the majority of people who&#39;ve never had amazing sushi, for those who have, it&#39;s not even close to the real thing. The service is very attentive and friendly though and the price point between inexpensive and reasonable for what you get, so it&#39;s worth at least a shot if you&#39;re in the area."

The atmosphere is fairly loud-- and I rarely complain about noise. They sat us an a table with 4 kids. The kids were indeed well behaved, but it was a bit upsetting that they took that risk of putting a couple on a date night at a table where kids almost outnumbered adults.

Our waitress was quite.. too quiet for the atmosphere. I didn&#39;t like how she tried to up-sell things like the fried rice without mentioning the additional charge we had noted on the menu. Also, at the end.. we were sitting around waiting for our hot tea.. which our menu said came with our meal.. and when we finally asked if it was included as we thought, she said, &#34;yes, if you ask.&#34; We found that really strange.. that they don&#39;t bring out hot tea that is included UNLESS you ask??

All in all, we had an enjoyable experience. The food portions were generous.. and it was definitely tasty.To be honest, if I hadn&#39;t had the LivingSocial deal, I probably would&#39;ve been upset with the prices/value. If we are in the mood for a similar experience, we will most likely choose Benihana instead on account of the atmosphere."

This isn&#39;t really the best setting for a group, but somehow I always went there with like 6 people...everyone loves this place!

It is not much to look at on the inside, but during lunchtime, you sit around a huge circle. All the sushi chefs are inside the circle, and between you/them is a moat with little boats of sushi floating by! All of the plates are color-coded, so you know how much each plate is (ranging from $1-$6, generally). Some of them are sashimis, some are rolls (vegetarian and non), and some even have salad or fruit, just to mix it up! You simply grab what you want before it floats by (before someone else gets their hands on it!)...and if you miss it and it doesn&#39;t come back around, they&#39;ll usually replace it.

If there is anything that you want that isn&#39;t floating by period, you can always ask the chefs for special requests, and they will happily oblige. 

Typically, a plentiful serving of plates and a mug of tea will run me about $24, which is good for sushi. 

I just find this place to be unique and great for a get-to-know-you type of outing. Since you sit directly next to people, it&#39;s not great for a group."

Generous portions of everything, vegetables and meat alike.  The steak wasn&#39;t amazing but not bad at all.

The atmosphere was very nice; there must have been 6 birthdays in a restaurant of 50 people and the staff sang and made a big deal for each one.  I noticed that a group brought their own cake and the staff was nice enough to cut it and serve it for them (very cool).  

We had a LivingSocial deal and weren&#39;t given the stinkeye (like so many other restaurants who treat you like trash when you bring in a coupon).  The service staff was friendly, re-fills were frequent and it&#39;s generally a great place for Japanese.  

My only issue was that the Japanese style-cooking showmanship (I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a term for this) was really short.  My girlfriend and I were seated at a table with 2 single parent/single child groups and the cook basically tossed his spatula for a second, did the onion train thing (never gets old), cooked our food, and left.  Granted, this isn&#39;t really a big deal at all but I happen to enjoy that sort of thing and when the cook takes pride in it, I enjoy the experience more and it puts a nice touch on the evening.  When they rush through it and half-ass it, it feels really lame and boring.  Were this our first date, I would have been embarrassed.  

All in all, I recommend Kampai as a great place to get dinner.  Not terribly expensive and yet terribly tasty.  Try and be seated somewhere towards the center for a cooking show that has some flair.  Good for kids, birthdays, and dates (just maybe not the first date).  :-)"

You will leave smelling like grease. Wait staff has no real knowledge of what they serve. If you work in a Japanese restaurant and can&#39;t answer what kind of rice is the steamed rice you need to sit down and look. Sushi rolls are the same.

Kampai is ALWAYS an ejoyable evening.  The hibachi chefs are great entertainment and extremely comical.  I love this place and will return again for sure!  

However, the night we decided to go and use our Living Social deal resulted in some flurries.  Apparently, all reservations for the evening were cancelled.  We decided to keep ours as this is Chicago and we should be used to snow.  Seeing as how we were the ONLY table in the establishment, the service we received was less than mediocre.  Hibachi chef excellent.  Only receiving drinks ONCE during our 90 minute dinner, NOT so excellent.  Offering my fiance a second beer only after we&#39;ve gotten desert, not acceptable. 
If they didn&#39;t feel like serving us they should have just told us they were closing for the evening."

I am so fascinated by breweries, so it was fun eating at one. Their flight deal is amazing- $3.50 for a whole flight if you get an appetizer! 

I highly suggest the spinach and artichoke dip for your app pick. The best I&#39;ve had hands down. Creamy and delicious with nice tomato topping and warm tasty seasoned pita bread. This along with my Cobb salad was more than filling! The Cobb salad is also a great choice- somewhat healthy but delicious nonetheless.

Food is your typical American fare; burgers, sandwiches, steaks, etc. All of it looked pretty good. Lots of variety to choose from as well. I ordered a burger, which was cooked exactly how I wanted. We also ordered beer cheese soup, some nachos, truffle fries, potato skins, and a rueben for our group of 4. 

I thought the best deal was the beer paddle (sampler) for $3.50 when you buy an appetizer. Beers are solid and it gives you a variety to taste to see what ones you like best. 

Not sure why this place is rated average. I&#39;d definitely come back for the food and the beer. Lots of outdoor seating too when the weather is nice."

Went a second time. My friend ordered the bacon Bleu burger with fries. I ordered the (app) seafood trilogy which was a perfect portion. I also ordered the wedge salad without the steak. This salad was a good portion too and very good. The seafood trilogy was ok, it&#39;s tuna, grilled salmon and sea scallop. The sea scallop was my favorite and normally wouldn&#39;t be. We also split one pretzel with mustard (app) and the baked potatos (app) those were both okay, have had better. 

I&#39;d say try this place but you&#39;re not missing out either. It is a brewery after all so if you like beer, check it out!!"

One thing I&#39;d warn you about though.  When we went there last time for some late night desserts, the portions were just right.  This time when we ordered desserts, the portions were on steroids.  So we had to bring some home.  Oh well, I guess there could be worse things to deal with. :-)"

The appetizers were all really good, including the charcuterie/cheese plate, calamari, and the spinach artichoke dip. The latter had great flavor and not too much mayo, as well as perfectly crisped pita triangles. The calamari wasn&#39;t greasy and had a good mix of the squid circles and mini octopuses. Sauce was just so so. The charcuterie had some good dips and was presented really well. 

The place was huge and good for big parties. The beer selection was obviously plentiful with it being a Brew-pub and everyone liked their selections on tap. 

Entree wise it was one of those menus where you have a lot of trouble picking something with all the great selections. Small plates, entrees, brew-pub fare, it had it all. But had the pub theme so it wasn&#39;t like they were trying to do too much. I really liked the French onion soup that came with my tuna. All the entrees looked decent as well that came out."

Long story short, we were blown away by how marvelous this place is. Great mood, service, and food. The atmosphere reflects an elegant American Pub with dark wood being the prevalent mood setter. Jordan, our waitress, was exceptional as well. She walked us through her favorites in each category of the menu, and also offered us free samples of their local brews.

We tried the roasted mozzarella flatbread as an appetizer, and it was one of the best appetizers we&#39;ve ever had. I got the pulled pork Sandwich with chili- which was great as well. The wait for our food took a little longer than most places, but we were in no rush, so it didn&#39;t make a difference for us.

My recent visit was a day out with friends, the place was moderately busy, and I felt our service was prompt enough, but our server was super nice and apologetic.  We were all happy at the table!

We wanted beer flights that&#39;s all, so we ordered them not even knowing the price.  We all liked most of the beers and some we really loved! When we got our check we were happy to find out the flights were reasonably priced as well.

The menu is diverse and on point. I&#39;ve tried almost everything from the starters to the burgers. The Jamaican &#34;me&#34; jerk wings are tasty and my favorite (I&#39;m a cereal repeat offender).  All their soups are delicious, but I recommend the chili. If you are in the mood for a good burger, go for it. The only thing I&#39;ve had that I don&#39;t recommend is the catfish bites (too bland for my liking-but maybe you are the bland type and this could be a match made in heaven; who am I to say?) 

The beer of the month club is a great deal: you get a free app up to $15, a free meal on your birthday, and upgrades on all their beers. Definitely worth it and a great gift for the local beer aficionado. Plus 10% off on Sundays and Mondays, and did I mention... three locations. I know what your thinking, damn this guy has me sold, but wait. One time I ordered a plate of wings and they brought me or two. No reason why, maybe they thought I was malnuturished, but either way I didn&#39;t pay for em. True story and just think, if you work hard and get lucky in life, maybe you can get a free plate of wings too. The sky&#39;s the limit and God bless America!!"

The food is a little pricey for the portions that you get, but it tastes good and leaves me pretty satisfied when I&#39;m done.

I mainly stop in here for the beer though.  They have beers that they brew all year &#39;round, but also others that are seasonal.  I always love trying the different seasonal beers, and I am rarely disappointed.  Most of the servers are knowledgeable about the different brews and should be able to recommend one based on your personal preference.  If you don&#39;t like beer, but still want a drink, then there are still a whole bunch of cocktails and wine to choose from.

We decided to split the flight of beers, because it was such a good deal. For only $6.25 we were able to sample 6 different beers. A few we really really like, a couple not so much. It was the perfect amount of beer to accompany our lunch though and it was great to taste so many.

I ordered the Slider Trio off the small plate portion of the menu and I thought they were very good! The sliders included a Pale Ale Pork, Mini Brie Burger and a Tenderloin Slider with my choice of a small side. I went with the sweet potato fries. The burgers themselves were really delicious. I loved the variety and whatever kind of buns they used were super tasty. My fries on the other hand, not so good. They were basically served cold which was obviously unpleasant and unacceptable in my book (especially because they weren&#39;t very busy). My husband basically had the same experience. He ordered a burger and sweet potato fries - demolished the burger joyfully and sadly left his old fries alone. 

I personally think after spending about $35 on a lunch, we should have left way more satisfied. This isn&#39;t the worst place I&#39;ve ever been, but definitely not the best. I feel like they have prime time real estate and excellent beer, but maybe need to either price adjust or boost their quality of food and service."

I got the buffalo sliders and the bread fell apart and The fries were very undercooked. The beer was good but for a food spot I expected much better food. Not to mention the bartenders were arguing for 15 minutes about stuff. Needless to say my first visit will not be brining me back.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and it is comfortable inside. I was there for lunch on a weekend and it was not too crowded which was nice, but it began to fill up into the afternoon.

For the food, I had the cheddar ale soup which was very good and perfect for the winter season. It came with a soft pretzel. I also had the taco and truffle fries from the small bites menu both of which were good. I liked the portion size. Usually when I go to places, I always end up with leftovers but here, the menu lets you order smaller sizes so you can pick and choose a few things and it is not too much.

Overall I would go back again and get the soup and try some more items from the menu."

I forgot what they called it on the menu but it was to die for.  The truffle fries are delicious.  Totally worth the upcharge.  The only complaint I have is the waitress was kind of a sourpuss. Didn&#39;t do anything rude or mean but you can tell by her body language that she was there to simply do her job.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Its too bad because the table next to us was being serviced by a gentleman that seemed to be a delight."

The problem is that they only offer this fantastic Porter for 1 or 2 days a year, &amp; then it is gone. All of their other beers are disappointingly average. BRING BACK THE PORTER!!! My friends and I request this beer continuously. Staff/management are curiously unconcerned &amp; unapologetic that their most popular &amp; sought after beer (their own words) is not on tap. &#34;We have it in a bottle&#34; they always tell us.

Our server, Earnest, was wonderful.  He offered a sample of their ale, but it was warm... which is a bar issue, not a server issue.

The length of time it too to seat our party: 8 minutes.  The two hostesses couldn&#39;t figure out where to put us... and there were three other occupied tables in the entire restaurant.

The food, meh. Mini burger cooked to hockey-puck perfection.

The drinks, meh.  They always take too long to arrive from the bar.

The atmosphere, meh... there were three other tables in the entire restaurant.

The beer cheese soup, meh... tasted like melted velvetta with no hint of beer.

Bottom line, we will not return.  We have tried to support this local restaurant on more than ten occasions, and this was the absolute last time we will eat here, simply because, it&#39;s meh."

Our waitress was quick to take our orders and we hadn&#39;t gotten a chance to open the menu yet.  She seemed annoyed that we weren&#39;t ready and left our table with a &#34;could care less&#34; attitude.

A few minutes after our waitress left our table another couple were seated across from us. Five minutes later they had their drinks delivered and getting their order taken.  Meanwhile we&#39;re still looking for our waitress to bring us our water.  The other waitress assigned to the other table obviously was aware we were still waiting to be served purposely avoided eye contact with us.

After a few more minutes of lack of attention we just decided to leave as we didn&#39;t feel welcomed.  The hostess asked us how it was and I just responded, &#34;not good&#34;, not wanting to answer her query of &#34;why&#34;?  I was too pissed off and didn&#39;t want to cause a scene especially in front of my children.

Would I ever go back, probably not. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it."

The hostess is super duper friendly and I think this place would be better served with someone like her waiting on tables. Our actual server was so insanely slow and completely disinterested. She was unfriendly and just not happy at all, it really affected our whole dining experience. There would be huge blocks of time where she would disappear. We were done eating for about 20 minutes before she came to our table again &amp; we asked for our check. Then another 20-30 minutes for the process of actually getting our check and paying. It just dragged on and on and on...

The real kicker for me though was when two guys grabbed a table behind us and she greeted them in a super duper friendly way. Wtf? Sexism up in here! The chick don&#39;t like chicks. Even if that&#39;s not the case, that&#39;s absolutely the impression we were left with here. 

Prices here are quite high. My friend and I opted not to have any of their entrees here which range $14-$23, though they do have burgers for $10-14. We both got a couple of small plates (ranging from $3-11) most of which interestingly/strangely come with a side. So...you could get the $4 mini slider potentially and get it with a side of their fries. Weird concept but hey I&#39;m down with more food. I got the Pork Belly Taco for $5 and the Slider Trio for $11 consisting of a Pale Ale Pork, Mini Brie Burger and Tenderloin Slider. The pork belly taco was forgettable, I&#39;m a huge pork belly fan and just didn&#39;t find the flavor there. The slider trio was a much better choice and I&#39;d recommend it to others. I wouldn&#39;t say it was amazing but all three sliders were decent and it was a good value.

My big thing this year is trying all the local breweries and Emmett&#39;s is just a couple of miles from my house! I was optimistically excited about finding a brewery so close to home that could become a regular hot spot for me. They have a fabulous outdoor patio that I&#39;m sure is amazing to catch a beer on in the summer. Problem is, I didn&#39;t really care for any of their beers. Just as with food, liking beer is completely subjective but none garnered more than 2.5 bottle caps from me on Untappd. Their star of the show is definitely the Pale Ale so give that one a try. 

Actually, give them all a try and judge for yourself! You can try all 5 of their beers for just $6.25! Quite a fantastic deal and you get to see what you like best before ordering a pint. They call it &#39;The Paddle&#39; and it legit comes out on a paddle. I really liked that they came out with a full description of each beer and the description correctly corresponded to the beer on the paddle. Made it super easy for me to keep track of them while going through each one. Especially since our server really didn&#39;t offer anything in this area, no descriptions, never asked if I liked them, just so insanely unfriendly. 

Honestly I think my whole experience was dampened by such poor service. I really would like to go back, sit on the patio, try some different foods and definitely get a different server."

My coworker and I hit up this place after work on a Thursday to do a little celebrating for the birthday of yours truly.  We were able to get seated right away and our server was funny.  He served us the wrong drinks and then he was telling us how he hadn&#39;t made any mistakes till we showed up.  It was entertaining.

We both ordered drinks and also ordered an appetizer.  The drinks were really good.  I ordered the mac&#39;n&#39;cheese for my entree and it was indulgent.  I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again.  It was good but I should have gone with a burger because those looked amazing.  

I&#39;m not a huge fan of the brews at Emmet&#39;s but the Red ale one is pretty good.  They have a few other cocktails and I tried one of those. 

The atmosphere in the bar area is fun.  Noisy but we could still hold down a conversation without yelling."

Was a little disappointed at the service at the bar. It seems like all of the patrons are best friends with the bartenders. We broke the golden rule of waving a bartender down because we couldn&#39;t get anyone to serve us a drink or provide us with a drink menu. We were able to settled for a booth in the bar area after waiting 25 minutes. The service by the waitstaff was a little more attentive, but I have to admit that our moods were soured at that point.

With that said....

Truffle Fries Roasted Garlic Aioli, a must have. Fries are beautifully cooked and lightly seasoned with super minced garlic salt and olive oil. It was crispy, it was soft and hot on the inside. A must have as an appetizer. 

Artichoke &amp; Spinach Dip Crispy Pitas, can pass on it the next time we go. Wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. Edible.

Slider Trio Pale Ale Pork, Mini Brie Burger, Tenderloin Slider, also a must have. Melt in your mouth pale ale pork and tenderloin sliders. Seasoned wonderfully. The Brie burger was just brie cheese on a small hamburger patty. A little lackluster in my personal opinion.

Overall, would probably not visit this establishment again in the near future. I just don&#39;t like feeling I&#39;m invisible when I need a drink. The finger foods are worthwhile, but not the service."

Too bad they can&#39;t match the food and beverages with the staff...then they would really have something special there.  We parked in a public parking lot a stones throw away from the restaurant.  I think you should stick to the burgers or the pulled pork type sandwiches.  Otherwise the portions were really terribly lacking.  I ordered the tacos...I had a choice of white fish, tuna or steak, I opted for the steak and tuna...literally a tablespoon of meat in a 4 inch diameter tortilla-2, for the price of an entree what a joke.  This wasn&#39;t even an appetizer portion.  One of my sons had a crabcake burger...he&#39;s pretty easy when it comes to dining out...very disappointing, puny piece of whatever served in a bun.  Husband ordered a pulled pork sandwich, everything good there....my 21 year old had a reuben...pretty puny...you can get a great reuben elsewhere ten times as good for less.  I ordered a dirty martini....it was really dirty...literally all olive brine and NOT a martini...NO vodka whatsoever.....I think I drank a jar full of vinegar....didn&#39;t want to complain since we were out for my sons 21st...they are making a bundle profit on mixed drinks there....lots of other places to check out...this place is ok for a beer after work, but don&#39;t expect good food for what they charge and their mixed drinks are a joke."

The inside is a very comfortable English/Irish Pub setting that&#39;s very clean and inviting. The patio outside is perfect for the summer and great for people watching. 

I usually just stick to the burgers and sandwiches and all of them are good and never had a bad meal. Love the Brewhouse and Blue Cheese w/pear burgers and also check out the Spicy pork sandwich. For the apps the pretzel twists with the beer cheese sauce is pretty tasty so are their Nachos and Truffle fries.

Now I&#39;m not Craft beer geek but considering the awesome suds breweries in the city and the surrounding suburbs have been churning out the last several years I have to say none of Emmett&#39;s brews have really ever blown me away. They&#39;re good, but not anything that will leave you speechless. But I do suggest you get a flight of their beers to check them out.

Emmet&#39;s is a fine place to go if you&#39;re in the mood for low key night in the northern &#39;burbs. As some others have said their service is a bit hit and miss but other than that it&#39;s worth checking out."

As a sleep-deprived new mother, she helped me figure out a great menu that would meet our budget.  The last thing my husband and I wanted to do was clean our house to host something and then clean it again after everyone left, so we were so happy to be able to have the event at Emmett&#39;s.  We chose to have a plated meal with 3 entree options, and based on many of my guests compliments, they really enjoyed the Rigatoni Mozzarella, Grilled Chicken Breast, and Grilled Salmon Fillet. She also provided us with a cake table, gift table, and arranged the few decorations we brought along with us. The server, Brian, was amazing as well.  Not only was he our bartender, but he really took the time to be in communication with me as the meal progressed, asking when I wanted him to take orders, cut the cake, serve ice cream, etc.  I will definitely be recommending Emmett&#39;s to others in the area that want to host events.

She never asked about refills, never asked how the food was, didn&#39;t say thank you, and took FOREVER. We waited a really long time for her to come to the table, to bring our food, and to bring/take our checks. I hardly saw any servers at all...so I don&#39;t know if they are understaffed or what.

The food, besides the soup, was pretty blah. I ordered the slider trio. Most of the meat was dry, one of the sliders was pretty tasteless, and the slaw was just ok. My friend ordered the truffle fries - very garlicy and greasy. I do like the small plates menu, but considering I wasn&#39;t all that impressed with the food...I probably won&#39;t be back to try more.

Really, the service is what killed the whole experience. It&#39;s really too bad."

Our previous bad experience was being ignored and not waited on.  During the summer, we came back with friends, and had a pretty good experience.  So with company, we decided to go there again since our guest is a fan of microbreweries.

Beer - decent.  The Octoberfest got better reviews than the brandywine.  The vodka and cherry coke got a meh.

Dinner - I ordered the tuna, hold the rice and double the vegetables.  Can&#39;t remember when I had to send my meal back TWICE!  First time it came out was full rice, vegetables and tuna - please remove that rice and double the veggies.  Came back with only tuna and rice....  Then I finally got the tuna and just a couple of vegetables - no sauce this time.  Guess they were tired of me.  So the waitress came by and seemed genuinely shocked that they didn&#39;t give me what I had wanted.  Where was she during all this time?  I felt really ripped for the price of the meal.

Two orders of wiener schnitzel - sour, sour, sour....  nothing to balance the sour tastes.  
And no gravy or sauce for the schnitzel.

Battered cod - fine

And it was steaming hot in the restaurant.  Guess it was Homecoming, so they heated up the place for the lovely ladies in evening gowns, but the rest of us were dying.  

So guess we&#39;ll go off to the multitude of other great restaurants in the area."

Starting with the service, they are extememly attentive and quick to take orders.  I LOVED the 1am beer on tap, it was refreshing with a complex flavor.  So far I have tried the veg burger and truffle oil fries, both of which were awesome.  The burger was a double stack of black bean burger which was filling and very tastey.  The fries felt heavy, but the truffle oil is really good
I have also tried a salad, which was also a large portion and taste very good.  I&#39;m not sure what the bad service reviews are about, becuase both times I have been there we had nothing but the best service with an attentive waitress and meals delivered in a timely fasion.

So I was expecting a great garnish. It came with a lime wedge. When I asked the server, he begrudgingly brought me a skimpy piece of celery and two small olives on a bar napkin. Wedge salad description again sounded great but came without bacon crumbles and almost no blue cheese! He brought a small ramekin with crumbled bacon... Def don&#39;t get what you order.

I&#39;ve given Emmett&#39;s the benefit of the doubt..and repeat business. But there are puh-lenty of better places to spend your time, calories, and money. I have grown to have a gag response when someone suggests we go there. No, thank you. 

Food is overpriced, drinks are ok, but nothing spectacular. And the service. Wow. They are beyond slow, and not in the intentional-so-you-spend-more. It is more the wtf variety. Not only are they slow, but there&#39;s a chip in the shoulder of EVERYONE I have ever been in contact with. 

Last time I was there, I was with two friends who got a table while I went to the restroom. On my way past the server hangout in the bar (mind you, this is in the open, and right by the patio door), three of the staff were very obviously making unprofessional and rude comments about the appearance one of my friends.

Let me preface this by saying I&#39;m a patient person and have dined here many times as we live down the street. 

Each time we make excuses for how terrible the service is. But tonight it&#39;s reached the tipping point. All the tables around us are flagging down staff to take their order or to inquire about where their order is. Every time we&#39;ve ever been here I have to flag someone down to take our order, fill the water, inquire about where our entree is, and find out if there can bring our bill at the end of the night. And this process takes place on a slow Tuesday or a busy Saturday.

I feel bad for the wait staff as it clearly isn&#39;t their fault. We&#39;ve gone off and on here for several years always hoping at some point management would figure it out. Sadly, that just isn&#39;t happening.

Why have we continued to go back over the years? It&#39;s not the food (very average), obviously not the service...it&#39;s the location (2 blocks from the house). They are the only game in town right now. However, that is soon to change with the opening of Tap House (a stones throw from Emmett&#39;s) at some point this summer. It&#39;s pretty apparent Tap House isn&#39;t afraid of competing with Emmett&#39;s and rightfully so. Once Emmett&#39;s starts loosing customers to Tap House they&#39;ll try to fix their issues but it will be too late. 

I pull for good business in Palatine and wish they would figure it out but my money will be spent else where from now on."

We waited at least 30min to get drink orders while sitting outside, and yet another HOUR for them to bring our food (6 people). I ordered a beer flight and was the only one not carded, which is fine, but I&#39;m 23. 

Beer was mediocre at best...I&#39;d much rather go to Lucky Monk in Barrington for a flight and a burger.

Ordered the stuffed chicken. SUPER overloaded in butter and garlic, and my friend and I both ordered baked potatoes as substitutes for the mashed potatoes. After our hour wait, neither baked potato came, so we asked about it. She then took my plate away only to return 3 minutes later with the exact same plate...saying she&#39;ll bring out the baked potato when it&#39;s done. Ok...then why&#39;d you take my plate? Also, my friend never got his potato, and she never acknowledged that she didn&#39;t bring it. At that point, we didn&#39;t really care and just left it as is. Luckily we weren&#39;t charged for it on the bill.

After all this...the truffle fries were the only thing that was decent. The vegetables in my plate and my friend&#39;s plate were completely uncooked and covered in butter. It&#39;s a very expensive mistake...costing us almost $160 between the six of us for mediocre food and beer and TERRIBLE service. Come on...keep the water filled and come by more than once every 20 minutes. Three hours after arriving, we got our check (not split, even though requested earlier). I NEVER stiff waitresses, but she was horrendous, and we actually did end up leaving a barely visible tip.

Don&#39;t waste your time here...go to Lucky Monk (Barrington), Emerson&#39;s Ale House (Arlington Heights), Stonewood Ale House (Schaumburg) or somewhere where they actually take service seriously.

Just so disappointing."

Food was straight up the worst I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant, which is fine. The service was in the bottom 5%, which is fine. Apparently Yelp dislikes anonymous reviews, so hi everybody.

Chicken was essentially raw,  so badly uncooked I sincerely hope it was pre-cooked. Not fine. The only thing I ask of a restaurant is it not get me sick. I was with a group and couldn&#39;t say anything

Me and a good friend were out on our motorcycles when we saw this nifty looking joint right near the train tracks. It seemed perfect - cool looking joint, house brews, outside patio, the works for my type of dining experience.  

We walked in and were greeted by an exceptionally friendly and warm hostess who seated us right away. Walking through the restaurant and seeing all the different beers people were drinking and the cool looking appetizers was making me giddy; the place was tastefully decorated and lit as well.  Unfortunately, all of the excitement quickly dissipated once we were seated.

It took over 10 minutes to even see what our waitress looked like, and I&#39;m not sure why... I saw two other waiters serving people around us and talking with customers having a grand old time. As she approached the table, her demeanor reeked of sadness and hatred. She approached us with a face that would indicate I had just killed her first born. 

Upon arriving - she coldly muttered the words &#34;Anything to drink.&#34; I left the question mark out on purpose - because she didn&#39;t say this in a questioning manner.  We ordered our beer and waited a lengthy 10 minutes before we got them. The beers were decent, as well as the appetizer we ordered shortly after - we ordered the pretzels with horseradish and cheese (except they didn&#39;t come with cheese as the menu said they would. We finished the pretzels before the waitress came back because she took eons and we&#39;re hungry young men, dammit. Strike 2, Emmett.)

The awkward interactions with the waitress continued through the evening until we got our main course. From this point on, we would not see our waitress again until she brought our check a half hour later.  This proved problematic, since the medium-rare Kobe burgers we requested arrived as charred hockey pucks that could chip a tooth if bitten too fast.  Never have I seen a burger overcooked this much.

At this point I calculated I&#39;ve spent 35 dollars for a pretty terrible experience. My hopes and dreams for this cool looking place were shattered by a miserable waitress and a &#34;Kobe Burger&#34; that tasted as if it&#39;d been on a searing hot grill since the Civil War. I felt robbed.

TL;DR - A cool looking place inside and out, coupled with an expensive menu,  terrible service, and the worst burger I&#39;ve ever had. I made a Yelp account explicitly for the purposes of warning people how bad this burger was."

When we arrived, there were just a handful of patrons and both the bar tender and the hostess told us to sit wherever we wanted so we sat outside on the patio.  An amazing gorgeous October day.

Our drink orders and food order were taken by the bar tender and our drinks and appetizer appeared as normal and were delicious as always.  Then we waited and waited and waited...
and
waited


and
waited

watch the large table next to us be served, ate and them leave

and we
waited

another round of drinks...

and waited

and waited...

apparently our order somehow got lost due to the fact a classic car group showed up in the bar and the bar tender thus had to go back to being a bar tender and not a server and couldn&#39;t believe no-one had taken care of our table.

I have to hand it to the bar tender.  It looked like he was doing the jobs of so many other people there.  I can&#39;t say anything positive for wait staff and hostess staff however.  Completely inappropriate to have a table sit and wait for their food for an hour and a half.

We did eventually get our food but even still we had to go up to the bar and ask the bar tender for our check.  I couldn&#39;t understand why the wait staff was not taking over.

So to make matters worse we had to WAIT 10 more minutes for our check.

Thank you for the complimentary appetizer but I&#39;m probably not going to patronize Emmett&#39;s for a long long time now. I&#39;m a beer club member but even now I think I may pass.  Such a shame."

It is a really beautiful building, clean and very nice-looking, with a great menu (hence the second star).  I would love to be able to comment on the food, but unfortunately the service was so bad I never actually got to have more than a glass of water.

I had gotten lost on the way and so arrived really late.  I only had time to order an appetizer to go before my friend and I had to be on our way.  I had to track down the server, and asked her how long it would take to make the loaded potato appetizer.  She kind of looked at me funny, nodded towards the dining room and said &#34;well, it&#39;s really busy here tonight, so maybe 20 minutes?&#34;  There were a whole six tables occupied, including our own.  Not sure how that qualifies as &#34;busy&#34;.  But I said okay.  35 minutes later, no appetizer.  I couldn&#39;t even find the waitress to tell her to cancel the order.

I might give it another try some time and hope for better service but so far as a monthly meetup spot, this is looking very shaky.  If they can&#39;t even handle six tables, how are they going to manage our group?"

The service...this is where Emmett&#39;s is disappointing. Each time we&#39;ve been here, we&#39;ve been unimpressed by the wait staff. They seem very inattentive and we always find ourselves waiting...and then we have to make a point of flagging someone down if we need something on top of that.

The patio in the summer is fantastic and it&#39;s ver convenient to the Palatine Metra stop.

I ordered steak sandwich and it was really bad, steak was too stringy and chewy, overall badly cooked. Fries were a little bit dry, but not bad with truffle sauce. Our waiter name Ernest was....I don&#39;t even know how to say better...too friendly and annoying. Good waiter has to know and feel boundaries. First of all, too many compliments to the ladies I had a dinner with (my wife and her friend). Compliments about nails, haircut, brows, are you kidding me? In my home country the guy can get a serious punch in the face for familiarity like this. He was lucky that I was in a good mood. Second, he tried to inject his personal favorites when explaining the menu, waiter can recommend something if he&#39;ve been asked, otherwise this is not acceptable. But ok, let&#39;s imagine that maybe he was just overly playing to get a better tips, but at the end when we asked for check, he tried to convinced us to take a dessert, even when he got our polite answer that we are gonna passed on that, he tried again pushing harder explaining that he can&#39;t let such a beatiful ladies without a dessert, not for free of course. The only good thing about the restaurant is interior, really cosy and nice, but overall experience is really bad."

The service is HORRIBLE...but I&#39;ve always chalked it up to the fact that I&#39;m sitting in the bar, or outside and it&#39;s busy. But, my last experience is the icing on the cake and will also be my last experience there period.

On Friday, August 23rd, a friend and I were hanging out at the Palatine Street Fest and decided that we were hungry and wanted some Emmett&#39;s Nachos...which by the way are really quite good. We got there at 11:40 and I asked the hostess when the kitchen closed. She said midnight and assured us it was fine for us to get a table outside. My friend used the restroom and asked me to order her the lightest beer on the menu with a lemon and the plate of nachos. By the time she got back from the restroom, I was still sitting there with the menus and nothing else.

The waitress approaches our table....an angry looking blonde/strawberry blonde, and proceeds to tell us that the kitchen is closing soon, along with the rest of the restaurant....ummm....yeah, if you would have taken my order ten minutes ago, there wouldn&#39;t have been an issue. We placed our order and never saw the waitress again. The food was served by a young man. She came back to give us our check, and when we put in our cash....she NEVER BOTHERED TO COME BACK WITH THE CHANGE.....nice.

I love how someone so obnoxious could have the audacity to assume the entire amount of the leftover cash is for her. We were planning on leaving her a minimal tip...but no such luck...blondie never bothered to come back.

Well, you know what Emmett&#39;s? I wont&#39; be bothering to come back either.....especially since I filled out a form on your website complaining about the poor service...and have yet to receive a reply.

I had a friend over who doesn&#39;t live around here and when we went to dinner in downtown Arlington Heights, she asked me why weren&#39;t we going to downtown Palatine since that&#39;s near where I live, my response, &#34;Oh, there aren&#39;t any decent restaurants there.&#34; My original plan was to take her to Emmett&#39;s, but not after that experience."

I ate here once for dinner and once attended a private event.  The dinner service was shoddy the first time, so I hadn&#39;t been back until the private event.  I was the last person served in a room of 45 guests, and they tried to serve me the wrong meal 3 times.

I&#39;ve been here a handfull of times and have always enjoyed the experience, including the time I visitied the Dundee location. 

I haven&#39;t exactly been able to offer my two cents about the establishment to Yelp in the past because I hadn&#39;t really dined at Emmett&#39;s, I mostly just drank beer, munched on their potato skins, and ordered Bear Fight shots. 

During the most recent visit, I ordered a burger with grilled onions and cheddar cheese along with their seasonal hefeweisen brew and pretty much went to town on my food while I gradually sipped the beer.
I have been looking for a good burger and beer place now that my ex-lover (Boston Blackies) closed shop and never called, but I think I have found my rebound. I wish I had taken the initiative to eat dinner here before, I guess I hadn&#39;t thought of it becuase I live in Arlington Heights and usually opt for more local dining, but it&#39;s not too far away so I will definitely have Emmett&#39;s on my radar from now on.

Other items of note include the [battered cod] fish tacos, and the 1 a.m. Ale. And I guess I&#39;ll admit that the Bikini Martini tastes pretty good too..... In hindsight I do love bikinis, and martinis, so why not the combo? 

Oh and if youre unaware, they will  have an outdoor host from time to time. There&#39;s a sign right by the podium outside that says &#39;for outdoor seating see the host inside&#39; so dont be fooled!"

I went here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch which was quite busy but did not feel crowded at all. As other reviewers have said, the service definitely needs some work as it can be slow at times -- however the quality of food for the price pushes my rating back up to five stars. If the service was improved, I would definitely come back more often and this could be one of my favorite places to go.

Beer: I tried the sampler paddle and enjoyed all 5 items. In particular the Munich Light German Lager which was clean and crisp with almost no bitterness, the Pale Ale which was bursting with flavor and body and had a pleasant aftertaste, and the Red Ale which had just the amount of sweetness and toastiness to give a nice complex flavor. Although I am not a big fan out stout, I did enjoy the one I had here.

Side Salad: Nice mix of greens with fresh vegetables and croutons. On par with the salads you&#39;ll find at nicer Italian restaurants.

Pork loin sandwich: Bursting with flavor and juicy meat. Flavored with an apricot glaze, bacon, and garlic mayonnaise with a nice sharp cheddar to match with the flavorful onion roll.

Prime rib sandwich: Good size cut of meat (a little thicker than the shavings you&#39;ll find in most restaurants), served with crispy onions and horseradish sauce on a flavorful onion roll. 

Sesame tuna: Slightly overcooked but flavorful and delicious. Actually prepared better than many other specialty seafood restaurants I&#39;ve tried this dish at (go to Bonefish Grill and try the ahi tuna sashimi for something similar).

Sunrise burger: After DC Sarnies had closed in Deerfield, I was afraid i would have trouble finding another awesome burger in the suburbs. However, this burger with a nice thick patty, bacon jam, and fried egg on a brioche bun provided me with the answer to my burger needs. 

At this point, I was about to give 5 for the food but lowered to 4 for service, however the dessert was so good it changed my mind.

Snickers pie: Arguably an improvement on the original candy -- just the right amount of caramel and chocolate with an ice cream that&#39;s not too sweet on a crust of crumbled oreo cookies. Simple, but profound in its flavor.

Raspberry tiramisu: Wow, this was bursting with flavor and aroma -- even without the general heavy liquor flavor you usually expect, it was a great item. The texture was silky smooth, the marscapone cheese provided a full body, the presentation was excellent -- all tied together with just the right amount of raspberry flavor. Definitely a must try item if you love both tiramisu and cheesecake."

For appetizers, the truffle fries are delicious as are the pretzel twists and the cheddar ale soup. The entrees are also really good, especially the pork medallions and the fried cod. I also love the tavern tacos. Really, there are no bad options! 

Plus, Emmett&#39;s offers small plates so if you want a smaller option or can&#39;t decide between a few choices, that&#39;s a great option as well. If you can save room, don&#39;t miss the desserts! They&#39;re great as well. The one and only downside is that the service can be hit or miss, but never bad enough to spoil a wonderful meal!"

I found most of the other reviews to be spot on. The food portions are enormous! My wife and I both got the large portions and it barely looked liked we even touched our food after we finished eating dinner. One of the large portions lasted me a dinner plus TWO lunches.

In regards to food, the flavoring was decent and the main reason I am only giving it 5 stars. There&#39;s a chinese place back in college called Cravings and no other place so far has compared. Some other reviewers mention the food was bland. I didn&#39;t think it was bland, however it could use a little extra seasoning/flavor.

Canton House is rated highly as it should be. The service is friendly and quick. The food is tasty and fairly priced. Those all add up to a solid spot of Chinese takeout when you crave fried rice and egg rolls. I grabbed a menu and will work my way through their lunch and dinner specials.

It&#39;s important to note at the beginning of this review that I ordered delivery here the night of a big snow storm.  The snow was just starting to fall, and neither I or my GF wanted to head out into the cold nastiness to get some food.  I&#39;d seen this place a few times while driving around, and with my bad luck with Chinese delivery here I was more than a little reluctant, but I do love me some General Tso&#39;s chicken... so I gave it a go.

The food was delicious, I got a large General Tso&#39;s (I know, not too adventurous, but I like to gauge Chinese delivery by their General) and my GF got a large sweet and sour chicken.  I&#39;ll start out by saying, get the small unless you are a football linesman.  They pack the bags with food, pounds of it, and it&#39;s great!  The wonton was light and flavorful, and the chicken was perfectly cooked.  The only drawback here was the egg rolls, which were clearly a frozen variety that had a very heavy almost dirty flavor.  Other than that, the place was perfect.

I&#39;d like to just add here that the delivery guy who dropped off our food is the reason this place gets a 5-star and not just a 4.  He got to us in ~35min and was super pleasant.  I will definitely be back!

This was the saltiest food I have eaten in a long time.  The fried rice that comes with the lunch special was just ok.  Other than salt, the flavor was lacking.  So while I didn&#39;t particularly enjoy this meal, it wasn&#39;t the worst thing I have had.  I won&#39;t return, but if you like very salty food then you may enjoy Canton House.

In fact, I have always wanted to go through a Chinese restaurant menu and order everything, at least once. Although, I have never found the right place to attempt such a task. I think Canton House is the place. However, a more realistic goal will be to tackle the Lunch Special Menu.

So far I have had the sweet and sour chicken, and the orange chicken.  Both with fried rice and egg roll. 

The portions are HUGE!!!  I think you get about 15 to 20 decent sized pieces of chicken with a heaping amount of pork fried rice.  I am in love with the food here because it tastes like old-school Chinese food I&#39;m familiar with from the 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s.  Egg rolls are crunchy and delicious.  I could eat 50 of them.  Well, maybe 4 of them. 

Currently,out of the Lunch Specials: 

#1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 

I have completed #5 and #18.  

Next on the list will probably #16, Liu&#39;s Special Lo Mein.  I&#39;ll find out what make&#39;s Liu&#39;s lo mein so special. 

Stayed tuned for updates on my quest.  I will order and eat at least once a week as to complete this project within 4 months from now.  August 6, 2014 to December 6, 2014."

They have great prices and the best Lo Mein Ive had anywhere not to mention Giant portions! It&#39;s unique and they even use true Cantonese vegetables to the Americaized version of dishes.
 If you ask them to leave something out (Ex: I hate mushrooms) they take great care to make sure they do so and are very friendly every time I go there.  Its my top choice for &#34;Chinese&#34; since Ive moved here!"

In scouring reviews of places in my new neighborhood, Canton House come up quite favorably, so I gave them a shot. Those ratings are well deserved.

I ordered some crab rangoon, sweet &amp; sour chicken, and the General Tso&#39;s chicken. One really nice feature of Canton House is that, for a small extra charge, you can receive a dinner portion of their various lunchtime specials, which includes an egg roll, so you don&#39;t need to order them separately. The rangoon and egg rolls were quite good on their own, but I wasn&#39;t a fan of the pre-packaged sweet and sour sauce they included in the bag. The two chicken dishes accompanying pork fried rice were very tasty, with the rice being among the best I&#39;ve had. The dinner portions were gigantic; we had enough leftovers for two more meals. Given that the total bill for everything we ordered was less than $25, Canton House is a tremendous value. Very much recommended."

Ordered #327 Sweet and Sour Combo in qty. of appearance, Lots of Chicken, Pork and Shrimp, the S&amp;S sauce was great but disappointed only two pieces of Green Pepper (crispy and flavorful), two pieces of tomato (fresh and very good), 10 small pieces of Pineapple (canned but passable.)  
Also Shrimp With Lobster sauce. perfectly cooked shrimp, Lobster souce was a little week in seasoning and lobster flavor .

This is definitely not a BBQ joint - in fact, is mostly Gyro style menu items. Well... That&#39;s ok, we were at first pleasantly surprised ... We love Gyros! Nothing wrong with an unexpected find, right?

Atmosphere: 
The restaurant was basic but clean -- no complaints for a casual cafe-style place. That being said, the eating utensils were not individually wrapped in plastic, and all thrown together in a (not so sanitary looking) bin. I understand this is a casual spot but I&#39;m a little grossed out by that! 

Food:
Overall the prices are not bad -- about $5-$8 a plate. The serving sizes are more than adequate but the taste profile was average at best. We love Gyro places - and we&#39;re looking forward to a spiced, flavorful snack! 
We tried the burger, Gyro sandwich and a hot dog -- all were greasy, bland and unfortunately boring. What a let down!

We settled on the prerequisite ribs, and when we prodded the cheerful voice what he would recommend, he laughingly said (and I paraphrase) &#34; I wouldn&#39;t provide any recommendations, in case you don&#39;t like that, and never come back.&#34; Hahaha. Gotta give him 1 star for candor. 

We then asked him if the chicken was bbq, since the menu didn&#39;t quite specify that, he said &#34;We can make it bbq for you.&#34; !?!?!?! Is this place not called the BBQ patio? 

My kind husband decided to give it a shot even though I was waving my hands wildly not to do it. I suspect all they are doing is slather some KC Masterpiece sauce over it.

All entrees came with a heavily buttered &#34;garlic&#34; bread and creamy cole slaw and fries. 

The ribs were not your fall-off-the-bone variety. Shockingly, the made-on-the-spot bbq chicken was the better of the two.

Ultimately, despite the absent recommendation from the staff for fear we won&#39;t return, we are not returning. It&#39;s too bad that this hole-in-the-wall spot did not hit a spot with us."

Yes, the ribs are good and at a good price. The chicken is BBQ, Greek, or plain and at $5 for 1/2 chicken, fries, cole slaw and garlic bread a real bargain. The Gyros plate is a meal for 2 (exceept for us over eaters). The Italian Beef is good (not spectacular) and is a good 8 inches in length. 
It is jammed at lunch and does a brisk dinner business though most of it is carried out.
The owners are nice, self effacing guys whose only goal seems to keep people well fed at a decent price."

Sam&#39;s is very popular with seniors and families.

I recently had Shrimp De Jonghe. The garlic aroma was hefty, but the flavor was not over-powering, as compared to other places. Most meals include a bowl of soup. We also enjoy the Monday special leg of lamb, which melts off the bone."

This reminds me of old time diners where you have the regular menu, then daily specials. It definitely needs an update in decor, but I thought the bar looked nice.

Service was outstanding. The server was so perky it was like she was on speed. (I&#39;m sure she wasn&#39;t.) But the food was kind of blah. I had a French dip. The meat was somewhat tasteless as was the au jus. The fires were very good - I think they were lightly battered and not too salty.

Food has satisfied me, but never impresses me, but also never disappoints.  Service is hit or miss depending on who you have.  The wait staff can be a little unprofessional as I observed an argument between 2 waitress and the manager that was going on during the dinner service and both waitresses were not doing a good job as a result.  The staff needs to keep the drama behind closed doors and not on the service floor.  But back to the food.  Definitely a good local place to go to for a bite to eat, reasonably priced and average food.  When you walk in it does feel a bit &#34;regulars&#34; oriented with people sitting at the bar, and to put it nicely an &#34;older&#34; demographic of people eating there for the most part.

I love the French Dip sandwich and the lovely professional servers have gotten me hooked on the sour cream and fresh horseradish that they mix up for me.  Only reasons for not giving 5 stars - on this visit our split pea soup was yummy, but not very hot and there was some strange looking white capsule type thing in my daughter&#39;s lemonade.  Our waitress, when alerted, immediately took it over to be replaced.  I will say, we were sitting where we could see what was going on.

They have daily specials and a pretty decent sized regular menu. Lunch type sandwiches are ~$5 and the regular lunch menu item can range up to $12.

There are many places to choose from in my area but my top pick is Papa Saverio&#39;s. One important incentive: coupons attached to the pizza box that I always save and use on my next order. Will it be Free Delivery or Free 2-Liter Soda today? 

I don&#39;t trust online ordering. Too many variables to mess things up with  my order, my payment, my delivery... So when I call in, I am always greeted by a friendly voice who gives me peace of mind. 

Today, I ordered one of their Speciality Pizzas: a 12&#34; ( you can go bigger)  Beef &amp; Giardiniera. It&#39;s roasted Italian Beef with Hot (you can choose Sweet or Both) Giardiniera peppers and Mozzarella cheese with a Can of Coke and Jalapeno Poppers with Cheddar cheese (they offer cream cheese too). A lot of food for one person but I have enough for leftovers; so, I decided to save money and redeem their Free Delivery coupon. 

People who complain about slow delivery apparently are ignorant to having their pizza made fresh, cooked and delivered with other orders. If you&#39;re going to order during peak lunch and dinner times, your complaints sound ridiculous to the rest of us who know better. I placed my order at 2:12pm and it arrived at my door at 2:38pm.

I just went here with my mom for a party with my dad and his soccer buddies. They throw parties here a couple times a year. 

The food was really good, but how can you go wrong with kbbq? We had unlimited chadol and samgyupsal with some beer and soju. The banchan was ok, nothing special. Kimchi was perfect. Super fermented, just how I like it. The little salad that comes with the kbbq was really good!! I actually prefer it over the ones I&#39;ve tried at other restaurants. The service was quick too considering the amount of people they were serving at the same time.

I didn&#39;t stay long enough to try the fried rice at the end or the karaoke. Maybe next time."

about nine of us enjoyed singing our hearts out. we received little instruction on how to maneuver the control panel contraption, but once we got the basics, we ran with it.

at the end of our allotted time, we went to check out, and were promptly told we owed $222. when asked why, we were told the normal room fees plus $50 for bringing alcohol.

biscuse me? luckily, there was a posted sign that displayed the $1 per bottle &#34;corkage fee&#34; -- let&#39;s not even get into the fact that not a single employee corked a ANYTHING, we didn&#39;t receive ice buckets or even a churchkey -- we handled everything ourselves. on principle, one of the people in our party went back in the room and counted all the open bottles. 32. not 50. 

after we corrected her, the employee threw US shade when she had to adjust the cost down. then, when we brought up the fact that we wanted to split the cost, she informed us that everyone using a card would be charged an additional $2 convenience fee. you know what? forget it.

every person had a fun time at ding dong dang, but it was entirely disappointing to feel like someone was taking advantage of the fact that a party was too busy enjoying themselves to receive the fair, posted rates. we were also the only patrons, so it would&#39;ve been nice to feel even a little bit tended to.

we were excited to have a new celebration spot, but it seems like we&#39;ll have to keep looking."

We ended up running to the Valli Produce to grab beer, but they charge $1/bottle fee, so it may be better to bring wine or something. They charge a little more for the corking fee for wine but I think it would still be less than the beer. As for the room and the karaoke selection, it was great. We had a freaking blast and laughed our butts off singing in our own room. It was a nice size and had a great big table in the middle. We walked around to see that they had some really big rooms, too. Now we want to plan a party there. The only reason I gave 4 stars was that getting info on this place was tough. Different reviews say it&#39;s BYOB, then a note from the owner said they are NOT, so we wasted some of our karaoke time going to buy beer."

First things first, if you don&#39;t know about Korean karaoke now you know. In Korean it&#39;s called Nohraebang - Nohrae meaning Singing and Bang meaning Room. Unlike American style karaoke, you get to be in your own private little room screaming at the top of your lungs, as to not offend others with your angelic singing voice...or in my case, offend people with my dropping lyrics like Eminem.

Ding Dong Dang is BYOB now!!! Which makes me love it even more. They do charge a corkage fee, but have someone ask them nicely in Korean to waive it and they will. They are super nice about bringing out glasses and water and just going the whole nine yards with the BYOB situation.

Ding Dong Dang is the only nohraebang (karaoke rooms) in the &#39;burbs in the Schaumburg area and has been a staple for at least the last 15 years. Sure they don&#39;t have all the amazing songs as the city spots - although better than the Niles nohraebangs - and sure the rooms may not be as fancy as the city spots, but they got what you need. A mic is really all you need. Extra bonus points for the disco ball lighting spinning around.

Any time there is any type of issue with the sound, they are always quick to come in and fix it. More often than not, they apply some kind of discount for us since we spend hours singing our hearts out.

Plus they have food for a fee courtesy of the adjoining restaurant! 

I would be lying if I said I didn&#39;t close this place down at 3am many times over the past 15 years. Get a group of friends, some drinks and party like a rockstar."

First off the place hard to find cause it didn&#39;t say Ding Dong Dang in the front so after making 2 laps around the strip mall I found it.  The food took over 2 hours to arrive and we constantly had to ask and remind the waitress about our missing drinks and food.  Food was alright, but not the best.  Later on they ended up forgetting at least 2 dishes and said the chef went home.  The waitress barely spoke English, the place looked run down, and the food was pricey.

We were a bit late for our reservation so they gave it away.  The guy at the desk told us to give him a cell phone number to reach us at and he would call when a room opened up, but it would be at least an hour.  We figured that was fine it was our own fault for getting sidetracked at the last bar and arriving late.  We were going to hang out in the bar at Din Dong Dang, but it was dead empty... we felt awkward hanging out there.  So, we left to check out the other places in the strip mall.

We settled on Sake and a quick bite to eat at Nari before or upcoming debut as karaoke stars.  We checked the phone that we gave the number to and realized that no longer than 30 minutes after we left Ding Dong Dang they had called.  We called the number back immediately (about 5 minutes after the missed call) and they said that we once again missed our room.  They said it would be another hour or so until we could get a room again.  We said okay and put the ringer on higher.  This time Ding Dong Dang never called us back.  We left sad.  

I understand that we were late and it was our fault too but, I think they should have stuck to the time they gave us and called us back the second time.  Also, the employees could have been a bit friendlier.

Oh, and the inside is a bit run down and dated looking."

Ding Dong Dang is known as karaoke place but also there is a Korean restaurant right next door. I guess half is karaoke and half is a restaurant. We had beef brisket (chadol baki). It was good and not too expensive. You get the side dishes and a soup with it. And plenty of meat for two. If you want some white rice, you will need to ask. By the way, you will have to cook your own meat. 

After you are done cooking and eating the meat, then waitress makes you a kimchi fried rice on the same stone grill. Yum! You should try it. And make sure to ask if they don&#39;t.

This place was pretty empty when I got there around 5:30 on Sunday and around 6:00 it was packed! Place is small.

We started in the restaurant area. It was positively empty. Not exaggerating.
The waiter was helpful, spoke Korean and English fluently, so good for my parents and my sister and I.
The menu was not very impressive, and while my parents had no problem ordering, my sister and I found only one thing we actually cared for (can&#39;t remember exactly. Some kind of chicken?) And it wasn&#39;t all that great. So the food was simply soso. But the owners brought out some watermelon after, probably because they didn&#39;t have anything else to do. But hey, not complaining. It was a nice gesture.
Afterwards, we went to the karaoke area. Because there were no other customers, they gave us one of the bigger rooms. Which was nice, especially since there were only four of us. We had a nice time singing. The owners let us stay longer without extra cost, so that was nice.
All in all, it was a fun experience. Although I am unsure if it was the place itself or everything the owners were doing for us. Also seemed a little strange that throughout the entire evening, there were no other customers. I would hesitantly recommend this place and plan on returning next time I&#39;m in Schaumburg."

((Look up noraebang on Wikipedia))  However, Ding Dong Dang just didn&#39;t deliver like I had hoped it would.

First off, this little noraebang is not the easiest to find. It&#39;s in a strip mall that doesn&#39;t face Golf Road. Not to mention, the name is written in Korean with the words &#34;karaoke restaurant&#34; underneath in much smaller letters. 

After countless drives up and down Golf Road, we finally found Ding Dong Dang.  The actual sign &#34;Ding Dong Dang&#34; was inside which doesn&#39;t make sense. But, it was my friend&#39;s birthday and I was just wanted to celebrate and bring out my inner rock star. My previous experiences in a karaoke bar like this, were more than a good time to say the least, so I was hoping for the same. I guess things started off on the wrong foot with the birthday girl, since the previous reservation ran over and our reservation was pushed back 45 minutes. I suppose I question what the purpose of the reservation was for then.

Anyhow on to the nitty gritty - the good and the bad...

Good:
+ Variety of room sizes ((We had the largest, comfortably seating 15-20))
+ Average prices//packages available
+ There&#39;s a snack menu with both Korean and American dishes ((the wings and potstickers were decent))
+ Songs are available in multiple languages
+ Shades for privacy
+ Full bar
+ Comfy, plush couches/benches in the rooms

Bad: 
- Weak song selection - unless you&#39;re all about pop music ((Britney Spears and the Back Street Boys gets old after a while...))
- Terrible videos playing in the background of the lyrics, most of which were depressing
- Disco ball and neon lights didn&#39;t work. We were told the bulbs &#34;burned out&#34;. Ummm...why not replace them??
- The remote is somewhat confusing. Actually, a lot confusing. 
- Difficult to find ((Please see above))
- Needs some serious remodeling. It was fairly decrepit
- The staff spoke little English, so be prepared
- Prices were inconsistent. A pitcher of Sujo for one person was 15 bucks. Thirty minutes later it somehow went up to 18...

I didn&#39;t stay until the end of the party ((which was 2am)) but apparently there was was some sort of mishap, and the staff attempted to charge the group an extra 90 bucks without any warning or notification that we went over the allotted time ((even though our party started late)). Kinda shady. 

So, is it super exciting to have an awesome noraebang in the middle of the burbs? You&#39;re damn right it is. It&#39;s just too bad Ding Dang Dong isn&#39;t awesome. 

I think I&#39;ll pass and head back to the city next time."

Which, after going to Ding Dong Dang, I definitely prefer (even though we used a groupon at DDD). Here&#39;s why my Ding Dong experience did not live up to my expectations:

-The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They didn&#39;t even offer an explanation of how to use the karaoke system until we asked. And we had to go back a couple times with follow-up questions since their explanations were not very clear or thorough.
-The remote control buttons were in Korean...Wouldn&#39;t have been an issue if the staff was more helpful! 
-Only 2 microphones, and one remote. I was expecting more since we were in a larger room!
-Spotty song selection -- There were quite a few songs they didnt have. 
-Even though there is a restaurant attached to it, we couldnt bring in drinks from the bar! It was BYOB only, which was not advertised anywhere...a sign outside would have helped! :/ 
-They gave us a two minute warning before our time was up, to the minute. Stingy! esp since they didnt have anyone waiting for the room.

Even with all the criticism, we still had a good time. But next time, I&#39;ll be ready to BMOB, ask lots of questions to figure out all the features of the karaoke system, and have a list of backup songs ready in case they don&#39;t have my faves! :)"

We had a table of 15 and they couldn&#39;t handle it. They forgot 3 of our dishes and we waited 2. 5 hours for them. Never checked on us to see if we needed help or anything. Had to ask for simple things over 6 times like soy sauce , white rice , even water. One of our guests had to go into the kitchen himself to find water. Sauces and side dishes where out last.  Not sure how they wanted us to eat the meat we cooked by itself. When we asked where the food was that was missing they said sorry and the kitchen was closed so they couldn&#39;t make it . They also said they where understaffed and only had 1 person cooking f or the the whole restaurant.  The karaoke section was nice but some of the controllers don&#39;t work. Seems extremely pricey for the experience that you get. As expected there is a strong language barrier and they had hard time communicating with us in English which we could work around but this time it was pretty bad.

We took one of the large rooms which was great, tons of seating... except for the one seat in the corner which collapsed when my friend sat down. 

Decent selection of music, my friends all raved about how they had everything they wanted, but I didn&#39;t have the same luck. No &#34;Your Love&#34; by The Outfield? No &#34;Amie&#34; by Pure Prairie League? For shame.

We also had some issues with the remotes, in that we had to enter each song about five times before it began to play. 

However, you don&#39;t go to a place like that expecting perfection; as long as you have a good group of friends and a few stupid-cliche songs to sing (I&#39;m looking at you, Bohemian Rhapsody), you won&#39;t even notice that you fell right through the seat cushion."

While it&#39;s tries to cater to everyone, their primary target clientele is Korean and Japanese and their primary systems are Korean.  Not to say if you&#39;re not Asian you won&#39;t enjoy this place but keep an open mind when coming here if you don&#39;t normally hit up Korean karaoke bars.

With that being said...

Their karaoke systems are the same you&#39;ll find in any Korean karaoke place in Chicago (Taijin/UKara), and they update their song selection  fairly often so it&#39;s kind of nice.  The downside of using Taijin/UKara is that while their Korean selection is nice, their Japanese and English selection can be spotty (which I guess can&#39;t be helped).  Still has the cheesy MIDI background music which we&#39;ve gotten used to.

The prices for drinks is rather steep, but if you need to get liquor&#39;d up, I encourage a pre-game.  $4-5 for a regular beer is a bit much.

We&#39;ve become regulars at Courtil in Chicago, and when the owners saw us at Ding Dong Dang, they recognized us which was great.  They&#39;re always courteous to us and encourage to come when the room rates are lower.

Overall, it&#39;s a typical Korean karaoke joint, a lot cleaner than Courtil with working systems, although sometimes takes a while to load songs.  We don&#39;t have problems with their service (although usually we go to the counter for service rather than ring them in) and the owners are always great to us.  Prices for rooms are a bit steep if you go on a peak night, but go with friends and it helps the cost."

If you do not know Korean characters nor have a GPS beware, this was a tad tricky to find because the sign does not say Ding Dong Dang. It just has characters. 

The place is half restaurant and half karaoke place. There&#39;s a guy at the front that escorts you to your room.

Here are my quicktakes about the karaoking experience
*They provide disposable microphone covers. I love this because when I really get into a song, my lips are all over the mike. So this made me feel a little better about slobbering over it
* Big and Small rooms have one large plasma screen.
* The five of us got the small room and two microphones. Good for duets not good for group sing-a-longs. :-\
* The remote controls work! I&#39;ve been to places where they don&#39;t and then you end up with Michael Bolton instead of Bieber.
* The song selection is pretty good. They have a lot of up to date songs.  It&#39;s March of 2012 and they had Rihanna - We Found Love, Coldplay - Paradise, Jessie J - Domino. They also had some good classics like What&#39;s going on - Four Non Blondes, Cranberries, Some Adele, N Sync, Beatles, Michael Buble so quite a variety.
* The room is comfortable but not the cleanest room I&#39;ve ever been in. Seats a little sticky.
* The rooms have windows where you could pull drapes down. I stress this because there are little cracks where people can see you belting out some Bohemian Rhapsody. So just be prepared.
* The groupon came with fried wings and cocktails. The cocktails were strong but the fried wings were mediocre, too much breading and not very much flavor.

I went on a Sunday night and the cost without the groupon would have been $25 an hour. I don&#39;t think the price was too shabby. I would come back here to sing some Katy Perry the next time I&#39;m in Arlington heights la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

It&#39;s Asian-style karaoke so you and your friends get your own private room with your own karaoke machine and a person who will bring you food or drinks if you order them.

The couches are comfy, the atmosphere is relaxing, and the microphones work!  They have a good selection of food and drinks and the staff is friendly and helpful.

The only drawback to the place is that a vast majority of the songs are not in English, so the song selection is a bit limited for people who only speak English.  Having said that, I went there with a group of 6 people and we never had too much trouble finding songs we wanted to sing over the span of a few hours.  Just don&#39;t expect every American Top 40 hit you&#39;ve ever heard to be available.

Definitely recommended for people who like karaoke but don&#39;t necessarily want to sing in front of a bunch of strangers.  Great for group outings."

aka
For $150.00 You Could... and Should... Get a Magic Mic on eBay

AMBIANCE
Located in a decent looking strip mall. The signage is cute. But it looks like that is where they stopped spending money. Inside, the decor is shabby and worn, the rooms need to be remodeled.... machinery was mediocre. 

Good thing everyone showered because  a group of 10 people that became 15 later, in a 15 x 12 room for 3 hours... it got warm fast, and the AC was a trickle of non-existent tepid air. For $50 per hour and $5 bottles of beer, you think they could buy a ventilation system?! Cheap rat bastards!

SERVICE
 The host did not bother to explain much or to tune the speakers and microphones, and the song books are albums with no real organization... you waste a lot of time trying to find songs.

Anywhoo... for those nutty enough to go... 

SUGGESTIONS:
1) Get an agreement that overage will be rounded to 15 min
2) Do not sign an erroneous credit slip. Make them fix it.
3) Bring in your own drinks in a flask.
4) Do Not Tip for Poor Service
5) Demand a room with adequate ventilation."

Love this place!!  I hadn&#39;t been out too many times in the past couple years, but last night I went with some friends and had a great time.

This is asian karaoke, so instead of standing up at a bar with a microphone, you get your own private room to sing in with your friends (or I guess you could come alone............).  I love this because it doesn&#39;t matter how terribly you sing, only your friends can laugh at you (if they are super huge jerks, that is).  Price depends on which room you are in (they fit different amounts of people) and how long you were there.  We were in a smallish room (fit 5 or 6 people) for 3 hours, total was around $80.  Split 5 ways this isn&#39;t too bad for 3 hours of entertainment.

Previously when I went with friends, we would get Japanese machines (which do include some English songs, but primarily Japanese of course).  They were comprehensive up until around 2006 or 2007-ish I think, and then you get supplemental pages as they add in newer, popular songs.  Last night we had a Korean machine that was primarily Korean songs of course, but also had a decent number of Japanese and English songs, as well as a couple others.. I think Vietnamese??  The downside to the book was that it was listed by song title, not by artist.  The English catalogue was mostly comprised of old songs from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s and then a smattering of the 2000&#39;s (I bet the Japanese catalogue was the same way), but last night I was amazed and terribly excited to see (sing) Jason Mraz, Bruno Mars, Katy Perry and Ke dollar sign ha!  Hooray, now I don&#39;t have to feel so bad about slowly forgetting the Japanese I learned in college!!  I still got in some m-flo though, don&#39;t worry.  Anyway, make sure to check the back pages of the song books, where they add the supplemental pages for new songs.

The controllers are very easy to use; just put in the song number and hit the Reserve button... ask the guy at the front desk if you have never done it before, though.  Also, when you first get in, tell the guy what language you primarily want.  Happy singing!!"

Mildly indifferent service and somewhat high prices, but clean rooms, decent food, and no long-assed wait or crazy atmosphere like Lincoln Karaoke can get like.

Other Korean karaoke places only offer one machine with many choices.  It&#39;s unique that they have two remotes, one is used to input Korean songs and the other is for American, etc.  I hear they have one Romanian song available and some other languages, but I&#39;ve never seen it.  Being that this place is now owned by the same owners of &#34;Gutie&#34; or &#34;karaoke restaurant&#34; in Chicago, I&#39;m sure they would try to offer as many languages as possible.  
The food is alright, nothing special, but still a better quality than what&#39;s found at a typical Korean noodle house (boon shik).  Food charges are too high, not equivalent to the serving.  Don&#39;t go there hungry, otherwise you&#39;ll leave penny-less.  It&#39;s common knowledge that no rae bang&#39;s(karaokes) are expensive.  Don&#39;t be a cheap ass and not bring money to chip in.  I&#39;ve seen it done many times.  People start drinking too much Soju and then they skip out on sharing the bill.  Since the store associate usually has a minimal knowledge of English, I would advise my fellow Americans to get the pricing right before you start singing.  
That little bottle of Soju at the store is about $6 dollars.  At karaoke its double that plus some more.  Be watchful.  Also be outgoing enough to try different flavors, straight up Soju isn&#39;t appealing for all.  
You&#39;re waiting to find out how I feel about their Thukk bokki ?  It&#39;s always just alright.  I think their thukkbokki runs that fine line between overcooked and needs just a bit more.  (Thukk bokki is Korean rice cake bathing in a spicy sweet orange colored sauce with fish cake. Ignore the words fish cake and just eat it, it&#39;s good.)

And for those that have never been to a karaoke place like this..  think mirrored walls, your own room, soft leather couches (vaguely remember), some rooms have a glitter ball, your own TV with  sound system and privacy to sing terrible.  They have bigger rooms for large groups.  

I keep thinking of that song &#34;More than a feeling&#34; by Boston..  I&#39;ve got to go sing.."

1. The screens mostly show just text to sing along with.

2. Doesn&#39;t have the &#34;party&#34; atmosphere as say Lincoln Or Court Hill karaoke.

I almost always order the pan fried noodles with vegetables and fried tofu (extra $2). It is always fantastic. I&#39;ve never had spoiled tofu here. And unlike some restaurants where most of the veggies are canned (ugh Lao Hunan), the veggies are always fresh. They use a slightly different mix than the usual, which often includes white button mushrooms, tomatoes, bell peppers, bean sprouts, and snap peas. 

The soups are super hearty (see pics) and cheap at a little over $2. They have $3 cocktails and wine on offer. Try the plum wine if you like sweet wines.

The menus are a tri-fold large font type. I came yesterday for lunch/dinner and the food came out in the right amount of time. What was ordered was:

Crab ragoon
Crispy chow fun noodles w/the green veggies and shrimp
Chef&#39;s special shrimp and scallops
Chicken &amp; beef curry
Plain white rice
Fried rice

The chow fun noodles I&#39;ve never tried cripsy before and the were pretty good.

The Chef&#39;s special was delicious and came out overflowing the plate (by the way they have big portions)

The chicken curry dish was too soupy for me. It wasn&#39;t exactly how I expected curry to be. It looks and tastes more like gravy and it&#39;s not thanksgiving so I didn&#39;t enjoy that too much.

The crag ragoon comes out extra crispy (6 big ones) and none to little cream cheese filling which I APPRECIATE because I actually don&#39;t like my crag ragoon all creamy and fatty. Their crab ragoon appetizer here is filled with I believe is real crab meat.

The fried rice I enjoyed because it came with little beef cube chunks I believe and it didn&#39;t taste overly seasoned or salty. None of the food did which I thought was great.

Will I come back here again? Yes!!

For a party of 3 adults and 2 younger children our bill was only $40? I say that&#39;s money well spent. We left home with left overs too which was great."

I wish I could still eat here twice a week like I used to.

The decor here couldn&#39;t get more basic.. it looks like the restaurant hasn&#39;t been updated much in 20 years and won&#39;t impress anyone.  But I&#39;d go just about anywhere for food like this.  Both the food and the owner&#39;s smile are truly memorable and you just can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu.  

Also, NHK is the best lunchtime place in the area - for just $5 you get lots of delicious food, and it comes out hot and fast!"

It may look a little shady from the outside, but...the food. Oh my goodness.  My cousin introduced me to this place awhile back, and since then we&#39;ve had Chow Fundays every time either one of us gets this intense craving for their amazing noodles. Which is pretty often. We usually start off with the eggrolls --perfectly fried and stuffed with delicious goodness. Then of course we order beef and shrimp chow fun with extra crispy noodles.

This is Old people Chinese Food, even the egg rolls were sub par, and I laughed when I read the review of someone complaining that there was too much crab in the Rangoon. But I now agree with it, there was no cream cheese just imitation fishy tasting crab? ...yes they are as bad as they sound.

I asked my pregnant daughter in law this afternoon where she wanted to go for dinner, she said Amalfi&#39;s. I said good idea, hadn&#39;t been there in a month.

During dinner we joked that maybe we should put 4 skeleton&#39;s at our table, as the food was taking a long time to come out.

I had a restaurant.com to use, I had used this there before. No restrictions as long as you spent $50. ($25 off)

I told the waitress prior to dessert that I had a restaurant.com, I opened it on my phone, she just needed to hit &#34;redeemed&#34;. She took it over to the bar where the owner / &#34;chef&#34;, Frank was sitting. 

Not liking anybody having my phone too long, after a minute or so, I walked over and asked if they needed me to reopen it for them. He was not on Amalfi&#39;s coupon on restaurant.com but in another section, the &#34;terms and conditions&#34;. He emphasized &#34;sir&#34; we don&#39;t take this on Saturday night, never have. (He&#39;s always there sitting at the bar), I said were usually always there on a Saturday night and that when we used it. 

After going back to my table, I reopened the restaurant.com coupon and again the restrictions were as little as &#34;Spend minimum $50&#34;. That&#39;s it. I walked over to the bar and showed it to him. He said &#34;Sir&#34; you have to sometimes read the &#34;terms and conditions&#34;. I said I&#39;m pretty sure theirs nowhere in the terms and conditions where it say that it&#39;s not valid on Saturday night (as their generic restaurant.com conditions, not the specific conditions on his coupon, I checked, nowhere in there does it say anything about excluding days, had it specifically said this we would have only gone on the days stated for use)

I said, &#34;you&#39;re making up your own conditions&#34;, he said &#34;are you calling me a liar&#34;  I said, &#34;I guess I am&#34;. He then called me a JERK.

While waiting at the front desk to pay, I heard Frank and his drinking buddies talking around the small bar , laughing at something about Groupon. 

Having owned a restaurant than a catering business for over 35 years (since sold successfully &amp; retired), NEVER, NEVER had I called anyone a jerk.

I understand from the people who work at Amalfi&#39;s (the last time we were in) that they added the 4 video poker machines in this small place because the owner&#39;s partners wanted them in. Not the look I wanted going out to dinner but hey, the food was decent. (Although that great garlic smell as you walked in hadn&#39;t been there in the last year plus).

We&#39;d been wondering why on a Saturday night at 7:00 that the place was half empty. Years ago it was jammed packed. Now we know. 
 
Our friends from Mundelein wanted to come in and go there next week, guess not. You can always tell when a place is nearing the end. 

Oh, and Frank, if you don&#39;t want to accept coupons on Saturday night, spend the time to adjust the restrictions and as the &#34;chef&#34; I&#39;d spend more time in the kitchen.

Frank get&#39;s 0 stars tonight."

If you like loud spaces full of boisterous people, Amalfi is for you. If you like your dining experience spread out over multiple hours, Amalfi is for you. And if you enjoy large portions of food, Amalfi is for you.

The last point is an obvious positive, but personally, I enjoy conversing without having to yell. I&#39;m also a fan of eating when I&#39;m hungry.

On to my lengthier review:
Our dinner this Friday night took 2.5 hours from the time we were seated until we walked out the door.

First impressions were that this is a popular neighborhood place where people bring their spouses and groups of family and friends. Even though we felt as if we stood out from the moment we walked in, we were optimistic about a new dining experience.

After being seated, we sat for ten minutes with no water or server, though servers and busboys buzzed around us. The hostess approached me at the table and asked if our server had been by. (The party of regulars seated after us had gotten theirs, though..) When I said &#34;No,&#34; she said she&#39;d send the server over.

Server arrived 5 minutes later, at which point I placed our orders for the Eggplant (rolled with ricotta) Appetizer ($8.50), my Vegetable Primavera with wheat pasta ($14) w/ Shrimp (+ $5.50), and his Cod Linguine with capers ($18). I asked for a glass of wine ($7.75) and waters, since we still had none.

It took another 10 minutes to finally get water, and nearly 10 after that to get any bread on our table. There were two types: typical cold slices to soak up your oil and parmesan cheese, and warm buttery rolls. The latter were seasoned nicely and insanely chewy. 

The Eggplant app, which came out 30-40 minutes later, was more like a lasagne roll than anything. I tried to locate the eggplant, even picking it apart, but I couldn&#39;t tell if the soggy tannish breaded (?) thing WAS eggplant. It only tasted like cheese and sauce, with no eggplant taste. For what it&#39;s worth, the +1 enjoyed it.

She must have either seen us looking at our watches/phones (or maybe we seemed so obviously out of place?), because, an hour in, our server approached us and asked if we were pressed for time. She explained that they are required to time when things (appetizers, soup/salad, entrees) come to the table: the logic being so patrons can enjoy their meals and not feel rushed. While that might be the Amalfi way, we surely weren&#39;t planning on devoting our entire evening to a long drawn-out dinner.

I understand normal waits: high volumes, small kitchens, busy kitchens...but by that time 1/3 of the diners were clearing out, the chef was in and out of the kitchen on the regular (sitting in a booth and schmoozing it up with his buddies, later hanging out by the bar), and an hour in/by 9:00, we&#39;d barely eaten. Sooo... honestly, the only reason I can&#39;t have my app or soup is because there&#39;s a time limit on when they allow it to be brought to the table? (Or maybe the chef is too busy socializing to cook?) I don&#39;t get it... 

Oh, and the people seated after us? They left way before us. They had their waters, bread, appetizer, and entrees way before we did, too. I was so envious.

It seemed like the timing was in 30 minute incriments, because we didn&#39;t get our soup until well after we finished our app. The Minestrone soup was under seasoned and depressing looking, with just spinach and onion along with the shells.

At 9:55 the hostess, followed immediately by the server, both came over to tell us they&#39;d checked on our entrees and they should be right out. They obviously picked up on our discontent.

Since I&#39;m writing chronologically and our entrees came dead last at 10:00, that&#39;s one of the last points to mention:

I thought the +1&#39;s dish had good flavor. My Primavera had big chunks of fresh veggies and 5 nice sized shrimp. Sadly it was entirely bland and the noodles were overcooked and just getting soggier from sitting in an inch of oil at the bottom of my dish. Portion sizes were large. I would rate the dish 2.5 out of 5.

The ONLY redeeming qualities were the nice hostess (I guess our server was nice, too, if just mostly inattentive) and the portion sizes of our entrees.

About the noise: The patrons/layout makes for a ridiculously LOUD atmosphere: loud as in having to lean forward so we&#39;re 8&#34; from one another and STILL raise our voices -loud. ugh; not really how I wanted to spend a date night. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever dined in an adult space with so much squealing, shouting, and clammoring. 

The fact that there were pronounced mandatory wait times - along with the stress of missing out on 3 other things we planned on doing after our date and before bed - made the whole experience very unpleasant. I&#39;d expect such exorbidant food wait times at a Michelin Star restaurant where a renowned chef meticulously prepares a culinary masterpiece, but not for mediocre Italian fare in Bloomingdale. 

Amalfi was definitely NOT for us. Never, ever again."

This is a family restaurant and we are not regulars, so the service was spotty at best. As a party of eight, I expected more attention to our group. We had to request water and drink refills before they we offered.

The most disappointing part of this experience was the covert up charging that occurred. For example, the Chicken Vesuvio was offered boneless or bone in, no word on up charge, $4.00 per serving (3 total) was outlandish! The Pasta with Vodka Sauce was inedible, it was served in a bowl with the pasta floating in a soupy and off tasting sauce. Further, there was no explanation that soft drink refills were not gratis, so when my wife ordered a refill, small glass, mostly ice with a little soft drink we were unaware we were being charged additional cost. 

Finally, when we called to challenge the extra expense, the gentleman we spoke to was both rude and unresponsive. No intent on resolving the issue. 

We will not be returning to this restaurant!"

Where they diliberately slow down their service so you don&#39;t feel rushed? Where there&#39;s an actual intentional waiting period of 10-15minutes between getting your water, order taken, appetizer, and entree? Have you ever been to a place and thought: &#34;man, I want to have a dining experience of over 2-hours, lets do this every night!&#34; If so, this is the place for you!!

Talk about slow service. We sat at a table and waited about 10-15 minutes before someone gave us water. Another 10 minutes before our orders came in. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the staff was nice and friendly, apologized for the wait several times, and even explained to us the mandatory wait between appetizer and entree. It took us almost 30-minutes before we got bread. 

The food was bland too. It lacked seasoning, This place was packed on a Friday night, and I know why now. Several times we saw one of the chefs sit down at the dining room chatting with friends, and other times we saw him hanging out near the bar and using the bathroom. With such a high-maintenance cook, how can you not expect a long wait?

I don&#39;t give a lot of 1-stars, but this place deserves it. Maybe its because I&#39;m not Italian and thats how Italians like things -- long waits amongst meals (OMG, did I just piss off an entire nation?) but this place is definitely not for me

BATHROOM REVIEW: The bathrooms are located near the front, by the entrances. Inside, there is a dinky stall and a urinal. Everything was in working order, but could be cleaner. The floors were dingy and dirty too. Sit or squat? Squat..... for 2-hours apparently"

When we walked into the restaurant and I noticed the decor was very outdated. We were greeted right away by a friendly hostess and walked to our table. Once we sat down, we were ordered drinks and I noticed the prices were a little high and thought they should update their decor and dinnerware for the prices they charge. The waitress came over with the bread bowl and took our orders. She was friendly but short. The garlic rolls were really good and warm. When ordering our food I asked what the specials were but was told that they weren&#39;t ready yet. I was surprised as the restaurant was already opened for 1.5 hours but whatever.  My husband ordered veal saltimbocca and I ordered cavatelli with vodka sauce. Our meals came with a small house salad that looked like something we could quickly throw together at our house (a shredded waterberg lettuce with a small piece of tomato and one black olive). Then our meals arrived, my vodka sauce was soupy and bland with taste less cavatelli. My husband&#39;s veal saltimbocca was oily and super salty with flavorless vegetables that looked like we could buy frozen at the grocery store. He also received a small bowl of spaghetti with meat sauce that was again super bland. We&#39;ve had better meat sauce from the grocery store. When our plates were cleared the waitress noticed I barely touched my meal and asked if everything was ok. I told her I didn&#39;t like it and they took it off the bill. We won&#39;t come back to this restaurant due to its&#39; overpriced and mediocre menu."

Only downfall I have noticed over the years and from the reviews I&#39;m not the only one...the timeframe has gotten very slow. It takes a very long time for dinner to be served.  Not sure why that has been happening.

Had to ask for refills every time which was annoying. 

The food was okay, the presentation is terrible. I don&#39;t care if the food is okay when it looks the way it does it detracts from the quality.

We were regulars there.. I&#39;m so disappointed. I think the owner of this restaurant needs to realize that the way he treats his customers is just as important as the service and food he provides them. He was literally yelling at our guests to go sit down before the food was even served so that he could get his head count (which we had already given him). He then told my mom, who was also hosting the shower to &#34;tell your guests that they need to sit the f*** down!&#34; It was unreal.

Last night I was nearby again and ordered a whitefish special for me and Baccala for my friend. Both times I&#39;ve eaten the food it was ordered for pick up so I can&#39;t speak to the service but I do consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado on Italian food. Personal opinion. It&#39;s almost impossible to find southern Italian-American food outside of little Italy or off 22nd street in Chicago that matches.

I think if people could chill out and get past &#34;it&#39;s an old pizza hut&#34; they might be surprised at how good the food is.

I ordered the braciole with mostaccioli, molto buono!  The braciole was very tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned with fresh garlic and herbs.  The sauce is a traditional marinara and I don&#39;t know if it is homemade or not, but it sure tastes like it&#39;s from nonna&#39;s kitchen.

 I like going here with friends and family because even though some say the noise level is too high, you can have a great conversation, laugh and have a good time without worrying that you are too loud.    The food is usually pretty good, but can be a little inconsistent.  I like their Sausage and Polenta and chicken dishes.  
Some say the service is slow, but I like that too.   You won&#39;t be rushed out of here, relax, settle in and enjoy yourself.    It is small, so can be crowded on Friday and Saturday nights but so are most places.   Prices are average and if you live in the area you will get coupons in the mail. (I like the two meals for $50.)      Each person gets a glass of wine and an entrée and then 2 will share an appetizer and dessert. 


Get over the Pizza Hut Structure !"

My wife picked it for her birthday dinner so we went to see for ourselves.  Overall (for those of you who are looking for a quick summery).  We would go back, and enjoyed our meal despite an inattentive server. The busboy  however was very attentive.  Met the owner, he was very nice and that&#39;s always a bonus.

Long version... 

We were greeted and seated nicely. The waitress was right there a few moments later but we were not ready to order.  We ended up  waiting just a bit for her to return, but that was alleviated by the warm garlic rolls that came to the table with her. My youngest said they were to die for. They where tasty, but I think she was over enthusiastic. So, why would they set those rolls which my family attacked with gusto, next to cold French bread? If they had simply warmed the bread with the rolls it would have been so much nicer.  The butter was cold, that&#39;s always been a pet peeve. 

 We ordered and the meal was paced nicely. I had the salad with homemade creamy garlic that was pretty good, needed a bit more salt to my taste. My wife had the Italian vinaigrette and she liked that as well.  The kids had the Minestrone. One liked it, the other didn&#39;t. I agree with the latter. While barley palatable, I have had better  out of a can. 

Entrees arrived and I had the skirt steak w/ risotto special, my wife had the Gnocchi and both girls had cheese ravioli . All the pastas were presented well, the girls liked the cheese ravioli. The Gnocchi was a little dense and chewy. I like little clouds of pasta when I order Gnocchi. 

The presentation of my steak/risotto was horribly unattractive. Risotto was on top of the plate, steak on the bottom swimming in jous.  I hate that. It&#39;s a steak, not a fish. It shouldn&#39;t be swimming.  The steak had no sear (brown) at all. It was kind of grey, yet was a bit over cooked. Nice trick that, wonder how they did it?

With all that being said, it was really tasty and I couldn&#39;t keep my wife&#39;s fork out of my risotto. Creamy and delicious, rich yumminess with a touch of lemon.  If this dish had been cooked correctly, steak seared and right temperature, delivered without the lake. Perhaps a green vegetable for color and balance.  I would have been RAVING about how great it was.  It really had good flavor. But the lack of sear, color and the lake was a turn off.  

We will be giving this place another shot it has a lot of potential. I know my wife will be ordering a risotto dish.  I hope the little attention to details are corrected and look forward to posting an update. All in all worth a try.  If you are still reading,  Thanks!"

The food is fantastic and I wish I could say the same about the service. We went on a Thursday night thinking it wouldn&#39;t be too crowded. Much to our surprise it was pretty busy for a Thursday night. The wait staff was very slow in coming, we had to ask about specials and were constantly asking for drink refills. I will consider going back again because the food was great but I truly hope the less than ideal service was a fluke and will improve."

We arrived at 6:30pm on a Sunday evening and it was packed. Considering that we didn&#39;t have a reservation and came at a peak time, we were still seated after only a short amount of time. I highly recommend reservations if you can make them.

We were seated at a small two person table rather close to another couple, but it wasn&#39;t too crowded. We never bumped elbows or anything and they were really friendly. We chatted a bit before ordering our appetizers. The waiter seemed to know them and we saw a cook come out and chat with another table. It looks like there are repeat customers and the staff is there to please.

The BF ordered the Chicken Cacciatore. It looked good and he said it was delicious. We split an appetizer of Calamari that I found to be a bit bland and overly salted. I also could take or leave the regular sliced bread. The dinner rolls, on the other hand, were out of this world and their olive oil is perfect, especially when sprinkled with salt and grated parmesan. For the main course I ordered the Clam Sauce Linguini. When it came out with a deep layer of oily looking sauce, I thought I made a huge mistake, but I found it to be more like a flavorful broth with a ton of pasta and giant chunks of clam.

We both ordered wine flights for our meals. He had #2 with red wines and I had #3 with white wines. All of the wines were good, but I probably would switch the second and third wines around. The second was a Riesling and I like my sweeter wines last. They complemented the meal nicely.

At the end of the meal we had a ton of leftovers. In fact, it was enough that I made a meal out of them the next day and still had enough for an entire third meal. Our total came out to about $66 and they took off our $30 Amazon Deal of the Day without a single problem. Even without the coupon, that&#39;s not a ridiculous price for an appetizer, two wine flights and two large entrees. Honestly, the only downside is the dragon breath from all the garlic."

Atmosphere:
Well... It tries hard to be a legitimate Italian restaurant, but the Pizza Hut structure and design aren&#39;t doing the place any favors lol. The effort is there though, but it just adds to the deception you discover after the end of your meal. 

Service:
Not the kind of experience you hope for at a pricey Italian restaurant. We had reservations, but it took over an hour to get our food ready on a moderately busy day. Service wasn&#39;t that friendly, and the busboy kept trying to take unfinished food.

Food:
The biggest disappointment of the night was the food. A lot of the dishes were soggy and retained water at the bottom. I also felt that the meat quality was subpar, especially in the Calamari and their Beefs. To top it off, the Cheesecake was not sweet enough whatsoever. It really makes you feel ripped off considering the prices on everything.

I&#39;d give it a 1 star if not for its effort in atmosphere and decent dinner bread. This place is a big disappointment though. Don&#39;t take a girl out here. I am by no means an experienced Italian eater, but even Olive Garden is more authentic than this place. It all felt like a big charade."

There&#39;s a reason this place always has coupons and deals available: no one would want to come back and the food is overpriced, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all prepared crap.

This place used to be a Pizza Hut and still retains the ambiance of a Pizza Hut. In fact, it is reminiscent of a fish fry at a VFW.

I won&#39;t belabor the point, but it took us more than an hour for a simple pasta dinner.  The service was incredibly slow, except for the waiter who tried to take my 1/3 eaten plate away because I put down my fork to talk to my husband. 

Don&#39;t order the stuffed artichoke appetizer, it is inedible.  It&#39;s served swimming in oil as well. My husband&#39;s pasta was a watered down mess and his parmesan chicken was not at all crispy and so mushy you could cut it with a fork.

The bread is the only part of the meal I enjoyed, which I know was not made on-site.

Finally, we had a Groupon, which we produced when the bill came. The waitress got annoyed and had to check with her manager about something since we didn&#39;t order drinks (the Groupon didn&#39;t require it, either). She said something about how most people don&#39;t show her coupons until the end because they&#39;re concerned they&#39;ll get smaller portions, and she assured us that wasn&#39;t the case and they&#39;ve been doing this for 27 years and they know their stuff. OK?  

No one ever asked us how our meal was and I only gave this place two stars instead of 1 because my pasta was edible and I didn&#39;t get sick."

The main values here are the standards on the left side of the menu and some of the chicken dishes.  That being said, I don&#39;t actively choose to come here but when a friend wants to come here, I don&#39;t say no.

The suburban location in a residential area is easy to find and plenty of parking in what looks like an old pizza hut.  Staff is nice and welcoming.  Overall, a place that I wish would be great again."

We&#39;re new to the area and decided to check out this place and support a local small business. Unfortunately, we were really surprised and not in a good way. 

The restaurant is in a converted Pizza Hut, that&#39;s obvious. The decor is something that you would find in someone&#39;s home. Cute and cozy, but not sophisticated. 

We opened our menus and my husband was the first to point out the high prices. We really weren&#39;t expecting a high price tag, but we went with it anyway. 

I had baked mostaccoli and asked for the whole wheat pasta. The waitress advised that the only whole wheat pasta was a linguini. I went with it, the shape of the pasta doesn&#39;t matter. My husband ordered the braciole with a side of pasta and marinara. 

When we received our meals we were so ready to chow! My pasta was MUSH! I wonder how long this whole wheat pasta cooked. Seriously, it was like baby food. My husband&#39;s pasta was so watery that the marinara sauce was actually more pink than red. 

We will never go back. We were very disappointed b/c we were so looking forward to finding our favorite neighborhood place."

Sat down at 7:30. Ordered drinks shortly thereafter. They finally came 40 minutes later--beers and glasses of wine--not elaborate mixed drinks.

We saw others around us waiting a long time and slowly getting their orders...

Finally ordered food a little after that. At 9:30, still no soup/salad or food. We asked for our soup and our waitress said NO!!! Something about they can&#39;t bring out the soup/salad until the food order has started to be made! What!?!? I&#39;m starving. I&#39;ve had enough of this bread on the table. Soup came a little while later. Food finally came a little after 10PM. By that time we weren&#39;t too hungry anymore....had a few bites of food--tasted okay. Waitress and a guy from the kitchen apologized for the inconvenience and offered us dessert, which was nice (however, it was one of the strangest Tiramisu&#39;s we&#39;ve ever had). 

Our waitress was very nice throughout this whole ordeal, so I honestly don&#39;t know if it was a service issue or kitchen problem in back.  

I didn&#39;t plan on spending over 3 hours at this restaurant--it&#39;s not like I was having an elegant meal at a fondue place or in France, where that&#39;s how long dinners are expected to last!"

We&#39;ve been dining at Amalfi&#39;s for years and just love it.  Sure it &#39;s in an old Pizza Hut building but it&#39;s been remodeling and really quite charming.  It&#39;s a little noisy at times but the foods is to die for.  They have the best eggplant parm I&#39;ve ever tasted.  I even order pans of it twice a year for house parties and always get rave reviews.  Frank the owner usually makes an appearance and couldn&#39;t be more cordial.  Even the dinner salads are always  crispy cold and so fresh and it&#39;s hard to resist only one of the wonderful hot garlic rolls served with dinner.

Walking in, the first thing we noticed was how small it was. Although we didn&#39;t make any reservations, I suggest you make one if you don&#39;t plan arriving early. The decor was OK. Ceilings seemed really low, also.

We sat down, and our waitress took a long time to take down our drinks. We told her we were OK with water. It took her at least another 10 minutes to just take our order. She was scrambling around like crazy, like she had a ton of tables to work with, even though she really didn&#39;t have that many. She even gave a table bread that arrived after us before she offered us any.

The place was packed when we arrived, so the noise level was extremely loud. My date and I had to practically yell to have a conversation, and  we were struggling with the noise level in general. (Side note; it was quite a relief to just use the powder room where it wasn&#39;t so noisy!)

Finally, our food arrived. I ordered the angel hair carbonara while my boyfriend had the baked mostacciolli. I will say this: the portions were very large! It was nice to see that my promotion didn&#39;t affect the size of the meal. However, my pasta tasted pretty bland, like it was missing something. It was also VERY soupy at the bottom which didn&#39;t make it too appetizing. My date&#39;s dish didn&#39;t even look &#34;baked.&#34; Just looked like some pasta with some melted cheese on top.

Even though the service was slow, our waitress was very polite and apologized for taking a long time. I just wanted to try something new, as I had not been here before. However, I probably would not dine here again."

My husband has been needling me to go to Amalfi for years.  We decided to go tonight for Val Day.  Cute inside; nice ambience.  Our table was in a very cold area.  Greeted right away by waitress.  Ordered our house wines.  They were typical - good.

I ordered veal piccante with salad and side of spaghetti and marinara sauce.  Husband ordered zuppa de pesce with salad.

Salads were pretty good - lettuce was fresh, no water in the bottom of the plate.  I ordered blue cheese dressing (1.50 extra with dry blue cheese sprinkles 2.40 extra.)  They put way too much dressing on the salad.  I should have asked for it on the side.  

Bread was cold and gummy like cheap Jewel Italian bread.  There were some buns with a lot of garlic on them.

Food report:  my veal piccante had about 2 cups of watery sauce over it.  The meat was absolutely swimming in the liquid.  Veal piccante is supposed to have a reduced butter, lemon, white wine sauce.  NOT SOUP.  The veal itself had no seasoning.  The side of spaghetti also had water problems.  About a cup of liquid was in the bottom of the bowl, washing off all the thick sauce, making a disgusting soupy mess.  The marinara sauce itself had too much garlic and no basil flavor.  

Husband&#39;s zuppa de pesce was okay but he, too, had about 2 cups of liquid in the bottom of the dish.  He did not finish his pasta or liquid.

Waitress asked how the food was and I told her that it was terribly disappointing.  I told her piccante was not supposed to swim in food and pasta was not supposed to be water logged.  She apologized, but offered nothing to make us feel better.  No manager came to apologize.

We like the food at Olive Garden - never have we gotten soupy pasta.  He usually ends up dipping his bread in the bottom of the zuppa de pesce bowl to get the last bits.  Not at Amalfi.  If I could give this place zero stars, I would.

We just wasted near $80.00!!!!!

As we used to live in Chicago and loved the restaurants, I seriously wonder about the people in the suburbs.  Don&#39;t they know good food?  I kept hearing Gordon Ramsey in my ear screaming about the veal swimming in liquid and having no flavor."

Being that I am writing this after visiting Amalfi for the first time, you might want to take a closer look at my review.

As we all know, food is very subjective and what may be a feast to me, may be a travesty to someone else.  That said, if you are looking for a 5-star dining experience, as determined by trendy magazines or by hipster friends (no offense to any hipsters), this is probably not the place for you.  However, if you can get past the &#39;Sizzler-esque&#39; exterior and have an appreciation for home-grown flavor and food that isn&#39;t trying to make the cover of a wannabe posh magazine, then you must try this place!  

The moment I sat down and noticed the handwritten specials menu resembled my mom&#39;s handwriting, I had to take notice.  The menu isn&#39;t about a wow-factor, but rather about bringing you food that is simply good eating.   I started out with a beautifully tender, and seasoned &#39;Calamari Steak&#39;  appetizer that was sizzling at my table.  From the first bite, I felt at home.  Everything I had throughout my meal tasted fresh and the food focused on being hearty and simply good, just like when you eat with family.  In addition to the bountiful portions of delicious food, the service was top rate.  In all honesty, I haven&#39;t had this good of a dining experience in a long time.  

To sum it up, If you want a trendy, avant-garde, dining experience... Go somewhere else!  However, if you want to enjoy real Italian-American family-style recipes that recall visions of Sunday dinners, then you must try Amalfi.  (The only reason I didn&#39;t give Amalfi 5 stars, was due to price, but my meal was completely worth every penny!)"

We enjoy it and it is easily worth 3 1/2 stars. It&#39;s a traditional Southern Italian restaurant.  However, it&#39;s really important to note that we always take our kids - so we arrive around 5:30pm.  I&#39;ve never been there during &#34;prime time.&#34;

We enjoy this restaurant - it&#39;s one of our &#34;go-to&#34; places when we don&#39;t want to cook and need to get out of the house.  Considering the food is homemade, the prices are very good.    I find their red sauce to be a bit on the sweet side. (But don&#39;t we all think our own, homemade red sauce is better than the rest?!?)   I&#39;ve tried their braciole and various veal dishes, all of which were good.  Their standout item is their eggplant parmesan, which is excellent.   When it comes to appetizers, we were pleasantly surprised to find their fried calamari quite tender.  Even the kids ate it!

As for beverages, the bar has always made excellent mixed drinks/martinis.  No watered-down, metered pours here!  However, the wine list is short and mundane.  Do not expect to find much beyond your average grocery-store Chianti.  Of course, these wines are (relatively) inexpensive, so having a bottle is not going to blow your budget.

I do not recommend making a long-dstance drive to try Amalfi&#39;s. However, if you live in the general area (15-20 miles), it&#39;s definitely worth a visit for some homemade southern Italian."

Food is pricey considering it&#39;s not the best Italian.  There also not very flexible on changes to a dish.  So if you want them to add onion or remove it, expect an eye roll or a hard time from the staff."

It&#39;s really easy to gorge yourself on the warm garlicky rolls before dinner and have little room left for your entree! Entrees are a bit on the expensive side, but they come with salad (and the aforementioned magical rolls) and are big enough for literally two or three meals. I  enjoyed my eggplant parm and I was completely stuffed after eating less than half of it and almost none of the accompanying spaghetti (and believe me, I&#39;m no dainty eater.)

They have the best italian food of the suburbs by far! I have been going to Amalfis for probably like 10 years. Its a tiny family owned place with lotsa character. I would reccommend making reservations if you are planning on going on a weekend night.It gets pretty booming. Oh yea and dont forget to ask for Gwen when you make your reservations. Shes a super sweet,funny and attentive waitress:) Oh and say hello to the friendly host man Wayne hes pretty damn cool too!

Now for the food... Well you get to start your tasty meal with hot garlic rolls.I suggest you dip the rolls in their olive oil and sprinkle cheese holy hell are they good!  Most of the dinners come with soup or salad which I really appreciate. They have the best creamy garlic dressing too! So I usually order eggplant parm or bake mostaccoli and both are the best! I like to think of myself as somewhat of an eggplant parm expert and they have one of the best I have tasted yet! My p&#39;s always get  chicken george which is a pasta dish with blue cheese,spinach and chicken. (not on the menu, ask for it).  You gets tons of food so you will def get leftovers! 2 for 1 yippee!

Hit this place up!!!!"

How dare they play the sweet sounds of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin while serving cuisine worse than the crap Chef Boyardee is famous for.

The parmesan dusted bread they bring out for the table is quite good but that is really the only thing. The escarole soup was salty beyond belief and seriously trying to hide the fact that is was lacking in any real flavor.
My tortellni came out swimming in a broth of oil and tomato juice  with overly generous chunks of garlic and onion.
Service was incredibly slow although we were one of the two tables present. Our waitress was MIA most of the time and very short and annoyed when she was available.

My friends complained that their dishes were extremely salty so i&#39;m thinking this was no isolated incident. If this is someone&#39;s idea of &#34;great Italian&#34;, I weep for them."

This place was muy delicioso...OK, that was sort of a combination of Italian and Spanish...but the point it, this place was really, really good! I ordered the lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the braciole (flank steak). Both were really good. Their homemade parmasean crusted rolls are to die for! The service was great -we were greeted by the owner when we walked in and the waitress was adorable. Super friendly! The only criticism is that the food did take a while. I think it was about an hour from arriving that we got our main entrees. Therefore, keep that in mind if you have a night out planned. I&#39;m thinking they cook everything from scratch so it takes awhile. This would be a fantastic place to bring a group so you can catch up and chit chat while the food is prepared.

There was a coupon for a $12.95 all you can eat fish fry and Italian dinner with purchase of drinks that I saw in the coupon magazine sent to our house.

I was really looking forward to eating the fish fry because we&#39;ve enjoyed it at other restaurants and because now this was going to be at Amalfi&#39;s.  It was supposed to be better than all the other restaurants we&#39;ve had all you can eat fish fries at.

I love Amalfi&#39;s.  The BEST dish is the veal francese.  It&#39;s the best francese in Chicago, I really think.  It is so lemony and flavorful.  I always order that when I go.  It&#39;s so bad because I want to try their other dishes, but I always go against my better instincts and order the francese anyways.

Tonight, however, was not going to be one of those nights.  Our waitress was consistently rude and brusk the whole night.  To start, I was translating the menu to my mom in Taiwanese.  The waitress, said, &#34;When you&#39;re done translating for your mom, I&#39;ll come back to get your drink orders.&#34;  That is not an exact quote.  That may not sound so bad, but it did come off really weird.  Next she brought lemonade instead of coke and just left.  Mine was an ice tea and that was right.  We discussed whether we should wait until she came back to change it to a coke, but she never came back.  So then I wondered if there were free refills.  If there were then it would be ok to drink the lemonade and request coke the next round.  So I said go ahead and drink the lemonade.  When I was able to finally wave her down, I asked about refills.  She said, &#34;This is a family restaurant.  Only corporate restaurants do refills.&#34;  Well, we drank the lemonade, so oops, no refills, and no coke either.  Then when our fish plates came, mine had tarter sauce and my mom&#39;s had cocktail sauce.  I don&#39;t like tarter sauce.  Again she ran off as soon as she dropped the plates on our table.  I had to wait 5 minutes to request cocktail sauce.  At the end of the night, she gave us our check and ran off to speak to other patrons.  She never came back.  I really was pissed with her the whole night and wanted to go so I just put on our coats and walked to the cash register.  The hostess rang us up (VERY NICE, by the way).  The waitress walked around and came to us as we were being rung up, looked at the bill, said not a word, and walked away back to the same patrons to continue chatting.  Do you think it&#39;s weird not to say anything, like &#34;Thanks for coming, folks,&#34; or how about &#34;Have a good night&#34;?

Now I remember going to Paris, France, in 1999 and got treated rudely by all the wait staff.  Even the donut man on the street looked at us with contempt.  One donut was 20 francs, like $4, for just one fricking donut.  But that was France and I digress.  You&#39;re supposed to get treated badly, and I thought it hilarious that I actually experienced it.  I felt I got the full French experience.  But here in America, that is unacceptable.

Now to the fish plates.  There were two choices.  You stuck with ordering more of your choice for the rest of the night as your all you can eat.  One choice was battered haddock.  The other choice was a combo of battered smelt and calamari.  WOW.  I love those choices.  I was really excited.  No other restaurant we went to ever had smelt and calamari.  It&#39;s always all fish of some sort.  We ordered one of each.

A half hour later, or some really really long time, our plates came.  Why it took so long I could not understand.  We came after 8:30pm and by the time we were seated, many people finished and left.  Only one other group of two came in after us so there was not a back log of orders.  Maybe our dish is so fancy it requires the time.  NOPE.  Not so.  The smelt had a really fishy after taste to it.  Not fresh at all.  I know smelt is small, but do you normally gut smelt or not?  If so, they didn&#39;t.  The calamari rings were really thin and small.  It&#39;s like we got the left overs, bottom of the barrel.  My haddock was really fat and meaty.  No complaints there.  However, it tasted so plain like out of the box from the freezer aisle at the grocery store.  The batter didn&#39;t do anything for the taste or texture.  I like my batter thick and crunchy.  This wasn&#39;t.

I have never ever ever in my life NOT ordered seconds for an all you can eat.  This was a first.  I couldn&#39;t wait to leave fast enough, with the rudeness and the bad food, it was just one fantastic combo.

I was just so disappointed.  I expected great things.  I will still come back and recommend Amalfi to everyone, but DO NOT get the all you can eat fish fry.  It ends with Easter anyway."

The garlic dinner rolls that they bring out before dinner are hot and fresh and awesome. My girlfriend had the baked mostacolli which I usually do not care for, but this mostacolli was hands down the tastiest I&#39;ve ever tried. I ordered the special of the night which was brazed lamb hock on a bed of risotto and tomato sauce. My meal was also really good.

It seems everything here is homemade including the chocolate cheese cake which was also amazing!

The food is authentic, delicious and fresh. Because the food is fresh it takes a bit of a wait in between courses so be prepared to wait for your food. The atmosphere is a nice as it can be ( considering it was once a Pizza Hut) but you can tell the owner takes pride in his food and the ambiance.

If you plan to go on a weekend evening I recommend you make a reservation in advance.  I&#39;ve called the of and just happen to get a reservation so I recommend you call a day or two in advance.

I&#39;ve taken groups here and have received high praise for the selection. The exterior is, as others have commented, an old Pizza Hut style building. I think that when first-timers see this, they&#39;re a bit apprehensive and expect far less than the excellent Italian-style cooking served here. My favorite meal is the chicken marsala: it&#39;s not over-fried and the marsala sauce is rich and sweet with distinct flavors instead of bland, runny crap found elsewhere.

On numerous occasions I&#39;ve had the owner come out to chat and see how everyone&#39;s meal tastes. Small touches like that make Amalfi&#39;s a top choice for good Italian without having to drive to the city."

After the birth we finally had an opportunity to check out the Amalfi restaurant within walking distance.  We dinned in once and the food and service were great.  Mostly, with an infant at home, we order take out.  The food is great and the price is fair.  They are open for dinner 6 nights a week and have always been busy when we order (always a good sign in my opinion).  Every restaurant, even the high end locations in the city, have a bad day.  If you have a problem with your meal, let them know.  They genuinely care about their guests and will make good if there is an issue.  There is a reason they will celebrate 25 years in business this year.  Since I just moved to the neighborhood and I&#39;m often too busy to cook, I&#39;m looking forward to this staple for many years.  I recommend you give Amalfi&#39;s a try."

However, I couldn&#39;t give this place more than 3 stars because of the service. The server seemed nice, but 2 things threw us off. First, when I didn&#39;t like my drink, she offered to take back it but made me feel guilty about it so I decided to just forget it. But that wasn&#39;t that big of a deal. When, before receiving our check, my mom gave her the Groupon, she said to her in a VERY rude tone, &#34;you should&#39;ve given this to me when you first walked it&#34; and she just walked away like she was doing us a huge favor by giving us that discount. Why is that such a big deal? Would you have given us worse service knowing that we came in with a coupon?

I had high hopes for my first experience at this local Italian restaurant which is just down the street from us, however my hopes were quickly squashed. I can&#39;t comment about the food, we never got that far. But the service from the moment we entered the restaurant was horrendous. We had dinner reservations for four on a Saturday night. When we arrived, the hostess had no record of our reservation, even though we had called just one day prior. There was no apology, even after I identified the specific person with whom I spoke to make the reservation. The hostess said we could wait in the bar area, which really was not set up to accommodate more than a few people. We waited 45 minutes, during which time the hostess never checked in with us at all, and when we asked about whether a table would be available for us, both the owner and the hostess completely blew us off.

Amalfi&#39;s is my favorite Italian restaurant and has been for many years.  It&#39;s small and space can get cramped, but I have never had a bad meal there.  The food is always fresh and steaming when brought to you and it&#39;s always, ALWAYS very good.  The reviewer who liked Olive Garden better actually shocked me.  I&#39;m Italian and I don&#39;t know one Italian who even considers Olive Garden a real Italian restaurant.  Their commercials with the big, happy Italian family eating there makes me laugh.  You can&#39;t even compare the two.  Amalfi&#39;s has real, homemade-like-your-grandma-used-to-make Italian food.  Their chicken vesuvio and chicken francese are both so good that if it&#39;s chicken I&#39;m going to have there, I always have a tough time deciding which one to get.  Their cavatelli is homemade and fresh.  There&#39;s not many Italian restaurants that have braciole on their menu and it does not disappoint.  The stuffed artichoke appetizer might even be a little bit better than how my mom used to make them, and I thought hers was the best.  Some of the items might be a little pricey (the braciole is up to $20 now), but they don&#39;t skimp on the amount of food that you get and I always end up taking home a doggy bag.  While the owners are always friendly, I will admit that some of the wait staff isn&#39;t, although they are all professional.  I&#39;ve never had anyone there be rude to me.  I have had to wait sometimes a little longer than I&#39;d like for my check, but I overlook that because I love the food so much and I love Amalfi&#39;s."

I mean really, REALLY good. Like drive out of your way because you&#39;ve got a taste for burnt ends and no other restaurant will taste the same good. 

The burnt ends are a must-have every time I go. I&#39;m usually not a fan of sweeter pickles but they just taste right with the balsamic-BBQ glazed brisket ends. So damn delicious. I&#39;m also a big fan of the BBQ Nachos. In fact, I could make a meal out of just appetizers here. 

Anything from the smoker is great. I&#39;ve had the ribs, honey-brined chicken, pulled pork, and hot links from the smoker. Shout out for having crispy, salty tater tots as a potato option! Yes!!

I recently made what I thought in my mind was a very brave decision to veer away from the smoked meats and appetizers and order something from the entrees section of the menu. I tried the chicken and grits. In very few words, it was amazing. High five to the chef who decided to use thighs for this dish. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. The sriracha-honey drizzle on top was the perfect finishing touch. For such a heavy-sounding dish (fried chicken thighs on top of cheese grits) it is surprisingly well-rounded. So damn good. Like I&#39;ll probably order it every time I go and just sneak bites of BBQ from my tablemates. The portion is more than enough to eat half and bring the rest home for lunch the next day (or a midnight snack).

The only thing I&#39;ve had that I could probably pass on the next time is the chicken wings. The combination of smoke and buffalo was just a little too much for me, and they were a little too salty. That doesn&#39;t take away any desire to come back though! I&#39;m glad I tried them, I&#39;ll just choose something else next time!

Staying overnight before flying out of o&#39;hare, we were frankly kind of unexcited about dinner options nearby. Hmm, take our chances with strip mall Thai or Mexican food (before an international flight seems risky...), go to one of the gazillion chain restaurants nearby, order delivery pizza, or take our chances on a place that says it has great ribs &amp; BBQ. We took our chances and don&#39;t regret it. 

Spacious place, no wait at 6pm on a weeknight, a terrific selection of whiskey, bourbon, cocktails, beer, and moonshine, and friendly service were a nice opener. 

The husband had the BBQ combo with Texas hot links &amp; pulled pork - both were delicious, though his baked potato was lackluster. I had the grilled chicken Sammie which was super yum - perfectly cooked &amp; seasoned chicken, lots of caramelized onions, on a tasty roll. And - best part! - it came with fries or (duh) tater tots. These were some high quality tater tots. (and I&#39;m a bit of an expert...) 

We shoulda passed on the meh chips &amp; salsa &amp; Guac appetizer (though the salsa was fresh &amp; flavorable and the Guac was fine), but my side salad was a cut above the usual iceberg side salad, with mixed greens, chopped cucumbers, tomatoes &amp; huge tasty croutons. 

Did I mention the whiskey &amp; cocktails? We may have each had one.

It&#39;s got lots of seats too, so it&#39;s a good place to go with friends to watch the game on one of their many TVs."

Once at the bar, then a high top, and then an actual table in the dining back area. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I have received the slowest service compared to any other restaurant all with a different server each time. The restaurant isn&#39;t even busy! It&#39;s just a quarter full with empty tables everywhere. I just don&#39;t get it. I&#39;m fairly confident that they hire waitstaff with no prior experience.

The food is good, they have a good drink selection and craft beers. Their moonshine drinks are meh. Not as strong as you would hope/want. We had the burnt ends - so good! And the nachos and southwest wrap is yummy. So the few stars in giving you go to food, but sorry, the service has outweighed the food...

But I can&#39;t stand my dinner being extended by an extra hour and a half because you don&#39;t know how to train your staff. Last night when I came here, we ended up getting our appetizer out BEFORE we still had even ordered our entrees with menus lying around everywhere. Just to give you an idea of how attentive the staff was... I can see servers easing up once you get your food... But having to wait 30 mins to order isn&#39;t cool. 

You would think the waitress would ask us for our food order immediately when dropping the appetizer off and realizing that she probably has slacked a little...But didn&#39;t and kept up her consistency with darting away before we can even ask her for anything. Probably tending to her other two tables she servicing, ya know... Because she&#39;s so busy. It was funny because when she got back she said, &#34;So, are you ready to order yet?&#34; YES, like five years ago! Seriously?!

Also, half the table never got waters... Probably cuz she forgot to bring the rest out? There was five of us.... We had to follow up another two times for them. Also because of the service, don&#39;t expect refills on drinks either - alcoholic or not. 

Sorry Rack, I&#39;m all about second chances, sometimes thirds... But you&#39;ve officially lost my business."

I happened to mention it to the waitress, first a lady came who wanted to replace the steak! I said it wasn&#39;t necessary even though tough! It was still OK to eat so she comped by beer!

I take the same approach with restaurants. There&#39;s so many variables when it comes to restaurant different servers, different nights, busy one day more than others, and just in general different managers.so you hold that it&#39;s always a good experience this time but you never know.

I&#39;ve been to the Rack more than a few times. And each time the whole meal as a whole was never that great. The ribs will be good with the chicken wasn&#39;t fully cooked. Or the meatloaf which is fantastic by the way was good but then they would not put enough sauce on top of it. I could say I never had a fulfilling experience there.

So tonight when we went my expectations were low. The service was decent. She was not very attentive and then do a good job like bringing up the drinks or refill on the drinks. I got the combination of ribs and brisket. I&#39;ve gotten the ribs before and I didn&#39;t think they were that great at all. I thought I could a got better at the grocery store in the pre-cook section. This time when they came out for the combination meal I wasn&#39;t expecting to have to a half rack but three pieces of ribs is just sub par. Factor in it was way over cook and I thought I was eating Jack Links jerkey. The difference being Jacks is chewy and this was was just el carbon. The brisket wasn&#39;t great either. Not terrible. Serviceable. I would say it would be awesome at a high school lunch. 

I tried my friends Carolina Pulled Pork. Yup over cooked. Spinach? Salt and butter. Looked delicious. Too much salt. Actually more than a few people said it was a very salty meal."

Prices aren&#39;t very high for barbeque but not a bargain -- decent sized portions. Service is friendly, but could be a little faster. The food is mostly unmemorable -- the textures are acceptable, the flavors aren&#39;t perfect but nothing is unpleasant, the theme of the dishes isn&#39;t obvious but there seems to be some care put into the preparation.

The best item I tried on my trip was the brisket -- tender and tasty and in hearty slices. The smoked sausage was also very flavorful, with a bit of a kick -- although I didn&#39;t love the flavorings that were used. The BBQ chicken, pulled pork, and baby back ribs failed to leave much of an impression. Each could&#39;ve been more moist, but they weren&#39;t terribly overcooked either -- possibly an extra bit of marination instead of depending on the barbeque sauce for flavor could&#39;ve been an improvement.

The sides were alright as well -- the corn bread has a strong flavor of corn, but is a bit on the dry side. The baked beans had a good texture and flavor, like a sweet chili. The coleslaw was also flavorful, but could&#39;ve been a little more creamy.

Rack House does seem to have promise, as the ingredient quality and smoke flavor is in the food -- a little refinement on cooking times and flavor would easily bump them up to 4 or 5 stars."

Conveniently, Rack House is a little over a mile from my home. 

We sat down and we started with an order of cheese curds. The cheese curds came out piping hot and delicious! The chili aioli really made the cheese curds POP! Unsure how others can label them as &#34;bland&#34;. 

Our server was very nice, considering we came in about an hour to close. He recommended an excellent craft brew. We both thoroughly enjoyed the recommendation. 

Next, we both ordered the Beef Brisket / Quarter Baby Back Ribs combo. It came with Jalapeño coleslaw, a baked potato, and AMAZING honey butter cornbread. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the Jalapeño cornbread. 

The ribs were excellent, the meat fell right off the bone. The brisket was delicious, with a persistent smoky flavor to it. The ribs and brisket were coated in a light &#34;glaze&#34; of barbecue sauce. However, I must say the meats needed a bit more sauce on them. Regardless, the barbecue was excellent, especially living in Chicago. 

We will certainly be back when the craving for barbecue hits!"

For the next six months we had tried to get out to this place with no success... And finally we made it. In a word, wow.

For starters, Brandon was our server and he was absolutely on top of everything. Super nice guy with great recommendations and extremely prompt service. When he had given us our appetizer of the burnt ends he asked how it was. I was genuinely giving constructive criticism in saying that it was a little bit fatty for my tastes, when a manager was walking by had asked me to repeat myself and ended up comping that appetizer. We didn&#39;t expected but I will be honest that it was actually really nice of them.

My girlfriend and I then went for the full rack of ribs. At $26 it is a steal and let me tell you it was one of the best racks of ribs I&#39;ve had in a very long time. The meet was so fall off the bone that it literally fell off the bone one my girlfriend picked up one of the reps. In a word I would describe it as succulent. It&#39;s a must get if you go there. Additionally, the cornbread that came with the meal was remarkable. It had those little pieces of corn in it which burst with flavor and was Don just... Very well.

Finally, on the side we had macaroni and cheese. Our waiter told us that it was their new recipe for macaroni and cheese and it is a winner. The cheese was nice and creamy macaroni was fresh and cooked to perfection where it was not too hard are not too soft.

All in all, this was a pretty epic place. I was extremely satisfied and we are definitely going back. The total bill was $36 which is nothing short of an absolute steal. If this was in the city and had the name Webbers it could sell for three times the price only in this case it would be twice is good. Put it this way... It&#39;s good enough that if you live in the city, go there. It&#39;s worth the trip."

It has a warm, inviting atmosphere, and really good weekly deals (check out their website). Not to mention the beer list! I had no idea this place had an extensive beer list. Almost all of the beers they have I had never tried. Our server was great about getting us samples and making recommendations.

In speaking of service, our server was great. The entire night he was very attentive, explained the menu, and even gave us a free dessert! The service is what really put this restaurant over the top.

The food was really good too. They have a variety of different things to try. I decided on the combo BBQ platter with pulled pork and brisket. The portions are just right, and they have great sides to choose from. It wasn&#39;t too pricey either (not cheap, but not crazy expensive). Good comfort food!

This was much appreciated, and allowed us to learn that youn can split the 8 piece order of wings into 2 flavor options, and he told us his favourite options for the trifecta plate wich was a great way to try and split 3 meats between two people.

I was here on a week long business trip and was looking specifically for a restaurant with a large drink menu or brewery. Short of downtown Chicago, this is it.  And for being the only real location like itself in des plaines, it does a fantastic job. The beer and whiskey menu is pretty extensive. Managed to try several local beers here. 

First up,  it&#39;s a very easy location to get to.  Parking is ample.  The hostess though different on the days I went,  on both days was very pleasant and seated me promptly. The servers were quick and accommodating.  I was by myself but they still checked on me multiple times; always appreciate that. When asked,  they gave me recommendations on popular drinks and dinners. 

First time here I got the Carolina pulled pork plate. Second time I got the over easy burger/egg. Both were delicious. Good portion sizes here. 

Doesn&#39;t look like my account will be in that area much longer so I won&#39;t be able to revisit. I&#39;ll definitely keep it bookmarked though. Give it a shot, I think you like it. I was going during the week (Wed and Thurs) and there was good seating for groups and at the bar."

We were out in the &#39;burbs with the grandkids anyway, so why not try it? 

We were very pleased! Chef Bryant had a special of his Chicken and Cheesy Grits which is soooooooooooooooo good. Then my husband tried a new special of steak and shrimp with a saucy topping. He loved it so much he ate the whole thing. Sorry I can&#39;t describe the sauce for you - it looked slightly BBQ-ish - but I didn&#39;t get a bite!

The staff took great care of our pair of 4-year-old boys, not an easy task what with a spilled drink and such. Turned out the boys loved the BBQ brisket more than the their own chicken tenders. They also liked the cheesy grits and the broccoli!

The gooey chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top sounded like an ordinary combination, but something about it made it much better than others we&#39;ve had. We thought we were sharing  the dessert with all three generations, but the grandsons moved onto grandpa&#39;s lap and the three of them ate the whole thing themselves :)

Rack House is huge compared to Cafe Selmarie but it&#39;s built in smaller sections so it felt &#34;warmer&#34; rather than industrial. The section we sat in could seat about 70 people and it was well-staffed in that we always had service as soon as we needed it. I would suggest to the restaurant that having the list of specials on the table while we decided what to order would be more helpful than having the waiter read it to us after we&#39;d been perusing the menu. That made ordering a 2-step process because we switched to ordering the specials once we heard them. 

One memory our grandson repeats over and over - the waiter brought him THREE cherries on a plastic &#34;sword&#34;. We knew Chef Bryan&#39;ts food had that extra step of caring and with the staff taking extra care as well, we&#39;ll be going back again."

On Thursdays they have $5 burgers. Add a couple bucks for toppings and you are set. They use really good meat, know how to cook it right, and are simply awesome. They even taste smokey. Almost like you actually hired a professional chef who uses fresh food to grill at ur own BBQ. 

As for their BBQ, amazing again. I&#39;ve had the ribs, the brisket, and the pork. All of it was melt in your mouth good. Perfectly smoked everything. I would almost say this food is as good as and possibly better than smoque in the city. 

Honestly, everything I put in my mouth here is awesome. I usually hate The side of coleslaw all restaurants and give. But this place really pays attention to how it&#39;s made. I have never liked coleslaw until I&#39;ve tried it here. And the cornbread is also ridiculous. Mashed potatoes yes. Tater tots yes. French fries yes.

And let&#39;s not get started on the moonshine. 

The only complaint I would give this place is that it costs between 18 and $25 for the barbecue platter. But in their defense, they do give a lot of food.

There are two things that are very consistent with Rack House: 1) The food is always really good, and 2) the service is always mediocre. I don&#39;t like being negative so I&#39;ll focus on the good stuff first.

The food is always excellent, which is what keeps bringing us back to Rack House. My brother loves the BBQ brisket sandwich, and there isn&#39;t anything I&#39;ve ordered that I didn&#39;t enjoy. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich is good, the salads are good (there is a tuna salad I really like), the soups are good, appetizers good, the tater tots (mmmm).... just very solid good food. Everything is a huge size portion, so the nice thing is you can have leftovers for later. There is a good variety on the menu so even if you don&#39;t like BBQ you can find something to eat. They also have a decent beer list as well. The patio in the back looks awesome (though my brother won&#39;t eat outside so I never get to sit out there).

The downside is that every time we go the service is bad. Having been a server for a long time, I&#39;m just surprised at the lack of even basic serving skills that these kids have. Over the last several visits we&#39;ve encountered a myriad problems ranging from being forgotten at the table, our orders not put in, our orders being wrong, servers disappearing for long swaths of time (to the point we have to ask the host to find our server), lack of knowledge regarding the menu, table numbers being entered wrong by multiple serving staff (as is evident from food runners stopping at multiple tables desperately trying to find where the food goes) or receiving general pithy behavior that borders on rudeness. The food is delivered to tables by runners, so I&#39;m not sure where the servers disappear for such long periods of time. The hosts, however, are always friendly and chipper. 

Look, I&#39;m not some picky needy person, and I really don&#39;t like leaving bad reviews. If you want good food and good beer go to Rack House, you won&#39;t be disappointed. It just surprises me that for as GOOD as the food is at Rack House, their service is consistently bad. There are always tables sat when we go, but I think they could really boom if the serving staff had better performance."

They skimped on the sauce: I expect my proteins to be either slathered in BBQ sauce or with generous portions on the side in containers; neither was the case.

*On top of that the 3 Trifecta proteins I ordered were pretty much devoid of BBQ/smoke flavor.  However, the meats were NOT dried out which I appreciated.

*This was a worst-case scenario for carryout: They didn&#39;t include any of the 3 extra sides I paid extra for, but I received 2 sides I didn&#39;t order nor want.  Granted it was a Saturday night and they were busy in both carryouts and table service.  If you&#39;re doing carryout be sure to open &amp; check all your items before you leave.

*The Burnt Ends appetizer is a standout! I&#39;m a Kansas City transplant so anytime I see Burnt Ends in the Chicago area I&#39;m intrigued.  These were good and served as an appetizer with generous amounts of good cole slaw and nice sour pickles.

The meat we did get was meh-countless small, fatty, pieces made up most of the brisket after I dug through the coleslaw and fried onions that seemed to make up a large part of the sandwich. The reuben, while drenched in a flavorful sauce, had an amount of meat that didn&#39;t even come close to what one would expect a typical reuben to have. I guess we failed to see the humor behind their deception in making these sandwiches &#34;appear&#34; to be more substantial.

For a bbq restaurant that specializes in several types of meat dishes, it was disappointing to not be able to actually taste much meat. The ratio of meat to bread was laughable, and after perusing some of the reviews on here, I know I&#39;m not the only one who has had the same unfortunate experience. For $12 sandwiches, we expected more. We deserved more.

The cherry on top? Took one last swig of my red wine, only to immediately spit it out. Nearly a tablespoon full of sediment at the bottom of my glass. Wtf.

It&#39;s a shame that the food and drink, the actual REASON people choose to go out to restaurants instead of cooking at home, is the only real thing lacking about this place. Outdoor patio, huge bar, and friendly servers are all fine and dandy, but I can find all that AND decent food elsewhere."

It was reasonably priced and the buffet was pretty good, with a nice variety.  The others in my party ordered off the menu - most impressive was the full rack of ribs, which was so big, it overlapped the plate, and everyone who ordered that took some home.  The biggest complaint we had was that it was REALLY loud in there.  I know it&#39;s basically a bar, but . . ."

Chicken was solid and what I would expect but the ribs were really bad. Dried out, but the worst was with a half rack I got four bones that were SO dry I really got dried meat to the point of jerky and I really really really likeBBQ ribs and give the benefit of the doubt. I believe o had a ad day with past reviews but if I came here from reviews, don&#39;t give me something that tastes like leftovers. Service is solid and atmosphere is outdated about 10 years yet comfy."

Pros: Solid beer selection and the BBQ sauce was super tasty.

Cons: I couldn&#39;t tell if you if the brisket was any good.. My sandwich was 75% bread, 15% slaw, 5% onions and 5% brisket.  I kid you not.  They could have given me mystery meat and I&#39;d never know.  We were sat in the bar area and homie was off his game, completely forgot one order (presumably because two people ordered the same thing), had to be flagged down to order and again to get our checks.

I also love the cornbread that comes with it!  I always enjoy the chef&#39;s specials, and last night one option was flank steak that came with beans and rice. Outstanding! I think it&#39;s great that they are branching out from their traditional menu and adding some interesting specials. And for a starter, the cheese curds are not to be missed. Very yummy!!

They have cider, which for me is a great option. The wine list is short, but has some good choices available. One evening margaritas were on special. Can&#39;t beat that!

The service has always been top-notch. One evening we had two four year olds with us, and our server could not have been more accomodating. I heartily recommend Rack House. It is comfortable, has great service, and I really love the food!"

I&#39;m giving the restaurant two stars because I had a mostly pleasant experience when my husband and I dined in. The food is good.

However, things start to rapidly spiral downward when it comes to their online ordering system and catering.

Online ordering: Great in theory! However, I paid for dinner online and then my husband went to pick up the food. My husband accidentally paid again at the counter. The restaurant doesn&#39;t have a system in place to catch mistakes like this. Luckily, I noticed the double charge on our statement and through a series of several calls with employees and managers at the restaurant, finally got the second charge refunded. If you&#39;re going to offer online ordering and payment, you need to have checks in place that don&#39;t allow for the possibility of charging customers twice. Also, shouldn&#39;t the restaurant&#39;s books have been off at the end of the night? I&#39;ve worked in retail. If the money doesn&#39;t add up, you find out where the error is and correct it.

Catering: Buyer beware! I hosted a baby shower recently and decided to cater some food from The Rack House. I went online, selected the package and was ready to go. Until, I saw the total cost and realized it was about $50 more than it should be. (I did take into consideration taxes and I planned on picking up the order, so no delivery fee.) I called the restaurant and walked through my order with an employee. When we got to the checkout portion, she also saw the $50 overcharge and didn&#39;t know where it was coming from. She said she&#39;d get in touch with their website managers and get back to me. That was about a month ago and I have yet to hear back. Needless to say, I took my business elsewhere. If there&#39;s a good explanation for $50 tacked on to my order I&#39;m happy to hear it. Otherwise, it makes it look like the restaurant is hiding charges assuming the customer just won&#39;t notice.

Good food. Very disappointed in just about everything else."

The cheese curds with the chili aioli dipping sauce are out of this world! I&#39;ve gotten them every visit here and quite honestly, they are the only reason I keep coming back. They also have an awesome outdoor patio which I high recommend on a nice day.

Now for the not so good...
I&#39;m not a fan of the atmosphere inside as it is dark and really doesn&#39;t have the décor you would expect of a BBQ joint. The food isn&#39;t all that great either. I&#39;ve tried the salmon, the brisket, and several of their burgers (which in my opinion are your best/safest bet) all of which were nothing special. It seems every visit to The Rack House involves some sort of issue. I&#39;ve had the bar not have my desired beer several times, numerous experiences where the service is extremely slow although the place wasn&#39;t busy, and have had mistakes with our order on a few occasions. 

I would still recommend the Rack House for their cheese curds are honestly worth it for me. Don&#39;t expect much more though."

First I was double I.D.&#39;d by our waitress and by the manager.  We ordered the nacho appetizer and our entrees at the same time as we knew what we wanted.  Even though I was starving I didn&#39;t expect them to bring out the nachos at the same time as my entree.  It just doesn&#39;t make any sense.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and the meat was really dry and very stringy.

This wasn&#39;t the best experience and I&#39;m not sure that I would come back here for barbecue."

The first time I came here I ordered a side of mac &amp; cheese with an appetizer: fried pickles and sweet corn. The mac &amp; cheese was not bad but not amazing. A unique thing was that they added crumbled corn muffin on top. The fried pickles and sweet corn were bland, which made the greasiness stand out (greasy is expected, but these were GREASY). I couldn&#39;t finish them; I guess this is why appetizers are meant for sharing. 

The second time I came here I got the steak tacos. Where the appetizers from last time lacked taste, these tacos had too much; they were extremely salty. And there was only two, which meant I not only didn&#39;t have leftovers, I actually thought about ordering another entree because I wasn&#39;t full yet. 

I did end up getting the cookie sizzler for dessert. The sizzler was small (I had no problem eating the entire thing on my own), and it got so soggy from the melting ice cream by the end, I couldn&#39;t finish the last bite. The first few bites were pretty good. It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve had better dessert sizzlers elsewhere.

So is the food here worth the price? Personally, I&#39;m going with a no. If I&#39;m going to be paying over $10 for my food, it better be somewhat decent. I&#39;m not that picky of an eater, but this stuff does not meet my standards. I&#39;d rather pay a few bucks more somewhere else and get much better food.

I admit it may have just been the food I ordered that left a bad taste in my mouth (literally), but they shouldn&#39;t have items on the menu that they can&#39;t cook well. If I do go back to this place, I&#39;ll try a burger on a Thursday (it&#39;s the daily special), and I&#39;ll leave an updated review. My friends have said that the burgers were alright. However, at this point, I am not impressed with this place.

On top of the sub-par food, the service was also very slow. It felt like our waitress took half an hour to come back to our table each time. It didn&#39;t even look like it was a busy night! Plus she would totally forget about things she had agreed to bring us, and then she messed up on my friend&#39;s drink order and kept saying she swore she heard him order what she brought him (he didn&#39;t). I will say that she was very nice, but nice does not really make up for poor service.

One thing I do like about this place is the cute dining area they have outside. They have a nice fireplace, and when it gets dark, they put out candles in mason jars which adds to the cozy ambiance. They also have TVs so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s great if you want to catch a game during dinner. I would recommend this place for drinking in the outdoor dining area during the summer - and maybe for the daily specials when the prices are more reasonable. That&#39;s about it."

However, our most recent experience (Sept. 17), was one that we still were experiencing the next morning, and not in a good way. I ordered the Over Easy burger, medium well and it came out over cooked and hard as a puck. My brother ordered the Trifecta (ribs, chicken and salmon), and the food was so dry and tasteless that he barely had 2 bites before he sent it back. The chicken was so bad that after chewing a bite, it turned into a dry paste in your mouth. The salmon was also horribly over cooked. It&#39;s almost as if each item was sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and just smothered in BBQ just before it was served. Finally, my friend had the sliced brisket sandwich and while it wasn&#39;t as bad as my brother&#39;s plate, it was still very dry.

Granted, by the time we ordered, it was after 8:00. But that doesn&#39;t mean we should be served food that isn&#39;t freshly prepared. And I promise you that none of the food was freshly prepared. Most, if not all of it, was put in a microwave to reheat it.
We spent over $100 that night, even with my brother&#39;s meal being taken off the check. We were prepared to chalk it up to a bad night by your cooks, until all 3 of us woke up the next morning with bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. The only things we shared were the Rack House Mega Nachos and the Cheese Curds, so either one of those dishes made us all sick, or everything coming out of that kitchen that night made us sick.

I generally don&#39;t put up reviews because if I don&#39;t like the food at a restaurant, I just don&#39;t go back.  But I contacted the restaurant to tell them of the issues we had and there has been no response whatsoever.  I think it&#39;s time to look for a new BBQ joint.  Any suggestions?"

IMHO, they should have a playlist made up of country, rockabilly, and honky tonk styles of music.

The staff was very nice and the place seemed clean. The cheese curds are amazing and I might just order two of those and roll myself out next time I stop in for dinner.

When it arrived, I was surprised, as I was expecting the bread to be a toasted baguette of some sort- but it was on two slices of toasted white bread instead. Whatever, not a big deal. However, the pork itself was pounded so incredibly thin and was inedible, because it was so dry. I ended up just taking the pork off and making a veggie sandwich.

The slab consisted of ten meaty bones. The dinner includes jalapeño spiced cole slaw, walnut flavored corn bread and a baked potato. The latter is their standard side and they charge a dollar to substitute. Other places include two sides of your choice with their rib dinners.

In a word the ribs were mediocre. They were fairly tasty but it was a precooked and reheated kind of taste. The majority of the ribs were of the soft, fall off the bone variety; so much so that you needed to use a knife and fork if you didn&#39;t want to handle the meat with your hands. However the meat near one end of the slab was a little tough and dry.

There was little smoky, barbecue flavor. Very mild, almost bland tasting. This style might be more appealing to others than to me.

The cole slaw and corn bread were very good, the baked potato fair. I ordered the potato &#34;loaded&#34;, but I didn&#39;t taste any onions or bacon bits. The carry out service was good."

Visit 1 - 
The first visit was to try their Oktoberfest specials.  I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel and it was pretty bad.  A very thin cutlet that was dry as a bone and dominated by a crusty breading that was terrible.  It was even hard to cut much less chew.  This is not what Wiener Schnitzel should be.  When the young, blonde cashier came over and asked how everything was I said, &#34;The schnitzel was not very good&#34;.  She said, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.&#34;  After that, nothing else.  Neither the cook or the manager came over to talk to us. I didn&#39;t write a review at the time and thought I would call the restaurant and ask to speak to Matt.  I called the next day around 3:30 and after waiting on hold for 12 minutes he picked up and I explained why I thought the Wiener Schnitzel was lacking.  He listened, thanked me for the feedback and said he was sorry.  Once again, that was it.  No, I wasn&#39;t looking for a freebie but he didn&#39;t seem too interested in asking how the meal didn&#39;t measure up.  All right, I just let it go and thought from now on I&#39;ll stick to the BBQ.

Visit 2 -
I visited again for an early dinner on 10/29 at 5:00PM. I ordered  a 2-meat platter and chose brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket was the saving grace of the meal and the only reason I&#39;m giving 2-stars.  The brisket has always been the highlight at SBR with a beautiful smoke ring and just the right amount of fat for me.  The pulled pork on the other hand looked like it was boiled and the cook just drizzled sauce over the top.  It had little flavor or seasoning.  It really struck me as if it was just reheated or boiled.  The green mac &amp; cheese was very good and the corn choux was just OK.

I need to mention that the same cook was on duty both times.  I point this out because I still feel that SBR uses quality ingredients.  The main problem with the last two disappointing meals has been with the preparation. 
My hope is that Matt and Chef Duce will look into this and implement additional training to ensure that they deliver a quality product regardless of the time of day."

The place looks like it started out as something else and didn&#39;t look like a BBQ place from the out side. The inside was cozy with booths, tables with metal tops and chairs. Sweet baby rays walls are covered with trophies, ribbons and old pictures so it&#39;s a sweet baby rays shrine for the most part. There is a BBQ sauce station if you don&#39;t like the bottle on the table and want something different. Overall the place looks the part for BBQ.

I got there for lunch and the lot was empty but I did smell smoke so that is a good sign but the bad sign was I didn&#39;t get until almost an hour after opening and no one was in the place. The catering side was going strong and the phone kept ringing so I was a little relieved. 

The service was great with no issues, you place your order and take a seat until your food is brought over. See my picture of the woman wrapping a cookie, that cookie is made in house and just came off of that baking tray next to her. What BBQ place makes there own cookies in this day and age. 

I ordered the St. Louis full rack with two sides, green chili Mac and corn maque choux with a small corn muffin. The food hit my table in like five minutes and and the presentation was nice because it&#39;s served on a paper lined baking pan.

The corn thing was good with a little heat finish. The creamy cheese Mac was creamy but it had a weird cheese flavor and was boring to me but the noodles were cooked perfect and not mushy. The corn muffin was good with a nice sweet corn flavor and one of the few I liked.

The St. Louis ribs looked narrower and thinner than I have ever had before but looked amazing, see my picture. I found the ribs to be a little hard with not much smoke flavor but they did come clean off the bone. The texture of the meat was weird and as you chewed it broke down into like splinters of meat. The meat was not juicy or moist and on the dry side like maybe they were made the day before and I&#39;m not saying they were in any way.

Overall I was unimpressed with sweet baby rays and I expected so much more because it is not a chain restaurant. I don&#39;t understand all the 5 stars or maybe people have just not had good BBQ like Smoque in Chicago or Pappys in St. Louis. Now I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad but I have been to many really good places which have set the bar for good BBQ.

Just a note, what I took home that I didn&#39;t eat at the restaurant as a second tasting went into the garbage because it&#39;s not good on the second day and reaffirmed that there are better places for BBQ. I just about never throw left overs away from a restaurant but I just couldn&#39;t get through it on another try."

We got a half order of the nachos with pork to start and I thought they were pretty good, just messy to eat, but at a place like this, that is okay with me! Lots of toppings and flavours and they did give us forks to help out.

I got a full slab of their St. Louis ribs with green chili mac and french fries. I really enjoyed one half of my ribs because the meat fell off the bone and was nice and juicy and tender, but the other side was too tough for my liking so I didn&#39;t eat it. The mac n cheese was really good! Nice and creamy and cheesy with a kick. The fries were just okay and I didn&#39;t try the corn bread. 

To go we got an order of their rib tips which were such a good late night snack!

Overall it was a great experience, with great service and I would definitely come back here again. Their weekday specials all sounded really good too!"

BBQ was okay. Got 4 meats. St Louis Ribs, Brisket and Burnt ends, hot link. I was really expecting true smoked bbq experience from the meats.  I couldn&#39;t taste any smoke or see any smoke rings?  Sauce was great but really masked the meat and the ribs where good but not as meaty as a normal st Louis style rib.  Good  place to try but is not a top place to revisit on my bbq list."

I&#39;ve had the banana parfait and I definitely recommend that even to take home for later!

We walked in and immediately felt like we were guests in a person&#39;s home. The woman behind the counter is soft spoken, funny and super kind. Her name is Endia and it turns out, her dad was one of the original cooks... the things we learn just being nice and talking to people!

4 stars for the bad news: they sold out of the St Louis Slabs of Ribs and I didn&#39;t want Baby Back Ribs tonight. They don&#39;t sell a boneless rib sandwich. 

I&#39;m unfamiliar with anything else when it comes to barbeque. I&#39;ve heard the words Rib Tips and seen shows about Briskets on The Food Network Channel but that&#39;s about it.

I asked Endia what she likes and her eyes lit up when she brought up the Brisket. I asked sandwich or plate? She said plate. I took her advice and chose the mac&#39;n&#39;cheese as my 2 sides (you can get two different ones).

We moved out of Wood Dale three years ago, so we don&#39;t get here quite as often as we used to, but had to make an excursion this weekend. They&#39;ve still got it. 

The menu has changed and expanded a bit, and you can now get the smokehouse nachos famous at the EGV location in Wood Dale. With your choice of pork, chicken or brisket. SO GOOD.  However I do have one tiny complaint: some of the chips in our nachos were chewy and difficult to eat. Like they&#39;d been nuked, maybe? Or were stale and then nuked? Hard to say. The rest of it was still delicious, though.

This time I got a two-meat platter with burnt ends and smoked sausage. That sausage was delightful. The burnt ends melted in my mouth. The green chile mac &amp; cheese and maque choux still has it. 

The WD location is small - though they do have outdoor seating seasonally - but they still have good service and friendly folks. They also have bottled regional sauces and rubs you can&#39;t buy anywhere else. So if you love some meat, get yourself here.

(By the way, in case it needs to be said, this place is not vegetarian friendly -- you can probably eat three or four things on the menu tops...)"

However, SBR&#39;s does a good job at providing a consistent product which is good overall. 

First encounter here was going in on a Friday evening with friends. The service was slow and the food was average. My second encounter was just with my wife at her request for some BBQ on a Saturday. Again...slow, again...the food was ok. Third encounter, we used SBR&#39;s to cater our corporate luncheon and feed 150 people. I was pleasantly surprised with the results. The pulled pork was good, as was their grilled chicken, and salad with grilled vegetables.

I probably won&#39;t go back unless someone else is paying. There is better BBQ down the street at Shorty&#39;s. For catering events I&#39;ll keep them on the list of possibilities."

When with some colleagues from work and the food was solid but not as impressive as I had been expecting.  The plusses was the variety and quality of the sauces (not surprising).  Almost all of their sauces are available to try and I had never had any other than their main commercial one.  Really liked a few, especially the raspberry one which had a strong raspberry flavor.

The rest of the meal was unspectacular, especially for someone who has had a lot of BBQ in the south.  I had a combination platter of ribs, brisket and burnt ends.  Was really looking forward to the burnt ends but could not even tell them apart from the brisket.  Both were good, not too fatty, but nothing special.  Same for the ribs, good but nothing special.  Sides also were not memorable.  Baked beans were baked beans, nothing more than you can get out of a can.  Green beans were the daily special, cooked in butter, but again did not jump out at me.

Loved the different sauces and may go back again just to dip but overall food was good but not great."

I will only focus on one item in this review - their Burnt Ends. Only one word to describe them - excellent. Theirs are by definition truly Kansas City burnt ends. The meat is from the point of the brisket and it is correctly prepared. I&#39;ve been to enough other BBQ places in the area and I don&#39;t think any of them have a clue on how to make burnt ends. Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s does it right. Keep up the good work guys! Many thanks.

It was more food than I expected. I had enough leftover for two more meals. The beans were not to my taste. The corn bread would have been great if it was warm.

I&#39;d always been a fan of their bottled sauce and when a coworker told me we work near one of their restaurants...well what are we waiting for??  Let&#39;s get us some Q!

I had &#34;The Duce&#34;...a delectable combo of fried bologna (a childhood favorite) topped with pulled pork &amp; coleslaw.  BBQ Goodness!  The pulled pork was oh-so-tender and juicy.  The fried bologna on the bottom, is quite tasty on it&#39;s own, but with the pulled pork on top you don&#39;t really notice it as much.  I did find the fried bologna to make a nice base, though, protecting the bottom bun from getting soggy &amp; falling apart.  I found the addition of their mustard sauce to this sandwich to make it absolutely perfect.

I also had sweet potato fries.  A nice crispy and sweet accompaniment because you just can&#39;t go wrong with those paired with BBQ.  My other side was cheesy grits...which I&#39;d never had before so I have nothing to compare them to.  I can say they were definitely very cheesy and I would order them again.

The staff was friendly and the food was ready quick, though we were part of the early lunch crowd.  I&#39;m sure they get busier as the day progresses.

So if you have a taste for some fabulous BBQ head over to SBR&#39;s &amp; be sure to wear dark colors to hide the sauce you&#39;ll inevitably drip on yourself."

Dried out horrible ribs with no smoke flavor to speak of, lousy service and total indifference are the hallmarks of this joke of a BBQ place.  Just about any gas station in Mississippi, Georgia or Alabama has better &#39;cue than this poor excuse for a barbecue joint.  Famous Dave&#39;s kicks the crap out of them--and they are only a 3 star place. Bandana&#39;s in St.Louis is head and shoulders over this place too and they are a chain--albeit a MUCH BETTER one. I throw better BBQ than what they served me here in the garbage.  Don&#39;t eat here--it&#39;s overpriced and terrible. Come down south where we know what good barbecue is supposed to taste like and you&#39;ll throw rocks at this place while you are on your way to Smoque which is 100 times better for about the same money. It&#39;s a toss-up between here and Rendezvous in Memphis on which is the more overrated for crap BBQ. Go back to selling sauce in the supermarket because the barbecue here is an epic and miserable FAIL.  A very expensive disappointment and embarrassing for my client who was trying his very best to take me for something he thought I&#39;d enjoy as he&#39;s an IL Yankee and I&#39;m a 5th generation southern gal. I felt bad for him, but I doubt he&#39;ll ever come here again either.  If this is what passes for barbecue then y&#39;all definitely need to come down south--where we KNOW the flavor is in the MEAT not the sugar-overloaded sauce. UGH!!"

I wanted barbecue and I was willing to travel.  So, adios to my oldest Yelp bookmark--and a fond farewell it was!

In part, I was putting it off because 1.) Who knows where the heck Wood Dale is? and 2.)  I was worried about some lame corporate atmosphere with mediocre food.  I was wrong on both counts.

I&#39;ll get to the food in a moment, but first let me praise the service.  The young man who served us was fun, energetic, dedicated, enthusiastic, and generous.  And what we saw from his handful of colleagues was more of the same.  That was a delight, because you rarely see an entire cohort of employees who seem to love their jobs and actually enjoy dealing with customers--at ANY kind of business.

Of course the food is the main attraction.  I&#39;ve been using Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s bottled sauce for over a decade now, and once long ago at Taste of Chicago I ate a legendary pulled pork sandwich from them.  But I was just a little hesitant about a bricks-and-mortar establishment.  My bad--I&#39;ve been missing out all these years.  All-around, these guys are making some of the best barbecue in Chicagoland.

Pulled pork:  still glorious
Barbecued chicken:  there&#39;s not much room for excellence with a chicken, but theirs is very good
Barbecue grilled shrimp:  again, it&#39;s not a knockout, but fulfills its potential
Baby back ribs:  I prefer a meaty rib, not a &#34;fall off the bone&#34; variety like some people, and SBR&#39;s was precisely to my taste.  So, in my opinion, these were some of the best ribs I&#39;ve had anywhere in the region.

They have more sauces available in the restaurant than they sell through retail.  I didn&#39;t much care for the mustard variety, but their Kansas City is damn fine.

How about sides?  Sweet, moist cornbread.  Creamy, tangy cole slaw.  Savory sweet potato fries.  Check out the corn maque choux for a nice change of pace from the typical starchy sides.  It&#39;s not really a &#34;healthy&#34; option, being creamier than it needs to be, but it&#39;s quite tasty 

For food, these guys rate a very solid four stars, but I am awarding them the fifth star (rare for me on a first visit) based on the staff&#39;s attitude.  If they are that happy to serve it to me, I would happily haul my keester all the way out to Wood Dale again for some more of this stuff."

I was especially surprised that this restaurant was located in itty bitty Wood Dale! 

Upon arriving, I had to make sure it wasn&#39;t closed because there was no one there. And it was a Friday night. I was a little hesitant to go inside because typically it&#39;s not a good sign if a restaurant is empty (See: Restaurant Impossible on the Food Network). However, once I walked inside, I understood why. This place is tiny as hell! There&#39;s about 5 tables total, so I would not recommend coming here with a big group. It&#39;s not really a sit down restaurant. The menu is on the wall, you walk up to the counter and order, sit down, and they bring you your food and drinks. They have two televisions there if you find your company boring, and they have a whole shelf of trophies, for their sauce and BBQ, I&#39;m assuming.

The food arrived on a nice little gray tray lined with wax paper, which I like. I&#39;ve only had food served like that at one other BBQ place (see my other reviews) so it must be a true BBQ thing. The food was pretty good. I had 1/2 platter of ribs, with fries as my side. The ribs were yummy. Nice and pink, and a little sweet. The ribs are done St. Louis style, so there was a mix of dry rub and a little of their signature sauce. However, if you like things a little spicier, there are 5 other sauces on the table which you can use to lather up those babies. The fries were nicely seasoned and the cornbread was phenomenal. 

My only complaint is that it&#39;s a little pricey. My half slab was $15. My boyfriend got the full slab which was around $20. With two sodas, our bill came out to $40. Yikes. If you can stomach the bill, this place is a-okay. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily recommend dining in, but it&#39;s certainly good for take-out. Oh and they have a few domestic beers. That&#39;s always nice."

Since the first bad experience 3 weeks ago, I have been 2 more times, hoping these bad experiences were just flukes, and both times had similiar issues, and the brisket was consistently extremely tough and not at all good. I had a bite and threw it out each time.

On the most recent visit I asked an employee if they had a change in management or cooks or something 3-4 weeks ago. She said they did have one exactly then.

And that seals the deal for me. Whoever the new management is, they are doing a terrible job as they took a great establishment and made it awful. I will not be coming back here, and will savor the old days when this place was good."

My meal was to go and I enjoyed it in front of the TV watching sports, drinking a beer and scratching myself. It was a good-sized meal but I expected more volume, especially from the side orders.

I got the brisket sandwich which was delicious. Soft, moist and very flavorful but not enough heft. The barbecue sauce was very nice. Not too sweet or smoky.

It came with two side orders. Some kind of corn,/pudding mixture and BBQ beans. Yes, I was eating alone. And besides, my farts smell like cornbread. Each side order was very good, although small.

(I was hungry. Shut up!)

Anyway, it was a very good meal for a pretty good price."

But I have to hand it to this little joint, they did all they could up to the point of doing handstands to make me happy.

One of my teacher friends suggested a stop there. I will admit, walking in, the aroma does tend to make one swoon. Not too busy, we hit it just right. I will also admit that I do love their sauce. Then I checked out the menu.

Hmmm. Sensing concern our waiter did a great job. I have to agree with my Yelp friend David that everyone at Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s was just plain sweet.

Now: on to the food!!!! My friend&#39;s pulled pork sandwich was gigantic. He said it was like &#34;butt-ah&#34;. I was afraid he would drool before he got going on it. He chose a side of mac n cheese, which had &#34;comfort food&#34; written all over it. He also got slaw. I snagged a taste, it was awesome. I had their chicken BBQ, my ever favorite sweet potato fries, and their slaw. No complaints from this girl. 

We both did ourselves proud, but they have something on their menu for dessert that will definitely send you back to your childhood. Banana pudding. And not the wimpy kind. This here was some pudding!!!

They&#39;re not just here to make a buck but to put the best out there.  They do a great job with putting out regional barbecue instead of just 1 style.  Their Memphis just isn&#39;t dry rub ribs, but they have the fried bologna sandwich topped with pulled pork and slaw.  You can get chopped pork like in Carolina (but no Cheerwine here) or burnt ends Kansas City style.  

They have a bunch of varieties of sauces along with their regular sauce.  My friend is the biggest fan of their corn maque choux.  Another loves their red beans and rice that definitely starts with a hearty roux.  I&#39;m a fan of their green chili mac n cheese.  Great flavor!  Regardless of the day of week or time of day, there is always some kind of special going on.  If you don&#39;t stay for their all you can eat ribs, they have a carryout special at the same time.  Service is also great since they bring the orders out to your table and refill your drinks.  The only issue I have is that they close at 8.  Duce Raymond, the main chef is also Kendall Culinary College trained so their recipes are solid.  Definitely the best place in the suburbs for great barbecue!"

Julian&#39;s is walking distance from my house and I still go out of my way for SBR. 

All of their meats are smoked extremely well. Favorites are Kansas City burnt ends, St Louis ribs and brisket. Sides are great too, especially the beans, corn maque choux, and green mac chili!

Also, a lot of different sauces that you won&#39;t find on the website or on the grocery shelves. My wife&#39;s favorite is the Smokey Apple, and mine is the Competition sauce. You can take a small cup of the sauces home, or just buy a bottle of your favorite, which are in the glass display counter."

In addition to the meteoric fall in quality and quantity that many other reviewers have voiced &#34;concern&#34; with, they&#39;ve apparently recently restructured their menu. They&#39;ve done away with many menu items (including my go-to Cubano Sandwich, which I&#39;ll try not to bitch about because I could see it not being very popular at a BBQ joint), but also and perhaps more jarringly, they&#39;ve done away with side choices and combo platters. What was once an exceptionally modular menu allowing for any number of combinations, is now for better or (much) worse a very straight forward menu. Everything is pretty much set: no selecting sides, you get fries and coleslaw. You can still order sides for $3 a pop, which for the Green Chile Mac is tempting, but for all I know that&#39;s gone the same direction as the brisket and burnt ends (to clarify: down). 
I can understand how consolidating and streamlining the menu would make sense from a business perspective, however in combination with the blatant deterioration in quality, it makes for a completely undesirable (and almost unrecognizable) experience."

After living in Kansas City for 3 years and having a husband that has picked up a Big Green Egg smoker; I know I&#39;ve been spoiled when it comes to BBQ and smoked foods.  He surprised me with a little jaunt out to Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s in Wood Dale.  Let me repeat, I LOVE BBQ so this was a lovely surprise!

One can tell just by looking at the place from the outside that they are really going for the &#34;real&#34; essence of a BBQ joint; small, quaint, and sometimes in the&#34;middle of nowhere.&#34;

They have a pretty extensive menu with a sampling of BBQ styles from across the country (Texas-style, Kansas City-style, Carolina-style, etc.)  

My husband and I chose the 2 meat plate but the girl behind the counter suggested we go for the 3 meat plate so we would have enough food, so we did. We chose double burnt ends (nearly impossible to find anywhere other than KC unless  you make them yourself) and sliced brisket with beans on the side.

*** Burnt ends: These were pretty good; tender but a little fatty.  The fattiness can happen depending on the slab of meat so I didn&#39;t discount them for that. I&#39;d give the burnt ends 3 stars.

***** Brisket:  I thought the sliced brisket was delicious; tender and smoky just the way I like it!  It had the ever-important smoke ring and held a lot of the smoky flavor which my husband commented can be &#34;difficult to do.&#34;  I&#39;d give the brisket 5 stars (almost as good as my husband&#39;s).

** Baked Beans:  Although sides are not typically that imporant to me at all, I was spoiled in KC by beans with brisket chunks in them, and now I am forever disappointed by beans I get anywhere else that don&#39;t live up to the &#34;brisket beans.&#34;  Aside from that, these beans had some type of funky flavor and I am not quite sure where it was coming from.  I didn&#39;t like these at all but my husband ate them. 2 stars.

**** KC Sauce: My favorite sauce, by far, and probably by no surprise was the Kansas City Sauce (which of course they don&#39;t sell in stores as far as I know).  It has the right mix of spices, this sauce is not a sauce for  you if you like super sweet sauces.

Other Sauces:  While I did sample all of the sauces, I didn&#39;t care enough for any of the others to be able to review them fairly.  I stuck with the KC sauce since I liked it best.

****Service:  The only person we interacted with was the girl at the register (who also brought us our food).  She was very sweet and helpful and therefore I give the service 4 stars.  

Side note: I actually really liked the honey cornbread muffin served with the meal.

We will defintely be back here again and will likely order the sliced brisket."

Simply amazing BBQ.  The inside seating is on the small side so keep that in mind if you want to bring a group of people because you might have to wait for a seat or get your order to go.

From the menu my favorites are the pulled pork sandwich, the Chicken &amp; Andouille Sausage Gumbo (which can be spicy), baked beans, red beans and rice, rib tips, and of course their ribs, and their Texas brisket.  Wash it down with lemonade!  Yummy!  And no, that is not everything on their menu, I just like those the most.

While you are eating slowly, take your time to savor each of their BBQ sauces.  Find out why they have won so many awards.  You&#39;ll have a hard time picking a sauce that does not work with your meal.  Also if you need some reading material while you eat, feel free to borrow one of their BBQ books from the bookcase near the door.  Now I&#39;m the one who&#39;s telling everyone to try Sweet Baby Rays.  Easy to find, it&#39;s near the Wood Dale Metra Station."

This is the absolute best mac and cheese on the planet.  It has a slight kick, the pasta is always perfectly cooked, and it isn&#39;t overpowered by the cheese.  Doesn&#39;t get any better than this.

Oh yeah, they also do BBQ here.  Their BBQ shrimp is amazing.  It used to be absolutely amazing but then they stopped including the garlic bread so that knocks it down a notch.

The rib tips and St. Louis style ribs are really good.  You get a nice smokey flavoring.  The BBQ sauce doesn&#39;t over power the the ribs.  One thing I wish they would do is have different flavors of their sauce available for takeout like Famous Dave does.  My favorite is the chipotle sauce which you can get in the stores.

How Wood Dale differs from Elk Grove Vill:
*dining area is a lot smaller; probably a 1/4 the size
*slightly different menu; it does not have mashed potatoes!
*shorter hours
*staff not as friendly
*in our case, phone orders trump eat-in guests (see below)
*sizes of the sides are a joke; two fork-fulls and you&#39;ll be done
*no wait staff, ordering is like Culvers, order at the cashier and they&#39;ll bring your food to you
*ambiance of a fast-food restaurant

We were almost finished ordering when one worker tells the cashier:
You can add another side to their order - no cornbread is available.
-Why?
Someone just put in an order of 15
-So why don&#39;t you give us ours, since we&#39;re here, and let that phone order get the ones you&#39;re going to make us wait for?

Very good dry rub ribs, the way ribs should be done and eaten. Make sure you order sauce on the side or you will ruin that prized crust that took hours to make. Baby backs and St. Louis slabs are both very good. Beef brisket is very high quality too. Fries were crispy and had just enough magic dust to make them plain yet special.

(v.) past tense of sauce: means to be owned.

If this is indeed true then I guess I sauced Sweet Baby Rays pulled chicken sandwich (I also literally sauced it with some of that sweet yet spicy sauce that we all know and love).

The pulled chicken sandwich was pretty good, though I must admit it would have been a lot better if it were actually hot! I know it was near closing time but still, slap that meat on the grill...that sounds dirty.

The mac n cheese was green! ok, a hint of green. Why am I not giving this place one star? Because it was supposed to be green, it has green chile in it (so that makes it Chile Mac, ha! get it?). The side order of mac n cheese is tiny but it is actually enough given the size of the chicken sandwich. You also get a bag of BBQ chips, I would rather have a second tiny side though.

I plan to go back because if it&#39;s good lukewarm I can only imagine how tasty it will be hot. You&#39;ve been warned Ray! Do me proud next time!"

We already did Italian for the past two meals and needed a change.  Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s was right in the area and a pulled-pork sandwich was sounding really good!  My coworker said the the BBQ sauce by the company is pretty darn tasty, so it was settled, Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s it was!

Although I wanted to eat there, we couldn&#39;t really leave our site, so we ordered take out.  I ordered the pulled-pork sandwich with a side of beans.  My coworker ordered the boneless rib sandwich with a side order of slaw.

The pulled-pork sandwich was pretty good, but not the greatest that I ever had.  The BBQ sauce was good enough to make me lick my fingers afterward, but it wasn&#39;t good enough to make me eat my fingers.  Good thing too, or I wouldn&#39;t be typing up this review!  The beans on the other hand, were way too sweet.  Well, it was the sauce that was heavy on the sweet side.  It pretty much took over the flavor of the beans.  So sweet that it almost made me sick!  I ordered a pint and I barely stomached a quarter of it.  I placed it in the pantry&#39;s refrigerator hoping someone would finish it off.  I wonder who took it?  I feel bad for that guy...I hope he&#39;s not diabetic...whoops!

As for the boneless rib sandwich, my coworker looked shocked when she unwrapped it.  It wasn&#39;t what she was expecting at all.  It was a a McRib!  They serve a McRib sandwich!  If she wanted a McRib sandwich, she would&#39;ve gone to McDonald&#39;s!

Once again, I have fallen victim to bad beans..."

First the food: No complaints.  Very good BBQ and a fun assortment of sauces to try.  I still prefer Smoque a bit better, but this was still excellent.

Bad:

No soap in bathroom, so.... what are the employees using before they go back to the kitchen???  Manager was told, and still no soap 10 min later."

been there twice from outta state, both times it was awesome, the secong time i actually met the sweet baby ray, nice guy, spoke with me about some places in indiana where i am from and gave me free dessert, an awesome brownie, the banana creme pie is great too.

the bbq ribs are good, not great, but the pulled pork---best ever, and brisket is amazing, the sides are excellent as well.  having a plethera of sauces on the counter helps to determine what bbq u really like, try the corn maux chax and the jerk chicken is very good too. nice place inside, way better than famous daves..."

Since we had no idea where to go to eat we went here on a friends suggestion. We do use the SBR BBQ sauce at home so we figured what the heck.

We were pleasantly surprised by what we discovered. We shared the combo plate - BBQ ribs, chicken and pulled pork with cole slaw, baked beans and honey corn muffin. Everything was just delicious. Of course that sauce was the sauce which is quite tasty. But I was impressed by the quality of the meat very good not at all fatty. 

The sides were good, not spectacular but good accompaniments. The corn bread was outstanding, baked with honey on top, yummy.

The place is small so don&#39;t expect a big dining room, it was busy but not packed so we were comfortable. The staff was extremely attentive and checked on us several times even though this is a place where you walk up the the counter and order. 

The extra bonus was that one of our friends cannot do gluten. She had checked with them prior to coming and they were able to accommodate her just fine. She had the ribs, cole slaw and baked beans. She enjoyed her meal as well. 

I would recommend SBR&#39;s to anyone who likes casual ribs &amp; chicken dining, the food is very good, the service great and the overall experience wonderful. We&#39;ll be back."

For starters, I wasn&#39;t even aware they owned restaurants... obviously they do, this one in Wood Dale and another in Elk Grove Village. I can&#39;t comment on their service or atmosphere since lunch was brought in for us, this is going solely on food... so if you like to rock the take-out or are thinking of hosting your next event with SBR&#39;s, listen up!! 

Trying to be a bit carb-conscious lately, I opted for their Mixed Green Salad and a Pulled Chicken Sandwich where I was going to ditch out on the bread and just feast on the bird. Unfortunately both were so skimpy I needed the bread just to get full. My salad was comprised of a handful of greens, a few small tomatoes and carrot shavings. I shouldn&#39;t have expected much more but the portion was really ridiculous. My sandwich didn&#39;t fare much better, it looked huge and juicy at first glance, but after ditching the bun I realized there was only a few ounces of chicken, mostly dark meat and not nearly enough to even satisfy a toddler. Get back here you cast-off bun!! We all shared a few sides of onion strings which were tasty, crunchy and had a nice spice to them. I&#39;m sure I overcompensated my lack of chicken by abundance in strings.  

Overall I was a bit underwhelmed and was longing for my Whole Foods Salad Bar. SBR&#39;s get an extra bump in star because they were nice enough to comp us a few bottles of their famous BBQ sauce (one of which promptly went in my purse) - I truly love their sweet and tangy sauce on everything I grill at home so this will definitely go to good use!"

I had a side of pork ribs (a bit tough), slaw (good), and the green chile macaroni (awesome).

My wife had the pulled chicken (a bit dry), and she enjoyed the slaw as well.

Overall, the meal seemed a bit pricey for the portion sizes.

We didnt&#39; have enough people in attendance to meet the 20 person min for catering, but they bent the rules a bit saying they&#39;d rather earn business than push it away!

We ordered a combo that came with bbq chicken (very moist), brisket (seasoned quite well), bread, two sides (yummy yummy beans , don&#39;t miss these beans!, &amp; potatoes), salad, drinks and more.  They were quite affordable, and even allowed me to tweak the order before hand in order to keep it on a budget.

Everyone was more than happy with the food and we are very excited to order again this month.  Their catering menu has more than just BBQ too, so check it out!

Ambiance - they brought plates and silverware and of course - wetnaps!!
Service - the reps were great and easy to work with, and the delivery was right on time
Food Quality - the food was piping hot and delcious

Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s is best known for its BBQ sauce but luckily for us they opened a restaurant!  I have always visited the original in Wood Dale which is VERY small (but very accommodating) but they just recently opened their new location in Elk Grove on East Higgins Road.

They have nightly dinner specials that you can eat there or take to go however I really, truly go for the pulled pork and Chef Paul&#39;s Corn Maque Choux-Kicked up creamed corn.  Their Green Chile Mac N&#39; Cheese is also to die for.  I highly recommend their sides and the ribs and crab cakes are fabulous too.

This past year Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s catered a two day event for the winery I work at and we had the absolute pleasure to get to know the &#39;guys&#39; of SBR&#39;s.  Chef Elton and Duce are spectacular and really make the best pulled pork and brisket you can ever imagine.

It&#39;s related to the other Sweet Baby Rays restaurant in name only - THIS is the one you want to go to.  It&#39;s a small house/shack and they have daily specialties, special sauces you can&#39;t buy/try anywhere else, the staff is always friendly - plus you have a decent chance of running into the real Sweet Baby Ray here.  The food is pretty good around - the Deuce sandwich is a favorite because it has wood smoked bologna on a pulled pork sandwich.  Sweet potato fries are good, and all of the meats are above average (nothing is the best I&#39;ve ever had, but it&#39;s all really good).  What I really like are the specials (for most holidays they have special menus, and there&#39;s things like a Cuban sandwich on the menu), the fact that the BBQ is done on small scale, by friendly people, with some experimentation - not this giant one-size fits all menu carved in stone Famous Daves abomination we&#39;ve taken for granted in Chicagoland."

If you like Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s barbecue sauce or barbecued meat or meat in general, you should go here.  It&#39;s comfort food at its best with barbecue sandwiches slathered with sauce, tasty rib tips, amazing shrimp and good sides, too! It&#39;s hard to find a good shrimp po&#39; boy outside of New Orleans but they do a pretty a good job at Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s.  My favorites thus far are the aforementioned po&#39; boy, crab cakes, pulled pork sandwiches, jerk chicken, rib tips, and grilled shrimp.  Droooool.

Service was pretty good, and pretty fast.  I had a coupon from the website,  on my phone, and the lady at the counter kind of gave me a hard time about using it, but she did take it. 

I ordered two hot dogs, the kids had a pizza burger, and a regular hamburger.   The total bill was $16,whixh in my opinion is a little high considering the quality of the food.  I could go to portillos, and get about the same price, and get better quality food. 

The hot dogs were not Vienna beef, and the buns seem to be the cheapest buns you can find in the grocery store.  (in fact they seemed a little stale). 
The French fries were just Ok. 

I am also not a fan or places where you can&#39;t just get your own refills, and that you have to ask the staff to fill it for you. 

Overall, it&#39;s a pretty kid friendly place, good if you need a fix quick, but as far as food quality and price.,  I am not sure I would endorse it."

On an extreme positive note, the good was really good.  My wife and I split a Francheesie and a Gyros.  If you have never had a Francheesie, then you should definitely check it out.  They stuff a hot dog with with cheese, wrap it with bacon, and then deep fry.  It was very juicy and had a great flavor.  They even include fries with it too.  That&#39;s a great deal for under $5.  The gyros was pretty good as well.  It wasn&#39;t the best I have ever had, but it is right behind that top one.  It was flavorful and wasn&#39;t dry at all.

Our kids each had a kid&#39;s meal from the menu.  It&#39;s always nice to see them getting some special attention with their own meals at place like this.  Our son had the corn dog meal and our daughter had the hot dog meal.  Both of them enjoyed their meals as well.  Mr. C&#39;s even includes milk as an option for their meals and that&#39;s awesome.  Quite a few places will charge you or make you buy it separately.  

We will definitely go back at some point to try out the Italian Beef and the Mr C&#39;s Gyros Burger as well as some of the other items on the menu.  If you&#39;re near there, I recommend checking it out!"

I had the polish sausage and my son had the kids corn dog meal and we spent less than $9!  The fries are awesome, not too greasy and come with a hot dog or sausage which is great.  My sister tried the hot dog meal and liked it but I am sure she will write her own review.

I WAS NOT at all rude when I ordered my food but the woman who took my order felt the need to huff and puff while taking my order. My fiance and I both worked 10hr days and the last thing we want is attitude when we order our gyro fries how we like them. I will always order my food how I like,  it it&#39;s our food and were paying for it , I want it how I ask for it. This older woman with blonde and grey hair was had a snippy attitude.

We ordered:
Side salad
turkey burger (added fries and drink)
2 Slaw Dogs (these come with fries)
2 Regular Hot dogs (these come with fries, too)

So four hot dogs, enough fries to feed an army, a burger, a salad, and a drink all for $20?!  SCORE!!!

OK, moving on.  The staff is really nice, efficient, and funny.  They were laughing at me when I had to stare at the menu for a good ten minutes trying to decide since everything looked really good!

As for the actual food, it was really good.  My salad was just iceburg lettuce and tomato.  Nothing special.  But my turkey burger was REALLY yummy!  It wasn&#39;t just a previously frozen patty, it was fresh and well-seasoned.  The bun was really good, too.

And everyone is right about the fries--they are really good.  Nice and crispy on the outside and hot on the inside.  Perfect!

They have 99 cent hot dogs on Tuesdays, which is a steal. They are Vienna Beef hot dogs and are really good.

I never really understood the appeal of these places when I was in the city, but it&#39;s because of their rarity in the suburbs, and because of how difficult it is to get the hot dog right that makes this kind of food popular: that and the Vienna Beef products they use. There&#39;s a nice snap to the dog when you bite into it. The fries are crispy outside and creamy inside. I think it&#39;s almost up there with Poochie&#39;s in Skokie."

Last year they built a new strip mall in Elgin and I saw they were putting in a hot dog joint.  I am always looking for a good dog in the area.  I went in for a hot dog, but when I saw they had a &#34;ripper&#34; dog on the menu I had to give it a try.  Now the regular dog was ok.  They bun was poppy seedless and the dog was lost under all of the toppings.  The hotdog was the size of my pinky.  They also skimp on the pickle.  It is not the wedge that I would like, it was a thin shaved pickle thrown on top.  They throw a handful of fries on top of the dog, but they were a plain frozen fry and not that great.  I had high hopes for the &#34;ripper&#34; dog.  It was a jumbo dog that was deep fried.  Now what I understand a &#34;ripper&#34; dog is thrown in the fryer and sits there until it &#34;rips&#34; open.  This was sliced with a knife and warmed in the oil.  I would have loved to see some color put onto the dog but really it was just a warm hotdog.  
When I was a kid there were hot dog places everywhere.  Now an independent hot dog joint is a rarity and it breaks my heart when they are not good.  I wish this place had great hot dogs and fries, but sadly it does not stand out."

The place is attached to a gas station, but has it&#39;s own entrance also.  It has a few tables between the entrance and the gas station shopping side.  I walked up to the counter to see the menu and order.  There was no own around and after a minute or 2 wait, i walk back to the gas station where I had seen somebody wiping down a table when I walked in.  This person was gone, so I returned to the counter and called out.  3 workers in there late teens to early 20&#39;s appeared from the back.  

I ordered a BBQ/bacon burger and got is with the fries and drink to go.  I was asked how I wanted the burger cooked and replied medium rare.  The one female working began by putting a bun one the grill top and then put a burger patty on too.  She took the bun off after it had grill marks and put it on the work area.  She let the burger sit on the grill and the grease from it caused the fire to rise up and engulf the burger.  After watching this for a minute or so, I complained saying I wanted the burger medium rare not burned on the outside.  The guy who took my order stepped in and said it was to get grill mark on the burger.  Okay, that I don&#39;t mind, but check out the pictures to see if that was what I got (sorry can&#39;t find how to upload the photos I took of the meal).  He removed the burger from the grill and then steamed it on the flat top with water and a cover.  

The female cooked the fries and the onion ring for the burger.  When she finished and was packing up the fries, she dropped a 1/3rd of them on the floor.  She didn&#39;t even flinch or offer to cook more, just put what was left in the bag.  With the burger and fries in the bag, she put them on the counter and said here is your stuff.  I said it wasn&#39;t done.  The guy then said, it is your order.  I said it is missing my drink.  The female walked over to the fountain without asking what flavor I wanted.  She finally turned around to ask and I said Coke but no ice please.  She immediately picks up the ice scoop and puts ice in the glass.  I repeated my request and finally got it the way I ordered it.  

I took the burger home to eat.  The burger was cooked well on the outside (burned by the fire) and brown not pink on the inside.  It was a decent portion, but was not very good.  The onion ring was hard and crispy and the fries were good but missing the rest on the floor of the restaurant.  

The customer service experience was horrible.  Nobody out front when I arrived.  Not paying attention to the food cooking or listening to the order.  A 4th person arrived and appeared to be the manger/owner&#39;s son.  While he joked with the staff, he was counting the money in the register.  He ignored the exchanges by the workers with me and no one apologized for the delay or quality of the food."

The burgers are made fresh and I highly suggest you call to order ahead and make sure they are open. The classic cheeseburger with jalepenos well done was delicious. Burgers are really thick, pickle slices on bottom, topped with cheese, tomato, and onion. Fries are pretty delicious!

I am shaking from the extremely aggressive and nasty phone call I received from a woman, who later I learned was the owner&#39;s wife! 

I work at a local elementary school and ordered some lunch for myself and some co-workers. My school gives Marinos about 1/7 of their lunch business. Correction, used to give. 

The delivery man created a scene in the office of the school because I was not waiting in the office upon his arrival, which was 20 minutes earlier than I was told. He then decided to leave and return to collect the tip he demanded. Let me be clear that I always have and always will tip. I had every intention of tipping and had the cash on my desk ready to go. I then went to the office, left him his tip, signed receipt, and a note apologizing for any confusion and explaining that they were early. 

During lunch I received a phone call from Marino&#39;s. This phone call was so extremely, disgustingly, rude that I could honestly not believe it was happening. It was from the owner&#39;s wife berating me for making the delivery man return. Now, I did not MAKE the delivery man return. We paid for our meal and if he was on such a strict schedule and was so concerned about his tip, the rational thing to do would have been to have Marinos call me and ask if I wanted to add the tip to the charge. She was speaking to me in the most demeaning and condescending way. She was not letting me speak and calling me &#34;sweetie&#34; and &#34;honey&#34; to make me feel belittled. At the end of the, I would say conversation but it was in reality an attack, she said, &#34;Are you ok? Good. Bye!&#34; I have never experienced this from any professional place of business and I am sick to my stomach that I contributed to this establishment.

I was willing to overlook a teen answering their phones and not knowing how to handle customer service, so I called them back a few hours later to let them know that a worker had called and treated an innocent paying customer with horrific disrespect. That was when I found out that, no, it wasn&#39;t just a young worker, it was the owner! And, there was no apology given by her or the manager that I was speaking with.

Let me restate that in no way was I in the wrong. However, even if I was. If I had somehow messed up the entire lunch delivery schedule or if I did not tip the delivery man, there was NO EXCUSE OR REASON for the ATTACK on a customer by the OWNER of this despicable restaurant. 

...and by the way, the penne alla vodka was vile."

We kind of just looked around how this place operates and we sort of thought that we had to go up to the front to order our food which was fine with us. The place wasn&#39;t busy at 4-5pm in the afternoon.
We ordered calamari (substantial size and not a lot of breading which we loved), stuffed mushroom (we had to return it since the mushrooms were cold when we bit into into it and which they replaced quickly), shrimp diavolo, pasta alfredo and my son, of all places, ordered a hamburger (which was humongous and he liked).

First time, I ordered their thin crust pizza and felt it was decent and O.K., but not impressed enough to want to order pizza here again... (see first review for more info).

A week or so ago I tried the baked caprese panzerotti and &#39;homemade&#39; gnocchi in vodka sauce.  I heard the gnocchi was very good, so decided why not? I craved a little pasta anyway.   I was told there was an hour wait when I called, but order arrived in 30 minutes!  Excellent!  Was very happy and appreciated the unexpected &#39;fast service&#39;.

Gnocchi came w/ piece of fresh, crusty bread and extra parmesan cheese. Portion was enough for two.   As excited as I was to try this, I was really disappointed - the gnocchi was very &#39;dense&#39;, starchy, and the more I ate, the heavier it felt in my tummy.    It was not in the least &#39;light&#39; or &#39;soft and slightly tender&#39;...but quite the opposite.  The vodka sauce was tasty.   Being Italian and having tasted many gnocchi dishes, I was hoping for a much lighter texture.  Would I order this again?  NO.  After a few bites, the rest went home with a friend as did the side order of meatballs.  After a quick taste, I wondered if they had be &#39;sitting around&#39; for awhile, and something was off-putting in &#39;flavor&#39;..not sure if it was the ground meat, or the seasoning.  On the bland side as well.

The baked panzerotti (caprese - fresh mozzarella, fresh plum tomatoes &amp; fresh basil) was actually VERY GOOD compared to other Italian/American restaurants I&#39;ve tried offering &#39;non-traditional&#39; panzerotti&#39;s.  Dough had a slightly charred exterior, texture was light &amp; tender, cooked perfectly.  The size was close to authentic &amp; not the size of a football!  The filling was pretty delicious.  All ingredients married perfectly without being overpowering.  Perfect amount of fresh basil, fresh plum tomato &amp; ooey gooey mozzarella without the saltiness.  Simple, fresh ingredients is the key here.  I would TOTALLY order this again....  

4 stars for super fast delivery when I was told 1 hour, and for a simply delicious caprese panzerotti, that didn&#39;t make me feel like a Heffer after eating it all in one sitting!"

Please hire some cashiers that know what they&#39;re doing. And please please please get food runners (also known as table stalkers) that speak English- even a little bit. Sound racist? Well, when they can&#39;t understand what you&#39;re asking them, that&#39;s a problem. I speak Spanish- but I refuse to be forced to use it when I shouldn&#39;t need to. 

While you&#39;re at it, the manager could use some personality lessons. Big time. 

Ordered two &#34;baked&#34; meals. Ravioli and chicken Parmesan. Neither are &#34;baked&#34;. They&#39;re heated. Placed on a cold plate. Cheese added. And maybe walked past the oven on the way to your table. 

It&#39;s customary in Italy to have salad after dinner. It is NOT acceptable to bring soup that someone orders in the MIDDLE of the meal after I already reminded you that you forgot to bring it at all when the entrées arrived. 

So there it sat... Getting cold since I&#39;d rather watch soup get cold than spoil the entree, too. 

When I told the cashier about the issue at the end of the meal, in earshot of the manager- she said, &#34;oh, no problem!&#34;  I replied, &#34;actually, it was a problem&#34;. And she looked confused. 

Tried this place once before, and it was mediocre then. And this experience killed it. 

Too many good Italian choices around town. Won&#39;t be back here. Ever."

We got the Shrimp Capellini pasta and the Penne pasta with sausage and peas. Both were fantastic and portions were large. The Shrimp pasta had a generous amount of jumbo shrimp in there - around 10 pieces or so. 

Service was good. Prices are on the lower side - both the entrees were under 13$. Overall, must go place!"

I&#39;ve ordered it twice thinking it was cooked wrong 1st time. The pasta was cold &amp; the cheese wasnt melted. I knew you cant &#39;bake&#39; in 10min so I knew something was up. $10 calamari is a joke. They barely give you any. Try Jameson&#39;s calamari for $10 &amp; you&#39;ll know why this place isnt good. The fried chicken is burnt chicken. Like biting into concrete. The host guy says he&#39;s Italian but he&#39;s not.

And I&#39;ll yelp it where ever I go just to find it. My traveling companions know my love of wood fired pizza and share it for sure. And have enjoyed pizza here before. I couldn&#39;t wait to try it. I was not disappointed. 

First - what cool decor! Not your typical red and white and green pizza place. Big comfy tables. My only complaint was the single dude eating at one and my inability to want to share the table with him. If you are single don&#39;t eat at the big table alone and give off the don&#39;t bug me vibe this guy was giving off. 

Next, menu amazeballs! Pizza you design. Pizza they design. Don&#39;t want pizza - they got you covered. I didn&#39;t think about not eating pizza though because the aroma of a wood fired oven was killing it the moment we crossed the threshold. Not wait - make that the parking lot. 

I did try the Caesar salad. Super good. I would have liked it better had the crispy cool romaine been tossed in the dressing. The croutons were great. The cheese bread was great. And the salad came with a side loaf of little breads. 

But the pizza!! We went simple and had mozz and pepperoni. The sauce was just the right amount of sweet and spice. The cheese had that fresh mozzarella salty creamy zing that only big cities with great Italian heritage seem to have. The crust was crispy and didn&#39;t sag under the weight of the toppings which were tie perfect proportions. This isn&#39;t dominos or papa johns people. This is how Italy Italians eat it. And if you miss that you are missing the big deal of this pizza. It&#39;s Napolitano pizza done well. 

They have beer and wine. And it is a great place for a date or a girls night out or a family dinner. 

My only complaint was the lack of table service. Order at the counter and they bring it out. And maybe it would be nice to be able to sit and watch my pizza being made like at my fav St. Louis pizza - tivoli. But, pizza isn&#39;t just my favorite thing in the world - it&#39;s is my most favorite thing to share with people. Visit this place and share the love! Eating in is my preference!"

I wanted to try something new and headed east down Irving Park Road from Itasca. Just east of Wood Dale Road on the south side of the street, I found Marino&#39;s. There was plenty of parking and the restaurant was pretty busy when I walked in. I took this as a good sign.

I was looking over the menu and getting ready to order at the counter when a woman walked up. I let her know that it was my first visit and that I was trying to decide on their tastiest menu item. We didn&#39;t get very far in the conversation at all. I ended up trying their chicken Parmesan sandwich with the sauce on the side, an order of French fries, a drink and a slice of tiramisu for another time aka breakfast today. My lunch with dessert was almost $17. I don&#39;t think I made the most frugal choices here. 

I filled my glass and tried to figure out where to wait. This was awkward. So I wandered to a doorway that had the words &#39;Carry Out&#39; over it. I met a gentleman who was most likely an owner/manager. He was very nice, made some conversation when he learned that I was a first timer and pointed me in the right direction to wait. There really isn&#39;t a waiting area. It&#39;s more like standing in the foyer in everyone&#39;s way. I felt weird, but whatever. 

I ordered the cheese on my sandwich well done, so it took a few more minutes and when I left, the car smelled great all the way back to the office. Plus, they packed the tiramisu in a separate bag. Into the fridge that went and it was lunch time!

The sandwich was quite large. That was a nice surprise. There was no way for me to finish it. The cheese was well done just like I requested. The chicken was meh. I can&#39;t see how it was a freshly breaded piece of chicken. It was more like a frozen and then deep fried chicken breast. I didn&#39;t love that at all. The fries were a waste of money. I tried one. It was undercooked and those ended up in the trash. 

Breakfast. Today, during a webinar in the comfort of my office with the door closed, I hid with my piece of tiramisu. This was the saving grace!  That and the kind gentleman at the Carryout window. This tiramisu was light and delicious. The cream wasn&#39;t overly sweet. It was the perfect indulgence!  

I&#39;ll try again. And I&#39;ll order the chopped salad because that seems to be the &#39;it&#39; thing to do here. I&#39;ll also order in advance, include a slice of tiramisu and go right to the Carryout window."

I&#39;m a reviewer and behavioral analyst and international social worker traveling to over 50 countries. Why do I say this? 
I know food, restaurants, and people 

1. Nice cashiers
2. Weird Italian lady training laughing and giving dirty looks-strange 
3. Pizza fantastic worth going there for that and calling it a happy satisfied night 
4. Skip the salads. I watched a few that came out with white lettuce &#34;romaine&#34; but no green ie waste of money and no nutritional value
I really felt like a salad and ordered a Caesar one what a disappointment. Smallest salad I&#39;ve seen for $7 and filled with about 20 croutons and 20 pieces of lettuce all wedges and practically no green. 

Would have returned it if alone. Should I have said something? Yes 
Should have been recommended a mixed green salad but the manager just wanted me out of the way and moved on. Throwing crap My direction bad idea.

That salad was horrible and worth whatever it cost for a bag of croutons um $2 ..
And dressing was sloppily thrown on top of the pile of croutons- mix it 

For an area called Wood dale that looks deserted -this is a good choice . Beautiful comfortable inside with nice customers and very hard working man bussing the tables.
It&#39;s  a nice presentation in the front and menu. 

Unfortunately, my Uncle who lives in Itasca will not be back as i gave my opinion and wasted $7 On A Salad That Went Directly into the garbage. I think I will do fine with pizza on my business trip to NYC next week.

Mangia mangia!

When you walk in, they have their daily specials showing behind a glass display from salads, to pastas, to soups...and don&#39;t forget their pizzas and sandwiches plus desserts.  As you walk pass the display it gives you time to decide what you want to eat...hum I&#39;ll take one of each, lol!
When you go there during lunchtime, I&#39;ve seen the line out the door and it gets pretty packed.  You go through a line, place your order then find a seat in their dining area.  They recently expanded their place next door into an area to have bigger private parties.  They also service beer and wine here and a couple of bottles of a little &#34;stronger&#34; spirits but not a full bar.  Don&#39;t ask for a shot of tequila here lol!
During dinner time, it&#39;s not so heck it.  But you get seated by the host with a menu then you go up to the counter and place your order...I&#39;d rather place my order and find a seat but whatever I&#39;ma hungry!
They have flat screen TVs and in the back ground you can hear Italian music.  They décor is dark tables and chairs with curtain windows, the tables/spaces are kind of snug so if personal space is an issue for you, you might want to go outside al fresca during the warmer months
For side orders, I like their breaded zucchini, cauliflower, mushrooms.  My all time fav is their lightly fried calamari that comes in  1/2 lb to a 1lb on top of shredded romaine lettuce.  You can literally have this as a meal with fresh lemon wedges and their sweet marina sauce on the side.  The pieces are huge including the tentacles, love the tentacles!
For Soups, I like their minestrone, cream of mushrooms, cream of broccoli, chicken noodles, and...aw heck all their soups are delicious.  You don&#39;t get a huge bowl, just enough for a person who is also eating it with their freshly baked warm bread (good for a lunch meal).  
Their salads are fresh and made to order.  I like them all!  Especially their chicken chopped, Mela, and a side of mariano&#39;s garden.  And you got to try their house balsamic vinaigrette, sweet and tangy yum!  
For their pizza, I liked their Margherita, Mariano&#39;s Special, La Romana, BBQ Chicken, and Hawaiian Pizzas.  I was lucky enough that I tried these specialties from my company ordering lunch for my team during work projects, thanks so much nom nom!  They also sell their dough by the pound if you want to make your own pizza at home
For pasta dishes: Spaghetti with meat sauce plus pay extra for 2 huge meatballs on the side.  So much pasta food you can take  1/2 of it home!  Penne with spicy sausage with Vodka cream sauce in a bowl.  I also heard their fettuccine pesto with grilled chicken was creamy and tasty
For sandwiches: Sesame toasted meatball sandwich topped with melted mozzarella cheese sooo good!
Their house dinners comes with a side of pasta of your choice and includes a Soup or Salad:  Hubby and I would order the following...Eggplant Parmigiana, sliced medium thin battered friend topped with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella cheese with a side of angel hair pasta.  Veal Parmigiana crispy on the outside, soft and tender meat.  Chicken Masala with potato so rich and creamy, Chicken Limón (if you love that lemon taste you got to order this one soooo lemony)!  
The prices are about $10 bucks a meal, some come with soup or salad.  Did I mention that you will always get served fresh warm baked dense bread, it&#39;s filling for sure.  I usually eat mine with olive oil and parmesan cheese that&#39;s on each table and yes they have butter too.  I don&#39;t care much that they are so close to the railroad tracks so it does get noisy when you do al fresco.  
Overall, great food I&#39;ll be back and continue supporting our local restaurants."

My husband ordered a chicken caesar salad plus extra chicken. We&#39;ve ordered it this way innumerable times without a single problem. Tonight we get our delivery and his salad is correct except that there are small, thin, and very few pieces of chicken. This has never happened before so we call to see if we can get a credit or somehow get more chicken for his salad (since we paid for it after all) and the manager proceeded to argue with us and defend his salad. He didn&#39;t offer any consolation so my husband told him we&#39;ll never order their chicken caesar again since we couldn&#39;t get &#34;extra chicken&#34; even if we order and pay for it. 

  we&#39;ve ordered up to 4 of these salads at a time from here the exact same way and always had plenty of chicken and their food has always been tasty and fresh. They really need to work on their customer service. ..."

What a selection!  Each and every item is made by hand and fresh daily which was obvious when we tasted our chopped  salad (that we had to order as it was recommended by everyone).  Sara suggested their homemade balsamic dressing which was wonderful and I highly recommend.  Next came our Margherita pizza.  Sara suggested added sausage which I loved.  We had the 14&#34; which after the salad proved enough  for me and my husband to take home for dinner.

Located on Itasca Road near the Metra train tracks, it has a lot to offer.

Marino&#39;s isn&#39;t your conventional Italian Restaurant. Service wise, there&#39;s no wait staff. Instead you order your food at the front, take a number, and get seated while waiting for your food. There&#39;s a silverware and drink dispenser on the side that offers free refills as well. The front counter has a massive display, showcasing all the various, appetizing desserts, gelato, pizza&#39;s, panini&#39;s, liquor, and more.

Tonight, we were seated in the Private Party Room Area, which was very spacious. There&#39;s several wall flat screen TV&#39;s, a large Italian Cafe themed wall, and a unisex bathroom near the back. 

The staff here are very friendly and extremely knowledgable about the menu. The food also didn&#39;t take long to come out at all, especially given that it was a busy Friday night. I had the Chicken Parmesan dinner with cream of chicken with rice soup, and for dessert the Turtle Cheesecake. They were all well beyond my expectations.  

Overall, for being my first time at Marino&#39;s it most definitely won&#39;t be my last. Definitely recommended! Buon appetito!"

The food arrived in about 45 minutes. The delivery boy was clean cut and polite.

The pizza appeared to be oven baked and was excellent. The crust was thin and with a great texture. The toppings were generous. 

The wings were average. The container the wings came in appeared to have a lot of grease in the bottom. I ordered a five piece BBQ and a 5 piece buffalo wing because they wouldn&#39;t split their 15 wings package with two sauces. Quite frankly, their refusal to split up the wings was a blessing as we only ate about 4/10 wings between three of us. 

We will definitely eat their pizza again the next time we are in Wood Dale. However we will probably order the garlic cheese bread instead of the wings."

Not a good start.  I&#39;m sure they would have sent a new pizza but who has time to mess with that?  Not me.

I was able to salvage most of the pizza, which was not very good.  Green peppers and onions were way overloaded and were poor quality.  The green peppers were especially bad, with the orange-pink tint that peppers can get if they are left out.

It&#39;s not amazing but the pasta is good and the service is reliable. They&#39;ve also got outdoor seating - a plus in my book. There&#39;s a ton to choose from so it will please your random group of co-workers...

Here are some items I&#39;ve enjoyed: 

- Chopped Salad. I get this almost every time. Not amazing but a good go-to.

- Meatball sub

- Cheese ravioli with meat sauce

- Love me some bread and oil! Who doesn&#39;t?


The eh:

- The pizza is as bit bland. I&#39;d skip it, even though you can get it by the slice.

- Caprese sandwich left something to be desired.

- I&#39;ve had some really good vodka sauce in my day and wasn&#39;t impressed with theirs, which was a bummer. 


Friendly people, quick service. Enjoy!"

I arrived during dinner time and ordered the Giambotta. Giambotta is a combination of sliced Italian Sausage, chicken, green/red/yellow peppers, onions and those yummy potatoe wedges all swimming in this heavenly vesuvio sauce. The Giambotta was amazing as usual. In fact, every meal I have ever had at Marino&#39;s has been amazing.

My one son wolfed down his Spaghetti with meat sauce (my wife ordered the same and had lots of leftovers). This is no easy task since the portion is Ginormous. My other son demolished the Chicken Parmasean dinner. Our total tab with a couple of sodas thrown in was about $41.

I even bumped into my sister at Marino&#39;s since she has now become a regular to the tune of twice a week."

Because of how delicious their food is the place does get quite packed during the lunch hour...but I&#39;ve come for an early dinner (around 5 p.m. on a weeknight) and it wasn&#39;t busy at all.  They really know how to package their to-go orders well, too, so I often order ahead &amp; take out for lunch or snag on my way home to bring back to the Hubs &amp; I for dinner.

One thing my area for work (Elmhurst/Bensenville/Wood Dale) does not lack is Italian deli&#39;s... you&#39;ve got Avanti&#39;s, Asti, and now Marino&#39;s. I eat lunch at Avanti&#39;s and Asti frequently and will now add Marino&#39;s to the list. Great atmosphere and nice staff! 

I see a lot of complaints about overpriced food, but my co workers all got their Italian Beef ($5.75) and Italian Subs ($5.50) and I did not hear any complaints. Subs for under $6? Hard to beat. Only downside is the subs don&#39;t come with a side so if you want fries or garlic bread then it&#39;s additional. 

I got the Capellini Shrimp Diavolo (Angel Hair Pasta, Shrimp in Hot Spicy Tomato Sauce). This had potential to be really good.... but my pasta was overcooked! I&#39;m not Mario Batalli but I know al dente pasta from soft/mushy pasta and that is definitely what I had. Too bad... the sauce had a good kick to it and the shrimp was not top quality jumbo shrimp but better than average. I would give this another try and hope that my pasta was cooked properly. At $11.95, their pastas are a little steep in price but the portions are LARGE. I rarely can&#39;t finish a dish and I have leftovers today. 

Their salads looked absolutely huge. I am extremely opposed to eating salads as meals otherwise because I am not a woman. However,  I may have considered one of these.

Of all the deli&#39;s, I would go to either Avanti&#39;s or Asti (down the street from Marino&#39;s) for sandwiches, but Marino&#39;s for pasta (although at a higher price). Overall though, nice Italian spot that I would highly recommend but lost a star for the overcooked pasta. Will update upon further review."

Parking was easy with a large parking lot. Marinos has a nice atmosphere with an open kitchen and adequate seating. The restaurant was also very clean. The menu has good variety of Italian favorites at reasonable prices. We ordered the lentil soup, pizza, and lasagna. Wam bread was served prior to receiving our orders. While not particularly flavorful, the bread was good and crusty on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. Olive oil and Parmesan cheese was readily available on the table. My veggie pizza was very good with the crust prepared as I requested. The lasagna was a generous portion and the chef was not skimpy on the amount of pasta sauce as I find in so many other restaurants. I was told by two people in my party the lentil soup was also very good. The staff was helpful and courteous. The only thing I would improve in the place is CHANGE THE MUSIC! Rather than hard rock blaring above our heads, why do they not have some music more conducive to an Italian bistro? Something like Sergio Franchi, Pavarotti, Sergio Endrigo, even Dean Martin. Heavy metal screaming is NOT suited at all to a romantic dinner with gelato and expresso afterwards."

Had the Italian Focaccia sandwich for lunch there today...awesome. First off it&#39;s HUGE, has crispy edges and a moist delicious center (thanks to the tomato on the focaccia bread and the Italian salad dressing) I was starving and I could only finish half. 

In the past I&#39;ve tried many of their pastas, their chicken pesto sandwich, the calamari and their pizza...all tasted fresh and delicious. 

Prices can be a bit high on a few items...but overall a very worthwhile trip."

Mela Salad - apples, walnuts, cranberries, creamy vinaigrette, and field greens. This is definitely one of my favorites. It&#39;s light, refreshing, and filling!

Vodka sauce chicken pasta - It&#39;s pretty good, but there is no way I can finish any of their pastas. I can put it away but the serving is huge! This can be a good thing if you are really hungry or want to save some for later.

Chicken Noodle Soup - I usually order this for an app since it&#39;s light and pretty flavorful. There is way too much potato in it and I would rather more of other veggies.

Meatballs - I order this on the side with some marinara. Delicious meatballs with lots of flavor and not dry at all.

Pizza - Not amazing, not horrible. If you are craving some I would order it. The slices are pretty big and I would think a side salad/soup and 1 slice should be enough.

it is something between  a fast food place and a sit down restaurant. 

Good

1. Vodka pasta is my favourite and my favourite salad is the Sicilian (it doesn&#39;t look appetizing but tastes great). 
2. The people are really friendly 
3. The service is fast (when they bring out your food) 
4. They have a good menu 
5. The prices are pretty good for what you get there are always leftovers to take home

Watchouts

1. You order your food at the front area then they bring your food to you. I am just not a fan of this type of place. 
2. Skip the sandwiches and skip the pizza...they are just ok (they are not bad but I think their pasta is what they are best for).
3. Many times the tables look dirty? And not when the place is busy. 
4. Some of the seating areas are crowded and sometimes you feel like you are on top of one another. 2 times we were seated right next to the take out window and I kept on getting bumped around.  Move the table or move where people pick up their pizzas!

marinos-pizza-wood-dale,Anna R.,Aal_s6-zgGHyKw5V7YRMQQ,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,69,kXMtKtOmfu5Q_1c-biRNBA,1.0,2014-01-27,"Let me preface this by saying that I have ordered numerous times from Marino&#39;s.  The food is good, they deliver and it&#39;s not terribly expensive.  I myself have catered from them at least a dozen times, and have referred them to at least 3 other families that have catered from them.

Yesterday I had catered Package #2 for 25 people.  I actually had to serve 22 people, but wanted a little extra.  The package would include 1 entrée, 1 pasta, 2 sides, 1 salad, and I added bread and butter.  The delivery came on time, and was hot.  However, as soon as I uncovered the tray of chicken I became worried.  There were 25 little pieces of chicken breast.  The size of the piece would be equivalent to 1/4 of a chicken breast.  That being said -- how can you expect a person to take one piece and make a meal out of it?  Literally two to three bites and it&#39;s gone.  

As a result, 8 of the 22 people did not have any chicken marsala at all.  There was enough pasta (penne vodka) and the two sides (vesuvio potatoes and green beans).  There was also an adequate amount of salad (mela salad).  But the embarrassment of not having enough chicken was mortifying.  Come on -- pasta, potatoes and beans are inexpensive meals....so I paid $280 for 25 people to eat pasta!!  I ended up ordering 3 family size pizzas from a local pizzeria, to try to supplement the meal.

I called Marino&#39;s and spoke with Dino (the Manager who I have ordered with all the previous times).  He went on to tell me that 25 pieces of chicken would have been enough since I ordered for 25 people.  I agreed -- 25 chicken breasts would have been enough - but not 25 pieces of 1/4 size of a chicken breast.  We should have be served 25 chicken breasts - or if cut the way served, then 100 pieces.  Dino&#39;s suggestion was to order an extra tray of chicken next time.  My question -- WHY?  Why didn&#39;t you serve enough in the first place?   Who charges $280 for 25 people to eat pasta and  a little chicken bite?

Dino offered to put a $20 credit on account tied to my phone number, to be used the next time I came in.  I told him that I would have been happier to have at least $60 credit to cover the 3 pizzas I had to order.  He refused -- I told him that he could forget about adding the credit on my account, as I won&#39;t be back.  Terrible, terrible, terrible service -- I was very displeased with the amount of food received, and more upset by the failed resolution.  

There are plenty of restaurants out there - try something else!"

I work in the Itasca area, and thought I would try something new because all of my friends at work and family have been raving about how good Marino&#39;s is. 

When I got there around 12, the place was packed! But the gentleman and woman at the counter kept the line moving quickly and there was plenty of seating available with a huge flat screen on the back wall with Champions League soccer on! 

The food was amazing. I got fortunately ordered too much! I got a chopped salad and a Penne Antonio (Because it is my name). The salad was huge, but phenomenal. The dressing, and the fresh lettuce was perfect. The pasta was even better, tasty, hot and tasted fresh and made to order. 

Growing up in a big italian family, I&#39;ve been around great tasting pasta my whole life, and this pasta was great competition for Nonna&#39;s pasta back home!

I highly recommend going to Marino&#39;s. I know I will be back again, will probably try the pizza next time since I&#39;ve heard so many great things about that as well.

I told her I&#39;d been referred by a friend, it was my first time ordering, and that the pizza was inedible, I was going to have  to throw it away, she said I bought it I could do whatever I wanted with it. I said to her, I&#39;m also a business owner and I would never let a new customer down like that, it wasn&#39;t good customer service, that&#39;s when she hung up on me. 
So now, I have an advertisement of theirs hanging near my workstation, that says DON&#39;T EVER GO TO THIS PLACE,  where I tell all my clients about it, I&#39;m a hairstylist. People talk about how great the food Is in this place, until you have a problem, no food is good enough to have to experience awful customer service from THE OWNER!!!!"

Everything on the menu is delicious and is a great place to go for a romantic dinner. Reminds me of the cafes in Rome. Nice Italian music in the background and a very polite and welcoming staff. It is always a joy coming here!

The food is good but it&#39;s hard to number down what you want and at the same time decipher what will or won&#39;t be good. I think the first time I went I got the tuna melt and I pretty much hated it but the next time I tried their pasta with vodka sauce and some yummy dessert and it was defo redeemed. Their salads are hu-mungo to the max. Defo a full meal for two people. It&#39;s a little pricier for a quick lunch but if it&#39;s one their pasta specialties or pizza it&#39;s totally worth it. 

My advice- skip the sandwiches and go with some carb-tastic pasta. It&#39;s worth it&#39;s weight in caloric intake."

I have never been for dinner, but for lunch, they are always consistently busy. I usually order their chopped salad (I believe it is the Marino&#39;s salad) that comes with romaine, pasta, blue cheese, bacon, onions, a very delicious freshly made vinaigrette and a piece of their homemade bread. I&#39;m telling you, the vinaigrette is the best salad dressing I have ever tasted, hands down, no if&#39;s ands or buts. 

Today I was slightly hungover and ordered the chopped salad with the half chicken foccocia sandwich and I was not disappointed. The sandwich was absolutely delicious and exactly what I needed! The sandwich was half of a round &#34;loaf&#34; of foccocia bread. I had tons of leftovers as the portions are large. 

I like Marino&#39;s because the people are always friendly and the food is consistently good! I like that their ingredients tend to be fresh and never from a can or bottle (ie: the vinaigrette) In my opinion, fresh ingredients is the sign of a restaurant that knows what they are doing!

Great place, I highly recommend it for lunch!"

I rarely write reviews .... I probably can say that this is my second review online lol. I do it only when I like something very much. I recently (about a couple of months ago) started working around this area. Tried a couple of places around and did not like any of them. When I found Marino&#39;s about 2 months ago I&#39;ve became their daily customer. They have most delicious soups with 2 choices daily to choose from (my fave soup is Friday and Monday special and when they have lentil soup) and most delicious panini. They also have some great entrees! 

And the stuff is awesome! 

As long as I work around this area I would never go anywhere else.

marinos-pizza-wood-dale,Don Z.,1dFC0YhcvFu1ibPVYTkEfA,"Bartlett, IL",0,1,1,63,7,FTmP0R4R86ZkWskQpNOWnA,4.0,2011-07-17,"I have been coming to Marino&#39;s for lunch occasionally over the past several years.  It is a tiny little place located in a strip mall.  The parking lot can be a little tight because of the way it is laid out, but I always find a spot.

Walking in you notice that the interior is dominated by the ordering counter and food prep area.  You walk up to the counter to order, then find a seat and they will bring your food to your table when it is ready.

The menu consists of a wide variety of Italian inspired food.  There is pasta, pizza, sandwiches and even some traditional American fare like fried chicken.  They serve a variety of soups with two different ones on each day.  Everything is listed on the wall behind the counter.  They also have a display of several of the items for you to peruse as you work your way through the line.

I have had a couple of pasta dishes and they are good with generous portions.  I typically get a sandwich and the chicken pesto is my favorite.  The creamy mozzarella and crispy/soft bread really make me happy.  The size is deceptive, as I am typically full after eating just the sandwich.  I used to order the sandwich and a bowl of soup, but I find that I cannot finish both.
The dessert options call out to me occasionally.    The carrot cake is delicious and a cannoli hits the spot too.

After you have ordered and paid at the counter, you work your way over to the next phase of the self serve aspect of this restaurant.  If you didn&#39;t order a fountain drink (which you must dispense yourself) or some other bottled beverage, they have several pitchers of ice water and cups for you to pour yourself.  This is what I do, because I like water.

Also be sure to pick up some utensils and napkins at this point.  I like that they have actual metal utensils available because I hate eating with plastic, which is also available.

There are not very many tables available.  Many of them only seat two people.  Due to the way the place is laid out, every table is in a high traffic area.  I always come before the traditional lunch time rush to avoid the worst.  In the summer there are tables outside as well, but I don&#39;t prefer to sit out there looking at the parking lot.

Once you have your table, I find it is helpful to display your receipt with the order number on it so that the guy delivering your food has an easier job.  Depending on how busy it is and what you ordered, the food is typically brought out pretty quickly.

I like that the condiment selection at each table includes olive oil and Parmesan cheese which I like to use with my bread.

One odd thing about the food presentation is that the sandwiches are brought out on a plate, but they are always sitting on a napkin.  The first thing I do is remove this extraneous napkin before it gets any more food on it.  As I am eating, my plate gets covered in olive oil and pesto and i don&#39;t want a napkin soaked in these things covering my plate.

The food is good and the portions are generous.  You will pay for this combination.  Considering the self serve aspects of the Marino&#39;s experience, the prices are a little on the high side in my opinion.

Overall, I like Marino&#39;s and I will continue to make it part of my lunch rotation.  I recommend that you try it as well, but come after noon so you don&#39;t take my table, OK?"

We got an 18&#34; regular crust cheese pizza and 10 free hot wings (hooray for coupons)... the crust was nice and solid without being too thick or doughy; a tasty, salty sauce and the plentiful cheese was a little brown on top (in a good way). The wings, while not quite as crispy as I like, had a nice flavor and were quite meaty.

So far so good -- tasty pizza for a decent price plus hey, free wings! I think we&#39;ll have to try some of their sandwiches or pasta inside the cute restaurant next time..."

Suprised to see I haven&#39;t reviewed Marino&#39;s yet, as I&#39;ve been going here for lunch for years. 
I&#39;ve usually stuck by their slices- more of a NYC style IMO- large, floppy, greasy slices.  definitely tasty for the style.  (personally, I&#39;ve been a little disenchanted with the NYC style lately, preferring a thin &amp; crispy style).
Good pastas with great sauces.  Excellent cheesy meatball sub.  Salads look excellent (though, I&#39;ve never had one).
a regular place for me."

I liked the poppers well enough. The bread is also pretty good too. The delivery service is very hit-or-miss. Once the guy delivered the order and then FORGOT THE ACTUAL PIZZA. I had to call him to bring it, and then it was cold! And then the restaurant didn&#39;t even take it off the bill, which I thought was kind of a crappy gesture.

Maybe if they took it off the bill I&#39;d review this restaurant 1 star higher but it just kind of left a sour taste in my mouth."

They added an entrance door with a canopy last year and it really helped with cutting down on the cold drafts this winter.  Had the Mela salad last week and greens were all fresh tasting, right sized portions. Not to small but not to large either. Mushroom soup was fabulous and I ordered extra to take home, makes me want to stop buying Campbells all together. Update on 2-18-2015  They Italian dinners are delicious and a great bargain. Main course, small soup, bread butter all varieties $12-14. The chopped salad is exceptional and I have at least 1 per week."

Most places in Wood Dale are either fast food chains or sit down restaurants like Crossroads. 

Food comes out quick. Portions are huge--especially their wonderful salads. Bread is fresh &#39;n flaky. The staff is always nice and pleased to see you when you walk in. The owner is one of the nicest guys ever! 

I have only gotten sandwiches and salads from there, but have sampled other items such as calamari, vodka and penne, and pizza and all of those have been wonderful. Lots of flavor! 

I don&#39;t know if i would like to come here for dinner, this is not a full on restaurant, you order the food at the cash register and they serve it to you at your table. Great place for lunch or a quick dinner."

I&#39;m glad to report I was very wrong. Marino&#39;s entrees are awesome and the pizza looks fantastic. We have a group pizza outing planned for later in the week, so I might not make it back to try a slice but I would definitely hit this place for dinner any time.

Big portions of great food. I had the giambotta and it was fantastic. My friends all had pasta dishes and raved about the flavor. 

We didn&#39;t have desert, but there was a really nice selection of pies and i saw a gelato case as well.

Egg rolls are yummy,  love the cabbage,  meat,  and spices. 

Cuttlefish was fried,  greasy(hell yea), and delicious with a sprinkle of diced jalapeño and carrots.   We ate it with the giant box of white rice that came with our order.

The people that work there are very nice and speak Cantonese. Apparently they also serve things like intestine and wonton noodle soup, I&#39;ll work my way to those eventually.

They have some of the best seafood in the area. I highly recommend any seafood dish. I have been avoiding their beef due to some overtenderization issues. Their chicken is really juicy.

Authentic Food
Red Curry Chicken - They added Thai food to their menu recently. The Thai curry is pretty good, I would say not as good as Dan Thai but pretty good.  The Chicken is much juicier than thai chicken which is almost jerk texture.  This kinda made things weird for me. But the curry itself was done well.  I will try some of their other ones in the future since you get SO MUCH MORE food for the same price as Dan Thai.

Salt and Pepper Shrimp - Shell on - the best of this has an easy time of eating the shell, with very minimal notice of the shell.  Here you notice the shell but can also eat the shell.  The shrimp are cooked perfectly.  This is the first place that has carrots in their SP Shrimp, different, not sure I like that part.

Walnut Shrimp - wonderfully cooked shrimp, a bit over battered, with perfectly cooked broccoli and walnuts.  The sauce is great, though for take out, the steam in the container washed some of it off and made liquid on the bottom, but probably not an issue if you eat there or if you open the container sooner rather than later.

White Rice - perfectly cooked fluffly white rice.

Americanized Food
Sweet and Sour Shrimp - the shrimp are big and perfectly cooked, tender, and succulent.  The sauce is authentic, not that neon orange stuff, it is the darker stuff and has some pineapples and green peppers in them.  It&#39;s great!

Fried Rice - they have gotten their fried rice act together. There is so much Wok Hei (the smokiness that makes fried rice good) and it is not hard rice. Best Fried rice in the area for sure.

Egg Rolls - this has improved since the last time few times I had them, they come free with lunch specials so I try them regularly.  It&#39;s not the best but an acceptable egg roll now.

Crab Rangoon - these are wonderfully delicious, a very sweet mixture compared to most rangoons. It&#39;s not traditional but it&#39;s good, more desserty, and the fry is perfectly crispy and crunchy."

I&#39;ve started ordering a week since they opened...but no more with their new and improved 25% increase...!?!? You&#39;ve gotta to be pretty desperate to hike prices more than the consumer price index rise in the United States during the last 10 years!

During the last two recent orders, the quality has visibly declined proportionately.  The key ingredients (e.g. Shrimp) have gotten less and the quality of cooking has also gone downhill. Either they changed kitchen staff but it&#39;s not the same Family anymore. Family House has now been infested with the greed roach!

This is a telltale sign of a business on a downward spiral... Pay more for mediocrity.  Thanks but there many more options around here that offers better alternatives.  I give this place another few months before its goes off life support."

First off,  all the fried stuff seemed undercooked.  Maybe their oil was off waiting for customers..  the crab rangoon was not good....  it had a slab of cream cheese in it...   egg rolls were ok, but undercooked..  pot stickers were eh...  fried wontoon chips were not good.   Fried rice was good but nothing spectacular.  Sweet and sour chicken was terrible.  Sauce tasted old and burnt..  sesame chicken was nothing spectacular...

Needless to say i wont be back..


I hate waisting food and money, but i wound up throwing away all of the leftovers"

Everything tasted like rubber. The &#34;crab rangoons&#34; were basically just yogurt in bread. The meat and seafood was really raw. Even the fortune cookies tasted like rubber. How do you fuck up a fortune cookie?  
I gave this one star cause the delivery guy was hot. 10/10 would recommend. Also the chick on the phone had a soft voice. I&#39;d probably order like a soda to be delivered to see the delivery guy again."

The restaurant is very deceiving when you pass on Schaumburg Road. From the road you see the back of restaurant. When you pull around to parking lot you find the main entrance. On arrival, I was promptly sat and drink order taken. The menu is a normal Chinese Menu, with a twist. It lists the proteins and then explains the sauces in detail. I settled on the sweet and sour pork dinner. The dinner comes with choice of soup, I chose egg drop, an egg roll and main course with fried rice. The soup was served hot and the favors where delicious. The egg roll was loaded with chicken, beef and shrimp. It is served with their own version of duck sauce. Excellent. The sweet and sour pork was battered but served with a traditional red sauce with peppers and pineapples in it. I opted for the combo fried rice and it was brimming with chicken, pork and beef. Overall the food was top shelf and the only bad item was the fortune cookie served at the end was stale. Can&#39;t blame Family House for that."

We were the only people eating in, but it seemed like they had a lot of to go and delivery orders.  Nice lunch special that included egg roll, soup, and rice ($6-8).  The options were pretty typical, but what really stood out from our lunch was the crab rangoon.  They were huge and full of filling.  I could only eat two.

They gave us crab rangoon for free and truly looks and tastes better from the first time I ordered during the summer. 

Truth be told, this is my second time ordering delivery from them this week. That&#39;s just how good it has been. I would say they are pushing towards above average. Keep on pushing! Not missing chinatown as much anymore.

The location is very close to us. I enjoyed the eggplant and chicken with salty fish #336 very much. Their lo mein noodles with beef and chicken was also a hit. The orange chicken was good but maybe a bit too sweet. The salt and pepper pork was flavorful but the meat was a bit too fatty. They forgot to give us enough white rice (we only got one takeout carton). I will definitely consider this place again next time for take out or if we have another party.

The place was clean and there was plenty of seating, including booths.  They seated us right away and were very friendly. After we were seated and got our menus, they offered us free egg drop soup, which was delicious. My family and I are vegetarians, so we were happy to see that there were plenty of vegetable and tofu items on the menu.
We ordered vegetable egg rolls, vegetable egg foo young ,orange tofu, and vegetable chop suey. The vegetables were very fresh, not overcooked. The broccoli was nice and crispy and the orange sauce on the tofu was terrific. The dishes weren&#39;t oily or greasy, they were light-tasting and had a nice flavor.
The waitresses were attentive and checked on us frequently to refill our hot tea and ask if we needed anything.  We enjoyed our dining experience there, and will definitely be back to try other dishes."

It wasn&#39;t savory and didn&#39;t have any spice to it. It tasted OK, but wasn&#39;t what I expected. Even though the portion was huge, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be eating the leftovers.

I&#39;ve only been here twice and I definitely wouldn&#39;t go again. The service is downright awful, however. Even if you don&#39;t agree with my review; never order before hand. They will never have it ready. Their excuse when I got to the place (after ordering 35 minutes before hand) was &#34;We were way too busy to cook your food.&#34; I didn&#39;t believe this, obviously. The place had only one family dining in. And even if I did believe that, why would you say that to a customer? It kind of reflects badly on the staff and especially with the management. The food itself is ok, and that&#39;s pretty much the best I can give it. I saw reviews that said the food was rotten or spoiled but I didn&#39;t have that problem when I went there. I just simply wasn&#39;t impressed especially considering how expensive they were compared to some other places in the area."

It took a while for someone to give us a menu, then take our order then give us he check but we still enjoyed the place.
The ambiance was fine but it was a bit loud. 
The food on the other hand was what really helped seal the deal.

I like how they gave us salsa and chips to keep our tummys happy until the real food came.

The first thing we had was the Vegetarian Tostadas which was pretty considering theres no meat. I actually got educated on the difference between hard taco shell and soft taco shell. I also tried for the first time fish tacos which was new but actually quite the combination. Last but not least i loved the Super Nachos which the steak was just sooooo tender, the guacamole was on point and the cheese omgosh the cheese. 

Would I come here again? Sure I don&#39;t see why not. 

Hope that was helpful!"

We ordered a carry out order and when my husband went into pick up the order a man was walking out saying don&#39;t bother picking up your order because they just screwed mine up.

We decided to stay in line but just check our order, but then the second person in line ahead of us also had their order wrong which they were in the processing of making it again.

So we waited and when it was our turn, my husband asked to confirm our order by reading back the order. It was correct. 

It was probably our mistake not to open the bag and go through each item, but she confirmed the order was correct.

Of course when we got home we realize that all seven tacos were made incorrectly. Those that were supposed to have sour cream did not have sour cream, those that were supposed to have no tomatoes had tomatoes, the other ones were missing and lettuce and cheese for some unknown reason. It was completely wrong.

We did not go back, we did call the store and let them know that we are the third person that had the wrong order this evening. They simply asked if we wanted to come back and pick up the correct order. We said no but we were letting them know that they need to figure out how to correctly take orders and make the correct orders because they just lost a customer."

Today super good service. Food was good this time though... I had a steak quesadilla ... that was good.  And I ordered a chicharron sope... they gave me a steak sope though... I didn&#39;t send it back because it took 28 mins (i timed it) to get our food after we placed the order so I wasn&#39;t willing to wait 15 mins for it...

I&#39;m a huge Mexican food aficionado so I was really looking forward to eating  here because of the good reviews. 

Ok so the first time there I went on Saturday night. It was pretty busy there and it took me about 10 minutes to get a table. I had to do this on my own because the service there is dismal. It took forever to be acknowledged and once the server came I got some chips and salsa which were ok, nothing special. I ordered a skirt steak dinner. It was a little tough and the flavor was just ok. It took a while to actually get the food. 

So I figured I would give this place another shot. Went in on a Sunday sat down immediately. Looked around and noticed the floors were dirty. The place was freezing cold. Seriously it&#39;s winter in Chicago, turn up the heat. Service was slow. It took 10 minutes to get chips and salsa and another 5 minutes to get a couple drinks and place our order. As for the food I couldn&#39;t really say because it never came. We waited 45 minutes. We asked twice and the one time the girl gave us an attitude when I asked if they forgot our food. I went to the bathroom there and it was dirty also. It&#39;s a shame that so many are putting up with these substandard establishments when you have choices."

It&#39;s a small location but they accommodated our party of 9. We ordered a little bit of everything and it was AWESOME! The guacamole rivaled any we had in Dallas. The fajitas were so tender and flavorful that I wished they had never ended. And every taco we tasted-was amazing. From lingua to fish, pastor to carne asada, there was no disappointment.

Love the food - cecina taco&#39;s with extra cilantro and onions are excellent...   Burrito&#39;s - large and excellent...   Food is a 5 star for sure.    

The only reason I 4 star it though...  After about 2 months of my very regular carry out orders- I always requested 3-4 salsas - these salsa&#39;s come in teeny containers too so 2 is not enough...   3 taco&#39;s needs 3 sauces for me...and I like to add it to the rice.  I went in recently and they had a sign on the register saying extra &#34;to-go&#34; sauce is .25 cents each...  Now if you eat in the restaurant, you get chips and salsa (which is also real good) and bottles of salsa to use as you please...  I sort of took the extra salsa charge as an insult against myself.  It&#39;s just a quarter, but it was more the principal...  When I saw the large bottles of hot sauce on the tables for &#34;eat in&#34; customers one day it kind of clicked in my head that this wasn&#39;t right.  

Food is definitely a 5 star though.     But I like hot sauce, and I&#39;ll probably not be going back as I have another good mexican place down the street from my office..."

After visiting California earlier this year, I find myself a lot more critical of Chicago&#39;s Mexican food as now I know what it SHOULD taste like.

I went here at 8:30pm on a Saturday and ordered two, take-out, steak burrito dinners.  I also got an order of chips and salsa.  The pricing was reasonable, $18 out the door.

The good:

The steak was very tasty.  The burrito was large and well-made.  It&#39;s not the biggest burrito I&#39;ve ever had, but definitely too much food for most.  The rice was also decent.  The chips and salsa were excellent.  The red and green sauce that came with the burritos were great.  I&#39;m a red sauce fan, and this is hands down my favorite sauce.  

The bad:

The beans had a very thick consistency and had an odd flavor to them that both my wife and I didn&#39;t care for.  The wait time was unbearable.  I walked in at 8:30pm and I left with my food at 9:05pm.  That&#39;s ridiculous for take-out service!  The irony of it is as I am standing there waiting for my food, I look across the street and see another Mexican restaurant called &#34;El Fast Burrito!&#34;  I couldn&#39;t help but laugh.

Overall the burrito was great.  If I ordered just the burrito and had my food in under 10 minutes, I&#39;d be giving this place 5 stars.  The funky beans cost them a half-star and the wait time reflects the other 1 and a half stars I deducted.  Definitely worth a try, if you have time to burn."

The service was great; the staff was friendly and attentive.  The music/Univision TV also contributed to a casual and authentic ambience.

I only try new places that have a Yelp rating of at least 4 stars. For the most part, Yelp is accurate. But today, I found for the first time a restaurant that is inaccurately rated.

There is no chance this is 4.5 stars, not 4 and not 3.5. They MIGHT be 3 IF they have great meat dishes (I ordered the veg burrito). But I think 2.5 is likely where they will eventually wind up unless they can radically change their game.

Some people rate highly cause a place is cheap. Not me. I rate for awesome food and specifically for vegan food. Some people rate high if a place feels authentic or if everyone inside is speaking Spanish. Well, you can have all that and even make me feel as if I am in Mexico, but if the food is sub par, well then that is how I will rate.

Rarely will I stop eating after one bite. Here I left after two bites. Life to waaaay to short for 2 or 3 star food."

Yes, there are a few Mexican restaurants in town but never on the same level as authentic tacos until I found Taqueria El Gallo de Oro! Everything from the ambiance to the food is as good as it gets in regards to authentic Mexican food. 

The place is small but when you walk in you know you are getting the good stuff as everyone in the restaurant is of Latin/Spanish decent. I usually order take-out as the service is slow in the restaurant but the wait is worth it! 

I suggest getting the Al Pastor, Cecina, and Carne Asada with cilantro and onion tacos. The guacamole is delicious as well as the rice and refried beans since they are made on the spot.

Got home and immediately dug into our food. The tacos were so good and stuffed with a lot meat and toppings. The taco dinners come with rice and beans, which were also very good.

Enchiladas mole, just tasted tomatoey. Boring. Enchiladas roja, more flavorful than the mole but as mentioned, mediocre. Although, a whole fish (snapper?) was served at a nearby table that looked interesting.Perhaps they were regulars who knew what to order.
Place is not clean. Dirty floor-makes me wonder about the kitchen hygiene.
 Biggest complaint for sure was the wait for our food. The place is tiny, and not one waiting table was getting their for about 1/2 hour. Not much take out leaving either. To me that signifies a poorly run place that does not warrant another visit."

We have only had food to go so I don&#39;t know how the service is, but the employees are friendly over the phone when we order ahead. I appreciate that the rice and beans are tasty as well.

1. Good, friendly service.

It&#39;s not obvious at first, but you can sit down to order food here! I didn&#39;t quite realize this and ordered &#34;to go&#34; at the front counter by accident, which confused the one guy as he brought me a menu and chips.

I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call this totally authentic Mexican, I saw too many concessions to American tastes on the menu, and in the food I was served. On the other hand I was also the only non-Hispanic patron there.  

Chips = OK. Salsa = Good. Authentic Spanish Rice isn&#39;t that bright orange color normally, I suspect that it is premade bulk product. It tasted pretty bland as a result. The beans were quite good, even if they needed a bit more salt for my taste.

The real star though is the chorizo tacos. I had one of each taco on the menu to test them all out. I&#39;ve enjoyed Chorizo many, many times before. But their version is by far one of the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. I ended having to order another one just to get enough of it&#39;s awesome flavor.

The &#34;green sauce&#34; as others have raved here has a nice tangy/spicy flavor that complements most of the meats on the tacos very well. I wouldn&#39;t use it on the chicken again, but the steak, chorizo and pork flavors all mixed very well with it.

Luckily, for a Mexican joint of this caliber, and my rather rusty high school Spanish, the servers I interacted with both spoke unaccented English. Frequently in my travels I&#39;m not 100% sure what I&#39;m ordering due to the language barrier, but that was not even close to being a concern here."

I will observe one more time if this is how she is with all customers or just those who do not speak Spanish!

Well, I tried it recently and I have to say that their food is pretty good. Being from Mexico City, I tend to have pretty high expectations on my Mexican food. Do not expect upscale Mexican food, but do expect much better food than Taco Bell and of those Mom/Pop greasy Mexican joints.

Great things about this place:

* Good salsa
* Univision playing constantly
* Good selection of beer and Mexican soft drinks (Sidral &amp; Mexican Coke)

Things to Improve:

* Chips were stale and oily. Chips need to be fresh and not as oily.
* TVs had bad reception. I would recommend cable service and flat screens. Well worth the investment to get repeat customers.
* Hand written notes on the walls. Gasten un poquito en Kinkos o Alphagraphics o que se los haga un amigo que tenga computadora.

Recommend: Although I do not eat steak any more, the fajitas that this guy was having smelled delicious."

I should have gone here more often.  Soon I&#39;ll move and, it will be much less convenient to go here.  It&#39;s my favorite mexican place.  Pretty much everything I&#39;ve had there has been decent, though some standouts:  
* Camerones Al Mojo De Ajo / Shrimp in Garlic Sauce.  This one is my favorite bit there.  I&#39;ve not found another restaurant that does it as tasty as this.
* Mushroom Quesadillas.  This is something I&#39;ve not seen too many other mexican places, and it&#39;s really tasty.
* Marinated Pork Torta.  I&#39;ve seen a ton of people chowing down on a torta on visits there, and it&#39;s a world that was new to me.  I finally tried one, and it&#39;s really great.  So you get a decent amount of food, it&#39;s reasonably cheap, and it tastes good.

A downside (with a touch of upside):  They aspire to be a nicer restaurant than they need to be, and they do a pretty good job making a nice eating out experience when they could be just a fast-foodish type thing.  Service can be slow, and I&#39;ve had concerns about being forgotten about completely at times.  Generally this has been for the &#34;I&#39;d like the check now&#34; portion of things.  You can generally go up to the register and get that taken care of instantly too.  Should I take a star for it or something? Maybe .5, so we&#39;ll round it up, because they all very nice and the food is good."

They serve tortilla chips and various dips when you sit down. The dips are all great, but my favorite is the green avocado dip (thin green and very spicy sauce). I drizzle that over my tacos too. 

Guac: good, but we swear they add chopped up boiled egg whites; there&#39;s something eggy about it, but it&#39;s very good still. Makes the guac very light. 

Taco w/ Rose Meat: REALLY REALLY GOOD, I will get this again and again
Taco w/ Tripe: I don&#39;t know WHAT kind of tripe this is, but it is not the chewy, comby tripe I know. This stuff was disgusting, it was almost like fried intestine that hadn&#39;t been cleaned out, not tripe. Very disappointing, will not get again. 

On another occasion I had the steak burrito: HUGE! A two meal-er for most women; pretty good, generous with the meat.

Took me a few years to find a spot for kick butt Mexican breakfast.  Found this place bout three years ago.  It does the trick.

Let&#39;s review

-  I like it as 1/2 the time the waitress speaks minimal English.  
- This limits am breakfast client to Norteno Bands nursing hangovers and regulars
-  AM is great on weekends watching Menudo fixes being administered!
- Me, I go for the Pozole Verde or Chorizo con Huevos
- Esposa, she likes the Huevos Mexicana
-  Learned to request the special salsa verde, which is brought out when requested.  Better than the standard green
- Coffee is hot and sometimes with a hint (is that the right word for a Taquiera?) of spice.
-  The beans are a manteca laden essence of sex.  My wife says like the ones Mom made prior to her halting the process due to getting old.
-  Other folks here rag on the rice.  Depends on the cook, but usually a 4 out of 5
-  Get some beans to go, the big cup and you have meals for the week.
-  Get to know Rueben, the owners son, he rocks
-  You can call in a dinner order, but why?  Come in, get a Negra Modelo and wait for your food.  

The handmade signs, the Guadalupe in the ventana, the Old style TVs, the bathroom with a questionable door handle...ahh, I always feel like I am back in my old stomping grounds.

You want table clothes and spit polish...go to Lalo&#39;s or another chain.  This is Mexican Comfort Food!!

I eat here at least 30 times a year....with double up weekends on occasion.

And you can even request flour tortillas if you prefer.

The interior is exactly what you should expect from your local taqueria; shanty location, plenty of neon lighting, corona banners EVERYWHERE, and most importantly, Telemundo blaring from the two TV&#39;s on both ends of the dining room.  The lady who serves us is always really nice and there is always a Mexican family dining there when I go, which is always a good sign of authenticity :)

There is no question that this restaurant does have very good quality products, and I cannot say that I was disappointed by what I had eaten.  However, the service here is agonizingly slow, and it takes forever to get anything accomplished here.  I am not a person that looks for instant service, but for a full service restaurant I expect things to move a lot faster than the service I had here.  To give you all an idea to what I am referring, from the time I had walked in to when I was finally given the chips and salsa took about 25 minutes.  From that point it took another 15 minutes for me to get something to drink.  From there it must have taken another 10 minutes to place my order.  All I had was a burrito dinner, and from start to finish I must have been at this restaurant for little over two hours.  Everyone at the restaurant when I was there from the carryout folks to the dine in people waited a long time for anything and everything, and the staff would simply disappear at times.

Especially with there being a crowded field of Mexican restaurants in the area with many of them offering an equally good product at far better service this restaurant is a pass.  Again, the food here is excellent though the helpings were small.  In the end of the day while food is quite important for a restaurant if the service is non-existent such as at this place, then one should exercise better options.

Out of fairness, the wait staff was pleasant, and I cannot say that anyone was rude or bad.  It just was tough not having anyone around when you most needed them, and it was really annoying having to wait around for an extraordinarily amount of time for what one can get at places in the area far more quickly.  If the service here could be dramatically improved, then I would gladly change my rating for the better.  Until such time this place is a pass."

You get 3 tacos, rice, and beans. When you eat there they also serve chips and salsa. I thought the chips and salsa were very good. Both salsas had a fresh taste. The red had a nice spicy kick to it. The chips were also warmed up.

I had the steak tacos and it was chopped steak, I thought it would be whole slices. I thought they were good. The steak was a little dry, but I think that is because the steak is already chopped up then reheated.

I thought the rice was good. It wasn&#39;t the best rice, but it was good. The beans were really good. The beans had just the right texture and good flavor.

It was very clean inside. They have about 10 tables and also about 5 seats along the front window. There is a Juke Box in the corner, which at one point started playing music very LOUDLY! It was so loud you had to shout to have a conversation.

I will probably return again to give some of the other food a try."

Since I no longer live near a Taco Burrito King, this place gets me my steak burrito fix, just 2 miles from home. While you can dine in, it&#39;s kinda crowded and small. Carry-out is really the bulk of their business. Their 3-fold menu offers a lot of variety for a tiny place. My son loves their quesadillas and I&#39;m a steak burrito addict. They also have tasty, loose rice and refried beans that are not watery. I judge them well as a carry-out, because the one time I got a mistaken order, by the time I returned, they had my correct item waiting for me and I did not have to wait at all. I like this place a lot better than Los Sombreros which is closer to my house."

First, service is OUTSTANDING.  Quick, attentive, and sincere.  Our waitress checked on our table frequently, worked well with a shy child, and found ways to connect without pandering.

Portion size, unsurprisingly, can best be described as intimidating.  The kid&#39;s &#34;one egg any style&#34; came with a huge pancake, two big links, a pile of potatoes, and a huge glass of milk.  The french toast that came with an omelet was enough for a main serving by itself.  Next to the mountain of hash browns, rose a lofty hill of eggs stuffed with veggies and cheese.

Surprisingly high quality ingredients seem to be used, except for the tomatoes and spinach.  Sadly, however, the coffee is such a beverage in name only.  When it first flowed into my cup, I thought that the server had mistakenly grabbed the carafe of tea, as the liquid was so translucent.  Flavor barely reminded me of coffee.

That&#39;s all right though.  Just grab an espresso on the way there and enjoy EVERYTHING ELSE.  Nothing to whine about if I don&#39;t order the coffee."

The price is right.  The portions are large (sometimes enough to eat for breakfast and lunch later.)  Everytime we go there the waitresses are so nice and helpful, it doesn&#39;t matter which waitress they are all wonderful.  
It is the small things and attention to detail that impress me the most about Bentley&#39;s.  They are always cleaning, and the waitresses are waiting for you to be ready.  Virtually no wait except for the food to cook.
Even though the building is old, I am really impressed with how well they maintain it.  There are people that clean the windows, and floors, and counters.  Bentley&#39;s has one of the cleanest restaurants I&#39;ve ever been to.  Even the bathroom is sparkling clean and smells good.
I am always highly impressed with this restaurant, and will continue to be a regular customer.

It&#39;s not a challenge to impress me once. But considering that we have eaten at Bentley&#39;s for over 6 years now, they have NEVER disappointed me. It&#39;s why we&#39;ll make the drive from Lombard to Wood Dale, passing up probably a dozen or more places that serve the same kind of food.

I order a grilled cheese that came with soup. They brought out the cream of chicken soup I order I took two bites before realizing there was a strand of hair in it. I told are server who asked if i wanted the other soup they offered which a politely declined I noticed she went to the manager and told him. Nothing was done right then and there. When I received my grilled cheese i took a bite and the bacon was so over cooked it hurt my teeth where I ended up just picking it off. when it was time to pay I assumed my meal would be taken off the bill due to the problems I faced. There were two managers on duty. One of the managers said I lied and it was only an eyelash and was overreactting. The manager handling our bill said since the soup was part of the meal there was nothing that can be done. I proceeded to tell the manager I had no problem paying for it, but it wasn&#39;t ethical for them to do. Eventually after about 3 minutes standing at the counter to try to pay for my horrible meal he did take it off. Which I am happy to say I will never go back. And let me just say the service there is horrible. To go on a Sunday morning I was shocked all the servers were just by the soda station socializing.

The bright and cheerful atmosphere is a nice way to break up the day. The staff is usually pretty friendly and quick to accommodate my requests. For example, I like their grilled chicken breast and I like a croissant, but they don&#39;t really have that on the menu that way. I ask and I receive. It works for me. :-) 

Seriously though, they have very good chicken noodle soup. It&#39;s a straightforward take on a traditional soup. There&#39;s nothing fancy about it, but there doesn&#39;t need to be. It&#39;s served hot and fresh with veggies aplenty. The seasoning is right on point. 

I am pretty boring and I get the same few things here all the time, but my dining companions change things up. My girlfriend has tried numerous salads and wraps. She usually gets through about half of her meal before she gets full. My hubby generally gets some version of breakfast eggs. He&#39;s an over-medium kind of guy. He won&#39;t eat them if they aren&#39;t cooked right and he always finishes them here, so I think the Bentley&#39;s Team knows what they are doing.

I apologized for the inconvenience and I will  say she was VERY nice. What happens next is what is unbelievable. My daughter is literally giving me hugs and kisses when the ( I assume manager/owner: tall guy and gray haired) comes to the table and says with an attitude  &#34;I just wasted two sandwiches on you, you&#39;re going to have to go eat somewhere else&#34;.. HUH???? I swear on my daughter he said that!!. After I recovered from the shock, I said&#34; excuse me? Your food is inedible and you&#39;re asking me to leave? He said, &#34; go to Mc Donalds. I honestly didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or cry...seriously. I had my 2 y.o there. WHO DOES THAT????  The worst part is, I don&#39;t even eat that kind of food due to having cancer. I try and eat healthy but I was going to &#34;splurge&#34;. If I&#39;m going to eat junk then gosh I&#39;d like it to be worth it! What an awful human being."

It&#39;s my family&#39;s favorite breakfast place. The portions are large, the food is good, and the staff is super friendly. The last time I came here I wanted pigs in a blanket which isn&#39;t a menu item, so I asked my waitress if they could make them, and she wrote down my order without hesitation. I was also super happy that I got 3 of them in my order made with full sized pancakes. :D  I would definitely recommend the Belgian Special if you want a complete breakfast that includes a whole Belgian waffle.  The only down side to Bentley&#39;s is that they close really early, around 3pm, so don&#39;t plan on coming here for dinner unless you want to eat super early."

Most of the time, I&#39;ve gone on Sundays in the late morning, and yes, it&#39;s going to be very crowded at that time.  However, I&#39;ve never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a table.  In fact, service is fast once you&#39;re seated.  Your food comes out quickly - VERY quickly.  While you think this might be a sign of lower quality, it most certainly is not.  My food has always been hot, my orders have always been correct, the waitresses have always been friendly and attentive.  They&#39;ve even played along and passed messages across the room to some friends we noticed eating there at the same time.  

I can&#39;t vouch for the lunch menu, but everything I&#39;ve had for breakfast I&#39;ve loved.  My favorite, however, is the Farmer&#39;s Skillet - lots of gooey cheese, plenty of vegetables, delicious hash browns, and they always use two double eggs.  The amount of food is just right, but if you get one of their omelets, you might have some left over to take home with you.  I usually have leftover pancakes, which are one of the two side options when ordering something like a skillet.

For $6.95, you get a sandwich with fries.  Trying to avoid fried foods, I asked if I could get coleslaw instead.  Sure, no problem.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The pork was moist and tasty, with just the right amount of BBQ sauce - a few drips fell on my plate, but it wasn&#39;t like it was swimming in sauce - it was just right.  The coleslaw was another pleasant surprise.  Crunchy and not overwhelmed with dressing.  I could actually taste the cabbage.  The container it came in held a full cup of coleslaw - yes, I measured!  So it wasn&#39;t the typical divot you get at most places, it was a full side.

I was also impressed with the cleanliness of the place.  The man taking orders washed his hands with soap each time he handled money, even though he was just putting already-packaged food into bags.

Tasty food, good value.  I smiled at the decor while waiting for my order - the walls are painted with a southwest motif, and in the middle of it, near the ceiling, is a large mounted fish.  Didn&#39;t realize that fish like BBQ - maybe his name is Filet Vettel?"

There&#39;s some place that does BBQ in the city that is cash only and they do a million times better than this. Sorry, this is kinda like Herm&#39;s in Evanston - it&#39;s not awful, but it&#39;s basically just kinda bland and fried."

Today I tried Julian&#39;s BBQ for lunch. I got the Brisket, of course. It was just about noon and there were more employees than customers.

Ordered and stood at the counter to see what they were doing. The guy before me had ordered 2 Pulled Pork sandwiches to go. They did something I&#39;ve never seen before: they put some pork into a big china cap strained and dunked it into hot water for 30 seconds, then plopped it into a bowl and slopped sauce allover it, and used this to make 2 sandwiches.

So, now I&#39;m wondering what they&#39;re going to do with my Brisket. After about 10 minutes I get my food and head out to the car to eat. My lunch consisted of the Brisket, fries, and a can of Fanta Orange.  

I take my lunch out to the car and open it up. I am not disappointed at what I see, I really expected it. My brisket is sliced a little thicker than Italian Beef and has this distinctive, thin, runny sauce on it. I&#39;ve eaten a lot of BBQ and had a lot of sauces, so it&#39;s easy to identify Open Pit. That orange runny stuff on my brisket is Open Pit! I take a bite and it&#39;s as bad as I expect. Oh, and aside from being sliced very thin, I can&#39;t taste a hint of smoke! Can&#39;t be BBQ without smoke. 

I try several of the fries and they&#39;re undercooked, cold, and unpleasant tasting. I try the Fanta Orange. Surely you can&#39;t mess up a can of soda, right? Wrong! It&#39;s barely cool. Seem that the temp of the cooler needs to go down some.

I was hoping for good BBQ since the place has a 4 out of 5 rating. I was totally disappointed in the food. This isn&#39;t even close to BBQ. 

Looking for good BBQ avoid Julian&#39;s cause it ain&#39;t good or BBEQ."

I mean besides the fact that I&#39;m a fat guy and the smells of grilled meat are like pheromones, drifting across the African veldt like so much prey attracting a hungry lion. So I was picking up some sushi from Sushi Today for the wife and remembered there was this new BBQ joint next door so let&#39;s try it, right? Right. 

I was in no mood to dawdle so I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries and got the fuck out of dodge to get my sushi order and go home. The staff was courteous and the food was up pretty quickly so I have no complaints about that. Got home, dug in and found the pork sandwich with accompanying BBQ sauce totally good. It was more chopped than pulled but it&#39;s pork, I&#39;m a fat guy and that means I liked it. The problem came when I tried the sweet potato fries. 

The last sweet potato fries I had were at Mr Bartley&#39;s Burger Cottage in Cambridge and I was so very afraid to order them again, for fear I would experience the same tasteless, greasy nonsense I had back then. I&#39;m sorry to say I was in the wrong again. The bad sweet potato fries strike back! Am I just a fry snob? Is my radar for these things off kilter? I ended up adding my own salt and was able to eat them that way but off the bat both my wife and I both said they had no taste and were, and I quote, &#34;yucky.&#34; 

Oh Julian&#39;s BBQ and Grill, I am disappoint. I saw the option for bacon cheddar fries on the menu and second guessed myself and went for the sweet potato option. That will not be a mistake I make twice. Next time I&#39;m in the area for a sushi run I will visit Julian&#39;s again but won&#39;t be ordering those sweet potato fries again. Still, the BBQ was good and I&#39;m a fan."

Those were some impressive rib tips. Different than most because of its size and texture. Julian&#39;s tips are the fattiest tips I have ever had. Just an FYI. I think most would think they are getting their moneys worth since each tip is almost 2-4 inches in length and girth. It&#39;s got a mighty thickness to it as well. I&#39;d only eaten 3 tips with toast and a few fries and felt full. The meat is tender and moist and can be cut without much effort. (Even with plastic utensils.) Side note: It&#39;s a grievance to me when a restaurant only offers plastic utensils; sometimes a cheaper weaker variety and you&#39;re unable to use them to efficiently eat your meal. Not the case here. 
Rib tips were served with a piece of Texas toast and two sides, extra sauce available on request. Their beans had a mixed variety and paired with the slaw, both were average. I visited their restaurant on the weekend. It was dead. I think they are busiest during the weekdays since they are located in a corporate park. Most nights they are out of there by 7 or 8 pm. Weekends they close earlier, so best to call ahead. 
The interior was clean and most areas smelled fresh. Their menu is broad with a number of items. My lunch pal was hankering for a fish sandwich, they only offered salmon but after a short discussion they decided to take the dinner special (Tilapia) and create a sandwich combo out of it. That too, was a tasty meal. Two guys, two meals with two medium drinks, total was around twenty three dollars with tax. Ample leftovers for the drive home."

I was in a SHOCK!!! HOW COME?? then I went to the manager and asked about this incident, he told me that :&#34;cleaning guy asked from other people  who&#39;s is this?&#34; and they claimed it!! we left the tip we talked to the cleaning guy, and why he asked other people who were sitting at the other corner of the building?? then i asked if he can check the camera? he went for 7 minutes, when he came back he said: there is a passcode can&#39;t help it.

There are two counters. One for food and one for beverages. You order your food at the food counter, as this is fast casual dining. Prices are very reasonable - you can get away with a pizza, two sides and two drinks for around $20 or less. They do not deliver the food; you must go and get it when your number is called.

Beverages are at the other counter. Soft drinks are dirt cheap - 95 cents or $1.25 depending on size. But it comes with a catch - no free refills. Have some coin ready if you are really thirsty. Alcohol is also served at this counter but since I do not drink I cannot judge this aspect.

This food itself is good, not great. The pizzas are either 11&#34; or 14&#34; and they put plenty of toppings on the pie. The pizza here is of the thin crust variety and is cut into squares, which seem to be the case with most Midwestern places. I opted for the standard triangle cut and although it was honored, the manager on duty did not sound pleased at this request.

I can recommend this establishment for the inexpensive prices and unique experience, but some of the staff need lessons on treating customers with respect."

We walked in and asked what time they closed?  They told us 11:00pm.  Perfect, we could have a drink and have plenty of time to finish the game.  It was about 10:20 and the game was already late in the 4th quarter.

After ordering, we grabbed a seat in front of the one TV in the entire restaurant.  As some of you may know, this was an intense game and came right down to the wire.  The Steelers were driving down the field in the final two minutes of the game.  With 40 seconds left, an employee turns off the television and tells us they are closed.  He provided us with no warning.  Dismayed, I checked my phone to see it was 10:43pm.  17 minutes before they told us they were going to close.

That&#39;s absurd. There were 40 seconds left in an NFL playoff game.  At least give us a heads up before you turn it off.  As a reference, the game ended well before 11:00pm.    I doubt I will be returning after this blatant violation of social norms."

The Good:
-Plenty of booths
-The pizza was decent with a crispy crust. 

The Meh:
-The high chairs were in need of a deep clean. Good thing I&#39;m a little bit of a clean freak and carry around a ton of wet wipes to scrub said chairs before sitting my toddler in one. 
-The place was absolutely empty at 5:30 on a Thursday. Not that I expect a vibrant crowd around this time, but it felt like a ghost town. 
-It&#39;s hella dark. 
-The mozzarella sticks, salad and dressing were uninspired, packaged and unremarkable. Not offensive, just boring. 

The Bad: 
-The ordering system. What the hell? Order and pay food at one end, order and pay for ALL drinks (including non alcoholic) at the bar. This includes milk.
-Cash or check only. Yes. Check. 
-The staff seemed genuinely sleepy and none too thrilled to be there.

Even though I recall enjoying Barnaby&#39;s as a kid, I can&#39;t imagine coming back here when there are so many other tasty and lively pizza options in the burbs."

We ordered a pepperoni pizza and cheese fries. The fries were good, but the cheese was kind of gross. Didn&#39;t care for the taste of it. The pizza was really good! The crust was perfect...not too crispy...not too soft!

One of the best things about Barnaby&#39;s is the price.  I ate here with my parents for under $20 and we didn&#39;t even order a pizza.  They both got burgers and I got mozzarella sticks.  We split a pitcher of coke.

It&#39;s a great spot when you&#39;re looking for something cheap and casual but still want to sit down.  You order at the counter, they call your number, and you go pick up your food.

I honestly don&#39;t understand how anyone could order anything other than the pizza.  I&#39;m sure everything is good, but the thin crust pizza has the perfect amounts of everything.

It&#39;s a family place, so it can be loud, there&#39;s benches and kids don&#39;t always sit in one place, but it&#39;s not like a Chuck E Cheese and there&#39;s plenty of adults.  Regardless, it&#39;s my favorite and I think the atmosphere helps you have a good time.  That and the very reasonably priced pitchers of beer (please tip them).

We have a tradition and I can&#39;t wait until February.  Barnaby&#39;s does heart shaped pizzas on Valentines Day.  I&#39;ve done that for the last 35 or so years and it&#39;s a fun tradition.

When I refused they didn&#39;t want to make another one. They did it after I argued with them but really I feel like they shouldn&#39;t have been so difficult. If it were just that maybe I wouldn&#39;t be so miffed but then I got back to the office and the pizza was still wrong. So I called the place to express that the order was incorrect and they told me it was my fault and there was nothing they could do and to call back and talk to the owner at 3. I called after 3 and still no owner. I did however get a lecture about how it was my own fault again.

Their unwillingness to do anything at all to fix their own error and the all in all AWFUL customer service is what gives this place 1 star for me. If I could give them 0 I would."

The sauce has little seasoning and doesnt taste too far from the can, the crust is elementary school style. I have enjoyed equivalent quality from the grocery frozen food section. Fries are tasty but beware the bright orange cheese sauce. Cheap beer on the plastic board. No refills on sodas. This is a cheap place to bring the kids and the neighbor kids for a lunch room style meal. There is a bit of a Frankenstein approach to the theme. It is both classic and class-less. The dining environment is one part being tranported to the 1970&#39;s via time machine. One part beer hall with woodsy booths, hanging beer Steins, gothic dimmed chandeliers, and beer signs. One part sports bar with sports jerseys and memorabilia hanging around a singular tv showing sports.

I was tempted to just leave it at that, but that wouldn&#39;t cut it. I have been coming here with my family since I was 4 years old, making that a total of 20 years. We still can&#39;t get enough. From Mark the Magician and watching the pizzas made to the draft beer and big screen tv, this place is classic. Oh yeah, and the pizza is incredible! I have never ordered it for carry out, because I don&#39;t want to wait that long to get it home, and that is a tradition that will continue. This is my sister&#39;s favorite place to eat so whenever she is in town we are sure to visit. We went the other day without her so hopefully this Yelp review makes her jealous. They accept cash or checks only so its about time that some people figure out how to use an ATM. I have no problem with it at all I just thought I&#39;d offer a heads up so no one cries.

Friday, Valentines day, we got 2 heart shaped pizzas that were both BURNED. It broke my heart. I conceded to the family who announced it was the worst pizza they had ever had. I bragged about this Inn for weeks prior to the family, as only I had ever had Barnaby&#39;s. A year ago we went to the one in Niles and the pizza was fabulous.

Barnaby&#39;s knows their niche well and that is to provide a limited menu (pizza, burgers, beef) to young families at a reasonable price. To entice the adults, they offer a surprisingly good selection of beer (XX, Guiness, etc). Wine, not so much. 

If you are looking for a quiet night out without kids, this is not the place. Barnaby&#39;s is the YMCA of the restaurant world. When I think of Barnaby&#39;s I think of family and value (oh, and pizza!)."

Did it change hands recently?

Pizza cook lied to me about one of the pizzas and all 3 were soggy and not very tasty. Never going back. If he didn&#39;t lie we would have wrote it off as an off night and tried again I&#39;m sure. Why do they assume that you are as STUPID as they are and lie. The following is the explanation of what occurred.

We ordered 3 pizzas on our way to the restaurant to eat in, 1 - 2 topping, 1 - 1/2 and 1/2, and 1 - 5 topping.

5:14 Ordered pizzas and told 20 minutes
5:35 Arrive and pay for pizzas 2 were ready 5 - topping was not and  pizza cook looks at the ticket and says it is still in the oven.
5:55 5 - Topping pizza still not ready and was told it takes 20 minutes and the others take 8 minutes. This is 40 minutes after pizzas were ordered. Rest of the party is pretty much done eating.
6:00 5 - Topping is finally done."

The place is big enough, however, that we weren&#39;t disrupted by them at all.

It has the feel of a regular neighborhood hangout. In fact, we watched several people walk in and run into people they knew. 

The pizza is good. Nothing special, but good. The beer is cheap! Mugs of Miller were $1.50 I think? Tough to beat that!

But the salt is no doubt what makes it so delicious! Oh, what a conundrum!

It&#39;s nice for eating-in if you want to order a pitcher of beer and catch up with friends, as long as it&#39;s not during Little League season. During that time, it&#39;s best to order ahead for pick-up, unless you want to be surrounded by rambunctious kiddies running around after practice or a big game or team photos.

The AH Barnaby&#39;s was the most basic menu of any Barnaby&#39;s I had been too.  Pizza, Burgers and Chicken sandwiches, House salad and that&#39;s about it.  Why mess with a proven formula.  It seems to be the spot for families to go after children&#39;s sports events."

So I reasoned with her and she agreed that Barnaby&#39;s was an acceptable option.

It was so comforting to walk in here and find it nearly identical to every other Barnaby&#39;s I&#39;ve ever been to...dark and dungeon-like, pay for food on the right, drinks on the left, the wooden booths with the short dividers so it&#39;s like you&#39;re sitting with strangers...I love it.

The pizza was better than I remember.  As a kid, we went to the Barnaby&#39;s on Caldwell (Niles?) and while the pizza was good, it was sometimes a little burnt on the bottom, so it wasn&#39;t my favorite place to go. This pizza was very good; we had half pepperoni, half onion &amp; mushroom; veggies were very thinly sliced so my daughter didn&#39;t even realize she was eating them.

I didn&#39;t check out the menu for any of the other offerings; we were here for pizza only.  Anyhow, my kid loved it and hasn&#39;t whined for Lou&#39;s since."

Since my original review I feel I may have Jinxed this place. We have ordered (delivery) 6 times since my review and 4 of the times our orders were wrong. Someone needs to start checking the orders before they go out. It has gotten to the point that we don&#39;t want to order from here anymore because who knows if what we order we actually get delivered. It&#39;s a damn shame too. 

What I like the most about this place is the variety. Moretti&#39;s has a lot to offer and that&#39;s a real plus when you want to do delivery and want more then pizza. I&#39;ve been ordering from Moretti&#39;s for years and  here are some of the best dishes I&#39;ve had here that you should try. 

The deep dish cheese pizza. I&#39;m normally not one to order just a plane cheese pizza but they use a blend of cheeses that makes this one of the best cheese pizzas I&#39;ve ever had. Better than Lou Malnattis and Gino&#39;s East. 

Their chicken Parmesan sandwich and Dinner are excellent. The sandwich comes with two chicken breasts and the dinner comes with three. Great value. 

The fried calamari- I ask for it with marinara though. It comes with cocktail sauce. 

Any of their pasta dishes are great

Last would be if you get a sandwich, instead of fries get their chips. Super crunchy and just the right amount of salt. 

Only reason I didn&#39;t go 5 stars is because they aren&#39;t always consistent in the quality of their food."

She was nice but seemed irritated when we asked about sitting at some tables that were empty. 

Waitress: Great! 

Food: Kids made their own pizza which was fun and they said it was good.  They also say Little Caesars is good pizza so I wouldn&#39;t take their opinion for much. 
Sunday was spaghetti night and the spaghetti was good and enough for 2 adults to split. I came here to have a Chicago style deep dish and was pretty disappointed with it.  The sauce was bland like they just opened a can of crushed tomatoes and dumped it on top.  There wasn&#39;t much cheese and all I could taste was the sausage which was ok.  Next time I&#39;m back visiting family I&#39;ll stick to Lou&#39;s or Rosatis."
morettis-ristorante-and-pizzeria-schaumburg,Harry P.,lZT92kolNaeymZ7xbdcZNQ,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,52,o_v0G16ycMpV7H2_QtwSzQ,3.0,2016-11-11,"Generally good food, but *very* disorganized when it comes to carry-out.  I regularly get orders that are wrong.  Order one salad no onion, every salad has no onions.  Wrong dressing.  Missing dressing.  Missing utensils.  Missing bread.  Seriously, what is wrong with their take-out staff?

Would rate higher if not for the bad service.  Eggplant parm. there (sandwich and entree) is the best I&#39;ve had.  Pizzas are very good.  Dine-in service is slow and just about as bad as take-out service.

I&#39;ve ordered from Moretti&#39;s probably a triple-digit number of times, and I think part of the problem leading to their wrong orders is the fact that they have multiple people bag up (at least) take-out orders.  One person puts in soups, another puts in condiments and utensils, etc.  You can see it happening as you wait for the order.  Have one person bag things up, and I suspect this would be far less of a problem.

Edit: On second thought, probably would leave three stars even if the service were better.  Food is about as inconsistent as the correctness of the orders.  Have had some soups that were perfect and others that were salty to the point of being borderline inedible."

The food has proven to be consistently inconsistent in portions and quality, but you can never go wrong with their mac and cheese pizza. It&#39;s seriously so good. If you&#39;re going to visit Moretti&#39;s one time and order one thing, get their mac and cheese pizza (add the stuffed Asiago crust for $4 extra for even more cheesy goodness). But this is a treat that I&#39;ve only permitted myself to twice; of course, it&#39;s a heavy dish, and it&#39;s on the pricier side. Coming close to $30 for a large pizza, regardless of whether it&#39;s a speciality pizza or not, is rather excessive. You&#39;ll definitely have leftovers, though! 

Other than the pizza, I always go for the pasta. The gnocchi is a hit or miss; they&#39;ll make it with any sauce you want, but I&#39;ve found the portions to be different with each order. 

The staff has been super friendly every time we&#39;ve phoned in an order. They&#39;ve always been extremely helpful answering questions and assisting us in placing our order, and when we got to be too lazy to drive over to pick it up, they&#39;ll throw in free delivery. 

One thing I have noticed is that for the two times I&#39;ve chosen to dine in, the service has been slow. One time I came in on a Sunday at around 6:00pm, and it was understandably packed. The wait time wasn&#39;t so much of an issue as the lack of attentiveness by our server; he sort of forgot about us. This happened again when we came in on a Thursday night at around 9:00pm, only it was a completely empty restaurant. Our server was aloof, didn&#39;t refill our sodas, and didn&#39;t make occasional trips to the table to see if we needed anything. We didn&#39;t leave the restaurant until 10:30pm; it took that long to get us our food and hunt down the server for our bill. Again, this was a dead restaurant.

Overall, Moretti&#39;s is okay. It&#39;s rather expensive for the portions you get, and the food is a hit or miss. I recommend picking up your order; there&#39;s plenty of coupons online, and the phone workers are always super friendly."

Went in last night at 715pm.  Party of 4.  There were a few people waiting and he took our name.  We went to the bar to wait.  I looked around and there were at least 8 tables open. After 10 min we got the text our table was ready.  They sat us at one of the tables that had been open the entire time.   Our waiter took our order brought our food and then the check.  Those were the only times we saw them.  The food there was generally good but I ordered the lemon chicken and it was not.  Plus it is supposed to come with vegetables and there were only a few skimpy ones on the plate.  I should have taken a picture.  Perhaps just a one off. The other people I was with enjoyed their dinner.

My father and I decided to go for a quick pie to check out the Schaumburg location. 
We used to visit the Bartlett location as we lived in Streamwood. 
However, we moved to Arlington Heights and decided the Schaumburg location was worth a shot. 

We went in on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately in a comfy booth in the bar area. The restaurant was not very packed. (Maybe because it was a Sunday?) 

Our server came over and took our drink and appetizer order. The service was good. (more on that later) 

We ordered the Breaded Calamari. It was fresh, hot, and delicious. 
When it comes to Calamari, it&#39;s all about the flavor/consistency of the &#34;breading&#34;. 
The breading was seasoned perfectly, not overpowering. 
If I had to order one thing off the &#34;Starters&#34; menu, the Calamari would be my choice. 

Next, we ordered the pizza. 
We ordered the &#34;House Favorite&#34; (Sausage, Pepperoni, Onion Green Pepper) and added Spinach and EXTRA cheese. 
Now, I&#39;ll be honest we stopped visiting Moretti&#39;s for years, as they would cheap out on the pizza. (Little to no ingredients, Little Cheese). This visit was our way of giving them a chance to redeem themselves. 

The pizza came out piping hot and looking good. 
We each had a slice and came to the same conclusion. 
What if we didn&#39;t order &#34;extra&#34; cheese?! What would &#34;regular&#34; cheese be? 
We both assumed it would be like eating pizza crust covered in sauce. 
To our disappointment, very little sausage or pepperoni on the pizza. Maybe one little ball of sausage per slice. I&#39;m talking pinkie nail size sausage. However, more onions and green pepper than one could palate.  I guess onions and peppers are cheaper to put on the pizza, instead of sausage or pepperoni. 

Fed up with the pizza, I reluctantly ordered a &#34;mini-dessert&#34;. 
I ordered the &#34;mini&#34; tiramisu. It was the worst excuse for tiramisu. 
The ladyfingers are normally dipped in coffee. Not here, dipped in water and served with warm whipped cream. I was fed up and got the bill. I doubt I&#39;ll return, except for calamari. 

The service was good initially, but went downhill real fast. Our server would routinely disappear for ten minutes at a time, leaving our cups empty. Her tip reflected her absence. 

We finished up our pizza and packed the leftovers to go. 
Needless to say, we were very disappointed in the skimping of ingredients. 
We will most likely not be returning for the pizza, when you skimp, people stop coming. 
(most likely the reason for an almost barren dining area) 
Also, other reviews are right. The delivery drivers drive like animals. 
One almost plowed into us while leaving the parking lot. Then, proceeded to cut other cars off. 

Stop cheaping out on the pizza, or you will be out of business real soon. 
Also, have your waitresses do their job, instead of disappearing every five minutes. 
Get your drivers in line before you seriously injure someone else. 

When they can make a REAL pizza, I&#39;ll be back. 
Until then, I&#39;ll order Tortorice&#39;s pizza, they&#39;re not afraid to PILE it on! 

5- Stars for the Calamari 
1- Star for Everything Else!"

The pizza was excellent. We had the thin crust pizza with the stuffed crust. They are generous with the ingredients and the quality was high. Two 16 inch pizzas with 2 toppings and 6 nonalcoholic drinks were over $70 plus tip. Our server was fabulous and never let a cup go empty."

Brought the family over on Sunday for a late lunch early dinner. The waitress was flat out brutal, even rude to our 7 year old &amp; 2 year old. Right off the bat, she had an attitude like maybe she got stuck late with one more table &amp; just didn&#39;t want to be there? Also, she didn&#39;t do her job. She didn&#39;t share the specials, even after being asked, brought rock hard bread to the table &amp; didn&#39;t seem happy when we asked for a fresh loaf. Actually, she cut off my wife with  &#34;Are you going to place an order?&#34; &amp; dropped her arms down to her sides!  She didn&#39;t bring water to the table...again, she was aggravated when we asked for some. She went to take a menu from the table at the same moment our 7 year old was reaching for something and she said in a snotty tone, &#34;EXCUSE ME.&#34; That was enough. I asked her if we did something to offend her &amp; she just said, &#34;No, not all. Did I do something to offend you?&#34; Do you just want a new waiter?&#34; I was surprised that was her response so I just said, &#34;Ok.&#34; A new waiter was sent over and was fine. One more thing that happened was that we ordered 2 Long Island Ice Tea&#39;s &amp; one of them was straight up sour lemon water. I brought it to the bartender, who was very nice &amp; apologetic explaining she had run out of the other necessary ingredients but that she would bring a new drink over once she had it all together. She handled things properly. My wife noticed the manager being informed of it all and what seemed to be ongoing conversation about the situation, but he did not come over to address the situation, ask if we were now happy, or apologize!  I felt that was a clear indication this was an acceptable way to operate their restaurant. We were thoroughly unimpressed with this Moretti&#39;s experience and absolutely will be sharing this experience with people &amp; will not ever return to this location."

Went in last night for 1/2 price pizza Tuesday.  The wait was an hour, which we expected.  What we didn&#39;t expect, was to wait over an hour for a large thin-crust pizza after we ordered it.

We ordered within 10 minutes of being seated (including asking the server to come back a few times because we just weren&#39;t quite sure.)  We ordered:

1 small thin crust pizza with 3 toppings
1 large thin crust pizza with 2.5 toppings
1 large deep dish pizza (the house specialty) - were told it would be 30 minutes, said no problem, just bring the others out when they are ready.
2 appetizer salads.

The salads came right away.  I had a salad that was on special - blanched green beans with tomatoes, red onion, danish bleu cheese, and lemon vinaigrette.  It was actually very good.

Then we waited.  and waited.  and waited.  and waited.

The small pizza came, and we were informed that the kitchen had to re-make the large, because &#34;they forgot the sausage.&#34;  Um... okay?

Then, the deep dish came.

Then, finally, the large thin came.

None of this was the server&#39;s fault... obviously.  She was sweet and kind, and you could see her anxiety over this kitchen fubar.

However, a manager was nowhere to be found.  My dad asked the server to mention to the manager how long the pizza took - hoping, he/she would come over, do something. 

Well, they did something, they took the pizza off the bill.  However, they never did make an appearance to apologize.  

Terrible management at this Moretti&#39;s.  We were there from 6:30 to after 9pm for a couple of pies.  

Ala Carte Entertainment - get your sh*t together and train your managers to manage.  Not hide.  When our server asked the manager to remove the pizza from our check, he/she should have been at our table immediately to apologize, at the very minimum.

And forgetting sausage on a pizza?  Let&#39;s get some training into the kitchen too?"

The parking is great, the hostess was polite, the food was good.  The only thing I was not thrilled with was the service.  Our server seemed to do the bare minimum.  As soon as we ordered pizza with no appetizer, the service went down.  She brought our food and checked back once.  We had to wait a good ten minutes to get her attention to have the food wrapped and the check.  I had a hard time getting her attention.  The place was not packed.  It had at least 6 vacant tables in our section. She never did come back for the cash. Glad I didn&#39;t pay with a credit card, or I&#39;d still be sitting there.  Finally I left it on the table.

A coworker introduced me to Moretti&#39;s  at lunch. I had the chicken Limon and was in love!  Two tender chicken breasts with a wonderful lemon butter sauce with capers over perfectly done angel hair pasta. I had to bring the leftovers back to my hotel which thankfully had a microwave. The left overs were just as wonderful the next night.   
On my next visit I discovered a whole new world of options by ordering off the paper inserted into the menu that listed the daily specials.  I&#39;ve tried so many amazing items over the last couple months on that daily specials list. I&#39;ve had multiple types of fish dinners, gourmet salads, tender steaks and a variety of other options. Tonight was a 10 oz filet mignon with mushrooms and onions, served with shrimp Diablo &amp; garlic mashed potatoes. I requested that they substitute angel hair pasta for the potatoes and serve the shrimp on top. The filet had a smoky rich flavor  and was butter tender. It was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had! The shrimp were large and flavorful and the Diablo sauce had just the right amount of heat and tomatoes. The price? Ridiculous, only $19!   I have no idea how they can offer such amazing food at such reasonable prices. Most daily special meals are in the $13 - $17 price range. One night I had pan seared kingfish tipped with crab and avocado salad with s side of broccolini. I thought I had died and went to foodie heaven. Perfectly cooked and seasoned and indescribably delicious And it was only $15.99!!  You need to try this place, you will be so glad you did.

But I really prefer the lesser known pizzerias and Moretti&#39;s is definitely my favorite.

The deep dish is what I go for, and although it takes about a half-hour, it&#39;s well worth the wait.  With pizzas, you can choose your own ingredients, or you can choose one of the &#34;Favorite Pizzas.&#34; I generally choose the favorites, and I often order the &#34;Moretti&#39;s BBQ.&#34;  The barbecue sauce blends well with the sausage and cheese for a uniquely tasty and mouthwatering experience.  Moretti&#39;s BBQ deep dish (you can also get a Favorite in thin crust) is what I order most of the time, but the Pizza topped with Mac &amp; Cheese is another tasty and decadent option.  I can&#39;t order that pizza too often, lest I gain a lot of weight.

Service is always wonderful, and there are lots of big screen TVs across the restaurant, so if a game is going on, be ready to join in the shouts with the other patrons when our local team scores.

The pizzas are a little pricier than what you might pay somewhere else, but once you take your first bite, you&#39;ll understand why.  If you&#39;re looking for great pizza, at a place with a great ambience, and great service, Moretti&#39;s is the right place."

The pizza was warm but not hot. After all, there was some nasty weather out there. The pizza was good but not in the upper echelon of pizza in the Chicagoland area.

I have had a variety of things from here - their pizza is great (probably one of my favorite things on their menu), and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad is my go-to. There is something for everyone on their menu. I love that you can sit outside, they have pretty cheap beer specials, and the service is decent. Oh and their bread is amazing. 

However, I think that the food is a little pricey. I would rather have smaller portions for less money. I can&#39;t tell you how many times people have said that their order was wrong when we have ordered delivery. And even though their pizza is great, it is really expensive. 

So, I would and will come back, but if it wasn&#39;t so close and convenient I&#39;m not sure I would come here as often."

Had a buffalo chicken pizza (after seriously considering the Mac and cheese pizza). Really good sauce with a mixture of blue cheese and buffalo sauce instead of tomato sauce. Cheese was plentiful and the thin crust was the best I&#39;ve had. Not too thin like saltine crackers and some texture and flavor. 

The homemade chips were great as was some of the wraps. Looks like a Fridays or Applebee&#39;s (used to be a Fridays) but not in a bad way. Better food but the good atmosphere."

I like it because when hubby craves pizza the rest of us can still order a different variety of foods. We usually do carry out but have had them deliver too. I saw some reviews regarding service lacking but I&#39;ve dined in once and staff was friendly. The thin crust pizza is good. It can use some more cheese though. Crust is nice n crunchy w texture. Calamari fried was good.  It was a bit soggy because we didn&#39;t have it fresh like dining in and it was a bit too chewy. Still tasty though. Lemon chicken I&#39;ve ordered for my kids who really liked it. Kids also had the spaghetti and meatballs once and they loved it. Said it was better than mine (straight to timeout!!) jk. The chicken breasts were not dry at all. The wild rice we weren&#39;t crazy about. I&#39;ve had a few of their salads too. All were great. I like this place in that it has a very good selection of pretty quality meals. It&#39;s also a big plus that they deliver. It&#39;s a solid 3.5 but Yelp doesn&#39;t do .5&#39;s so...

They also have good specials,.  Rare occurrence when food isn&#39;t prepared well so we keep coming back. 

However I do have complaint with their pizza delivery drivers;

Warn your duffus pizza delivery drivers about not trying to intimidate customers with their aggressive driving antics.  We have right to walk in our own neighborhood, even after dark.  Their aggressive driving is not good for your business. 

You had two drivers this evening in plum grove creek area 7pm, Friday, 2-13-15;.  
The first courtesly hit the brights, saw me and and slowed down.  The other idiot driver never slowed or even moved to the center of the road, I finally held my arm straight out to force him/her over to the middle.  He/she knows what they did, I wished he would have pulled into a driveway near me, we would have had a discussion right then and there.

I eat at your restaurant at least once every 2 weeks, I&#39;m a customer who doesn&#39;t care for your fools driving aggressively on our community streets, they have no right away superior to a pedestrian.  Do they not know they have a big lighted Moretti sign on the top of their car advertising who they work for, that in itself is an indicator of how dumb they are.  Have you checked their driving history/records before putting them out there (negligence)?  

I could have a easily called the police and made it really difficult for Moretti&#39;s, however I&#39;ll leave that up to you the mgmt to address.  Next time I&#39;ll take the license plate down and call the police."

HOWEVER. I had a terrible day. Power went out at my hotel, we got moved to the Best Western, I was in a conference until after 10pm and I was starving. I asked the girl at the counter for some menus.  I called the first place, their oven was broken. Second place was snotty when I didn&#39;t know the street address for the hotel (I mean, it&#39;s the nearest best western, is that difficult?), and then I called Morettis, which I could practically see from my room.  Although it was close to their closing time, they were friendly on the phone and when I asked what would be fastest they said anything would be quick.  I got some kind of meat lovers and onion pizza, fries, and soda.  They were super quick, the pizza was artery-clogging heaven, and it was HOT and fresh.  

I felt like the price was reasonable and the delivery guy was polite.  I can&#39;t think of anything that would have made it better!"

Slow initial service, entre arrived too soon after we were served our soup, Lasagna way too salty. I doubt I&#39;d return.

We had reservations and we were promptly seated, though I had to reposition the table so we actually had room for the five of us to sit at the table, for some reason it was very congested where we were seated.  

We waited more than 10 minutes for a waiter to appear at our table.  There were a number of empty tables that evening so I can&#39;t imagine they were too busy. 

A stiff string was found in one of the bowls of clam chowder, when we asked what we were looking at the waiter said it was a &#34;stem&#34; and later explained it was the string used to tie the thyme together, either way not really edible and we were not offered another bowl or any apology.

The entries arrived well before we&#39;d completed our soup and to my dismay the Lasagna I ordered had far more salt added for my taste. The other entries ordered were well received and enjoyed.

Nice atmosphere, not too loud, oodles of televisions, refills were prompt and the service for the remainder of the meal was quite good."

It&#39;s so good. 

I can&#39;t say that my review is totally fair. I&#39;ve never even eaten in the restaurant. I used to frequent the bar when I lived closer by. We&#39;d go with a group of friends and hang out in the bar for a few hours, and sing (listen to) karaoke. But, the restaurant part was always busy. So, while here, we always used to order food at the bar and it was always really good. We usually got the pizza.

Service is usually fairly good, obviously it depends on who you get. Restaurant is nice and clean. It&#39;s definitely worth a stop. And considering this is just a local little restaurant, and the # of reviews it has - that should tell you something. LOTS of people like to come here.

It&#39;s always nice to come back and try their food!

We started off with yummy bread (which I had to ask the server for as she walked by). Usually, the server brings it to you with every meal... My fiance got the Parmesan Crusted Salmon ($15.99), I got the Gnocchi A La Vodka ($11.99), and we also got a Parmesan Crusted Salmon to go for my father.

The Parmesan Crusted Salmon was yummy as always! However, the portion has definitely gotten a lot smaller than we remember! 

My Gnocchi A La Vodka was delicious as well! It had arugula, tomatoes, and delicious sauce! However, the portion was much smaller than I expected.

I got a call from my parents later, asking if we gave them our leftover salmon. They said the salmon serving looks like a half serving and that they thought we gave them leftovers. =/ I wish I looked at it before I gave it to them.

The service was pretty bad too. The waitress started off nice but then NEVER came to check on us after she took our order. She walked past us literally 5 times and I had to scream &#34;excuse me!&#34; and ask for something. every. single. time.

On average, I order out for pizza twice a year. It&#39;s not very often, so I like for when it to be spectacular when it happens. And as you may have guessed from my succinct opening, Moretti&#39;s just didn&#39;t do it. 

The pizza I ordered was simple, but something that I feel is a good test as far as judging a pie. Any pizza can be delicious with juicy, salty pepperoni, it&#39;s like the miracle all-spice for pizza, but mushroom and black olive- well, that takes talent. 

Our pizza was lacking flavor in crust and our sauce was rather watery, when it was even present. The toppings were pretty sparse and at $5 for 2 extra toppings that were hard to taste amongst all the average. I found myself raiding the spice rack for anything to add for more zest. A bit of oregano and a cornucopia of crushed red pepper would have done wonders for this semi-downer, sub-par pie. 

I would like to note that we picked up for take out and didn&#39;t get the full Moretti&#39;s experience, but the inside dining area did look fun and like a good gathering place/respite from Woodfield Mall."

Quick service / cooking and good prices (especially the Mt Prospect location) are definite pluses but it is sometimes inconsistent with the cooking.

When the bread comes freshly out of the oven it has a nice chewy inside with a nice crispy skin. This goes great with the bruschetta which is pretty good but is a bit pricey (except for when you get 4 - 6 pm half price appetizers) for what you get. The soup here is okay but better than what you&#39;d get at most comparable restaurants.

I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the specialty pasta here. Seemed a bit heavy flavored for me although Biaggi&#39;s also puts too much sauce or salt in their pastas as well. The simple pastas that come with entrees such as sea bass (flaky) or eggplant (amazing) are done fairly well.

The burgers are surprisingly good here, both the cheese and Jack Daniels burger. I hope you&#39;re hungry because they are generously sized and come with a choice of fries or chips (homemade, take this choice!). The wraps are pretty good as well although the Italian beef isn&#39;t that impressive. You can go to Johnnie&#39;s Beef or Portillos nearby to get your fix.

The $2 desserts are not as small as you&#39;d think they are. I enjoyed the cannoli dip although the carrot cake and tiramisu are a notch above. I especially love how strong the expresso flavor came through in the tiramisu."

Just today we got chicken tenders, wings (three flavors), and cheese sticks for delivery. I found the chicken tenders to be a bit dry but after popping them in the microwave for a bit they juiced back up. So I attribute the dryness to the delivery and time sitting out.

Bartender made me feel like I was a bother to her cleaning. Asked for marinara got meat sauce. She actually stopped talking to me mid sentence and replied to a text for a minute or so. Amazing. Plopped down my bill at 10:25 and said were closing early pay now. Everywhere I look it says open til 11.Wow, I really hope she gets the interview at Costco she&#39;s going for. Pretty clear that customers are bothersome to her. Poor service ..... yup."

We all have our favorites, of course, so I felt a little like Benedict Arnold when I eschewed my folks&#39; favorite &#39;za delivery in favor of Moretti&#39;s. But hey, if ordering this delicious pizza is wrong, I sure as hell don&#39;t want to be right.

Let&#39;s get down to brass tacks:

1) Service: 4/5: The nice lady on the phone was a bit confused, directionally, but once she figured out that I was on the East side of Schaumburg, order &amp; delivery were in motion. That being said, I&#39;m not sure they deliver to the West side...perhaps they should put clearer delivery boundaries on the website.

2) Pizza: 4/5: Solid. Nice neutral sauce with just a touch of sweetness and tang, right amount of cheese and a crispy thin crust. It was the perfect vessel for lots of crushed red pepper. I would speculate that the 12&#34; can feed two hungry people, but, hey, I have no idea how much pizza you prefer to consume. Leftovers were just as tasty.

3) Bruschetta: 5/5: Sweet Jesus, this is some delightful bruschetta. Little toasted slices of country bread topped with deliciously garlic-y, basil chopped tomatoes and covered with a hefty slab o&#39; buffalo mozzarella. Get some and try to share, if you can. If I remember correctly, there are 4 pieces to the order. 

4) Value: 4/5: While you can clearly read that I enjoyed said meal, $22 for a 12&#34; pizza an bruschetta seemed a tad pricey. Nevertheless, next time I shall take a moment on Moretti&#39;s website and printing a coupon or two before calling. The only thing better than a delicious meal, is a delicious discounted meal.

Have I found my new pizza delivery fave in Schaumburg...I think so!"

Do yourself a favor &amp; get it with a side of their ranch dressing...seriously amazing. You&#39;re welcome.  I should also mention that I prefer the Edison Park location both for food &amp; service.

The problem I have with both locations however, is that they seem to only hire female bartenders and, apparently the ones with either the least amount of experience or the ones with the least amount of customer service. Maybe just the dumbest they can find? As a female myself, I&#39;m comfortable enough to grab a quick drink/bite by myself at the bar. I&#39;m friendly and also industry. My point? I&#39;m easy, know what I want and tip generously.  

Every time I come to the Schaumburg location, I get some twit bartender who  doesn&#39;t seem to see me/remember I&#39;m there. It takes forever to greet me as I watch her make sure that EVERY guy at the bar is checked in on, joked with, (read flirted with). She will avoid me until I literally have to call her over to get a menu, a drink, a refill...u name it. It doesn&#39;t matter which female bartender. So...wtf...you&#39;re right...I don&#39;t want to sleep with you and I&#39;m not going to pay you and your baby&#39;s way in this life, but I&#39;m pretty easy to take care of and I will tip you. So pleeeeeaaaase stop ignoring the women at your bar.  Greet EVERYONE within one minute...isn&#39;t that written somewhere?  

I will never go to the Schaumburg location again because 5 or 6 times of this nonsense is too much. I tried to give them a chance, but your twit bartenders suck."

I get to say that because I&#39;m the Duke of this place. If you&#39;ve got a problem with that, then check in here and take it away from this audacious Arizonan. 

But NOT before you chow down on what I feel is some of the best thin-crust pizza I&#39;ve ever had. Seriously, just bursting with flavor. That crust is amazing. That sauce is top-notch. They&#39;re not too stingy with the toppings, either. If you&#39;re feeling brave, go for the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese. The asiago crust is also decent, and the deep dish will do, but that thin crust is where it&#39;s at.

Don&#39;t forget to check out some of the adventurous appetizers. Skip the mozzarella sticks and go for some stuffed mushrooms. You&#39;ll thank me later. They have a good weekday happy hour on those, and on Tuesday nights, they have HALF OFF ALL PIZZAS. 

Delicious...almost as delicious as watching your puny team choke in overtime. I&#39;m sitting back at home laughing at how easily we&#39;ll cruise through the first round. But if it&#39;s any consolation, a round of pizza and beer at Moretti&#39;s is so good it might mask the bitter taste of defeat."

Definitely one of the better restaurants in the burbs. Atmosphere was also quite nice and spacious with various different seating areas and plentiful TV screens. 

Place is definitely known for their pizza and had a variety of toppings including italian beef and giardiniera (must try next time). Had their bruschetta to start which was very good. I had the mushroom risotto. While not bad, next time I would stick to pizza. The rice was well done and not al dente. There was nice flavor and mushrooms were plentiful that included about 3 different types. It was a tad saucy and salty for me. My bf ordered the special of a chicken pasta dish (forgot the exact name). However, our waitress put in the wrong order and got him the other special of fish and shrimp. She apologized and my bf chose to stick with this dish and she assured us there would be a discount, as it was her mistake. When our check came, we were very surprised to find that my bf&#39;s meal was completely comped. It would have been more than enough to have charged us the price of the chicken dish (as it was less than the fish/shrimp) but it was free! That is great service. Would come back again, but likely will stick to pizza.

What was a somewhat setback (though understandable) for me was that while it was nice for them to explicitly state this in their menus, they use pre-made Barilla pasta in their dishes."

About 40 minutes later it was already at my door! I was impressed even before tasting the goodness that is Moretti&#39;s pizza. This pizza is by far the best in Schaumburg (having lived in the area my entire life) It is perfectly thin and crispy and the sausage and pepperoni were phenomenal.

We tried a second time and succeeded this time. We ordered a large pizza and chicken parm meal and it was $35. I was taken aback by the price. The chicken parm was average at best. The pizza has potential but it was lacking sauce that I had to stop eating it.

I just can&#39;t give a five star review because their prices are a little outrageous- you&#39;ll easily pay well over $20.00 for a pizza that&#39;s very good, but you can get better for a lot cheaper. It&#39;s a very good thin crust pizza, could definitely be a little bit crunchier. Everything else I&#39;ve tried has been fantastic- they have a delicious chicken wrap and a cannoli dessert that you dip pieces of cannoli into a mascarpone cream dip- yum! They have a nice patio, but not a lot of good drink specials. Good ambiance inside, but I think they&#39;d do a lot better if they made the prices more reasonable and improved the drink specials. The only reason I would go there that is unique is the pizza and I&#39;ve already found a place nearby that is much cheaper."

We waited and waited for the bartender to come by to order our next round. She was too busy talking to her two friends at the bar. 

We actually tried to get her attention by calling to one of her friends as the bartender  was completely unaware of our attempts to get her attention. The bartender was so involved with one of the two friends. 

When she finally came by she looked at us wondering if we needed another drink. When we said yes somewhat rudely, she proceeded to tell us she just came by 13 minutes ago. WTH!

I had email proof of reservation but the private room was booked by someone else already. After 30 minutes of going back and forth they finally accommodated us with seating in the dinning room. Manger did honor original pricing quoted but no other compensation was offered. When we asked for additional discounts for the mixup and hassle we were met with resistance and they did not want to do anything else to make things right. Our party of 30 stood at the door waiting an unacceptable amount of time, my fiancé and I were very upset that we our reservations weren&#39;t accounted, I spent over 20 minutes trying to pull reservation up on my phone and was very upset they forgot about us . I expected better treatment after a mistake like that. Food was good, servers did a great job rushing to take care of us BUT MANAGEMENT failed to make this right. Our bill was over 500.00 and I feel like our concerns weren&#39;t addressed in a professional manner and correctly. We won&#39;t be back and I think I can speak for our wedding party that they won&#39;t be back either. I would like to add that I posted this same feedback to their FB page and rather them them reaching out to see what they could do or to apologize they took down the rating/review rating on their profile.**** I also wrote a email to corporate ACE Ala Carte Entertainment, here is the response John,We received your message re: Moretti&#39;s and apologize for the mishap.The manager Emily is no longer with us and should have called the GM for a problem like this.Please email me your address so I can send a GC that will invite you out for dinner on us and will hopefully let you know we care and use us again in the future. **** I did receive a GC from ACE but clearly they don&#39;t get it, the issue we had was for our wedding rehearsal dinner so that would imply that my wife and I both were involved, the gift card we received might cover the cost of maybe 1 person. All the frustration and effort we have went thru I expected more than a measly 25.00 gift card. Remember we spent over 500.00 the night of the issues."

If you&#39;re looking for a review on the taste of the food, I&#39;d give it 4 stars. Unfortunately, this is a review on my experience as a whole.
I went to Moretti&#39;s yesterday for dinner with my mom and my yia yia. We got there around 5:45 and were given a pager and told it would be about 20-25 minutes. We did wait about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table in the back. It was the closest table to the kitchen. Normally I&#39;d ask to be seated somewhere else since my yia yia hates sitting by the kitchen, but the place was slammed. (1/2 off pizza on Tuesdays will ensure a busy restaurant). Now, you would think that being so close to the kitchen, we&#39;d be greeted right away. Not the case. By the time our server, Rachael (she didn&#39;t give us her name, but wrote it on our receipt), greeted us, we were already ready to order our drinks, appetizer, and pizzas. Our appetizer, a caprese salad, took an extraordinarily long time to come out, seeing as it didn&#39;t have to be cooked. 
While we were waiting, they sat the two tables surrounding us, and it got really tight. my mom was back to back with the man at the table behind us, which pretty much imprisoned the man next to us between the tables and the window. When he was ready to leave, the people at the other table had to get up and push in their chairs so he could get by, and he still knocked into my mom.
After our pizzas came, Rachael never came back to check on us, and I had an empty cup just waiting for a refill. We ordered sausage pizza and mac &amp; cheese pizza, both of which can make a girl thirsty! Rachael was very attentive to all her other tables around us but completely ignored us until we had to flag her down for a check. I got my refill... but someone else dropped it off while Rachael was printing our check. 
While we were waiting for Rachael to come back so we could pay, the hostess came by to try to seat the table next to us. (the same table that required people to get up and move so the man could get out) The table hadnt been cleaned yet, and it was missing a chair, and the hostess wanted a busboy to get in there right away to clean it up and get it ready. My mom was pretty fed up with being knocked around and told the hostess just to take the chair she was sitting in and she&#39;d move to another spot at our table until it was time to go. She also told her how Rachael had been scarce, and asked if she would just take our check.  The hostess was apologetic and apologized again when we were on our way out, and I appreciated that. However, she didn&#39;t apologize for the hullabaloo over seating that corner table. 
Step it up, Moretti&#39;s. You know you&#39;re going to be busy on Tuesdays, so maybe consider scheduling your &#34;A&#34; staff and moving the tables in the back so there&#39;s a little more wiggle room."

I looked at the menu online (posted on their website) before calling to prepare my order. As I ordered, I discovered their prices weren&#39;t the same as what was advertised online. When I tried to inquire about the change, the employee sounded impatient and unsympathetic. I asked to speak with the manager. He listened to my concern but was also unsympathetic. He raised his voice to me and then hung up the phone. All I wanted was a 10&#34; veggie pizza that was advertised for $11.90, not $13.90. It&#39;s only a two-dollar difference, but I&#39;m not interested in supporting a business that has false advertising and poor customer service."

Said pizza (thin crust) had just the right amount of salt, cheese, crispy crust and a touch of grease. I may have blotted the pie a few times before dispersing the slices onto plates. No biggie.

Beyond the delicious pies, I also enjoyed a sampling of their mozzarella sticks (tasty but nothing overly special), and a few bites of a caesar salad. At the end of the day, Old Town Pizza catered to my pizza craving with ease. 

Go ahead and create you own pie or order from their well rounded menu. Or try my creation. You&#39;re welcome."

To be fair, I tried several different pizzas from this place because they are so close to home and I really wanted them to be my go-to carry out pizza joint. Sadly, their pizza is worse than Rosati&#39;s. Hey, at least they&#39;re better than Domino&#39;s or Papa John&#39;s!

Not the friendliest of people behind the counter either which is kind of expected in a carry out only pizza place but it just adds to the crappy experience. Do yourself a favor and drive a little further up to Moretti&#39;s."

I stopped in tonight while my oldest kid was a soccer practice and picked up a slice. Normally I would get pepperoni or sausage but both kids looked like they had sat for more then an hour. So I opted for the cheese which looked more fresh.

First off - this is not NY style pizza - just normal pizza cut in triangles. Second, for those of you who have ever picked up a $5.00 pizza from Dominicks on a Friday night - this is identical. Sure the crust is slightly better but the mozz is so floured out that there is no stringyness to it.

This is about as plain as it gets and just not worth any amount of money."

They ran out of pepperoni.  Who ever heard of a pizza place running out of pepperoni.  But, once they realized it they called us back to see if we wanted to substitute with something else.  No problem - Canadian bacon is a fine substitute!

It&#39;s a popular place to grab a few drinks after work for all the people in my office who commute from the city. It pretty much has that sports bar atmosphere, and we&#39;ve been here before to catch some March Madness games and even to host our fantasy football draft. I usually go here with co-workers during our lunch hour or after work if we want to grab a few drinks before catching the train. In the summer they also have a decent outdoor patio if you wanted to eat outside for lunch.

The food here is pretty average bar food. I&#39;ve had a decent amount of their menu items and they weren&#39;t bad, but most weren&#39;t really amazing either. The prices are honestly a little high for the quality you get too. 

Wings - I&#39;ve only tried a few flavors but overall they&#39;re good. They usually compete at the Chicago wingfest every year and even placed in the BBQ category in the past. 

Pizza - Pretty good thin crust pizza that you can customize with a bunch of different toppings. 

Macho nachos - Enormous pile of nachos that can be shared if you have a group. We brought in some pretty young, hungry dudes and were barely able to kill it. 

Stuffed burger - This is one of my go to items whenever I come here. It&#39;s basically a huge burger that has its center stuffed with gorgonzola cheese and little pieces of bacon. It&#39;s topped off with a huge onion ring too. This burger will definitely go straight to your arteries but it&#39;s so good. Once you take your first bite you pretty much have to keep holding it since the cheesy center is just oozing everywhere. On the side they also have some really good seasoned waffle fries that come with a special spiced sour cream. 

Overall, Wool Street is a good option for me purely based on how close it is to my work. There&#39;s probably a bunch of other places where you can get better food at the price, but it&#39;s good enough if you just wanna grab some food while drinking and catching some games on TV."

As i got my food they were calling to let me know that there computers were down and that they needed to re-run my card, which i totally understood and gladly re-gave it to them. about 2 hours later we got our food again, oops! we explained we already got our food, the delivery driver said no problem that they would make it right. After looking at the receipt&#39;s we had been charged twice and different amounts each time, so we called to get it fixed. the first person i spoke with wasnt very sure and so i asked to speak with a manager, the manger rudely explained that she knew it was hard to understand if you hadn&#39;t worked in retail before. . . never should you assume someone else&#39;s knowledge of the kind of work you do. I used to run a restaurant and know the in&#39;s and out&#39;s. This place has lost  my respect and business due to how they handle internal issues and customer relations.




I have never been to this place before, and I will never go there again. Due to the fact that the manager or owner, whatever it is that she is, so rudely and condescendingly assumed that since we were confused about why our cards were charged twice for two different amounts, that we must have never worked retail before. If your staff ins&#39;t correctly trained and you have your host charging people four times for something and having your delivery driver show up twice, hours apart with food, then you should probably work on your training, since she knows retail so well and all. My family has owned businesses in the past, and this is no way to run one. This place has indefinitely lost my respect and business and anyone who is associated with me as well, since most people I do know DO WORK IN RETAIL. BYE,."

Or at least I thought he did when I picked it as the town to raise my family and keep them safe. Seems it worked. A quiet burg an hour by car or train from downtown Chicago, Barrington has been around since the 1850s. Today it&#39;s a cute little village surrounded by expensive homes, immaculately kept lawns, and million dollar horses grazing in back &#34;yards.&#34;

There are ordinary families like ours, and celebrity familes. &#34;Rumored&#34; to live in Barrington, or owning homes here are Stevie Wonder, Oprah Winfrey, Chicago Bears Mike Singletary, and Walter Payton.  I can attest to the latter two, as their kids were in school with my daughter.  Singletary and I worked the pizza tent at the annual grade school carnival.

The Wool Street Sports Bar is a rather new addition to the town.  When we moved here 25 years ago, I&#39;m not sure there was a bar. Well, maybe one.  Now the village is host to the requisite hoity toity cuisine outlets, fancy grocery stores, and posh shops one would expect to find in an area like this, 78% of the people are homeowners, and the median house value is north of mid six figures......and well up in to the 8 figure range, as well.  The &#39;town&#39; is really four areas, Barrington itself, North Barrington, Barrington Hills, and South Barrington. Together they make up one of the wealthiest zip codes in America.

Wool Street has a very lengthy menu of American bar food, burgers, salads, pizza, dinner plates.

I went with the stuffed burger, Wool Street&#39;s version of the burger that made Minneapolis famous, the Jucy Lucy. (sic).  This one was stuffed with gorgonzola and bacon, with a very nice flame finish, great char flavor.  The interior cheese was very ample.  The burger was parked on a soft bakery roll with an egg wash, and tomato and lettuce.  A wide variety of sides come with each sandwich, I went with tots, which were more than satisfactory.  

This is a damned fine burger.  Worth a trip to Barrington.Worth a stop"

I had a small party of 15 people planned there and I had to apologize to all my guests for the awful experience. I made the reservation well in advance, when we got there two tables were set up for our party. I was told this was the most convenient set-up for them. I had to move the tables myself, so everybody could sit together. 
There was one waiter for the entire room, who clearly could not manage the workload and was not very engaging. 

In short: our order was messed up, the drinks were horrible, the waiter did not come back to take coffee or dessert orders. The &#34;manager&#34;, Carrie, got involved after I complained, but she had a horrible attitude. 

The best part was that they had the audacity to add 20% gratuity to my bill!!"

Looked at the website and the menu and it looked like it could be a good place to try out. We have been trying to find somewhere else to go to that is within 20 minutes of the Schaumburg / Hoffman Estates area. We decided to have lunch and watch the Bears game today. TV&#39;s in the bar area are too high up in the ceiling. Your neck will hurt before halftime. They have a lower level off the bar that looks like it could be a good place to watch games.
My girlfriend ordered the Prime Rib French Dip and I ordered a bowl of their $8.00 chili. I was forcing myself to eat 1/2 the bowl. It was not good and the price was higher than all other places that I have had really good chili at. My girlfriend ate a few bites out of one side of her sandwich and did not like it so she tried a few bites out of the other side to see if it was better. She said that this was the worst sandwich that she has ever had.
The service seemed OK but one of the bartenders did not seem like he wanted to be there. Did not seem to have much of a personality. I really was not sure at first whom our waiter or waitress was. 
I noticed on their menu that they have different sizes of nachos. I believe the table next to us ordered the $9.00 nachos for one. If that was it it was the smallest amount of nachos on a plate that I have ever seen anywhere. Most places are at least 4 times that amount for their small order. 
The Bear&#39;s Miller Lite beer special did not seem like a special. A 20 oz Miller Lite was $2.95 but you had to purchase a dinner or you had to purchase an appetizer and a Miller Lite before the next beer was $2.95. So if you wanted to drink 2 beer specials do you have to order another dinner? Never seen any kind of special like that before. Seemed odd. 
Not going back to this place unless I just want a beer and to watch a game in the lower level off the bar.
Was not sure about parking. There is some street parking around the building but then there was a huge Metra Lot across the street. I do not think you can park in the Metra lot without the risk of being towed. If this place is crowded not sure where you could park and not get towed."

It was about 1:30, a little early for us, but late enough to miss the lunch bulge on a really gorgeous day. Amanda served us faithfully and I can now go peacefully to my cremation having ordered Pot Roast (stickymeat) once in my life and it was VERY good here and an $8.75 lunch special on Thursdays. To round out our light lunch, we also went with a GuidoBurger, medium rare plus delicious sweet potato fries, you&#39;re not going to live forever.  The pot roast roast had some color surprisingly, I would say even medium rare and fall apart tender. I&#39;ve almost gotten used to getting overcooked burgers when they will let you order medium rare and our GuidoBurger was perfect with Pastrami and pickles to boot, NO leftovers on the burger, a little pot roast appetizer for another day.

This is not a fast food restaurant, and it is not fast food. We thought our service, noted above, was faithful, certainly not fast but fine for the day and Amanda&#39;s trek from the kitchen out to the patio. We are fans. Do it."

I&#39;ve heard about this place for a couple years but never got a chance to try it out.  I finally did on Saturday nite, Labor Day Weekend.  I was with 2 male friends and we just wanted a good place to hang out and watch college football.  We arrived around 7:30pm, the  bar area wasn&#39;t crowded and we got a good table for viewing their TV&#39;s.  We were there for over 20 minutes and not one person greeted us, let alone acknowledged us....and we were seated right in the middle of the bar (this is no exaggeration).  We were thirsty and wanted a beer, but we couldn&#39;t get any employee&#39;s attention, from the bartender to several waitresses that were &#34;around&#34;.  Extremely frustrating!  We were actually talking about getting up and walking out before I finally got the attention of a server, who said &#34;I&#39;ll be right with you&#34;.  Now, keep in mind, the bar was not crowded by any means.  There were several empty tables near us.  I let the server know we weren&#39;t happy and from that point, she at least kept an eye on our table, albeit the service was still pretty slow.  The long and the short of it is the food was decent (not bad, not great) and the whole sports experience was OK.  My friends and I agreed they could&#39;ve set up their TV&#34;s better for a much better viewing experience.  
Bottom Line...thumbs up for ambiance, thumbs up for food quality, 2 thumbs down for overall service."

Wool Street in Barrington shares the parking lot with Barrington&#39;s Metra station, therefore, Wool Street is awesome.

I&#39;ve been here a few times; the most recent being this past Friday night.  My girlfriend and I went here for dinner before going to the movies.  I heard good things about their fish fry, and we both loooooove fish fry.  We sat at the bar and ordered a couple drinks.  Blue Moon was on special for $3.50 (already a good start!).  The bartender told us the fish fry was &#34;perch, so you know....its perch.&#34;  Meaning we shouldn&#39;t expect that much.  However, I always say a good batter and tasty tartar sauce is what makes good fish fry.  They serve you about seven pieces of fried perch with a very light batter.  it has a nice crunch to it, but not a thick layer of breading like some places.  It was very good.  I ate my portion, finished my girlfriends, then ordered two more helpings.  We had one more drink before heading out.

All of the food is good here.  My sister once had the tacos, which I thought was a bad choice since its a sports bar, but they were delicious as well.  I&#39;ve had a burger and a chicken wrap from here in the past, all were great.  

This would be a great place to have drink, eat some great food, and watch the Bears destroy the Packers :)"

They have all of &#34;Wild Onion&#34; beers on tap which is a nice local touch.  Menu is pretty standard.  Burgers, pizza, wings, and other type of bar fare.  It&#39;s a bit pricey in here.  You really have to work the specials, which there really aren&#39;t that many.  It&#39;s not a place where you go with your buddies to &#34;tie one on&#34; and watch a game.  You&#39;ll be broke.

Big bar area.  They have big tables which are really nice for groups of six or more.  The only issue I have with this place is if you are sitting at the bar, you have to crank your neck straight up to see the tv&#39;s.  If you&#39;re at a table in the bar area you area bout 3 feet below the bar so there is usually somebody blocking the tv&#39;s. Best to get a big group and lock down one of those big tables across from the bar.  Good viewing and lots of room.  Plus your elevated.  There is a big room below that has plenty of seating and a big screen to watch the game, I have never sat down there.

All in all it&#39;s pretty standard.  Only one urinal in bathroom with one shitter.  Always a line.  Somebody dueces in there and you might as well leave.  The patio is decent in the summer.  Average service."

The service here was decent, but given that the place wasn&#39;t all that busy, there was time to go the extra mile with some conversation or the like. Didn&#39;t happen.

The restaurant section is really small but comfortable.  We arrived around 5:45 PM and there were a couple tables of elderly people that seemed like regulars.  By 6:15 PM the place was packed with young couple and kids.  I overheard that there was a half an hour wait as well.  If you are 21+ you can dine in the bar area which I thought was pretty cool.  There are tables here as well as television and no children!

I ordered the Angry Calamari for an appetizer and it was really good but the hot sauce seemed to fall to the bottom and was a little difficult to pick up with the calamari.  This dish was spicy, I went through a lot of water.  For my meal, I had the Twisted Mac and Cheese which was pretty good.

We were seated quickly and received our first drinks and food in a reasonable amount of time. This is where our experience turned for the worst quickly. After getting our food, our server &#34;Crystal&#34; disappeared, and we were waited on by a random waitress. This wouldn&#39;t be a big deal except we almost stopped getting service completely. We had to wait around 45min to get another drink. After an hour we had to ask a random bus boy to get our check because we were taking the train home. After receiving our bill we only tipped 10% mostly due to lack of service. We would have easily ordered more food and drink had we been given the chance. Once we paid our bill, our original waitress &#34;Crystal&#34; appeared out of nowhere and collected it. She then looks at her tip and says &#34;really a 9$ tip on a 90$ tab?&#34; This was pretty shocking as I thought she should probably get less. Then we watched her go around with the money and show every server while pointing to our table. While walking out to leave we walked past her, when I told her the reason for the tip was we hadn&#39;t seen her all night. She then tells me to &#34;F*** off.&#34; I have never had a staff member openly curse at me. I am usually at 20% tipper but if there is poor service I will give less. After returning home I call the restaurant to ask for a manager when the very same waitress picks up the phone and tells me there is no manager for the entire night. I find it hard to believe that a manager isn&#39;t working a Friday evening. This was confirmed when the other guests I was with called and claimed they talked to a manager 10min later. This place is a joke if they allow their servers to behave like children having a tantrum. I would never not tip a server, but 20% isn&#39;t guaranteed.

Their food is not amazing, but I have never ordered anything I thought was bad in any way.  I do like their waffle fries with seasoned sour cream and the Fish Tacos with Papaya-Mango Salsa (ask for the fish to be grilled, not fried...it&#39;s much better that way).  The service is consistently good in both the bar area and the dining area.  A foodie may not enjoy Wool Street, but I&#39;d say the average person would make it their regular restaurant if they gave it a try.

It is always packed on the weekends, and you&#39;re likely to find some middle-aged regulars who probably should be home with their kids.  I don&#39;t love it, but it&#39;s not bad, and I think part of its popularity is due to it being the only place like it in town.

I remember the wraps there being really good.  I was with a large group last night for dinner and we split pizzas which were very cheesy just how I like them.  However the service was sooo slow.  I understand we were a large group, but it was about 45 minutes before we were asked if we wanted to order, and pizza takes awhile to make.  It&#39;s a/(the only) good sports bar/meeting place if you want to go someplace like that in Barrington. The new room they added on with all of the TVs is pretty cool.

They actually held the reception for us after a memorial for a family member. They were very accommodating and quick with the service. We ordered pop, ice tea, quesadillas (only cheese and tortilla), veggies, sweet potato fries and chips/salsa for 75 people. I thought for the amount of food we didn&#39;t walk home with (didn&#39;t seem like many were eating, but I could be wrong), the prices were quite high - it added up fast. To save food for the others, a couple of us ended up on the bar side to have a beer and order off the menu.  

Definitely check out their wings. Now we&#39;re talkin&#39;! Ask for the wings &#34;Jimmy-style&#34; and you will get them hot and grilled. They could have actually be a little more spicy, but they worked. We also tried these pizza bite things - dough rolled in Parmesan cheese with marinara dipping sauce. Not good...the bartender actually took them off the tab for us. She said they were trying them out and would pass on our feedback. Service was AWESOME! Even during shift-change. The prices were reasonable for the restaurant/bar. I would definitely stop in again as there were quite a few other items on the menu I would love to try. Wouldn&#39;t recommend for large groups as it was a little on the pricey side. They did work with us as far as moving the group downstairs and taking over one of their dining rooms.

My friend and I ordered food for delivery one night and it was incredibly disappointing. I ordered a chicken burrito and my friend ordered a buffalo chicken wrap. On the menu, it says the burrito comes with everything inside, like beans, rice, tomatoes, sour cream, etc. I asked for the beans and rice on the side, which they did, but there was nothing else in the burrito except chicken and lettuce. My friend usually orders the buffalo chicken wrap, and this time she said it was really terrible. About an hour later, we both started feeling nauseous and the feeling lasted until the morning.

Especially my daughters dish the three amigos. That was delightful! I will be getting that next time. 

Our server was most likely new because she at first didn&#39;t ask if we wanted drinks and left for long periods of time.

This is one of 20+ restaurants competing in Wingfest this year, an annual competition to see who has the best wings in Chicagoland.
Wings are priced at 10 for 8.95, so with tax it comes out to about $1/wing. My friend and I split four flavors: rajun cajun, giner teriyaki, pineapple habanero bbq, and a rather spicy number called &#34;Sick in the Cabeza.&#34; Here&#39;s a breakdown of each one...

Rajun Cajun- very unimpressive, tasted like a very basic buffalo sauce (my least favorite)

Ginger Teriyaki- decent, a little hard to taste the ginger but still very good, the teriyaki flavor complements the moist meat very well (my favorite)

Pineapple Habanero BBQ- expected spicy but came up short. These had the most flavor though, and it was a refreshingly sweet one at that

Sick in the Cabeza- coated in a mysterious mustard-yellow sauce, these bad boys will leave a burn on your tongue. Disappointing though, because when you take a bite, there&#39;s no flavor. It tastes like someone made a sauce by dumping a shaker of spice into a pan. Not salty, not sweet, just void of flavor.

I doubt Wool Street will win any awards at Wingfest this year. Great service, average food. Stop here for a drink, otherwise head elsewhere."

My sister has lived in Barrington for the last few years and had never been to Wool Street, so we figured it was time to head over there and give it a whirl.  We were seated promptly during lunch hour on a Friday.  The menu has some really great offerings, so much to choose from, but not menu overload by any means.  We couldn&#39;t decide, so we decided to each pick a sandwich and split.  We went with the Veg Out and the create your own Chicken Sandwich.  The chicken was quite good and the veg out, holy crap is was amazing.  Probably the best veggie sandwich I&#39;ve ever had.  It was soooo incredible that my sister and I went back the next night for supper because we couldn&#39;t stop talking about how good it was.  It&#39;s amazing... roasted red pepper, portobello, grilled potato slice and goat cheese with a basil vinegarette on a ciabatta roll.   I&#39;m going to have to hit Wool Street every time I head out to Barrington, which lucky for me, is a lot.  We also had the green bean apps. which were strangely awesome.  

The service both times was kind of..ehhh... at lunch, our server was certainly nice, but not very efficient.  At dinner, our server was a a tad bit bitchy, but very effecient.  Sooo whatever, I&#39;m not looking for fabulous attitudes and stellar service at a place that cost $30 (tip included) for supper...

What stood out most to me was the split-level layout on bar side that made it a great place for live music:  there&#39;s an upper section near the bar, and then a lower section where the band plays.  It works out really well because you can stick to the upper level if you want to chat with friends and listen to the band in the background, or hit the lower level if you&#39;re mainly there for the band.

The burgers were ok.  Reminded me of meatloaf so thinking they put a lot of fillers in with the meat.  Waiter returned 3 times before remembering drink orders after coming to tell us that they had run out of a beer.  He brought the water pitcher to refill and spilled a little.  Not a huge deal.  But instead of wiping it up, he put down a bunch of paper napkins to soak it up and left them there.  WTF??  It&#39;s not like he had other tables to go rushing off to tend.

They have a good Cuban sandwich although I don&#39;t think they really press it correctly (not flat enough).  They have good Cubans at Hooters too, but I havn&#39;t trotted the family in for one yet.  The beer selection is very good and not too pricy."

This is strange, I know, because I can&#39;t have the rancheros part since I&#39;m restricted from eating spicy and tomatoes! The boy loves huevos con chorizo, so I ventured out for a very Mexican morning!

I seriously think that Amigas is the only Mexican place open in the morning! I&#39;m glad they are! They are just a small place in the middle of a strip mall. I would say that this place could fall in the hole in the wall category!

I did get some very confused looks and questions when I ordered my huevos rancheros sans the rancheros, but you gotta do what you gotta do! The lady was very nice and tried to accommodate me with their non-spicy salsa. She was so sweet that I didn&#39;t want to deny her sweet demeanor lol!

I got home with our takeout breakfast and we feasted! You would think my breakfast was plain and bland! Au contraire mon fraire! The eggs were a nice medium so the yolk made a mess when I picked up the crispy tortillas! The beans had a good flavor with the cheese! There was a side of beans and rice with some cheese. Dunno why, but I always mix them together! The beans were a little runny and the rice was a little dry. On their own they tasted good, but the consistency just wasn&#39;t quite right. My tenancy to mix them together worked out very well for me here.

The boy enjoyed his huevos con chorizo too! The eggs come scrambled with the chorizo and cheese on top. You get a side of beans and rice, though he doesn&#39;t dig beans so I got him a double side of rice. We had plenty of leftovers for the next morning too! I just cooked up a couple extra eggs for us to throw on top!

We&#39;ll definitely be back to check this place out for lunch or dinner!"

The interior of this place is better than the outside - it&#39;s very colorfully decorated. It seems to kind of a mini mart with ice cream and traditional snacks and restaurant. I&#39;ve tried the house recommended soup with beef and the green salsa pork. Portion wise the place is good. I thought it was kinda pricey though. Chips and 3 kinds of salsa for free as appetizer. Overall nothing bad and nothing super outstanding.

Service was really good - friendly, accommodating. We had forgotten our coupons, so the server/employee gave us some for next time. 

We had complimentary chips and salsa and ordered the guacamole. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the salsa - it was mostly liquid. The guac wasn&#39;t fresh and was underseasoned; a little salt helped it along though. We asked for a bit more chips (none really came with the guac), and she brought us a heaping refill. Wow! So nice!

My steak burrito was so delicious - the steak was very tender and abundant, and the tortilla was grilled. It was very salty though - left me thirsty! Note there is some gristle in the steak, and the chicken can run a bit dry.

The dining area was clean, and there was a TV for entertainment.

I&#39;ll be back for another burrito!"

Located in the stripmall near LA Fitness, this is a healthier option than the neighboring Steak N&#39; Shake. I actually heard about this place because one of the employees camped in the LA Fitness and was passing out flyers and free samples.

Upon sitting, you get a basket of chips and salsa. The salsa seemed a little bit bland, and needed salt. We ordered some guac as well, and although I liked the consistency (not too gooey, not too chunky), again, it felt like it needed more seasoning. The tacos here are A-OK -- I do like that it comes with customary cilantro and onions, none of that Americanized crap of lettuce tomato and cheese.

Overall, good meal. They have taco tuesdays where their tacos are $1 each. Score!"

Though the chicken marinade combined with plenty of Sour cream (inside the burritto) formed a secret sauce reminiscent of Taco bell (in a good way!). I imagine a steak or cecina burrito would be better. Upon my first visit I was in a Carne mood. Which lead me to Carne Asada A La Parilla dinner. To my surprise it came out very spicy, with chopped steak, and plenty of Tortillas on the side. I highly recommend that dish which will no doubt provide leftovers, at a price tag of $13 after tax (worth it). I am looking forward to going back as this is my New Fave Mexican lunch spot. I&#39;m looking forward to maxing out on Tacos which are $1 on Tuesday. From the outside it may look like a hole in the wall, but its a large hole in the wall, with an excellent interior.

The first time we called 15 minutes before closing so all they were able to make us were some steak tacos and a burrito. We were pleasantly surprised that they offered cilantro and onion on the tacos, very authentic.

Tonight unfortunately was a different story. I ordered myself a chicken torta and am super disappointed and am literally writing this review after picking through it and throwing half of it away. To begin with the second I opened up the foil I noticed lots of liquid. When I lifted the torta to grab a bite the whole bottom of the torta bread was soggy and spongey. Also the chicken tasted more like canned tuna. Overall, there was nothing to enjoy. We also ordered an order of fries which was another big disappointment... Soggy and greasy. The horchata is ok but nothing special. Again, I tried to give a new place a try and was let down...

The Short:  Service wasn&#39;t good.  Food was just alright.  The place looks cool.

The Long:  My major complaint about this place is that there were like 20 servers (or what appeared to be servers) running around trying to get stuff done and ours didn&#39;t seem to care much about our experience.

Our server did the minimum she needed to do... took our order and brought us our food.  Beyond that we never saw her because she was too busy folding silverware in napkins.  She never asked us how we were doing.  She never asked if we wanted drink refills.

In fact, I walked up to the bar to get my own refills.  Cause it sucks to eat food that is a little spicy without anything to wash it down.

We started off with the pretzels.  Which, they give a ton of pretzels.  And, was totally worth the $9 we spent on them.  The cheese sauce wasn&#39;t bad... but didn&#39;t really stand out, in my opinion.

I got the Mac and Cheese with Chili.  It was weird, because when I ordered that I pictured something totally different than what I got.  I imagined the chili to have a lot of meat.  There was not much meat at all. There was like a tablespoon of meat, tons of beans and a fair amount of tomatoes. The portion size seemed fair.

My wife got the Cuban Panini and said it was pretty good, but the fries had no flavor at all.

I really was in the mood to try someplace new.  I wanted to enjoy my experience.  I know sometimes people go into a situation not being 100% into the idea.  I was and am a little upset that a server and mediocre food ruined it for me.  I hope to go back and see if it was just an off night."

We waited in the front and were offered beer samples, a grapefruit ale that was just delicious.

We were seated after about 15 minutes and were brought to a high pub table. The table was fine, but the chairs don&#39;t appear to be built for anyone with junk in the trunk. Seriously if you have even a slightly not flat butt, you will feel like you are falling out of this chair. 

Our waitress was friendly and professional. I can&#39;t remember her name, but she was great. She seemed to be rushing around and brought our drinks out not all at the same time. My iced tea first, then their lemonade and beers. I would&#39;ve thought they would come out at once, or at least the nonalcoholic options first then the beer. Whatever. So domestic drafts and their house ales are on special for $3 on Saturdays which is a really nice special.

Other Saturday specials include $3 Absolut mixers, $4 jaeger shots, $5 jaeger bombs, $5 individual pizza, $6.99 for customize your own burger. Which is exactly what we all ended up doing. I had a chicken sandwich with pepper jack, avocado, bacon, tomato and chipotle mayo. All those toppings were included. Up to 5 toppings, even off their &#34;premium list&#34;. They had a lot of great specials for the entire week. My sandwich was delicious and my husband swears that his chicken sandwich was the best he has ever had. My friend ordered the veggie burger. Neither the waitress nor the general manager knew what brand of veggie burgers they were. Frozen, boxed burgers. That&#39;s really all you need to know. So basically, a morningstar chipotle black bean burger, which is what everyone has. My friend seemed to enjoy it, nonetheless.

My only complaint was that it was very, very loud inside. So loud that we could not hear each other while talking at the table. Between the TVs, music and everyone talking we had to shout to hear each other. I could barely hear the person next to me without shouting and I definitely could not hear my husband across the table without leaning and shouting. Not great for conversation at all. Otherwise, great place. We will return."

Six microwaved pretzels with 3 dips (they had the exact same marks on the bottom as the ones in my freezer).  Our receipt listed the pretzels as &#34;Warm pretzels&#34; yep, warmed in the microwave!!!  That, topped off by the completely lackluster service by our server Kelsey, pretty much solidifies that we won&#39;t be back.  Not our first time here, but will be out last.

The environment: Yes, it&#39;s very loud. It&#39;s the style of a typical sports bar, crowded, loud, lots of TVs, etc. Kind of difficult to have a conversation, seems like a better place to meet for drinks than for dinner.

The service: sllloooowwww. I genuinely felt bad for the bartender, she was so busy, people constantly grabbing her attention, she never had a minute to stop. But because of it, many of the bar customers weren&#39;t getting the attention we were all waiting for. Another girl and 2 guys were in and out of the bar area trying to help but it seemed unorganized and not like a team-effort.

The food: just okay. We each had bacon burgers. They were neither juicy nor flavorful. They were extremely messy. We both ordered them &#34;medium&#34; and one was overcooked. Had parmesan garlic wings to start -- flavor was good, wings were soft not crispy (people have different preferences, I prefer crispy).

FYI: They have coupons online. Good ones! We printed them and were intending to use them but it took sooooooo long to get our check we completely forgot to use them because we were so focused on tracking down someone, anyone, to get our check and help us pay so we could leave. It just took too long.

They do have really great specials each day, including dollar burgers, half price pizzas, and drink specials. Maybe that&#39;s why they&#39;re so busy?"

Ordered the appetizer platter. It was average. Essentially frozen items that had been cooked. Daughter commented that the mozzarella sticks were &#34;typical&#34;. Pretzels were like the ones you can buy in the frozen food section of any large grocer - although cheese sauce was good. Husband said wings were good. All in all - typical bar food.

Husband ordered the burger and commented it had a nice grilled flavor. Good that it was a Saturday special . When we asked about fries, we were informed they were frozen so ordered the homemade coleslaw instead - which was ok.

Daughters fried mac and cheese was clearly another item that was frozen and then cooked there. 

My caprese flatbread was ok - edges were crisp and inside was softer. It was ok. 

Bulldog wheat beer was good - had a citrus undertone and 5$ chocolate martini was enjoyable. 

Finished the night with baked chocolate chip cookie which was sweet - as dessert should be. 

All in all - it&#39;s typical bar food. Not a gastro pub but edible ( as long as you enjoy items purchased frozen).

Decor is nice . Place is clean. Server was attentive and nice.  It is noisy. 

Good place to watch a game with a large group.  Not a place for upscale pub fare.  It&#39;s a solidly average &#34;joint&#34; and every town needs one of those."

There are so few restaurants in this densely populated area they have a full restaurant. The food seems pre/packaged. Low quality and grease and salt are the secret ingredients. 

The noise level  prohibits any conversation. The food is prepared in a deep fryer or microwave oven. The waitress thinks it&#39;s timely to serve the appetizer the same time the meal is served.  

Otherwise it&#39;s a great place. I think the building has bad karma. This is 5th place in three years...  I&#39;d suggest a fast food joint over this place."

Jocelyn and the rest of the wait staff were very friendly, fast and accommodating. For beer lovers, the selection is huge, so you definitely won&#39;t go thirsty. I tried the Bulldog Sunset Wheat. It was fruity and light. A 32 oz. mug was only $4.00! My only gripe is that it could have been served a little colder.

We started with the soft pretzel and queso appetizer. The pretzels were a warm salty delight and the queso was spicy, but not too spicy for kids. Three of us had burgers and one had the Reuben. We were all pleased with our choices. All burgers were served on a pretzel bun, which was a perfect complement to the juicy, meaty burgers. I ordered mine medium well, but I think I&#39;ll go medium next time, since mine seemed slightly over cooked. My Ale House burger was supposed to include onion straws, but I was served raw onions instead. No complaints here, as I love raw onions.

My only other criticism is that the A/C needed to be cranked up. The temps outside were around 80 and it was just slightly cooler in the restaurant.

We will most definitely be back. Welcome to the neighborhood!"

The food was good over all, The wings were a little dry but decent enough. We both had burgers that were very good. The beer selection is great. 

What ruined it for us was the horrible service, Our waitress was also working behind the bar and couldn&#39;t care less about the tables. We were seated at a high top in the bar area but we didn&#39;t request that, There were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant area. After getting our initial drinks and taking our order we never saw her again. The food was delivered by the kitchen staff, I had to get up and get condiments from the bar myself. Who doesn&#39;t provide ketchup &amp; mustard with burgers? Half way through the meal my wife and I were ready for refills and we never saw our waitress again. We will probably return to the New Lenox location but never again to the Aurora location."

I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere. They also have an excellent beer selection. I had the jalapeno poppers and they were still popping when they got to the table! The poppers were so delicious and you can tell they were homemade and not frozen.

The only thing I was disappointed with was my main course. They have Mac and cheese bites, Mac and cheese burger and regular Mac and cheese! So I went with the mac and cheese, thinking it would be maybe homemade with real cheese baked with breadcrumbs. I was severely disappointed. It was very bland and just tasted like Mac and cheese out of a box with breadcrumbs on top and that&#39;s it. 

Other than the mac and cheese, everything was fantastic!"

The lighting is way too dark. I could not read my menu.  The boneless wings were salty, and my burger which had jalapenos and tortilla strips was average. The fries were HORRIBLE! There was a so much salt on them, I couldn&#39;t eat more than 5 pieces. I enjoy fries with my burger, so I was very disappointed. I guess this is how they always season their fries. Anyway, I cannot recommend this place and will not go back."

A little too dimly lit for my tastes, it lighting made it a little difficult to read the menus. 
We had dinner on a Saturday evening, we were estimated a 30 minute wait, we were waiting no more than 10-15 minutes. 6.99 build your own burger Saturdays.
As a vegetarian food selection is often limited and often has to be custom ordered. I ordered a burger with the veggie patty. This burger was honestly the BEST veggie burger I have ever eaten. The fries have a fantastic seasoning. Mixed drinks from the bar were pretty terrible. Though if dining at an Ale House one should choose the beer.
Overall a fantastic dining experience and we will certainly be regulars. Signing up for emails on their website have yielded coupons for free appetizers and entrees.
I highly recommend Bulldogs Ale House."

The other reviews are correct. The service is atrocious here. 

Last time I went was about a month ago for a going away party for my coworkers. There were about 18 to 20 of us and we were the only people in the bar because it was a weird time of day. We had a server who was blonde, had a man bun, muscles and a lil scruff. I was actually excited to get a male server because every single female server I had here was horrible. 

He comes and takes our orders and 6 of us towards the end of the table wanted beers. We ordered beers and he left the table. He comes back 15 minutes later and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We told him that we ordered beer. He said oh yeah and laughed.  15 minutes later he came back empty handed to our side of the table and asked us if we were ordering food. We said maybe but where are the beers? He laughed again.  

I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say it took me over 30 minutes to get a beer.  And we were sitting 10 feet from the bar! I wanted to jump over and pour it myself. 

Needless to say only a quarter of the 20 person table left him a tip because that&#39;s how much it sucked.  I asked my coworkers how their experience was down at the other end and they said it was the same as mine. 

You would think the managers of Bulldogs would get it together and hire competent servers especially when there are so many complains about service. The servers may be attractive but they don&#39;t have much going on upstairs. I&#39;d rather have a guy who looked like King Kong serve me if he could actually get me a beer when I order it."

Waitress was training during rush hour which was surprising.  Our table had to ask for drinks at times.  Everyone orders food and drinks.  The table order consist of 1 salad (liked), ribs (little dry to much sauce), burger (good can&#39;t go wrong with a pretzel roll), 2 of us order the all you can eat fish and chips (this is a Friday special, but we were never asked if we wanted anymore, so beware, one and done) Korean street tacos (good).  Decent selection of beers.

I gave it 3 stars for now.  New place still working out the kinks, but something should be natural in the food industry.  Also it was very hot and humid in there as one reviewer said.  Next time I go, it won&#39;t be on a Friday after work. Will give another try.."

I asked if he was the manager, and he said yes with no expression on his face.  I explained the issue and said we received a partial order.

Place was packed, a little darker than I was expecting and loud. Service on the night was sub-par, despite a lot of wait staff.  Ordered a beer, waited 15-20 minutes for it. 30 minutes later, I order another beer and a cheeseburger. The burger and fries came before my beer. Ugh. Beer and beer selection were good, not great. Cheeseburger and fries were the same, good not great.  Place thinned out after 8:30 at which time the music turned to club music and got significantly louder.  Check came and there was a beer I didn&#39;t order on it. They quickly removed it but that too was odd.  My friends really like this place, but to me, it&#39;s just okay. If service improved, I&#39;d be more likely to go again. All in all, the place is okay. Nice, close option for beer and a burger but nothing special.

Somehow all of the premium beers they have on tap are always out of stock. They only staff a minimal amount of people behind the bar so this means you have to wait a long time to get your 3rd choice of beer but I won&#39;t blame the wait staff for this inconvenience. As for the food? Stick with the wings or a burger they really should not make anything else.  My biggest gripe is that they are almost always out of the better beers.

Ordered a chocolate martini since they have martini specials saturday, it was way to boozy, not good at all. The atmosphere was dark and very loud. They do have many different beers on tap to try and lots of TV&#39;S for sporting events. If a group was going I would give it another try and maybe have a go with he food, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend or think of stopping in again."

The AC was pretty chilled so I didn&#39;t have a problem with the heat as others stated. The have nice drink and food specials every day of the week. The atmosphere was enjoyable. I haven&#39;t had a chance to try the mixed drinks but they look good. I&#39;d definitely come back.

Excellent beer selection, which is why we will be back. Had no problem with the service since the bartenders weren&#39;t busy, but the food was only average. My friend got a burger that he enjoyed, I got wings. There is virtually no sauce on the wings so make sure to order it on the side, and the spicy garlic had nothing spicy about it. It literally tasted like olive oil with a bit of garlic powder. They were also ridiculously soggy. Regardless, we will be back and will try something different."

But not worth it when it comes to very, very, very did I say... Very? slow service. Our waitress took 10 minutes to greet us and get us beverages. We came with our two little kids and it was so loud there. The inside of the place is super cool, mix of industrial and wood. Too bad the staff all looked drugged out and had mouth herpes. This place should definitely get some cute and upbeat people working there. Majority of the people when I was there (Sunday afternoon for the bears game) the people working looked uninterested, inexperienced, and kinda like drugged out from the night before. Very disappointing. Food was good and decent price but if I am going to spend the money and take the time to eat out with my family I want it to be an overall good experience. Not a family place."

Had a Reuben and Cole slaw which were both good.  Definitely avoid this place on Friday and Saturday nights.  I went there last Friday night with my family and there was no parking.  Got there at 6pm and told the wait would be half an hour.  We waited until 6:30 and didn&#39;t get called.  We wanted to stay, but we had a show to get to by 8pm, so it wouldn&#39;t have been possible to make the show on time had we stayed because I&#39;m sure the food and service was backed up. They were giving away free mini beers for all the people waiting in the foyer so that was nice.  They send you a text when your table is ready I ended up getting a text at 7:15.  So that wait was over an hour.  It also was the second Friday in Lent, so I think the fish fry brought people out.  We&#39;ll definitely be back just not when it&#39;s during their busiest times."

-Agree with the other reviewers.  Boost the number of wait staff.  They seem to want to make a difference, but are limited.
-Burgers are good, fries are just ok.  Wouldn&#39;t take too much to make them special.  Go for it!
-Beverage selections.  More options, if possible.  Please brew your own tea! 
-Coupons are really great - do keep them coming.
We don&#39;t have a lot of restaurants to choose from in this area so I am looking forward to visiting Bulldog Ale House in the future, providing they knock out some of the new restaurant kinks.
Good luck!"

The service, management, training, food quality on beer/food along with a management crew that has no sense of urgency made for a very disappointing first visit. There are some inexpensive beer &amp; drink specials that might lure me in there again. However heres an example of what went wrong with the Bloody Mary special: $5 Bloody Mary specials on Subday...great, but the cheese &amp; pepperoni spear tasted like it was prepped a day before &amp; just had a stale taste that didn&#39;t go well with what could have been a good Blood Mary &amp; all the other fixins&#39;. Like other people on Yelp, I had to go to the bar to get a beer &amp; gave up after the bartender seemed too busy with side chatter &amp; 6 low maintenance beer drinkers. Next came the service at the table, attentive on the wrong things, inexperienced hadn&#39;t tried much of the items to tell us about the food. Ordered some flatbread. It was flat, floppy, kinda gross. I&#39;d never order it again. Got the wings. They were more like sad fowl nuggets &amp; tasted old &amp; frozen like a freezer that hasn&#39;t been cleaned out in a while. I noticed one male manager sitting off to the side ALOT when clearly the bartender needed help, the server needed help answering questions and well...there was plenty of idle servers doing not much of anything. The burger my family member got looked promising. He also mentioned none of the food was really great just ok from other visits. Lastly we went through an awkward transition to close the tab when our server got cut for the night. One of the managers took over who basically made it no mystery the other manager who was sitting around wanted to close out his ticket in the system so he could leave and get his tip. I understand wanting to get your tips &amp; leave but overall, it was a very unprofessional exchange &amp; I kinda felt like somebody turned over a Ferrari to a bunch of kids. Overall, you could turn this bar into a dive bar with just the beer on tap &amp; a few burgers on the menu, but there&#39;s nothing special going on here. I thought about going back, but I won&#39;t. I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s probably some questionable things going on with the food &amp; sanitation in the back I don&#39;t want to know about. I&#39;ve seen enough to be wary of this place. I&#39;d say the only good thing going for this place is the selection of draft beers, but don&#39;t expect the beer lines to be clean very soon &amp; if you have a question about a craft beer, don&#39;t expect an educated answer. For some reason I could not read the menu, but after reading some of the reviews, I can see that wasn&#39;t just my problem. If you build a palace to beer and also have your own name on some of the beers...have some decency to hire &amp; train enthusiastic staff about beer, you might sell some!!!"

Service was slow and not friendly at all.  Food was bland.  Husband sent back his watery pot pie.  My shrimp po boy had 6 tiny bland shrimp.  Beer selection - nothing special.  This is just a loud bar -  guessing the food may taste ok to those drinking a lot.  Ladies bathroom has 2 stalls and one sink.

Place was busy but seemed well-staffed. Acoustics aren&#39;t great so place feels noisier than it needs to, although not unexpected in a sports bar. Bad first impression because menu cover was torn on both top and bottom edges and I immediately saw a typo (sheddred cheese on a salad).  Kitchen management is lacking. Chicken sandwich was a pounded flat breast; I asked for it plain, they managed to leave off the toppings, but there was still mayo on the bun.  Curly fries tasted of bad oil.  Server never offered drink refills. Manager wasn&#39;t checking on customer satisfaction.  Servers and guests were not quite upscale enough for my Geneva Commons tastes; guy next to us smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke.  Husband thought his potpie was good, except it only had crust on top, not all around. For our $29 total before tip (2 entrees, 2 sodas), I  would have been happier with a McDonald&#39;s buttermilk chicken sandwich with fries."

Not sure what all the other cars where there for, Lover&#39;s Lane is the only other business in the same complex (full moon?) . To go orders have to be picked up from the bar which I have always found some what bothersome, it is much easier to pick up from the front, but whatever. Again not too bad of a place. Just hope they can overcome the curse that is that parcel. I have seen so many business come and go in that location, Mother&#39;s, the Golden Egg, and a few I have overlooked I&#39;m sure."

We sat down at a high top and about ten minutes go buy a fight breaks out in which the manager really did not do much about, I kinda felt bad for him haha, then our first order or pretzels from the appetizers came out and literally every one was COLD, &amp; I legitimately mean it was C.O.L.D, like a 30
Seconds in the microwaves and forgot to check to see if they were warm kinda cold, THENNNN our 10 boneless wings arrived when the young took our pretzels back and the wings had very very light sauce on them. I&#39;ve personally worked in this industry for many years up and through college and that was very poor preparation of wings with literally a light poor of Sauce, needless to say I was not impress for the first time here. I&#39;ll likely not come back unless it&#39;s just for beer, I will say the server Lindsey was very attentive tho!  Good job"

One of them did manage to look up and still no acknowledgment.  I was very patient and waited up to three minutes until another server that came to the front desk asked me &#34;How many?&#34; with a not so happy face and tone.  
So after being told to wait 15 minutes for a table, we decided to quickly order our food.  I ordered the PoBoy Shrimp Sandwich with Fries and my husband ordered the Cuban sandwich with Fries.  He also ordered a side of honey mustard for his fries.  Needless to say, they charge you a quarter for dime size of honey mustard.  RIDICULOUS!!!  Anyways, he didn&#39;t even get to enjoy the honey mustard with his fries because they brought it 10 minutes after the food was brought to us.  
Overall experience, the place is nice and the food was not bad.  My husband and I did enjoy our sandwiches, however, the fries were stale and not tasty at all.  My major complaint about this place is the customer service.  They are completely disengaged with the customer and have no personality.  It really dampens the mood of the place."

Right when we walked in, I was pleasantly surprised with the hostesses (it didn&#39;t hurt that they also had some beer samples up front) and we were seated pretty quickly. So far so good, that&#39;s when the good times ended. Our waitress took entirely too long to greet us and take our drink and appetizer order.  After our appetizer was brought out to us, by another member of the wait staff, then we had to ask for silverware, twice.  She then came back and told us that the other staff was mad that she stole the last two for us, which begs the question, if she didn&#39;t &#34;steal&#34; the last two for us, what were we supposed to eat with? Should we have brought our own? The food was fine, and the subpar waitress brought us another round of drinks that we did NOT ask (both of which were on our bill even though I didn&#39;t drink mine, which is why i didn&#39;t order it)  but after we finished our meals, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that the bartender kept grabbing every cup by the top rim (common sense tells you that&#39;s a no-no, that&#39;s where people put their mouths!). Once I noticed that, I took a major interest in the way the bartender was handling things, and boy was it ugly! She handled all but one glass, must have been over a dozen, by the top rim, she poured something into martini glass by accident, showed another staff member, laughed about it, then poured it out and poured the martini in without rinsing it, she also would put a receipt on top of each drink, which on most orders found itself into the actual drink (paper left floating in the drink until someone came for the order and took the sopping wet receipt out of the drink, gross) and not once did I see her wash her hands. As we were getting ready to leave I casually mentioned it to a manager. He said thanks and poured himself a glass of water and sat down at a table. If that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing in front of my face, I&#39;m scared to know what&#39;s going on in the back. We will not be returning."

A nice kick with some good cream to cut it. I also liked that they had spinach in it which made the dish a bit more earthy and maybe healthy haha.  

The service is wonderful, and the free bread they give out is buttery garlicy and blissful. 

I haven&#39;t been here in a long time but I will be coming back again for sure, especially since they have some good lunch specials that aren&#39;t terribly expensive, for instance mine was 8.99. The nicer dishes like salmon were 11.99.  Not bad for a sit down restaurant and you get enough food for a second meal."
riccardos-restaurant-schaumburg-3,Doc J.,QkXjBKJcJlwYBDcBefZk0Q,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,1,0,45,73,CFnjtacrNJh7q13vs_CcFw,2.0,2016-09-14,"A friend and I walked into Riccardo&#39;s yesterday after being just across the way at KFC. As it turns out, KFC had run out of multiple sides and even some chicken (shocker, I know), so we decided to just go have a nice meal across the parking lot instead. We still had our drink cups from KFC, which we had finished and were now empty; we just carried them because we didn&#39;t think to throw them out. Actually, we were in the process of ordering NEW sodas at our table at Riccardo&#39;s - it wasn&#39;t like we were bringing a drink from outside.

After being seated by a generous hostess, an unknown gentleman approached our table. I&#39;m assuming he was a fellow host, another waiter, or something of the sort. He wasn&#39;t my waiter, I can assure you, as our waitress had already greeted us promptly after being seated. He asked, &#34;Did you guys just come from KFC?&#34;

Well, yes, and I explained the situation. The gentleman nodded and smiled for just a moment.

Then the smile dropped.

&#34;Let me ask you a question. You know it&#39;s rude and frowned upon to enter a restaurant with food from another restaurant, right?&#34; 

It was a tone that a father would use with a child. I&#39;m almost 30, I&#39;m far from broke, and I don&#39;t need (what I&#39;m assuming?) is a host at a restaurant belittling me. Especially when the cups, again, were EMPTY. We literally just had empty cups in our hands that we had accidentally kept when we had left KFC and decided to bring our business the 100-or-so-steps over to Riccardo&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t as if I walked in with an entire bucket of chicken from KFC. I walked in with two empty cups.

I&#39;d already have an incredibly rough day. There was a reason we were going to KFC in the first place, for crying out loud. Rather than explain to the waiter that the cups were empty, I simply got up and said we can gladly go to one of the dozens of other Italian restaurants in the Schaumburg/Roselle area. He held his head in his hands and the waitress looked at him with that very special look that indicated, &#34;Dude, you just cost me a sale.&#34; I fully admit I could have handled the situation better, I could have explained the cups were empty, but I was absolutely not in the mood to be given crap at a random Italian restaurant in South Schaumburg.

Riccardo&#39;s has great food - I know because my friend lives directly across the street and we&#39;ve ordered from them multiple times for takeout. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not giving it a 1-star because they&#39;ve had solid meals from them in the past.

But now? There was no excuse for that. If he had taken more than a nanosecond to look before opening his mouth, he&#39;d have seen the cups were empty. Ridiculous. I&#39;ll pop a little further down the street for Italian now."
riccardos-restaurant-schaumburg-3,Elana K.,D8WuAA6QO6plFiGT_cyjdg,"Schaumburg, IL",1,1,0,11,79,THdfyDSsDxdYGSW0B8607g,4.0,2016-07-06,"This is a 3.5 star review, but since there are no half stars on Yelp I rounded up.  Most of the stars I have given are for the great service.  The servers here go above and beyond to be friendly and attentive.  Prices are okay.  Food is just meh.  My family is Italian so I might be more particular about this than the average person, but...

Eating here basically felt like going to an American friend&#39;s house for lasagna: while the food was filling and good enough, it was short of being amazing and it surely did not feel authentic. As a first impression, dinner rolls were served instead of Italian bread.  There was no olive oil for dipping.  More importantly, there was no finesse to how the main dishes were flavored or prepared.  Everything just seemed &#34;heavy,&#34; e.g. heavy on the cream, heavy on the sauce, etc.  

That being said, I do want to re-emphasize the friendly service.  You will definitely feel taken care of while dining in here.  If you are in the mood for Americanized Italian food the prices also aren&#39;t too bad, so this could be up your alley.  As for me, if we are ever in a lazy-pizza-night type of mood we may give this place another shot, but otherwise I am going straight to Mama&#39;s house when I want real Italian food."

Last time was a while back though.  I just visited again today and enjoyed a late lunch.  I sat in the bar (I have sat in the bar every time I&#39;ve come here, so I can&#39;t really comment on the main dining area). It was a Saturday when I went and the bar had a couple people there.  The bartender was very nice and very attentive; he kept my water full and checked if I needed anything else multiple times.  

I had the bruschetta and cheese stick appetizers this visit.  The cheese sticks look homemade, but, I am not sure if they are or not.  Either way, they are a bit better than your normal cheese sticks.  The bruschetta was good as well.  Bread was a little damp, could have used a bit more crunch; however, taste was very good!

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back and I suggest you give them a try."

First, the pizza. It&#39;s delicious. We went with a plain, cheese pie, which was excellent. I&#39;m a little picky about my pizza. Not overly so, but ingredient proportion is something that I notice. Too much / too little sauce, cheese, toppings, or seasoning can ruin a pizza in a hurry. Riccardo&#39;s has the perfect amount of each. They also nailed the crust, which I think is the most crucial part of the pie. 

The bar isn&#39;t the rowdiest place around, but it&#39;s still a good time. And they have Peroni! A few Peronis after knocking down a pizza was the perfect way to cap our evening."

We got the food home and ick. The spaghetti was just gross. The sauce was really horrible. I ate a few bites of the spaghetti, ate the mediocre meatballs and threw the rest away. The chicken parm was ate but not in happiness.

Very much like card board? Even a simple cheese ravioli was seriously disappointing. Baked clams were no good. The best part was the minestrone soup. :( I can get the same from a can though. Nothing tasted home made or from scratch. And oddly most of it was laced with that odd flavor of card board or some thing. I wish I could my finger on exactly what the taste was. Maybe just old frozen food flavor. Like it sat in a box in a freezer a little too long?

Looked completely different inside than I imagined (in a good way). Nice friendly service.  We decided to go with the two-for-$30 menu.

A lot of the entrees seemed to have cream sauces, and the pasta fagioli appeared to be cream based, as well. We tried the bruschetta for the appetizer, which was good, but we both thought it could have used a little more pepper.  My wife went with the spaghetti and sausage with marinara.  The sausage was very good, but she found the marinara a little bland (although she likes her some garlic).  My lobster ravioli was OK, but I couldn&#39;t really find very much lobster flavor, and again, the tomato cream sauce, which was good, could have used a little more punch.

One issue: we were given the two-for-$30 menu, and were fine with that.  At least, we were until another couple came in, about the time we were finishing, and asked for the suburban restaurant week menu, which we weren&#39;t aware Riccardo&#39;s was participating in, and would have been nice to have known.

On the whole, a positive experience.  We&#39;ll probably go back if we&#39;re looking for Italian food, and sample something off of the regular menu."

We&#39;ve eaten here plenty of times, although not the best we usually had something edible.  But after this last time we went, we will NOT be back.

It was just my son and I on a weeknight.  There were a fair amount of patrons, but the service was decent.  We ordered bruschetta....the tomatoes were mushy, the edges of the bread were burnt to a crisp and the middle of the bread was mush.  Not off to a good start.

My son had cream of chicken soup and I had a salad.  The salad was a salad, nothing exciting one way or the other.  But my son&#39;s soup was horrible.  It looked and tasted like they had watered down the soup.  Even after dumping excessive amounts of salt and pepper in the soup it was still inedible.

Next come the entrees....I had pasta with a mix of pesto and alfredo sauce (waitress&#39; suggestion when I was debating which one I wanted.  It sounded like a good idea) and my son had some sort of chicken dish.  I truly think my pasta, or at least the sauce, were microwaved because there were some really bad hot spots.  My son&#39;s chicken dish had a tomato sauce that had no flavor and was really runny.  Both of us tried to improve the flavor with parmesan, salt and pepper to no avail.

I finally asked the waitress if they had a new chef since everything was so disappointing and different than we&#39;ve had in the past.  She sent the owner over and it was at that point that I was expecting to see Gordon Ramsay&#39;s camera crew since this interaction was something you&#39;d see on Kitchen Nightmares.

She comes over and questions what was wrong.  I told her while it wasn&#39;t exactly terrible it was off from what we expected from them.  I explained everything like I&#39;ve written above and received replies such as:
&#39;I had the bruschetta today, it was fine&#39;
&#39;All these people are eating the soup, no one else is complaining&#39;
&#39;These are the same recipes we&#39;ve always used and no one complains&#39;

I told him NO, but he wanted to eat carryout from here anyway. This has got to be the worse Italian food I have ever tasted and for a restaurant to be solely dedicated to what can be absolutely delicious cuisine, I found this highly disappointing. 

I had the cannelloni and it was so bland that I didn&#39;t even want to attempt to waste my time seasoning it myself. That&#39;s what I paid THEM to do. My guy had the shrimp Alfredo and the Alfredo sauce looked like water. Runny and again, bland. 

The inside of the restaurant can only be described as &#39;unclean&#39; and &#39;cluttered&#39; and we will not be returning.

The restaurant has been good to us... and we to them!  We&#39;ve always been pleased with the service and food.  I can&#39;t even remember having a bad night there in all our years going.  

The food has always been exceptional.  I usually stick with the traditional chicken marsala or some sort of pasta.  Recently, I finally branched out and had their veal marsala (after years and years of my Dad only ordering that, I decided to take the plunge).  And boy was that good.  It&#39;s your typical Italian food but they also have a great house salad and of course, pizza!

As far as service, I&#39;ve never had a bad experience.  Servers, bartenders, owner.  Everyone has been great.  Katie, the owner, is amazing.  Our family&#39;s foundation held a meeting here about 6 years ago and she couldn&#39;t have been more helpful and accommodating to our requests. 

It&#39;s a cozy place with a nice atmosphere.  They play sweet jazz music too (Sinatra, Martin, etc... which is what I love).  

From a family who has been going there for the last 25 years, we all recommend YOU going!  

Oh and my Dad recommends the veal marsala..."

First off I would like to point out that I do not take pleasure in leaving negative reviews but I felt compelled to after eating at Riccardo&#39;s.  We started off with Calamari for an appetizer and it was the worst I ever had rubbery and tasteless.  My wife and I ordered Veal Parmigian and it was terrible.  The sauce is over seasoned with oregano and not good at all.  The veal was chewy and flat as a sheet of paper.  My son ordered chicken parm and a mini filet, the filet was ordered well done and when brought to the table it was blood red and barely cooked. I could go on and on about the poor quality and taste of the food but I&#39;ll sum it up by saying that we dined with 9 people total and not one person was satisfied with their meal.  You can tell everything Riccardos makes is straight out of a frozen bag from a restaurant suppliers delivery truck.  There is no Nona in the kitchen making genuine Italian quality food here.  Save your money drive a little further and eat at Spavones!"

They also provide them with hot lunch a couple Fridays out of the month.  My daughter always loves &#34;Riccardo Days&#34;.

So I have been here once or twice before tonight, and it has always been a pleasant experience.  My group of eight of us (5 adults and 2 kids) came here tonight for the fundraiser, and we had a fabulous meal.

First of all, as their rolls, it&#39;s really amazing garlic bread.  These are SO good.  The kids ate them all up--well, they ate what the adults couldn&#39;t steal back from them!  What a nice touch!

The appetizers we ordered, the bruchetta and the spinach rolls, were decent.  The bruchetta was definitely better than the rolls.  It was slightly odd, but we wanted to try it because it sounded different!

But for our meals I got the lemon chicken, my husband ordered the spinach and peppers, and the others got some shrimp/scallop noodle dish.  I loved mine--the lemon sauce and mushrooms were really good.  The sausage in my husband&#39;s dish was great, too.  The shrimp dishes were slightly spicy, but I heard no complaints from the others!

Each meal comes with either soup or salad.  I got the salad, and my husband ordered the minestrone soup.  He was disappointed in it, though, because he said it came with exactly ONE noodle.  Sad!

Overall it was a great meal, and I know I will be back!"

Overall, it&#39;s a fine meal. Nothing too fancy or special. But, they have an extensive menu and you can basically always find a coupon for buy one get one or something along those lines in the local publications. 

Pizza the other night was pretty good. The crust was crispy, the bacon was cooked just right and there wasn&#39;t too much sauce. It was my kind of pizza. 

When we dine in, I try to be adventurous, but as you may know, I am a creature of habit. I usually end up with the stuffed shrimp and pasta. My husband is not a big fan of seafood and make childish comments about what the dish looks like to him. (He thinks he&#39;s pretty funny...well, he is, but don&#39;t tell him that I said that!) I&#39;m eating it, not photographing it, so what does it really matter? :-) Anyhow, we start with some delicious, warm bread rolls. Follow up with soup or salad. And, finish with our entrees. My hubby usually does try different things - Chicken Parmesan, Lasagna, Spicy Red Sauce (Arriabatta?) and pasta. 

My only complaint is that the service is hit or miss and they have run out of the special or the soup on more than one occasion."

I came here on a Friday night and you figure this is the day that they would bring the A game that everything is ready and it&#39;s going to be a awesome experience. Man was we wrong.

Started out with the Fried Calamari and the Bruchette, two things that say hey we are a italian restaurant and we should know how to do. 

Calamari WAY OVER COOKED, almost burnt, it had this taste like the oil was dirty or something and it just was terrible, we sat and ate it, I wanted to send it back but the wife as always didn&#39;t want to make a scene. 

Bruchette, Seriously did we have to throw in more garlic than tomato, i like garlic but that is a lot of garlic that was in it. I didn&#39;t eat more than three bites on it and I passed. 

Ok Main course came. 
We ordered a 14 inch, Half sausage and mushroom and the other half cheese. This was terrible. The sauce tasted like it had spoiled or something it just left a messed up taste in your mouth. And lastly there was something weird with the dough, it i dunno if it wasn&#39;t cooked all the way through but it felt spongy and under cooked. Which i&#39;m kinda happy i ate the cheese part instead of the sausage part of the pizza. I dont wanna get sick or something from undercooked Pizza. 

All in all there are other places in Schaumburg to go if your looking for pizza and better quality Italian food. 

As i said before Never again"

Riccardo&#39;s will always have a special place in my heart-- I remember eating here for my cousin&#39;s rehearsal dinner when I was 9 years old..over the years, my family celebrated several events at this establishment, most of which were in my younger years.  I remember that I always liked the food, but no details specifically.  I returned two weeks ago, for yet another baby shower and was baffled by the experience.
The service was decent, a bit spotty especially considering it was a relatively small party but overall I can&#39;t complain.  The waiter was polite and attentive with respect to refilling coffee and water.
The decor:  heinous.  The bathroom needs an update like nobody&#39;s business.  It&#39;s like the same color as a grape Now N Later and just seemed sort of dirty in a way that it couldn&#39;t be cleaned.  Not because they don&#39;t clean it, but because it&#39;s old and just run down.  The dining room itself was bizarre.  It seemed as if there was residual Christmas decorations/angels scattered all over but I guess that is actually the look they&#39;re going for.  Very tacky.
Now the worst part:  the food.  I honestly could care less about the atmosphere of a place (so long as it&#39;s not filthy) if the food is where it&#39;s at!!  I was so disappointed.  The salad was okay, less the enormous chunks of iceberg lettuce and nasty olives.  I love black olives (and green) but these just had a weird taste and it sort of ruined the salad.  The rolls, well those were good, some of the best I&#39;ve had at any restaurant.  The pasta was awful.  Not even comparable to making some with a jar of sauce at home.  It was incredibly bland and tasted basically like tomato paste over overcooked penne.  MEH.  
I was very disappointed with my experience this time.  Maybe I&#39;ll be back for another family function but I most likely will not return by my own volition.  I will say that they&#39;ve been in business for over 20 years so they must be doing something right...I just had a hard time seeing anything positive on this visit, despite the sentimental value this establishment carries for me."

First I need to say that the decor was pleasing and that won&#39;t be the only nice thing I say but that will be later.

We ordered Pizza for the kids, an individual for our youngest and a medium thin crust pepperoni and cheese for the two older.  The dough tasted frozen or stale, there was one piece of pepperoni per slice of pizza, huh?  The sauce was average but it was hot...I would never call that pizza good.

My wife and I ordered off the menu, I had the gnocchi stuffed with asiago in red sauce...what I got looked like no gnocchi I have ever eaten, they looked more like mini ravioli, and if that was asiago cheese then it is the most boring asiago I have ever tasted.  My wife ordered the chicken in cream sauce with linguine and mushrooms...well the linguine was cooked well over, the chicken tasted as if it had been microwaved.  The cream sauce was good though once salt and parmesan cheese was added.  The salad tasted fresh...fresh out of a bag.  The soups were minestrone based and the oil and grease that stayed on top even after stirring in might well be the solution to our fuel issues.....

The server reached through my wife on two different occasions to remove the oregano and cheese as well as plates from the table while we were still EATING!  

The best part of the meal were the garlic cheese rolls that were free and offered to us if we wanted more...we went through two baskets.  

Upon paying for the meal I was waiting to be asked how the meal was and it was almost as if they knew what I was going to say and dared not ask....

There are other issues but I will let the meal represent this review and make no further comments."

I never use salt and I had to put some on to get a flavor going. Afterwords, servers hostess and the bus boy kept coming to the table wanting the bill paid. Was very rude and distracting.

I have been here quite a few times while in the &#39;burbs, and I have never been disappointed!

First plus is that it never gets terribly crowded, and the staff is very friendly. The biggest draw, of course, is their pizza, especially their thin crust! It&#39;s delicious: just the right amount of sauce and cheese, and never, ever oily.  Their garlic bread and calamari are also first rate. Their menu is pretty extensive as far as Italian delights, and if I weren&#39;t such a pizzavore I might actually try some. 

I also love their random Christmas decorations here and there in the dining room. Only adds to the charm!"

We were very happy with the food and atmosphere. I had the baked most and asked for Ricotta cheese and they had no problem with the request. My husband had the meat ravioli and he loved it. He also had the mussels and thought they were great. He was not a big fan of the pasta fagiol but I thought the Minestrone was excellent
Server was so so but the owner Katie made up for it. Very nice and welcoming. We will definately be going back!"

did take out pizza and salad this week and the pizza was really good, not skimpy on the cheese, sauce was really good. salad and garlic rolls still good
i plan to get pizza from here more often 
had the thin crust and the sauce was perfect - not too thick and not too spiced - perfect"

I went to a party here, and the food was actually pretty good. (What the hostess orderd all kind of tasted the same, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s because she chose lasagna, baked mostaccioli, and pizza. All too similar.) 

Anyway -- the food was good. Salad was an iceberg lettuce in very large pieces (which is a pet peeve of mine), and had some sort of house italian. I didn&#39;t much care for it, tasted too packaged for me. 

My husband loves their pizza, I think it&#39;s just ok. Beer is good, service is good. Prices are fair. 

Not outstanding food, it&#39;s like a Greek restaurant (you know the one -- where you can get a turkey dinner, pancakes, or sundaes and a small glass of wine), but with Americanized Italian food."

I used to go there when I was a kid and my parents would bring us for pizza. It&#39;s nice to see after all these years that this business is still serving the community and hasn&#39;t sold out to the national chains. The inside of the restaurant is still the same as I remember with the flying angel babies with pizza and beer mugs in their hands. The reason I returned to my childhood pizza place was because of a coupon we heard about online, offering a buy one entree, get one free good until Feb. 2012. So we found said coupon and headed out to Riccardo&#39;s. The menu items were priced well and they had awesome drink specials. (Sun - Mon $1.50 domestic drafts) We had the Bruschetta as an App. and put in our orders (Chicken Parm for me and my g/f had the Schrimp Scampi.) Everything came out quick and hot. Even the plates were hot to the touch and very tasty. The service was nice, as they offered water refills right away and took away used dishes quick. The server even told us to grab a take out menu because it features more coupons. How cool is that?  No real complaints here as we will return in the future (and more frequently)."

After working in this area for 2 years, I typically to not frequent restaurants with strip club like black tinted windows. I definitely wish I hadn&#39;t. What do you expect from a strip mall? This place was something out of &#34;kitchen nightmares&#34;. I hope they submit themselves to Gordon Ramsey&#39;s show for a HUGE and much needed overhaul. Myself and two other co-workers, went here for lunch and were extremely disappointed. I ordered the grilled calamari which was rubbery and fishy and tiny floating in a gelatinous sauce which was lukewarm. The &#34;garlic bread&#34; was stale and not warm either and had the look of soft rolls but were hard. My warm diet coke came with a few ice cubes and missing the lemon, I ordered. My friend ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich which came on a enriched white flour bun- like burger king, and obvious frozen french fries, not hand-cut. The salads came with a obviously bottled creamy garlic dressing, you could turn upside down and it would still stay in the plastic cup it came in- like old pudding. My girlfriend order a chicken salad, and I must say... drum rollplease... the portion size was great. We were so grossed out buy our surroundings it was hard to enjoy anything at this point. The walls are pastel blues and pinks with Christmas Angels as large as little children everywhere. There are random art pieces and pirate ships, glass blown figurines, and plastic tablecloths with the felt inside similar to Bob Evans. So gross. Frank Sinatra was playing overhead, which was halfway decent. We were only one of three couples there during the lunch rush and it is obvious why. Terrible food, ok service, and rummage sale decor. I clearly wasted $15.00 for lunch. Never again."

I have been there twice (wanted to give it a second chance) and unfortunately will not be going back in the future.  The first time I went, a girlfriend and I had lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was nearly empty so seating was quick.  We each ordered wine and an entree.  The wine was decent and very inexpensive, which is a plus.  However, the food was greasy and not very flavorful.  My friend didn&#39;t seem to mind it so I had a few glasses of wine and tried to chalk up the taste of my meal to the kitchen having a bad day.  The second time I went, my husband and I had a coupon that was expiring for a buy-one-get-one-free meal and he wanted to check it out for himself so we went for dinner on a Friday evening.  Again, the wine was good and cheap (big plus since we both love to drink wine with meals) but neither of us enjoyed our food.  We started with mushroom caps for an appetizer.  Then we each had a salad an an entree.  Nothing was fresh; everything seemed like it had been frozen and just re-heated for us.  The mushrooms were soggy and the pasta dish had a ton of grease.  The food really was terrible, but both times we had EXCELLENT service.  Maybe I am an Italian food snob, but I definitely would not recommend this place."

Horrible..........This was the worst italian food I have ever eaten and I&#39;m 50 years old, and the decore was almost as bad, it&#39;s more like a greek family restaurant.  Nothing matches.  I had the 4 cheese pasta and my girlfriend have the mushroom spinach ravioli.  I was expecting something similar to the 5-cheese Ziti at Olive Garden.  What I got was cooked pasta with a can of alfredo sauce poured over it.  My pasta dish was so bad I had to actually send it back to the kitchen.   I have never done that before in my life.. I felt so embarrassed asking our server to send it back to the kitchen.  I had my girlfriend try my dish as well and she agreed it was the worst thing she ever had.  The server knew it was bad because she offered a side of marinara sauce for free when I placed the order (to give it some taste).  She know from experience this dish was nasty but told me &#34;its pretty good&#34;  when I ordered it.  Our server was nice and asked me if I wanted something else to eat instead.  I said yes something simple please like spaghetti with meat sauce.  There is no way they can screw that up right?  Well I was wrong it was the worst meat sauce I have ever tasted.  Literally out of a can.  My girlfriend&#39;s ravioli was pretty bad as well.  They brought a salad and bread before our meal which was nice but, the bread was just okay and the salad was terrible.  Crappy lettuce and 2 tiny slices of tomato and italian dressing out of a bottle.  This restaurant does not have a chef they have untrained cooks.  The &#34;cooks&#34; have no culinary training whatsoever, especially in italian food.  It&#39;s probably some high school kids or people who have never cooked back in the kitchen that make the food.  It starts with the owner and manager.  They are obviously clueless as to what italian food is, and it trickles down to the cooks they hire and their menu and their recipes.   I would not eat there ever again even if it was free. I&#39;m guessing this place is really a greek family thats trying to run an italian restaurant and suck at it.  Stay far away from this place trust me it&#39;s the worst food you&#39;ll ever eat.   I don&#39;t know how they have been in business so long (at least 10 years) it may be because of the pizza which they offer but I have never had and never will.   YUCK  !!!!"

Got the boneless buffalo chicken wings , not great , I prefer them with the bones. My son got the pizza , ate it all , I didn&#39;t get to try any. I ordered the chicken vesuvio, it was a boneless breast (I prefer the bone in and the skin on for vesuvio) , it was decent, I liked it.

We have had catering by them and it was good to go, they also have another place at 20 N. Martingale Road, but that one is in the basement and the 10 N. Martingale Rd. locale is on the main floor with a view (albeit it facing the highway, better than the wall)

Soups are good..cheesy beef is good, and some of their entrees are really good.  They also have a selection of cold cuts and salad, and paninis.  Fountain drinks juices and pwoer drinks and candy bars are also available.

The 20 North Martingale Rd. is like a cafeteria, where the 10 N. Martingale Rd kinda gives it the restaurant feel.  No free refills btw.

They Open early but the 20 N. Martingale Road location closes at 2pm, while the 10 N. Martingale Rd location closes at 3pm.  I don&#39;t know why."

Was there a change in management? This place is literally a trainwreck. Movie started late..no popcorn  (you pay $18 ) on would  think there would be the popcorn you pay for.

There&#39;s never a wait and the servers are so friendly and efficient, its just the right environment to unwind after a long day. 
I like the shaker drinks because not only are they delicious but I get to take the shaker home so I can practice my drink making &#34;skills&#34; at home as well. The truffle fries are so so good, I crave them all the time!

The theater itself has totally spoiled me. It&#39;s so nice in there! The Premium seats are leather and really big and comfy, you don&#39;t get your own server but you can bring food and drinks into the theater and you get a nice tray table to put them on.

If you pay for the premium plus seats, those are leather recliners. You get your own personal server, a bucket of popcorn, and a pillow and blanket. SO WORTH IT!
This theater has made it hard to go to any other theaters for me. It&#39;s so clean and relaxing and I love having assigned seating, takes all the stress away of getting there an hour early for good seats haha.

I recommend signing up for the membership, it&#39;s free and you get a discount on tickets. Also, the app makes it super easy to buy tickets so definitely download that as well!"

Came last night with friends who are visiting from California. They did not bring out invoices because their computer system went down.  They lost her credit card and gave her someone else&#39;s card.  They then asked her to try to find the other person and trade credit cards back.  No attempt to help or reverse the charges that she never signed for.  Horrible service and zero attempt to resolve the situation they created.
ipic-theaters-south-barrington,Jennifer L.,MhHtPfvJXweF4xwK7Hm5yA,"Buffalo Grove, IL",1,1,1,103,85,gvyy-zk2W6jeHUH04-5ewQ,4.0,2015-12-23,"Unfortunately, since I absolutely adore this place - i&#39;m going to have to down-grade my current review &amp; star-rating of Ipic in South Barrington. I teetered between 3 and 4 stars, but considering it&#39;s still my favorite place I will go with 4 for now.

Here&#39;s the Positives:
++ They have updated the reclining chairs!!! (at least in Theatre 5, which i was just in). Which was a much-needed update. The old ones were starting to have too many stains, and be crooked. Some of the issue is that the old ones were more of a suede-like material, whereas now they are shiny leather. They&#39;ll be much easier to clean. And they no longer &#34;lean&#34;! Score.

++ Waiter Service: the Waiter Service now runs for the majority of the movie, up until about 30 mins before the show ENDS. It used to only run for like the first 15-20 mins of the show.


Here are the Negatives:
- The updated recliners: there&#39;s no longer a storage bin. The old ones you could pickup the arm, and there was a large storage area for coats/purses/etc. it was fabulous. Now i have to put my purse/coat on the floor. 

- The free popcorn that used to be delicious is now pretty horrible. It used to be warm, buttery, salted goodness. Now it&#39;s none of those. It&#39;s cold. Like hours-old cold. With no butter and minimal salt. Yuck. I used to REALLY enjoy their popcorn. I&#39;d always eat two. They need to go back to making it fresh for every movie so that it comes out warm.

- They&#39;ve redone the menu and I have two issues: 1) is that it&#39;s too fancy and i don&#39;t really like anything on the menu. So i just eat popcorn and tater tots. 2) the food they do have, i haven&#39;t had friends/family give great reviews about. Seems to be lacking. My mom ordered a $15 salad, which she said was the worse salad she&#39;s ever had in her life, and she sent it back. 

- I pay extra to be a part of their rewards program, and it seems like the rewards/benefits you get expire too quickly. The couple times i&#39;ve gotten rewards they&#39;ve expired before i was able to use them.  

- Who runs this place?? I tried to reach out to Management of this location with a question; i&#39;d sent two emails and reached out via Facebook and never once got a response. That&#39;s pretty poor Management (now, in full disclosure, this was probably more than a year ago).

It&#39;s still my fave movie - place, but they REALLY need to get some attention focused on the issues I mentioned above. It seems like the customer satisfaction focus they had when they first opened is starting to go by the way-side."

On the other hand the food wasn&#39;t really that great, we ordered the Naan-Cho&#39;s those were OK, and also ordered the Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos, which I didn&#39;t really like. overall this place is nice but WAY over priced, from the tickets to the food.

The food is phenomenal and the whole concept is great. We&#39;ve always had wonderful service! The couple issues I have (which, don&#39;t get me wrong, they would only make iPics even MORE desirable)...are 1) the movie times can be a bit of an inconvenience based on what they&#39;re trying to promote. We like to go there and eat one of our meals while watching a show. That being said, a lot of times we&#39;ll check movie times and they&#39;re a couple hours off from what a &#34;typical&#34; meal time would be. So then we&#39;re either left trying to find another place to eat before or after or we don&#39;t go because it&#39;s not convenient. 2) traveling in &#34;odd&#34; numbers can make for awkward or inconvenient seating. Most of the seats in the premium sections are double seats so if you go in an &#34;odd numbered&#34; group, someone is left alone. Offering more diverse seating would be ideal. 

Other than those somewhat minor suggestions for improvements...we love the iPics! And I really love when the theaters have the videos playing of the latest iPics news or Chef Sherri (sp?)...we love her!"

I am the type of person that goes to see probably 2 or 3 movies a year, but I may go more now. This place is definitely my go to movie theater now. Once you go, you just really can&#39;t go back to like an AMC or a regular theater or something. It is never crowded and always just very comfortable, relaxed etc. The lobby is very trendy and really feels more like a restaurant/lounge than a lobby - which I guess it is - they have fireplaces and everything. The big difference right off the bat is that you can eat there....no, I am not talking about some hot dog on a roller machine or whatever - actual prepared food - very trendy and up market. It isn&#39;t cheap, but it is on par with upmarket casual restaurants and they have a full menu and table service etc.

I told my friend we would eat at the theater instead of going to a restaurant afterwards and they wanted no part of it - I promised we could go to a restaurant as long as they physically looked at the iPic menu first. Once they realized that iPic was an actual restaurant, they were fine and we ate there. The food is good, but the portions are a tad small for what you are paying for them. They also have your standard movie refreshment favorites at a counter just before you enter the theaters themselves.

The other big difference is the seating....they have two classes....the highest tier are two side by side leather chairs - you get pillows, blankets a foot rest, table for your food, your own server who will bring you food, drinks etc....lets call that first class....the other seating choice is more akin to business class....leather chairs nearly as big as first class in rows...these do not have the pillows, blankets, foot rest or server, but they do have the table. You will just need to hike your food in yourself rather than having it brought to you. There really is not a bad seat in the house, but if I had to say, I would say that the first class has the best locations.

When I go to the movies it is usually spur of the moment so I have never been able to secure the first class seats, they are always reserved....if there is something you want to see though, and you know you are going in a few days, it is a two second deal to go online and reserve the first class seats. They cost more, but...nice things cost money. Chances are, if you are going to iPic, you don&#39;t care about the cost anyways as you are already paying significantly more than a normal theater. I will say though, it keeps out the rapscallions, hooligans, lager louts and other types....everyone should try this place at least once - I bet you won&#39;t go to a conventional theater again if you do."

Even my nephews and my pastors kids ask me if they can go back to the nice theater. The premium plus seats are so comfy and it&#39;s the way movie watching should be with big plush recliners. The food is high end restaurant quality and the unlimited popcorn is nice for kids. Oh and you select your seat and never have to leave as you have your own server. Best movie experience ever.
ipic-theaters-south-barrington,Robby W.,QC_g-og4viJ9gjK2pjJteg,"Hoffman Estates, IL",1,1,1,198,2,Ucd1S20KB8XQR-Jr0-DiYw,4.0,2015-07-30,"This is a very enjoyable, albeit pricey, theatre to visit and is the very embodiment of what constitutes a successful date night. Their business model is similar in most respects to what we called a &#34;cinema draft house&#34; back in Wisconsin, with the difference here being that instead of offering up pitchers of PBR and cheese curds to enhance your movie experience, you have fantastic bistro style food, couch-like seating arrangements and a full bar that serves top shelf cocktails. 

This place is located just a short 5 min drive from me straight down Higgins and contained within the impossible to miss and upscale shopping center The Arboretum of South Barrington. If you want to show up early to wander around, the shopping center is decked out with brick walkways, fountains, sculptures and ridiculously overpriced retail establishments. If you are dating a girl that is a shopaholic, you are probably better off sticking with the AMC 30 up the street, as you can waste money like a politician at the shops here. Parking can also be a severe pain, especially if you show up during peak times like Friday or Saturday night. I do not think I have ever wanted to bitch slap someone so badly before in my life as I watched countless cars swoop in and steal a spot as I was clearly sitting there with my blinker on waiting for someone to back out. 

The inside is very clean and likely to be more opulently decorated than any other movie house you have been too. They obviously spared little expense in putting this place together, and the full bar and lounge is a great place to post up before a film with comfy seating, a pool table and lots of flat screens. 

What really sets this place apart is the in-theatre movie experience itself, as it is without equal. I would highly recommend you splurge and go for the premium plus seating. This provides super comfy accommodations allowing you to fully recline and relax. This also allows for movie long wait staff service to bring you drinks, food, etc. As a person who has been to this iPic on numerous occasions, trust me when I tell you that it is the best way to take in a flick in style. The only real drawback is that if you are on a date the center divider makes it almost impossible to cuddle, kiss, cop a feel, etc. effectively. I guess this could also be construed as a benefit too, since I am more likely to actually pay attention to the movie and it lets anticipation build for later right? Like the outside, the inside of the theaters are also very clean and well maintained. The toxic waste level sticky floors you often encounter at a traditional movieplex is not present here. 

Really my only gripe against iPic has been the level of service I have received from the in theatre wait staff. The iPic bar outside, conversely, has always been on their A game on my visits. 

If you plan on coming here very frequently, I would highly recommend you join one of their membership programs. The &#34;purple&#34; level is free and provides you with discounted pricing along with the typical perks you would expect from other business loyalty programs. If you are still in the dating game, it might be worth the coin to invest in one of the annual fee memberships (mine was 15 bucks). This allows you priority advanced purchase ability which is all but required for newly released films showing on the weekends. Top notch seating goes quick in these situations, and without one of these memberships you are pretty much screwed.

Overall, I am a huge fan of iPic and am thankful it is located so close to me. It&#39;s always a pleasant night out and takes going to the movies to new and exciting heights. It&#39;s pricey to be sure, but well worth it in my humble opinion."

The good: clean, excellent sound, comfy chairs, fresh laundered blankets, pillow &amp; ability to order food &amp; drink from my recliner. Modern lounge feel for adults or comfy, fireplace lounge for family. Ladies room seemed well maintained and smelled clean. 

Not so great: thank goodness for blankets, the theater was freezing!  Expected to be greeted with smiling face and overly helpful staff.  The young lady was melancholy and not an inviting host. When paying more I expect more...

I did have the complimentary popcorn and a drink, both taste as they should.  No opinion on food as I did not order anything."

We were able to shoot pool before the movie, as well as have a few drinks.

Half an hour before the show time we took our seats in the Premium Section, and were given table service.  We had our lunch and drinks during the movie.  

We have recliners and the option of having a pillow and blanket as well.  Sure wish we had such an attraction back home.

I was at this theater last night to see Suicide Squad. (Movie was great by the way!) Myself and 2 friends purchased our tickets online before arriving at the theater. We chose iPic because I am on crutches with a broken foot that needs to be elevated and their website said all seats have recliner chairs.  Upon arriving and entering our theater, we realized that our seats were not recliners and you had to choose premium plus for those seats, which were all sold out since it was a Saturday night. That part of my review was minor, however I was very uncomfortable and disappointed.

Before the movie started, I made my way to the bathroom. After passing 2 dirty stalls with toilet paper clogged in the toilets or urine on the seats, I found a clean one. Let me remind you I&#39;m on crutches in a non weight bearing cast. I do my business and go to wash my hands, to again have to hobble between 3 sinks because the first 2 did not work.

After the movie, about 2 1/2 hours later, I took another trip to the bathroom.  Only to find it was even dirtier than before. Stall after stall that was dirtier than the next, but I needed to go. So I crutched my way into one, balanced on 1 foot while I attempted to clean the toilet seat and then attempted to hover over the toilet.  

I am very disappointed in this theaters lack of cleanliness.  For the nice atmosphere and not so cheap movie tickets, you would think that they would pay someone to make sure the bathrooms are clean at all times.  Since most theaters these days have reclining seats, bars/food service.. I think I may choose a different theater next time I go out for a movie."

It&#39;s pretty schnazzy, being one of the few spots that offers dinner and drinks while you watch your movie. HOWEVER. do not expect cuddling. These seats definitely aren&#39;t designed for that in any way, shape, or form.  Arm rests do not rise.

Seating: Premier plus comes with a recliner, pillow, and blanket. It&#39;s a bit of a microsuede material, so it&#39;s a downer if you overheat like me. They also give you free popcorn. Regular premier seats are more my style. leathery, cooler, but doesn&#39;t recline.  All seats have the movable table top, which is great if you have snacks or drinks you want to move closer or further once your finished... to resume hand holding ^_^ for the mushy like me.

In looking back at all of the reviews the same marketing person responds almost the same way in every response. Clearly they don&#39;t care about the customers and they clearly don&#39;t follow up. I really was hoping for at least a follow-up of how they planned it to fix the lack of support and lack of attention to customers.

I sat in one of the VIP seats. VIP seats are $25. Now, this is actually a great price, considering all the benefits of being a VIP. VIPs get comfy recliner seats, with an optional pillow and optional blanket. You also get waiter service. How cool is that? Also, the popcorn is complimentary and is brought to you like the rest of the food that you order.

Now, this isn&#39;t just regular food. Don&#39;t think this is just a cheap gimmick to get people to buy the VIP seats either. The food is actually real restaurant quality. You think I&#39;m delusional, I&#39;m sure. Well, that&#39;s not the case. It&#39;s like a restaurant and a theater! This theater takes its food seriously! I mean, there&#39;s also a full bar in the lobby, as well as pool tables, TVs, and an aesthetic to the lobby that exudes luxury. And yes, the waiters and waitresses will bring alcohol to you while you&#39;re watching the film. How great is that?

Our group of three shared calamari, and I had raspberry cheesecake for dessert. The calamari tasted fresh, and the breading had the right amount of crunch and the flavor was perfect. The raspberry cheesecake even looked amazing. A square plate with rounded edges, with raspberry drizzle diagonally across the plate. Amazing plating, seriously. The cheesecake tasted as good as it looked. Flavorful, the right texture; it&#39;s what I expect from a great slice of cheesecake.

Do you know how cool it feels to be reclining in your chair, with your blanket on and a pillow behind you head, while the waiter hands you cheesecake and you&#39;re watching Jurassic World on the big screen? It&#39;s awesome. I felt like a king. I felt so relaxed too.

The only reason why I didn&#39;t give this theater a perfect rating is that the projector was a tad off to the left onto the wall, and it seemed ever so slightly out of focus. Or we just weren&#39;t watching in 1080P. I don&#39;t know. But I can say that it didn&#39;t really take away from the viewing experience much. The surround sound sounded great. This was just one of the theater rooms out of 10 or more, I&#39;m pretty sure. So, I&#39;m sure that this isn&#39;t a problem for every theater room and it was probably just a problem for that night. Still a great viewing experience.

Definitely check this place out. It&#39;s all around a great, fun experience."

One improvement I would recommend is the bar and waitress service in the lobby.  Consistently it&#39;s slow and non attentive.  Your asking your patrons to arrive early so take advantage of the extra time you have them in the theater.  Sell them something.  We normally spend 30 minutes in the lobby bar and we are lucky to be able to get one drink. Takes a long time for someone to come over and a long time for your drink to come back from bar. This happens time after time.  Recommendation to patrons.  Sit at the bar to get noticed

However, I am writing a special review of this iPic Theater location because of my experience taking 20 of my high school students there on a field trip to screen the film Divergent and to receive a tour and sales talk from the location manager, Holly Fisher.  Our visit was on Thursday, April 2, 2015.

We traveled an hour from Evanston, IL to Barrington to get to iPic.  When we arrived we were greeted by Ms. Fisher and seated in one of the theaters where Divergent was playing. Holly gave my students a brief but insightful talk about iPic and the movie &amp; hospitality industry; and, boy, my students hung on her every word!  After several questions and interactions between my students and Ms. Fisher, we were served drinks, and then food (choice of enchiladas, burgers or pizza!) and every one was given a warm bag of freshly popped popcorn.  Ms. Fisher even helped serve us and assisted her very capable staff (the ever-charming server Drake and also the young lady with long brown hair whose name escapes me...I am so sorry!).  Then we settled in and enjoyed the movie!

On the way back to Evanston, several students commented how cool it must be to have Ms. Fisher&#39;s job and how different iPic Theater is from any other movie theater they have visited.  Indeed, Ms. Fisher and her staff were professional, helpful, informative and assisted us in have a wonderful time.  They all went over and above to make sure we had a positive experience.  I highly recommend this option for a date night or even for an informational field trip for your kids if you would like them to see something different than the traditional movie venue.  Thanks Holly, we had an awesome time!"

Parking can get crowded so get there a little early. The check in process isn&#39;t always the greatest (they&#39;ve forgotten to give us the 3D glasses on a few occasions) but if you use the automated electronic screens its super quick. 

The seats are all comfy, however we always elect for the VIP seats because the experience is way more comfortable: free popcorn, servers for food, reclining chairs, and most of the time the two seats are somewhat divided from everybody else.

The food is alway really good. It is definitely pricey, and sometimes the servers are not quick about getting orders in so you end up being served food or signing the bill during the movie.

The one negative is the upkeep to this theatre. I think the VIP chairs are getting worn down and sometimes its a little dirty. Also, they only use 1 screen for 3D movies and the screen has a noticeable rip in the top of it that really detracts from the movie. Nevertheless, we love going!"

Went here on an early morning matinee date to see Ride Along. We got the premium plus seating and were the only ones back there...sweet! As you probably already know from other reviews, there are both premium and premium plus seating. The latter allows you to order food and have it brought to you by the waitstaff and is an additional $5.50 or $7.50 depending on if you&#39;re a member and also comes with huge reclining comfy chairs, a pillow, and a blankie. Trust me...become a member. It&#39;s simple and doesn&#39;t cost anything and you get &#34;member pricing.&#34;

Anyway, we ordered a few beers and three items off their prix fix menu which allowed for an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert...all to be brought out to you. 

The app of nacho chips was delicious as well as the entree of BBQ chicken flatbread. Both came out at the same time within the first 30 minutes of the movie. So we polish those off real quick and continue with the movie. Well, 10 minutes before the movie ends we realize our waitress never came back with our dessert. In fact, after paying she disappeared.

I go out into the lobby and state our problem to which someone says they&#39;ll bring it into us. I go back inside to catch the last of the movie and we wait some more. The movie ends and the LIGHTS come on and here she is bringing our dessert. We kind of just look at her until she&#39;s uncomfortable enough to scurry away.

Nope...nuh uh...not happening.

We leave the movie with the rest of the people and run into a dashing fellow in a suit coat and tie and he must&#39;ve seen the look on our faces because he quickly asked us if we needed anything. Again, we state our problem and he apologizes profusely while running into the kitchen to take care of it. Not only does he come out with a HUGE slice of our cheesecake in a to-go container, but he tells us to take some bags of candy (gummy bears, sour patch kids, etc) as well for our inconvience and apologizes again on behalf of his staff.

So back to my opening statement: Your sweet manager saved you!

I realize this is a different location, but the service should not be as inconsistent as it seems to be between the two locations.

When we went to see Furious 7 on Sunday night, there was no organized system for people getting food and drinks and the result was a huge mess of people clustered around the whole bar area trying to figure out where to order food, where to order drinks, where to pay, and where to pick up food and drinks. The staff working on Sunday night made no attempt to make the process easier, although they were friendly even when they were really busy.

If you can only order drinks at one register and food at the other (which seems silly), there should be clear signage that says so, instead of a menu posted at a register at which you can only order drinks. We had to get in and out of line twice because we didn&#39;t know where to order and when we finally made it to the register, we were told we could only order drinks there, not food.

We arrived at 6:45 for a 7:20 movie. 35 minutes should have been enough time to at least place an order, but because no one seemed to know what they were doing and the service was unbelievably slow, we missed the previews and the first several minutes of the movie. 

The only saving grace of this experience was that the food was pretty good. At least that&#39;s consistent between locations, even if the service clearly isn&#39;t."

Thank you fellow Yelpers for noting that you could reserve seats in advance. For my first trip to iPic I really wanted to sit in one of the special lounge chairs- and because I read the reviews in advance we were able to get two reclining seats for Maleficent. We didn&#39;t get to the theater too far in advance, so we didn&#39;t have time to hang out in the lounge area. Instead, we headed right into the theater and were promptly greeted by our server who explained how the whole process would work. We went somewhere else for dinner (due to price and reviews here) but did order dessert and drinks. My prickly pear margarita was good- and the shaker was definitely worth it as I saw the size of the drinks of other guests. My husband had a soda (which was huge- wahoo), and then we ordered dessert. He had the red velvet bread budding- which neither of us really loved- and I had the creme brulee cheesecake which I did really enjoy.

Overall, I was pleased with the experience. My husband was worried that the servers would interrupt the film- but that didn&#39;t happen at all. The four stars instead of 5 is of course for the price. It is very expensive to go here- so it is going to have to be a special occasion type of place for sure. I can say that if you join their club the tickets are much cheaper- so I would recommend that for sure!"

Much like suburban folks will drive all the way to the city for a great restaurant, we do the reverse commute when we want to see a long, epic or visually stunning movie. Yet, we have no problem with the local movie house for the run of the mill romantic comedy crap or Vince Vaughan mindless comedy crap.
The food is actually good - we have had the Lobster Roll, sliders tots and truffle fries.  The truffle fries are great with a lil cheese and herbs to complement the perfectly fried spuds.  
Ok, I jump on the &#34;its expensive&#34; boat, but come on, open up the wallet for that special occasion movie."

I had never asked for any compensation, however, Holly offered us a complimentary return visit with free food and non-alcoholic beverages.  

I felt this was an extremely generous offer and assuming the issues I had previously were an anomoly I expect to have a very pleasant experience.

We saw American Sniper this evening and the service was outstanding.  The manager on duty as well as the assistant GM both made it a point to stop by our table and ensure the visit was goong smoothly.  I think I can say confidently that my previous experience was an anamoloy and is not the level of service iPic strives for.  We will definitely be returning in the future."

For real, I&#39;ve never been more comfortable in a movie theater. The combination of being extremely tall with extremely long legs and having bad knees makes legroom a must for me. Not only did I have ample leg room, my seat was a full recliner with a leg rest. Oh yes yes yes indeed.
Also, the price is totally right. Sign up for a free membership, and your Premium Plus seats are $18.50. That includes the reclining chair (you pick your seats when you buy the tickets, so you know exactly where you&#39;re sitting), a pillow and a blankey (yeah, I said blankey), a small popcorn, and a waiter who will cater to your every whim. You&#39;ll end up spending more than that getting a cramped first come first served seat and a small popcorn at any other theater, so why not spring for the best?
The only reason I&#39;m docking a star is because our server wasn&#39;t the best. When our food came our utensils were a little slimy and he took FOREVER to get new ones out to us. And we waited over 30 minutes for our drinks. We watched everyone around us arrive, order, and receive their food and drinks and we sat there, parched. It won&#39;t stop me from coming back, though! I can&#39;t wait to see my next movie at iPic!"

The popcorn included was very tasty, but unfortunately, like one yelper mentioned previously, it seems as though they may not give you a fresh blanket with your viewing. The blankets are of a cheap fleece material, so I doubt it would be THAT much of an expense for them to purchase enough blankets so that each person had a freshly laundered one, which is why I took one star off of their review as my blanket smelled like perfume...that did not come from me.

Another star is removed for the staff not maintaining an environment conducive to movie-watching (which is why we were all there in the first place). There was a family in the last row before the premium rows started who stared at their phones throughout the entire MOCKINGJAY PART 1 showing! It wasn&#39;t a quick glance here and there--the mom and dad had their phones held up in front of their faces for several minutes at least 5 times EACH during the movie. At one point, the guy just held his phone out for about 10 minutes. Just had it out in his hands in the middle of the dark theater. It was completely rude and disrespectful, and they should have been removed from the theater, but they weren&#39;t. By the time the movie started, my husband and I already spent $80 at that theater. For an $80 dollar movie experience, I expect to be able to watch my movie in peace, and to not have to spend its entirety distracted by the glow of two jerks&#39; cell phones. 

The lack of attentiveness of the theater staff, the unwashed blankets, and the stained recliners make this anything but a premium experience. iPic receives three stars because it fulfills a niche market."

Don&#39;t give your money to this place. They don&#39;t care at all about you. 



I&#39;ve been to iPic more times than I can count but this location is horrible and I will never return. I went there on Friday to see Jurassic Park and it was horrible from the beginning. 

My friend and I sat down and I paid for the tickets and she was supposed to pay for the food. She left to go to the bathroom so I ordered an appetizer of loaded house made chips and I told the server twice to split it into two plates.  I&#39;ve had this done at the Bolingbrook location at least 20 times.  

He comes back with the chips and they are all on one plate.  I said, I asked you to split this into two. He didn&#39;t say sorry or offer to bring it back to the kitchen but instead he said, oh I can bring you two plates. Seriously? You&#39;re income is based on service and you&#39;re not even going to try and aplogize. Do I need to tell you THREE times to split the appetizer in two?  I decided to let it go because I didn&#39;t want that to ruin my experience at this location.  

I ate the chips and they were gross. Definitely not like the Bolingbrook location.  They tasted like they have been sitting there awhile and there was barely any bacon on it. 

Then, my friend asked for a refill on her pop.  The server said he will be right back with it. It is literally half way into the movie and no server around. I happened to go out to use the bathroom and what do I see, the server along with other workers standing outside the door talking with one another.  

I go back to my seat and I told my friend that our server is just out there laughing it up. 10 minutes passes and the server comes around with NO DRINK. My friend was like, where is my Coke? And again, the server didn&#39;t apologize and just said oh yea let me get that. 

For charging 18 bucks a ticket you guys should really get it together.  Poor service and crappy food.  Oh, not to mention dirty.  Don&#39;t get me started on the nasty smelling blanket you guys gave me. 

Go to the Bolingbrook location. Believe me, they are 100000000x better."

It used to be awesome.  There are no waitresses for the lounge and they are not cleaning up the theater for us to enter.   At $16 a person, I expect them to fully employ there location.  Plus, the workers all stand around talking rather than working.  You can&#39;t order wings during the movie either only at the bar.  I asked for a manager twice and no one showed up.  There are not enough people working.  I just think not enough people are employed in this country and I am sick of bad service because of lack of employees."

I was introduced to the goodness on Friday night and just fell head over heels for this place. iPic is located in South Barrington in the hub of hotness near Cooper&#39;s Hawk, Pinstripes, a ton of restaurants and shops.

Keep in mind, I didn&#39;t pay for my time here on Friday so I&#39;m not really factoring the price into things...simply my experience. We got to iPic a couple of hours before our movie and decided to just chill out by the bar area and have some drinks. In the area they call Salt, they have a few pool table, big screen TVs plus these cool TVs built into some of the tables. We agreed that in concept it was a great idea but it&#39;s hard to see what&#39;s being shown on these table TVs unless you&#39;re directly above them so you have to kind of stretch if you&#39;re short like me. :)

When we first sat down our waitress asked what time our movie was and said she would let us know when we could go into the theater. She was super sweet and on top of everything throughout our drinking time. They have some good beers on tap and you pick between two sizes. Being the girl that I am, I went for the large and it was quite big, Mmmm. When it was time for the movie to start, we closed out and headed in the theater.

I watched This Is The End on Friday which was weird, scary and funny but I did think it was very good.Total stoner movie. Upon walking into the theater, I was mesmerized with the huge recliner chairs. Apparently they are a part of premium seating but you can do a bit cheaper option that&#39;s not as cushy. Our chairs came with blankets (which I took full advantage of) and little pillows. These chairs were like a cloud of softness with automatic reclining. I was sure I was going to pass out it was so relaxing, but I somehow stayed awake.

With the premium plus seating, you get free bags of popcorn. I feel a bit bad that we didn&#39;t even touch ours...seems like a waste...but you get them if you want them! You also get service to order drinks &amp; food in the theater. I tried the Roasted Portobello Slider and liked it. Can&#39;t say it was the best portobello burger I&#39;ve had but it was just fine and tasty. I also tried the Ale Battered Chicken - now this was amazeballs. It&#39;s basically big chicken fingers (I had to cut each of mine into four bites) and comes with honey mustard &amp; bbq sauce. The chicken was moist and the breading was delicious. Definitely would order that again!

I want to go to iPic for all my movies and sit in the cushy recliners! Plus I didn&#39;t get a chance to try their tater tots that come with bacon ketchup ~ they sound so good! Join their club to get a free movie on your birthday &amp; some other perks."

I also met one of the Managers, Brenda who was also helped us with her tickets. Extremely friendly. When I sat down for my Movie. Lovely leather recliners with a pillow and blanket.

What I did not know was that you could reselect seats :( so unfortunately were were stuck in the fourth row. 

Parking was a witch but then again we got there a little late. We grabbed an order of mozzarella sticks to eat during the movie. Because isn&#39;t that the whole point? Unfortunately this was a terrible idea and a waste of $11 for 5 mediocre sticks of cheese. They did not taste homemade, but rather out of a off brand frozen box. Although large pieces, size did not help the taste. And they give only a small container of marinara sauce to dip them in. Seriously?....

Ok so the facilities itself was clean and nice. But for me, Ipic did not live up to the hype. I would rather pay less and get a bigger screen with better food at the AMC closer to me. 

Maybe I need to go and try their upgraded seats before I make my final decision."

Second- great prices for the package. Luxurious way to see a film... Absolutely fantastic experience for a movie lover! I have to lose that half a star simply because the food is overpriced and nothing amazing. For the price of the food (and the appearance) it should have a lot more distinct flavor...

I, too, agree that the service, food and overall condition of the theater has declined tremendously.

Food: I don&#39;t know who&#39;s cooking now, but iPic has lost the innovative food choices it used to have. I don&#39;t even know if food is being made specially, or if they are heating up preprocessed food in a microwave or fryer.  It used to be like an upscale restaurant; the food appeared to be made right then. I had the chicken quesadillas and they were awful. No flavor and the chicken was clearly dry and overdone.  

Service: Management really needs to do something about the gathering of wait staff at the end of the bar. Not only does it look awful, but the wait staff isn&#39;t paying attention to their customers. We were the only ones in the bar area eating and in order to get wait staff attention, I had to yell &#34;excuse me!!!!&#34;  One younger girl was VERY eager to help, but she didn&#39;t have our table. (Unfortunately)  The most she could do was (literally) run to get what we needed and give it to our waitress or get our waitress&#39;s attention. Our waitress was very nice, just not very attentive. 

Theater: We always sit in the premium plus seats, because of our membership. When I sat down, I could see the overall wear and tear on the chair, plus the side armrest (the one with the storage) slipped off. I also know the blankets and pillows they are giving us are not washed very often if at all. Ewww. I hated to touch anything.  It took awhile for our waiter to show up, but he was awesome. He took care of us right away, and when my second Cosmo wasn&#39;t quite right, took it right back and then brought the new drink quickly. He was great.

I&#39;m disappointed that the overall feel of the place has declined."

My husband and I came here after Ruth Chris Steakhouse for our One Year Anniversary and we couldn&#39;t have been more pleased.

When you walk in you are greeted by some friendly staff members and its just not like getting a ticket.  They ask you if you have been there before, if you are celebrating anything, when you can go to your theater, etc.  Since we were celebrating our anniversary, we were given a free dessert -- thank you!!  It was great cause we were so full at dinner, but figured we could either eat during the show or after.  

We had about 45 minutes before our show, so we decided to get some drinks and watch some of the Hawks game.  Talk about a beautiful bar!!!  Huge selection of booze, tons of seats, tons of TVs, and even pool tables.  My hubby got a huge beer and I opted for the shaker Lemon Drop.  For $14 you get about 2-3 martinis and you get to keep the shaker.  That&#39;s a no-brainer for me!  I almost wish you could just go here to watch games, it is really a fantastic bar.

Once we decided to enter the stadium, there was a lady to escort you if need be.  We found our seats with no problem and still heavily enjoyed the premium seating (I&#39;m legit afraid that if I have a blanket, pillow, and a reclining chair that I might fall asleep...)  Anywho, we were insanely comfortable and enjoyed our viewing of Man of Steel.  Though, the 3D glasses sort of bugged me.  I guess I am just used to the cheap ones at AMC, lol.  Speaking of AMC... to see a 3D movie in those awesome leather seats was only $13, you would pay that at any other movie theater!  Also, during the commercial stuff, while you are waiting, there is a timer in the right hand corner telling you how much time before the show.

After the movie, we went to get our dessert.  We opted for the Big Brownie Sandwich...omg.. delicious brownie slices with ice cream in the middle and chocolate syrup on the side.  And it was HUGE!  We had four slices!  

I really cannot wait to have another movie experience here!"

The theatre itself was cozy and comfy but I&#39;d rather spend my moolah somewhere I can experience the movie with bigger screens and better sound system. 

Our server was nice (and does not think I guess) and seemed to be in a hurry during the time we were there. We saw Noah last night in the premium plus sitting theatre. 50 bucks in total for me and my hubby.
Our server took our apps and drinks order as soon as we got in (30 mins before the movie) my hubby ordered his wine and i wanted Coke. 15 mins later he came back. He brought the pizza, wine and 2 large cups of Pop. Why two? When Nobody said we&#39;d have each have soda. But I let him pass this one and didnt say anything. Before he left we placed our fish and chips order for the entree.
Now he came back with our fish and chips and by then our pizza&#39;s gone. Empty plate for that one. And the server was struggling to figure out where to put our plate of entree when he could just have taken away the empty plate from the pizza we just had. I had to take the fish and chips plate from him to help out and before I could hand him the empty plate, he took off. Tss. How stupid was that. 
The food was not worth the price either. Our total was about $50 for that too salty fish and chips that I had to peel off the breading and taste the very bland fish - which did not taste too fresh. The panko breaded fish we get from Costco is even way beyond better tasting with less the price. So if you have heart disease/problems, you may wanna stay away from their food. Well what can I say, the food is from the resto SALT. Lol
I just remembered, the flatbread pizza was dripping with oil. Too much olive oil. Ech.
Okay, back to our friendly server , the movie just started and we&#39;re still eating our entree when he came back with our check. Dude, can&#39;t you wait till after Noah&#39;s finishes the ark? I saw the other servers give the checks to the patrons after about an hour.

My husband had never been to the theater before, and he was floored when he walked thru the doors. We were treated like royalty. We ordered our food &amp; drinks, and when the food was ready, we were shown to our seats with our food.

The food was delicious (and seriously - they have tater tots - who DOESN&#39;T love tater tots?) and I still get such a kick out of reclining and covering up with a blanket while I watch the movie. I swear, you don&#39;t want the movie to end because you are so comfy and snuggly in the chair.

This has definitely become my new favorite theater.  Their seats are amazing: plush, real arm rests with drink holders that won&#39;t leak out the bottom, and nice, cushy backs.  Comfort-wise, I&#39;d say it&#39;s even better than what I have at home!  Each seat even comes with its own swing-out side table where you can rest your food.  iPic also offers &#34;premium plus&#34; seating that includes a foot rest, blankets, pillows, and a waiter who will bring you food up until the movie begins for just $5 more.

Another notable difference with this theater is their food.  No icees, stale nachos, or hot dogs here.  Everything is way more fancy.  Instead, they have truffle fries, mini burgers, flatbreads and paninis.  Heck, you could eat your dinner while you watch a movie!  My only gripe is that their popcorn doesn&#39;t compare with classic movie theater popcorn.  They use real butter, and the taste just doesn&#39;t quite cut it for me. 

When you purchase tickets, you choose where you want to sit (either online beforehand, or at the kiosks in the theater), so there&#39;s no risk of having to split up because the theater is sold out.  Best of all?  Sign up for their free membership program, and you&#39;ll get discounted rates!  For their basic seats, you&#39;ll pay the same price that you&#39;d pay at AMC -- and what you get for that price is ten times better! 

However, I wouldn&#39;t necessarily recommend this for a date or a big group -- the seats are bigger and better and thus farther apart so you can feel a little disconnected from those you came with.  But if you want to see the latest new-release that you&#39;ve been counting down the days for, iPic is the place to go.  The movie viewing experience just doesn&#39;t compare anywhere else."

I frequently go with my wife and also bring friends and family members to special shows that we like. Bottom line.......I have spent a LOT of money at this iPic theater over the past few years. We recently went to see &#34;The Hobbit, Battle of the Five Armies&#34;. I paid (as I usually do) for premium seating for 9 people, in addition to numerous food items and drinks both before and during the previews. I have to say that I was extremely disappointed in the level of service. My group sat near one of the fire places for 30 minutes and no one came over to ask us if we wanted anything. Finally, I had to get up and grab someone to come over to help us. Not only did one of the drink orders get screwed up, but it took forever to get our food. If this is to be the new level of service, I doubt that I will return with my friends and family. It would be a shame because we really enjoy spoiling ourselves and watching a good movie in the premium seats."

First off, you walk into this place, and it&#39;s like a hotel. They have a whole lounge area with a fireplace that you can sit in while you wait for your theater to open up. They have a front desk where you get your tickets. And they have an entire bar/restaurant that you can get a drink or eat at before or after your movie. Fancy!

A few recommendations - sign up for a free membership and get discounted prices, and treat yourself at least once to the Premium Plus Seating. All of the seats are very nice, but the Premium seating doesn&#39;t give you any of the awesome perks. We upgraded, which comes with huge, fully reclinable - yes RECLINING - chairs, a small bag of popcorn, a pillow and blanket, and waiter service. Totally worth the upgrade. 

The service was great. They can take your order up until the previews are over, but you can order dessert or other items to be brought out later. They are very good about not coming around too much so your movie isn&#39;t interrupted.  The menu has something for everyone. We got the Angus Burger Trio, Truffle Fries, and the Death By Chocolate. Everything tasted amazing. It was a little hard to eat in the dark, but you figure it out.

My only beefs with this place are the prices and the cleanliness. I didn&#39;t feel that our three tiny burgers were worth $15. The pillow was little, as well as the popcorn. It&#39;s definitely a place you come to as a treat. There were some crusties on the blanket and chairs, and a bunch of popcorn in between the seats. Otherwise, this place surpasses all other theaters!"

I was very impressed by the cleanliness of the whole place in general. The lounge area is decorated with beautiful furniture and an amazing fireplace. They have a full bar and even several pool tables. 
The only small issue that my boyfriend and I had was that we had to wait over 20 minutes for a waiter to come and take our food order. I was very surprised when the waiter came over to us before the movie ended to apologize and tell us that the bill was on them. I thought this was so nice of them and for that they get my 5 stars."

The food is not. You&#39;d think a place that is known for the option of being able to order food to your seats would have great or at least semi decent food. But unfortunately they don&#39;t. We&#39;ve gone twice and been disappointed with our food both times. The lobster roll, mushroom burger trio, and the quesadilla were TERRIBLE. I will say that the buffalo chicken bites were great.. so maybe just stick with those.

Aside from the food issue, iPic is great and relaxing. Maybe go out to eat beforehand or go and order the buffalo chicken bites then get dinner afterwards. That&#39;s what my boyfriend and I will be doing from here on out!"

I have to say that it was far better back then. Yes, it was more expensive, but then the service and quality of the experience was totally worth it. Now with AMC and other theaters following suit with more comfortable chairs and bars, there really isn&#39;t anything that sets iPic apart. The service has drastically gone down. 

I would rather go to an AMC and pay $11 per ticket than  pay $18.50 for the premium seats and have to still go to the bar for my drinks as I would at an AMC. 

The experience is just not what it used to be and not worth driving out to S. Barrington or The Prommenade. 

Now if we are in the area then we may stop in, but I would rather go to Star Cinema Grill in Downtown Arlington Heights than come here and give them my business. The only thing, I feel, they have going for them is that Coopers Hawk and Ruth&#39;s Chris is in the same plaza. 

Don&#39;t go out of your way. If you are in the area then I guess it is fine. Otherwise, go to another theater.

The only reason I am giving it a 2 and not a 1 is because I strongly feel it is management&#39;s fault for the poor service, not necessarily the team in place. You can only be as good as your leader and the managers I have come in contact with should probably seek more training."

The seats were comfy, the service was good and it even came with free popcorn! The pillow and blanket were also pretty awesome. I&#39;m not giving it five stars because it is kind of expensive and I think the servers can be slightly distracting. They stop service 30 mins into the film, but it was still a little much.

The seats we had were directly behind the stadium seating and were the only seats available. Not being able to see the bottom of the screen while sitting in the higher cost premium seats made what would have been a 5 star experience a 3 star."

The staff is super friendly, the atmosphere is grand and the food is spectacular.  I have been coming here for a little bit and can&#39;t get enough of it.  I was turned on to this place from a trick I was hooking up with out in the parking lot.  We used to meet for nooners and quickies all over the area and one time we ended up here.  Right after we took care of business I had gone in to use the bathroom and low and be hold this place took my breath away.  As I was done cleaning up I spoke to this lovely young woman at the front desk who described all the great benefits of coming there and becoming a member.  I do enjoy the movies and was pleasantly surprised by everything.  I was so pleased with just my walk in experience I brought my wife and kids the next weekend.  I thought about bring my &#34;Friend from earlier&#34; but I felt like this was more of a family experience I wanted to share with my loved ones not some hood rat from Elgin.  The full on experience was a success with my whole family and we have been coming here ever since.  It&#39;s so worth what you pay. From the experience to the amazing staff they have.  You should give it a go.  Also if you&#39;re looking for a great place to make out in the area for your tricks don&#39;t use this parking lot any more, class it up....that&#39;s what AMC is for.

AMC has changed its look and I am not sure why iPic hasn&#39;t noticed it. AMC lake in the hills cost us $18.00 to take three people to the movies. We bought popcorn (free refills) and you can mix your own drink coca cola machines (free refills). That was an extra $14.00. In the theatre, you have assigned reclining seats. The same ones iPic has. All you need is a blanket. 

In comparison, iPic tickets cost $36.00 for two people. Then we ordered a BBQ pizza and chicken crispers. That cost $33.00 and my wife tipped $8.00, because they stand over you while you fill out the receipt. We did get a very small bag of popcorn and my wife had to use a popcorn bag to take home her leftovers. I guess the waiter took his $8.00 and ran away. So to see a movie with dinner, it cost us $77.00 for two people compared to AMC $32.00 for three people. The movie was great, but the price tag is totally wrong. Honestly, for $77.00 I expect the Disney experience...top service, good food, I shouldn&#39;t hear the movie next door, etc. At least the food is still good."

We went with their &#34;cheap&#34; seats the first time me, hubby, and the two kiddies visited. These seats are nice and roomy and had a nice little table to put your snacks on. 

After becoming an iPic Member (definitely become a Member and save a few bucks!), we went with the more expensive seats - the ones that recline and you get a pillow and blanket for added comfort. It is by far the closest thing to watching a movie at home....actually, it may be slightly better because they have waiter service. Sadly - I don&#39;t get much of that at home. :)

Theaters are small so it isn&#39;t a big, huge crowd. Nice and refreshing. That said - you need to buy tickets prior (sometimes days prior!) to seeing a big, blockbuster hit.

We decided to give ipic a try since we had heard about it. We did and we&#39;re disappointed. For $50.00 (tickets alone; we got the premium plus seats for 2), it&#39;s fair to expect to get the very best of service. The waitress came as soon as we got in (movie started at 9:30 and we arrived at 9:25). We were taking off our coats getting situated, and she rushes us in taking our order. We were hungry but because she rushed it, we ordered two drinks only. She said they don&#39;t come once the movie starts. Odd. What if I need a refill? What if I decide I&#39;m hungry? In any case... our drinks and their complimentary small popcorn had to do. That&#39;s our first complaint. Next is the lack of cleanliness. Ok, so I get it. Theaters are not the cleaniest of places but this theater uses the same blanket and pillow for each seat (they provide a fleece blanket and pillow as part of the deal for these seats). How do I know? The smell on each made it crystal clear. So much for sanitary! And the cloth chairs just looked gross. There&#39;s only a limited number of these premium plus seats and at what is charged,  they really ought to be leather and wiped down! Lastly, the bathrooms were absolutely atricious. So bad that I literally walked in and out. Great concept guys, but lots to improve and change. Until then, we don&#39;t plan on coming back."

The food was decent, but it was nothing that I would return or make a special trip for.  It&#39;s what I like to call &#34;good in a pinch&#34; food.  It&#39;s not necessarily bad, it&#39;s just not necessarily good either.  We ordered a Pad Thai, Panang Curry, Chicken Satay, and Crab Rangoon.  Nothing was awful, though the satay was super dry, but nothing really stood out either.  I guess out of everything the Crab Rangoon was the best, and the peanut sauce that came with the satay was pretty amazing, but the main dishes were just alright.

Both entrees were good, not great. I ordered the crab rangoon after seeing other reviews calling out how good it was, and it didn&#39;t disappoint. It came with a clear-ish dipping sauce that was similar to a sweet and sour with maybe a hint of heat.

The peanut sauce that came with the chicken satay was excellent, which was good because the chicken was dry. There were also some chunks of satay that looked a little rough. Probably should have been tossed out.

We might be back, but we&#39;ll try some others nearby first. If you are closer to Bloomingdale or Roselle, try V Thai on Lake St."

However the sauce was different, like soupy-er and not as brown in color as all of the other sauces I have had. I think I&#39;m used to this dish being more pan-fried a bit instead of gravy-ish, if that makes sense. The little cucumber salad was awesome! The soup though...not enough ginger or cilantro, and no rice in it at all. It was just bland, which I&#39;m sad about. The good things are that a lunch special is only $7.99, and the service was beyond fast! It look only 45 minutes from the time we sat down until we left. Not bad for a weekday lunch!

Service is acceptable, the guy running tables seemed like a stoner who couldn&#39;t keep up with a fairly slow lunch period. Overall as a business lunch place I&#39;d call it an 8/10, the lunch combo is decent food for the price (soup + 2 spring rolls or salad + main for $7 as of writing) so it&#39;s hard to complain. Crab rangoon is better than average thanks to some unique flavors, but it&#39;s not especially remarkable. Each table also has sweet chili sauce, apply it liberally to the crab rangoon, possible mixed with the hot sauce."

1)      Elephants are prominent in Thailand and everyone loves a happy animal!
2)      After you eat here, you feel like a very happy and very full elephant
 
Happy Elephant is in a strip mall on the corner of 53 and Nerge.  You can easily miss it if you don&#39;t know where it&#39;s at.  The restaurant is very small with probably only 15 seats give or take.  If you want a seat during lunch, get there early or eat a late lunch.  But when you do get seated, service is lightning fast.  The serves don&#39;t rush you but they get your food out to you quickly!
 
My personal faves:  Pad Thai and Lime Chicken.  Their veggie soup is light yet flavorful and the spring rolls are the perfect size and spacer between your meal. I like this spot because it has a cute interior, fast and tasty food, and decent pricing."

The restaurant is cute and clean and the staff is friendly.
I hate to say this but I typically order from here because it&#39;s a &#39;last resort&#39; for Thai food in the area. As an American-Thai person growing up in an entirely Thai cultured home, I&#39;m probably a bit more biased about Thai foods/entrees. 
All the times I&#39;ve had their food, I&#39;ve been disappointed. Perhaps the owners have super &#34;americanized&#34; their recipes, in which case, fine. Their restaurant, their choice. The most popular Thai dish, Pad Thai, has been less than good. They use the much thinner noodles than the traditional pad thai noodles and the sauce is so bland. I can&#39;t quite figure out what sauce they use, but the dish comes out very slightly &#34;wet&#34;, or soupy, which is way off for pad thai. The Pad See Ewe is also very bland and again, also wet. It&#39;s just a weird thing for these particular dishes. The egg is like a mixed fried egg instead of stirred into the mix of noodles. The lard nar is okay, but even the gravy is very thin and light in color. It should be a thicker consistency and like a brown color. Theirs is kind of ... grey. 
The chicken has been fine - cooked right, not over or undercooked. The shrimp however has been smaller in the past year and it usually seems hard. Shrimp should never be hard. Period. 
The garnish that comes with pad thai seems to overwhelm the dish itself which has me questioning if they use less noodles and meat. If so, that&#39;s not cool. I don&#39;t want to pay for a heap of carrots, cabbage, and bean sprouts. 
It&#39;s very sad because I really keep hoping that if I go back after a few months, it&#39;ll be so much better. Even a little better. But it hasn&#39;t been."

Medical Center. I found it on Yelp, after leaving the appointment, hungry and with an itch for Thai food. It&#39;s a short hop and a skip from the medical center, extremely easy to find. The dining room is no more than a storefront, but very clean, bright and cheery, with comfy, glass top tables, covering a pretty pattern. I read in another review that it&#39;s chilly, and I found it to be so, too, particularly on this cold winter afternoon. It would be great if they could think of a way to improve their heating system output. I found a great way to bust the chill, however, in a large pot of hot Jasmine tea, which was quite tasty.

I started with spring rolls, and was pleased to find them very fresh-tasting, with delicate wrapping, yummy inner ingredients and a delicious, light plum sauce, to which I give high marks. I moved on to one of my favorite staples--chicken satay. On the up aside, I loved the fresh cucumber salad and the shredded lettuce and bean sprouts that adorn the chicken pieces. The best aspect of this entree is the peanut sauce, presented as a generous serving, heated, very creamy and most flavorful. I give it an A. The one disappointing feature, however, was the satay itself, served in a unique preparation. In fact, I&#39;ve never had a satay like this. The pleasing aspect of a chicken satay is the meat being thinly sliced, flavorfully grilled, served on wooden skewers and, normally, very tender. The Happy Elephant has a very different approach to chicken satay, however: chicken chunks are battered and deep-fried, served off-skewer, on the plate, next to the shredded lettuce and sprouts. Not only is the grilled flavor lost in a fattier, starchy cooking style, but I&#39;m sad to say the chicken chunks weren&#39;t the least bit tender; they were very chewy and actually tough in spots. If the chef asked my feedback, I would recommend they abandon this unusual twist to this popular dish for adoption of the traditional preparation. It&#39;s a shame, too, because the inferior style detracts considerably from the exceptional peanut sauce.

I moved on to another favorite of mine: pad Thai with tofu and the .99 extra peanut sauce. I give this one high marks; again, the ingredients were marvelously fresh, the thin noodles soft and delicate, and the tofu had a lovely taste and texture. My enjoyment of this dish went a long way for offsetting my disappointment with the overly tough chicken chunks. The added peanut sauce was an inspiration, given how really special it is at the Happy Elephant. I&#39;d like to mention, too, I had a glass of Thai iced coffee, which was excellent: a tall glass, sweet cream and good, chilled coffee over ample ice. 

As I was taking a lot of it home, I asked for an added to-go item: a coconut milk soup with lime juice and lemon grass, enhancing a chicken broth. It&#39;s among my husband&#39;s favorite at a Thai restaurant, so I wanted to treat him to this special plus, along with the other leftovers, when I returned him in the evening. He loved the spring rolls and pad Thai, and was delighted with the coconut soup.

I&#39;d like to say a word, too, about the service. A very lovely, friendly and extremely efficient, young woman waited on all the customers single-handedly and she was attentive, knowledgeable and very courteous. When I asked to take leftovers home, she brought containers to my table and packaged up everything herself, stacking all containers neatly in a tightly cinched bag to prevent spillage. Everything made it home in perfect condition. The one, unisex washroom at the back of the dining room was spacious and exceptionally clean and comfortable. Most impressive of all was the bill: with everything I ordered, the total tab was only $30, which I call an exceptional value, especially given the overall high quality of the service and food, minus the disappointing satay.

I&#39;m not an elephant, but I left a happy customer at least, and like an elephant, I won&#39;t forget this fun stop for good, reasonably priced Thai food next time I&#39;m in the Elk Grove Village vicinity."

This was one of those places. A couple weeks ago, I finally made it out here for dinner with a friend.... after missing the entrance and parking in the lot of the abandoned diner next door, of course.

It is very small inside, but very cute with bursts of color and happy elephants! After we sat, we had two different people come up to ask and if we were ready to order. We asked them to give us a little time but I was confused why two ladies seemed to be our waitresses in this tiny place. My friend and I both decided to get Pad Thai -- his with chicken, mine with tofu. I also ordered a coconut bubble tea.

My bubble tea was terrible. The balls were mushy and misshapen. Tasted blah. My server looked sad when I asked her to take it back, but I couldn&#39;t stomach any more of it (and at least I said something instead of complaining online!). I hope the bubble tea isn&#39;t always like this (and I really hope I didn&#39;t hurt her feelings). My dish was good, but kind of lacked flavor. Both of us cleaned our plates, though. It was just the right portion. Then we stayed another two hours to chat while they kept filling up our waters (props for this). Our bill was reasonable -- about ten dollars each.

I have mixed feelings about this place. The decor is fun, service is awesome, the food is OK, and the bubble tea wasn&#39;t worth it. I really hope it was just a random lackluster day as I plan to come back a few times this summer since I&#39;ll be working around the corner."

Green Curry lunch special (it&#39;s not on the menu, but said he can put the order in).. friend said it tasted ok.. rated it a 3/5.. the portions were ok

**you had an option of ordering some of the food items mild, medium or spicy... I ordered medium for my curry.. and it wasn&#39;t that spicy ...

Egg Rolls: tasted good

Soup: nothing too special about the soup.. it was very light.....just had veggies in it..
**oh and everything on the menu has no MSG per the menu.. that&#39;s good!

Customer Service: we were served our water, and soup upon arrival and the food was served on a timely manner..the waiter was nice.. not any major complaints.

Atmosphere: seems like a family owned business?...the fan was on.. but it wasn&#39;t too hot or anything.. but if you sweat a lot.. maybe you would sweat as you ate something spicy...

Parking: it&#39;s located in a small strip mall so there&#39;s enough parking... I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have any issues finding parking...

Would I come here again?  maybe just to try the noodle dishes...but not for the curry.."

The restaurant itself is cute with about 10 tables in front and a takeout counter. We got right to entrees and I ordered a Pad Thai with shrimp. The dish was a bit disappointing. It seemed like there was about 50% lettuce and 50% noodle/actual ingredients. So overall a lot of filler. And the shrimp were deep fried and laid on top, which seemed strange for a pad thai. The dish was also about room temp.

The people I was with had slightly better experiences with their meals, so that is why I&#39;m giving a 3 star review vs a two. Overall, service was good, prices were about average for the type of food, but the food itself was lacking."

Clean and bright fun looking paintings on the wall. We ordered beef pad Thai it was good. I like mine with hot sauce. panang chicken curry good but wanted sauce thicker though, Thai basil fried rice was good, more of a short grain rice so not as fluffy. They can leave out the raw jalapeno slices toppings out. serving size enough for two of all dishes. Not bad. Took home fried rice. service is friendly, music background is modern and mellow. Overall nice experience, will come back again to try out other dishes. Got a coupon for free egg rolls for our next visit see you then!"

I&#39;ve been eating here before ownership changed from the last Thai place and it became Happy Elephant, so I&#39;m not new to the game. For years it was a great suburban go-to place. 

But I took my dad here in June for Father&#39;s Day, and the waiter (a new face I had never seen) snapped at us. SNAPPED. I had asked if he could bring some condiments- super kindly, mind you- and he snapped back, &#34;Ummmm. I only have two hands. You&#39;ll have to wait.&#34; As a social worker and as someone who has worked years in restaurants, I was taken aback, but quickly responded, &#34;There&#39;s no need to snap. I myself worked in restaurants for a long time and know it is difficult work. We would appreciate a little more respect as patrons of your restaurant.&#34; to which he had no reply. I had hassled him in no way, and his response was rude and inappropriate. 

I came in about two weeks after that hoping he would not be there (he wasn&#39;t) but my to-go order was TINY- about 1/3 the amt you would get at any Thai place in the city. I also had requested extra veggies and there were no veggies to be found, only a few lonesome bean sprouts. Sorry to say I will not be coming back."

I meet my friend for weekday lunches sometimes as it&#39;s halfway between our two companies. They have good lunch time specials and are such a cute little thai shop. I loveeee the name and all the super cute branding they have to go along with it! They sell adorable shirts!

In my latest order just last week, I had a huge miss. I&#39;ve gotten their pad thai before but it&#39;s been awhile so maybe they&#39;ve changed their recipe. I ordered the tofu pad thai and it was probably the worst pad thai I&#39;ve ever had. It tasted powdery for some reason and the tofu wasn&#39;t good either...which was weird because when is tofu not good? I&#39;m wondering what happened to this batch. All the noodles were stuck together in huge chunks and that powdery dry taste...maybe they didn&#39;t add fish oil? I don&#39;t know what happened but it was the worst ever. I had about 1/4 of it before I just couldn&#39;t do it anymore. I was very sad and now I don&#39;t think  I can risk getting the pad thai from Happy Elephant again.

Now the Lime Chicken...I don&#39;t know why I never got this before last week! I&#39;m obsessed and in love! I could see myself getting the lime chicken quite a lot. It reminds me of honey chicken from chinese restaurants but with a limey thai twist. This dish was on point in every single way and I can&#39;t see myself ordering from Happy Elephant ever again without this as one of the items. I&#39;m in love~~~~~

Happy Elephant is one of the few places in the area on GrubHub which is a huge plus! :D I&#39;m going to keep on trying new things at Happy Elephant but at this point I wouldn&#39;t recommend the pad thai to anyone! However, I highly recommend the lime chicken."

Sadly, pretty disappointed. To be fair I grew up eating a lot of traditional southeast asian foods (Vietnamese, Lao, Thai). But plenty of other thai joints I&#39;ve enjoyed.

Anyway, the lady and I shared a few items. First we had the Yum Yum salad. Something my dad would make a lot when I was little. It was ok - good flavor, but that cut of beef was really tough (probably a stew beef or something). On their menu it says that the beef is grilled. Maybe it&#39;s english second language but that was not grilled. Not that I care though, just pointing it out. Also had some Green Curry. Decent flavor. No complaints.

The sticky rice was a joke though. Mushy, clumpy, way too sticky and even brick-like in a few spots. I think they skipped an important step and just took it right out of the steamer and threw it into some plastic wrap. 

Maybe it was an off day for them. But I won&#39;t be ordering any food from them in the future."

We received a Happy Elephant flyer yesterday and wanted to give it a try. Thai food is generally something the family likes.

We ordered egg rolls, happy rolls, spring rolls, garlic beef, spicy basil beef, ginger rush shrimp for and pepper steak for delivery and not one dish was more than acceptable. 
The best of tonight&#39;s meal was the happy rolls. The spring rolls were cold chicken wrapped in a raw tortilla with carrots and cucumbers; gross. The egg rolls were nasty, undercooked and terribly priced small veggie rolls. This place isn&#39;t fooling me, they certainly we&#39;re not home made and you could definitely find the same exact pseudo &#34;egg rolls&#34; in the Jewel freezer aisle. Definitely not an egg roll. We actually had to call the restaurant back to make sure we received all of our order (we could not determine what the spring rolls were and thought they made a mistake). 

All of the dishes lacked flavor and were soupy  take out containers stuffed with a garden of vegetables. My dad had to add 3 different sauces to his basil beef so he could eat it; it was THAT bland. 
The ginger rush did not have the slightest taste of ginger in it and only had 6 small shrimp. $12 for 6 small shrimp, no ginger and some watery sauce? No way.  How are are charging $9+ per entree?  It should at least have a decent amount of meat. In fact... All of our dishes lacked meat (which was low quality anyway) and were overloaded with vegetables and watery sauce. Such a rip off!!! 
The pepper steak flavor was good, but loaded with way too many undercooked green peppers. 
The garlic lover beef was bland. 

Everything was terrible. I am so disappointed. $60 of our hard earned moolah down the drain and the worst Asian meal of our lives."

But, the food is good and inexpensive, and the service is wonderful.

They have a great lunch menu, primarily Thai with a few Chinese dishes mixed in.  With lunch you get soup, an appetizer and the meal itself.  We both had Massaman Curry with brown rice.  It was hot with loads of fresh, crisp vegetables, plenty of chicken and a wonderful sauce.  They offer several kinds of teas - I had a pot of oolong and Jon had jasmine tea.

But, the nicest thing was the service.  Our server came by our table and chatted.  Told us about the paintings.  When we told her how much we enjoyed the food, she told us that the next time we came in we should ask for certain dishes that were not listed on the menu and she would make them for us.

All in all, a wonderful experience."

The husband and wife owners are super sweet and genuinely happy to be there to serve you their (read: her - she&#39;s the chef) homemade dishes. He is the the smiling guy at the front of the house. Doing a little bit of everything to make the visit enjoyable. You want an example?  I&#39;ll give you a good one...I placed an order to pick up at a specific time. It wasn&#39;t quite ready as there had been a rush just prior. We chatted away for a few minutes and then I kept myself busy waiting. He reappeared with an iced coffee on the house. Ready for it?  I quit caffeine, so I couldn&#39;t drink it. Here&#39;s my sad panda, err, elephant face :-( I ask if it&#39;s caffeinated and learn that it is. I mention my lifestyle change aka no pop/no caffeine anymore. He tells me to go ahead and take it back to the office for someone else to enjoy. Thanks!  When my order arrives, he hands me a bottle of water. Fast forward to today...he brings me water when dining in without a question. He remembered. And even if he didn&#39;t, it makes for a nice Yelp story. So just hush and smile. :-) And then head to Happy Elephant for the homemade crab Rangoon, homemade dipping sauce (yum!), basil chicken, sweet and sour wraps and peanuty thai chicken with carrots and broccoli. 

Oh yeah, it is a cozy place if you eat in just so you&#39;re aware. But no complaints from me.  By the end of today&#39;s lunch, I was chatting with the lovely ladies from an apartment rental office nearby. One of the gals ended up ordering a crab Rangoon to go based on my rave reviews.

The place is small, but it is always so clean and bright, it doesn&#39;t as small as it is. You know some those Thai joints are so scummy inside, that even if the food is good, it&#39;s creepy.

Happy Elelphant sparkles. And so does the service. I have eaten here at least ten times since finding it by accident one day. Every single time the service has been so friendly -- like I&#39;m a family relative. Often the lady there will just drop in something for free with my order. For no reason!

The first time was last year and the food was just OK. Certainly not the worst &#34;Thai&#34; food I&#39;ve ever had but there wasn&#39;t really any standouts and the portion sizes were rather small for the price.

Yesterday, having a craving for &#34;Thai&#34; takeout, I returned - big mistake. I have to say it was the single most underwhelming and overpriced meal I&#39;ve ever eaten.

The spring rolls weren&#39;t rolled anywhere near tight enough, so when you picked them up, all the filling just spilled out. Strangely, the cook had also decided to placed 5 slices of dessicated jalapeno slices on top, that had obviously been sliced hours (if not the day) before. The pot stickers were OK but they were strangely similar to frozen ones I&#39;ve bought at the supermarket before....

The Cashew Chicken was basically vegetable stir fry, with a couple of slices of chicken and a few cashews thrown in as an afterthought. There was no &#34;sauce&#34; to speak of. Instead, I received an oily broth that caused the otherwise crispy veggies to get soggy. My wife had the Garlic Chicken and it was the same way. The rice portion was basically a single SMALL scoop of rice thrown in an oversize styrofoam box. If I&#39;m paying close to $10 for an entree, the least the owner could do is &#34;splurge&#34; on giving enough cheap rice.

And for all that, we payed over $30! Ridiculous. I won&#39;t be going back and would warn others to stay away."

I&#39;m an avowed Meatatarian, but there are a select few foods that I get vegetarian since they&#39;re just better that way. One of them is Tofu Pad Thai, and one of my favs is Happy Elephant&#39;s (medium spicy).

Their Mango smoothies are top-shelf, right up there with my standard-bearer Coffee Haus (in Schaumburg). That said, I don&#39;t like whatever kind of tapioca balls they use, so I go bubble-less here.

Also delicious: their Raspberry Iced Tea (which they mix themselves), their Mango Sticky Rice and their Fillet of Sole.

We usually get carry-out, but their delivery great as well. Often the very friendly and happy proprietor himself delivers our grub.

One star for friendly and fast service -- I only sat about five minutes eyeing my surroundings (smallish dining room done in reds and golds) and enjoying my iced coffee.
One star for asking how hot I wanted my noodles and nailing it -- they were spicy without being &#34;Thai spicy&#34;, which my white-girl tongue can&#39;t handle.
One star for veggie-packed, tasty food that was clearly made with fresh ingredients.
Minus a star for the spring rolls. They were frankly disappointing -- not wrapped tightly enough, I ended up eating them with a fork. The filling was all right, but overall they were overpriced and just so-so.

I&#39;m glad I checked HE out -- it&#39;s a cute place and they seem to care about their customers and their food. Given the chance, I would try something else, but I have had better Thai ... though not in EGV :)"

I have never seen this dish appear to be swimming in a watery fluid before.  It is a drier dish and the noodles are typically pan fried.  This place seems to be more like a fast food restaurant.  The porion for $10 was disappointing as well.

I did rather like the Sriracha Shrimp appetizer, tho.  I would order that again.  The Happy Wraps were mostly dried white noodles."

All in all, the food was well prepared and you could tell that they use fresh ingredients.  We ordered 2 spring rolls, green curry with tofu, chicken peanut raman, veggie stir fry, Thai fried rice, spicy basil fried rice and 2 Thai custards.  Cost=$59
Everyone enjoyed their meals and commented how good it was.  Except for the green curry I found the entrees lacking in any kind of spice &#34;kick&#34;.  Both fried rice dishes were fluffy and not greasy at all as is the case with typical Chinese fried rice.  The veggie stir fry was in a light, flavorful sauce.  The Thai custard desserts were far too small.

I&#39;ve loved everything I have tried, and I especially like their curries, noodles and happy wraps. Thai coffee is good, too. We order in all the time, and the owner delivers himself. It is also a great lunch spot, especially if you are in a hurry.

The first time I came here, the food was excellent. My order was right, everything was cooked properly, and my pad woon sen was delicious and flavorful. The second time I came here, they forgot the tofu in my pad si ew, the carrots were practically raw and the broccoli was burned, and they apparently felt that &#34;hold the egg&#34; also meant &#34;hold the sauce.&#34; So disappointing!

The first time I came here, they gave me a free elephant sticker with my order. The second time I came here, they almost forgot to give me my receipt and change. 

The first time I came here, the staff was super friendly and answered the phone right away. The second time I came here, it rang about seven or eight times before anybody answered. The guy who gave me my food on arrival was friendly but seemed totally freaked out by the full dining room (maybe he should switch to decaf).

This is the only restaurant besides Hard Rock Cafe/Rainforest Cafe I have seen that has its own line of t-shirts. The logo is pretty adorable, and I love the colors. Having swag is a nice plus. Having tables so close together that nobody can get through the small dining room during the lunch rush is not. I think most customers would rather have a little R&amp;D put into the dining room before (admittedly completely awesome) elephant logo stuff.

Parking can also be very iffy. Once I was here and got a spot right away. On another occasion, I had to decide if I wanted to wait for somebody else to leave or park in a bagel shop&#39;s parking lot and walk over here. I also saw a heron in the parking lot on the first visit, but no such luck on the second visit, when the only wildlife I spotted was the invasive Parkus illegalus.

Also note that there is a minimum charge for delivery.

Maybe the difference is the time of day. My dinner visit was the 4-star visit, and my lunch visit was my 1.5 star visit (extra half star for friendliness and at least getting the mango and sticky rice right). I intend to look into the matter some more and report back with my findings. In the meantime, I&#39;d say skip Happy Elephant for lunch and try it for dinner instead."

We went here today after my 9 yr old son said that he wants to eat at Happy Elephant, so off we go for lunch with my daughter. Place is still packed for lunch. Always ordered Yum-yum salad (beef salad) which never fails.
My daughter got the chicken wings, not your typical American fare but she loves it. My son got the pot stickers and he was able to finish it on his own. 
I think dinner is better in this place...they have more on the menu especially lime chicken.

This place won&#39;t disappoint.  I admit objectively, I&#39;d rate the food&#39;s at 3 stars - average but solid food.  What sets it apart is that the couple that own the restaurant are so friendly and welcoming to everyone coming through their doors.  They&#39;ll come out to chat with you if they have time, and it&#39;s just got the feel of a neighborhood joint with a lot of regulars.  Even though it&#39;s in a small strip mall next to a laundromat, it&#39;s very tastefully decorated inside in beautiful colors, feeling somewhat hip and urban.

Most dishes we&#39;ve had was very good - the Penang Chicken&#39;s my fav.  The only item I had issue with once was the shrimp in our takeout pineapple fried rice, which smelled really strong, but that&#39;s just a one-time thing since all the other times it&#39;s been fine.  They&#39;re very accommodating with substitutions or any other preferences you may have.  The owner chef is Thai, and brings her spin to some of the dishes.

Definitely recommended as a friendly neighborhood joint for solid food."

It&#39;s kind of our go-to place when we have people over.  Everyone loves it or they&#39;re being super courteous.  

I love their Pad Thai.  It&#39;s steamy and fresh.  You can tell it&#39;s home made b/c it does not have that orange or pink tint to it.  The Drunken Noodles are excellent as well.  They are the wide, rice noodles with hints of basil and jasmine.  The basil fried rice is cooked to perfection.  You can tell that they&#39;re not cooking out of large plastic containers.  Everything is pretty much made to order.  

Background:  The Happy Elephant moved into a noodle place that I drove by 100 times, but never walked into.  The outside used to look dirty (and mean).  Anyway, those days are over, so out with the old and in with the new.  The new place is super clean, colorful, with creative Zen-like art on the walls and did I say brand spankin&#39; new.    The ambiance is definitely not fancy, but it&#39;s fresh; which I prefer.   It reminds me of a place you would find in New York or Chicago b/c it&#39;s totally unpretentious, mom and pop, but with a much younger vibe.  

If you like Big Bowl, drive the 4 miles south and check this place out.  It&#39;s in the same strip mall as Teddy&#39;s diner.  

I didn&#39;t want to go here, but I&#39;m going to.  As far as Mary K&#39;s 1-star review of the Happy Elephant, I can say this:  I have 168 reviews under my belt and at this time you have 2, so .....#@$#$%%$^%$%$!!!!!!!.........and you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about anyway.

I would go back again during my lunch break when craving Thai.

I would have given them a 5 star review if it weren&#39;t for their not so enthusiactic waiter.  He let us know he was having a bad day, which clearly showed and he wasn&#39;t knowlegable on the dishes and had to ask the other owner a few times about how a few dishes were prepared."

The dining area is on the smaller side but the awesome service makes up for it.  

For the dishes:

The Thai Veggie soup was ok - my 5 yr old said it tasted just like chicken noodle without the noodles. 

Crab Rangoon - the little triangles were much smaller then I&#39;m used to but they do pack a punch of flavor. You can actually taste the different veggies / crab (not just cream cheese).

Red curry - Good mixture of veggies and beef. I thought the eggplant pieces should be a little bigger. The dish did have a good balance between sweet &amp; hot. 

Beef and Broccoli - This dish was just ok. The beef, broccoli and carrots were fresh and tasty but this dish lacked any special kick to it. The brown sauce has a soy base but not much flavor other then the soy. 

Coconut Ice cream - Who doesn&#39;t love it? Its not made fresh there but a delicious treat to finish off the lunch experience. 

Overall, a good cheap Thai restaurant in the nw burbs."

My brother and his girlfriend loves this place so my boyfriend &amp; I decided to give it a shot.

Food was great.  The moment we sat down, we were given soup - as I guessed was part of the lunch special.  I guess for lunch, they only give you the lunch special menu and not the thorough, complete menu.  Oh well.  It comes with your choice of eggroll or cucumber salad; I got the salad, which had this sweet, tangy zing to it that I liked a lot :) then for the entree I got their infamous lime chicken (probably the best decision I made! It was delicious!)

I knocked off a star because service wasn&#39;t up to par.  We ordered the Thai Sunrise (a drink) or something named like that, and the restaurant, being such a small place, we could hear our orders being yelled out... Now the drink may be too tedious to create, but we don&#39;t wanna hear: &#34;Two Thai Sunrises... No I&#39;m not kidding, I don&#39;t joke when it comes to that stuff.&#34;  Like is it really that bad to make the drink?? As a customer and a previous employee of the food and beverage industry, I didn&#39;t want to hear that.  Another thing, my boyfriend was offered water (to which he declined), but for some reason, I drank my drink almost down to its last ice and the server didn&#39;t even bother to ask ME if I wanted water. Other than that, I wouldn&#39;t really put this place under the guillotine - it&#39;s still pretty amazing food.  The employees would just have to watch what they say sometimes, since the tables are literally less than 3-5 feet away from the counter/server area/kitchen area."

Like most people, I take my Thai food seriously. I have no qualms with this place being in a dinky strip mall, as many of the best Thai Food purveyors hide in them, but I do take issue with the food. I got my usual dish at any Thai Food haven, Spicy Basil with tofu... and make it extra spicy. Sadly, it was not spicy at all and wasn&#39;t all that great. It reminded me of the time I tried to make Thai food myself and it just tasted like a rice, water, and frozen veggie mix. No real flavor, absolutely no spice, and not up to par for me. The Tom Yum soup was also a disappointment. The portion size on the soup was good but again, lacking in flavor; I need more lemongrass.

My boyfriend got the green curry with tofu and totally lucked out with LOTS of spice... but not like it was hot, just like it may have been over spiced- still better than my bland food. I was so sad because the service was fantastic, the decor is uber cute, and I totally want a t-shirt with their logo on it but it just wasn&#39;t all that I thought it would be. 

The owner did come around partially through our meal to check on us and was very nice, but I didn&#39;t mention that my food was virtually tasteless. I know, I know- that&#39;s my fault, but we were in a hurry to make it to a Flaming Lips show and I didn&#39;t want to waste any more time fixing it to be better. 

If I have to be totally honest, I&#39;d give the food a 2 but the decor and service a 4.8. In defense of Happy Elephant, I think we just had an off meal because one guy eating there ordered 2 meals and then applied for a job... I&#39;d maybe give it another try if I were in the area."

While I am quite adventurous with my food choices my mother is not. No spice and as plain jane as it get for her so I was a little cautious coming here.

Needless to say I am so glad that we came here. The place is super small to eat in but they are super friendly and it is especially great to have the chef (owner?) come around and see how everything was.

The thai veg soup was very hot and perfect for a cold day. I cant put my finger on it but it might have been white pepper that gave it some heat. Im probably way off but for how clear it was it packed so much flavor. If anyone can find out how they make please let me know their secret!

The egg roll was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Im a sucker for fried food so this passes with flying colors. Nice sweet and sour dipping sauce on the table too.

I got the drunken noodles which were amazing. It seems all too often when the chow fun noodle (flat wide rice noodle) is used they get burnt in the wok or over cooked to much. This was the first time in a long time that they were cooked perfectly. I love spicy food and this could have used some more for my taste so next time I ask for spicy. Overall very flavorful and lots to eat too.

The second dish that we ordered was the golden noodles. We both ordered our dishes with bbq pork and it was good match for mine but i think that the golden noodles would have been better with chicken or maybe shrimp. It was a little more basic is flavor but still very good. The eggs made the dish and it was something that I wouldn&#39;t have thought to pair.

Basically if you like thai food get over here asap. The menu is large and I will be going back soon to try more things out. Lets see how spicy they can make it though...."

Crab Rangoon was absolutely delicious and the Sweet &amp; Sour sauce was simply amazing.  A must try!!!

The Spicy Basil Chicken did not disappoint.  The vegetables and the chicken tasted fresh.  I enjoyed it very much.

The Tofu Pad Thai was also made with fresh vegetables and was very tasty as well.

The only reason why I did not give 5 stars, is because the dining are is very small, which is not a problem if you pick it up or get it delivered.

It&#39;s a very small restaurant and the tables are tiny Between the dishes of food, drinks and bottle of hot sauce and sweet and sour sauce, things on the table got a little precarious. But the service and the food was wonderful so I can overlook that, or else order takeout next time. 

We had the lunch specials--for about $10 you get a small cup of vegetable soup, choice of an egg roll or cucumber salad, and choice of entree with white rice. The soup was good--a peppery flavor and a lot of little bits of celery, carrots, and cabbage. The egg roll was good--nice crunch and very fresh--not to greasy either. I chose the Spicy Basil with chicken. Very good mixture of chicken, basil leaves, mushrooms, baby corn, bell peppers and bamboo shoots. The menu noted that it was spicy. It had a good flavor, but I didn&#39;t find the dish spicy at all. The house sweet chili sauce I added gave the dish the heat I wanted and it was a pretty good tasting sauce as well. Hubsbie had the green curry with chicken--I got to sample a few bites and I liked his dish much better than mine. It had a good amount of heat to it and a peanuty/curry flavor. 

On the smoothie/bubble drink note note, I must say I cannot find ANY bubble smoothie places in this neck of the suburbs so I was very excited to see it on the menu and hoped it would be good. My mango smoothie was OK--I&#39;ve had better. My favorite is still that &#34;joyous&#34; place, but HE&#39;s bubble drinks will be good in a pinch when I&#39;m having a craving and not willing to drive very far."

I had to use the spring roll dipping sauce to make it edible. The beef and broccoli should have been called &#34;find the beef in this broccoli&#34; and it was bland.

Most recently, they left 2 items out of my order that I paid for. And that was after I had to go over my order a few times with them. I only ordered 5 items total and without any special requests so I don&#39;t see what the issue here was. 

A big plus for me is the frosty keychain. I think it only costs $1 and then whenever you order anything on the menu, you get this cute tiny little frosty which is the perfect size for a cold dessert after dinner! An order of chicken nuggets &amp; the mini frosty make for a great deal for $1~! 

They have some new items on the menu like mac &amp; cheese for $2.50. Not a bad deal and decently good but I don&#39;t think I would get it again as the value menu items are a better deal.

With so many better food choices in the area, I wouldn&#39;t recommend going here unless you&#39;re main objectives are speed, convenience and price. Always check your order before pulling away!"

I was going to go to Wickett&#39;s across the way but their kitchen closes 2 hrs before regular closing time. My order was taken by DJ, nice kid and promptly served in about 7 minutes later. We had 2 combo meals and a 4 piece nugget for our daughter after shopping at Woodfield. 

Near the end of our meal we find a deep fried beetle in our fries. Gross! See picture of said beetle. We called over a manager Rajishi that wanted to give us a gift certificate to come back. Come back and eat beetles? I think not. Rajishi refunded our entire meal even though I didn&#39;t finish my sandwich and scooped the remaining nuggets out from in front of my daughter since they were probably fried in the same fryer. 

The entire beetle incident has turned me off to this particular Wendy&#39;s. I should have sucked it up and paid for dinner at Seasons 52 next door instead of dining on bug fries. I felt like Rajishi didn&#39;t know how to handle the situation and I had to walk him through the scenario of our food was 85% fried with the exception of buns and frosties. We had the spicy chicken combos, fried spicy chicken. I didn&#39;t yell, didn&#39;t scream but he seemed clueless on what to do next so I asked him for corporate&#39;s contact, his name, took a picture of my food and got a refund. We won&#39;t be back."

Burgers are dry and fries have too much salt. I&#39;ve both eaten in and gotten drive through. Eat-in is fair. I suggest the drive through, your car is probably more comfortable. 

I&#39;ve never had outright bad service, but they DO forget items often. Condiment requests quite often are not placed in the bag as requested. And once, an actual menu item paid for, was not placed in the bag at the drive through. On two different occasions, my friend had to go back to get the fries they forgot during eat-in for some reason. At one time, almost daily when I used them for lunch, they kept claiming they were out of an item that was featured on the menu. Either remove the item off the menu or get it in!! 

Once again, just OK."

I sat with my jacked zipped up.  It bothers me terribly when it&#39;s cold season and the dining area is kept cold.  Who eats in the cold?  Animals do, not human beings.  My hands were cold, the burgers were cold (cheese not melted), even the fries were cold.  We heard an employee joking with the manager that their hands were cold!  Mind you they were standing near the counter.  The dining room needed some attention, food and used napkins strewn about.
Q: what does it mean when a garbage cabinet is turned around so it cannot be used?
A: There were fruit flies whizzing around, so, the garbage bin must be thoroughly dirty or still have garbage in it.  Maybe it&#39;s broken?

Another woe was a debacle involving their nasty tasting sweet tea.  They ran out of Dr Pepper which is a fountain favorite of mine at Wendy&#39;s.  Well, the cashier said they had everything but Dr P.  I opted for sweet tea.  On the menu it&#39;s not listed and I assumed it was the same price as fountain.  The cashier didn&#39;t offer any info about it and charged me an additional seventy-five cents for having it with my meal.  Sweet ice tea, blah!  Artificially sweetened and too damn sweet.  
What happened to cashiers that offer you information before charging you?  I hated the tea and I hated having to pay an additional charge without my knowledge.  I only realized after seeing the receipt.  Looking at the cashier, I knew I wasn&#39;t going to get a refund.  When I told her I thought the tea was gross, she looked at me oddly.  Maybe she was admiring the fruit flies flying in sync behind me?  
The food was consistent to Wendy&#39;s food, but, it was cold and without care."

The paneer Tika we orders were good but they delivered our dish on wrong table and so we had to wait longer than usual.. After that we waited long for lemon, onions n chaat masala that goes with it.. By the time lemon n chaat masala arrived we already ate half of the tikkas..The green chutney was also not fresh this time..

UPDATE: 5/3/2016

In my previous review I stated our disappointment that our order contained mostly sauce.  We have been in contact with the owners and they truly care and are honest people that run this restaurant. 

They corrected the mistake and we are satisfied.

Truth be known Mast Masala&#39;s Butter Chicken and Matar Paneer are the very best we have ever had of all the Indian Restaurants we have ever gone to.   Whoever does the cooking for this restaurant is not simply a cook but a master chef.  We are not adventurous so we basically stick with Buttered Chicken and Matar Paneer but have sampled enough different Indian restaurants with these two dishes to get a feel for good and great.

Mast Masala&#39;s Butter Chicken and Matar Paneer is not simply good but great.  Easily great.  

If you want really great Indian Food this is the place to go.

And it&#39;s so good, the leftovers are even good cold when you sneak to the fridge at 3 am to experience a bit."

I had no idea anyone could layer so many flavors into a dish and you would reach another level of flavor with every bite. This stuff was pure vegetables, if I could make vegetable taste that damned good I would be 100% vegetarian today!

Then out came this Naan bread. If you don&#39;t know what naan bread is, when done right, like they do here, it is the most delicate and delicious bread I have ever had. I also got a chicken tikka masala I think it was and it had this creamy delicious gravy that was amazing with the bread.

This was my first experience with this regional fare and I was stunned at the complexity of flavors as well as the depth the flavors enhanced each other.

There was a salad dish, veggie samosas, 6 veggie sides (masala, yogurt, curry, saag based), and 2 meat dishes. They also serve fresh roasted red chicken, on a hot plate with onions (which I believe is typical for lunch buffets) and hot naan, both that they bring to the table. The manager (?) there checked in every once in a while to make sure everything was good or if we needed more water. Everything was very tasty and flavorful- the buffet looks small but I typically like smaller buffets because then you know they make it fresh everyday and it gives it a homey feel. Not that I have anything against large buffets, but I feel like making food in smaller batches gives it good quality control. For dessert there was a sweet carrot item (that my friends really enjoyed) and gulab jamun. 

I absolutely love indian food and my friend that I was with, who happens to also be indian, says that Mast Masala is one of her favorite place to go to and get indian food!

***Quick tid-bit (because I&#39;m all up for transparency) : Someone messaged me saying that they had been to Mast Masala in Hanover a few times and wasn&#39;t aware of the lunch buffet.

I&#39;ve only been there once on a Wedn. afternoon, so I am not sure if they have the buffet every lunch weekday or not.

I LIKE Mast Masala but there&#39;s something about the food that makes me not LOVE it. My Indian food palate isn&#39;t refined enough to tell you what exactly it is about the food here that makes it less delicious than some other Indian places I frequent, but I can tell you that it has a certain sweetness to it. And maybe even an anise/licorice flavor. Maybe it&#39;s a different region than I usually eat but it just seemed off. All of it. 

We got a Butter Chicken, a Chicken Tikka Masala, some garlic naan, and an order of the Aloo Ghobi...our usual try out foods for any new Indian place. I will say this...the standout of our entire meal was the garlic naan. It was HUGE. We ordered 4 orders (one naan an order) thinking they&#39;d be smaller. Big mistake. Each naan is the size of two regular pancakes stuck together. No wonder they were $2.50 each. Sheesh. Needless to say, there&#39;s a couple of leftover naan in the fridge as we speak. Other than the carbs though? Everything else was just okay. The food comes with a ton of sauce (which is great to dip your naan in!) but not a lot of meat. And the meat you do get is somehow really dry. Even the vegetables were just alright and had a different flavor to them than usual. At least it came nice and spicy (white girl spicy, that is) even when ordering it mild. I could even go medium here but surely the hot would burn my mouth off. Be warned. 

Overall, this is a good Indian place, but it&#39;s not great. Guess I have to keep searching for &#34;the one&#34;. Oh well."

They should probably expand their space and get some seating for the guys who are waiting - we had like 3 different groups waiting before us and two after us. Everyone went to walgreens nearby :p

Once seated, I thought the service and staff both were really good. We got some papad w/chutney as complementary. We got the cilantro chciken tikka sizzler as appetizer. Even though, it was SIZZLING it tasted good. We got the butter naan ( 4 pc) with Butter chicken masala - which by far tasted the best among probably about 10 other indian restaurants I have visited in the NW suburbs of chicago.

We ordered Butter Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo, garlic naan and buttered naan.  All I can say is amazing!!  The butter chicken had such a smooth flavorful sauce and the lamb vindaloo was equally tasty.  The portions were large and the naan was 2 pieces for a reasonable price.

I will need to come back for their buffet to try more of their foods.

Definitely give this place a try, if your food is as good as our was, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Over the countless times we&#39;ve ordered, the food is sometimes inconsistent, but overall, it is still the best Indian we&#39;ve had, aside from Kama Indian Bistro, but at a lower price. Portion sizes are adequate, if not better than some other places we&#39;ve been to."

Since we cook our own Indian food at home, and love it, I was hesitant but willing. Since he is from London and use to the curry shops there, I trusted his judgement on this one and we were not let down. We tried the Lamb Korma and the Chicken Tikka Masala. Since I did not have control of the spices, I had my korma served medium, and his tikka was served hot. Both complimented each other favorably. The lamb was so tender, it was easily cut with a fork. There was a generous amount of gravy in our pots for dipping as well. The meal came with quite enough rice, which by the way was cooked perfectly. We ordered the butter naan and the garlic naan- again - plenty for both of is and delicious. 

The decor was lovely, not at all like a typical London curry shop- which was a pleasant surprise to my husband. After all, it&#39;s not about the decor, it&#39;s about the taste. And this one past his stringent test.. 
Since this is the only Indian Restaurant I have visited in the Chicago area - I am 5 starring it and setting the bar high. 

The price for our meal was a ridiculous $31.00 for 2 people. VERY reasonable, since we left completely full. 

Our server was a young man, a cricket player and was very kind and attentive. He also believe cricket is the greatest game on earth, but I won&#39;t remove a star just for that!"

The past 3 times we&#39;ve called to place an order, they don&#39;t answer the phone consistently and we have to call back a 2nd or 3rd time - just to place an order.

I ordered lamb vindaloo tonight &amp; it was greasy with a LOT of inedible pieces of unidentifiable &#34;stuff&#34; in it. Our buttered chicken had no curry in it.  I had to go back &amp; ask for rice again.  I&#39;d already paid for our food, and before leaving, I asked the woman who&#39;d taken my money if there was rice in the order.  That stopped the transaction dead in its tracks.  She had to go to the kitchen and get approval to add rice to the order.  I got a small container of white rice - not Basmati rice as the previous owners would give us with our order.  While I was waiting, the owner was standing there staring at me.  No smile, not acknowledgement that I&#39;d just paid $50 for a meal for 3 people.  While I was waiting there, I noticed my shoes were sticking to the floor.

We used to be loyal customers - we came in 10 times over the past year and the food was outstanding.  The new owners clearly don&#39;t get it and they don&#39;t care - we&#39;ve given them 3 chances.   We won&#39;t be back."

So I decided to give this place a try.   First time I did carryout and ordered their Chicken Vinadaloo along with veggie samosas (though I want to find a place that does Keema samosas) and some naan.   I thought the food was fine...was disappointed with the naan portion but then realized they only charged $2 for it and I could take a second order and be satisfied and that price would be around what other places typically charge.

My second visit was a weekday evening.   First good sign was that there were a lot of Indian families at the restaurant.    I was my usual party of one so they sat me in an area away from the families which was nice.

This time I had two orders of the butter naan which more than satisfied the bread order.   I this time ordered the Shrimp Korma along with an appetizer of veggie samosas (still looking for a good keema...sigh) and basmati rice.   I also had an order of mango lassi which I thought was a little more room temperature than I would&#39;ve liked.   Also thought I could&#39;ve used more rice (though maybe I have to do two orders of that as well).   Barely had enough rice for the leftovers the next day.

The service was okay.   I may go back but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve found that replacement yet."

We had it and it was delicious.

We also have had MANY different dishes and have yet to be disappointed with ANY of them!  (Vegetable Samosas, Paneer Pakora, Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Korma, Malai Kofta, Lamb Korma, Lamb Curry, Garlic Naan, Butter Naan, and Lacha Paratha)

Anyways, given it was Monday night, I had to try to be fair--- Paneer tikka masala was very different from what I have had at other Indian restaurants, daal makhani was not-so good, lacked taste and flavor.

The shrimp dish (shrimp korma) contained only about 7-8 really overcooked, quarter-sized shrimp.  The onion kulcha was very greasy, and the onions used were quite sharp/bitter, not the usual sweet, mild onions usually found in onion kulcha.  Actually, this was the first time that we didn&#39;t want to save our leftovers in the fridge.  With the overall change in quality and flavor, we&#39;re disappointed.

Everything I ordered tasted perfect.  The Butter Chicken had enough spice to it since most Butter Chicken is cooked without any kick to it, the Butter Naan was heavenly.  When biting in to the bread, it was just like walking on clouds.  I haven&#39;t had Naan as awesome as theirs in a long time.  The Kadai Chicken was also cooked to perfection.  The chicken was moist with the perfect amount of spices added to it.  As for the Samosa, it couldn&#39;t have been any better than any other Samosas I&#39;ve eaten.

We get there and asked to place a carry out order and they immediately questioned us why we didn&#39;t call ahead with the order - as it will take an hour. At this point I was livid - and told them that we called 10 times without anyone bothering to answer the phone. The least they could have done was accomodate us and take our order.

I&#39;ve never had to order white rice separately (it&#39;s usually included in the meal in any Indian restaurant I go to) but I was told since I didn&#39;t order it, I wouldn&#39;t get it. The appetizers--veggie samosas, seekh kabob and chicken pakoda--were pretty good and they all had distinct flavored from one another. I can&#39;t say the same thing for the main dishes. Butter chicken, shrimp vindaloo and chili paneer all tasted very similar. Even worse, the Vindaloo seems to use the standard american method of drenching everything in tomato sauce. The  only other things we had was okra masala and onion kulcha and those was very good. I have to admit the young server/waiter we had was very friendly and did his job very well.

The garlic and  buttered naans were tasty as well. And then the lamb biryani was even more tasty with a gradual burning sensation from all the spices. The price wasn&#39;t cheap, though most biryanis I could find in the area felt a little pricey too, but at least the portions were large enough that I needed a take-home container. I tried a couple &#39;medium hot&#39; dishes which were also good, although they were somewhat closer to mild than to hot."

He was very helpful on our first visit.  The lady that takes phone orders also has recommended a items that were great.  It would be nice if they had a combo platter for 2.

I came here a couple weeks ago and got the lunch special everyone was talking about.  I went with the butter chicken.  It was damn good.  So was everything else.  Only complaint is they placed me by the window and I bet it was in the 50&#39;s where I was sitting.  Then I went there today for the same.  There was a sign on the window that said no lunch specials today.  Dang.  I went in to ask when they would have them again and they said never.  Double dang.  Well I didn&#39;t feel like paying more money for less variety so I took off.  I then went to go a couple miles down the road to Himalayan.  That place is gone!  Triple dang!  It&#39;s just not my day.

Edit:  So they brought back the lunch specials they told me they weren&#39;t going to have anymore.  It&#39;s like it was before, but doesn&#39;t come with the chicken tandoori anymore, which is a shame since it was really good.  You get filled up for 7 bucks though so it&#39;s still a good deal."

I don&#39;t know how long Mast has been around, but it appears fairly new.
Mast Masala was recommended by a friend (oops, I didn&#39;t yelp search first), and Mast didn&#39;t disappoint.  
Upon first experience, I was impressed.  Mast appears to be a nice, small, clean place.  Everything we ordered seemed very freshly prepared.  Compared to the typical diners of indian cuisine, we eat early enough to qualify for the early bird special.  Place was dead when we arrived.  Some would see this as a bad sign, but the typical diner usually eats later in the evening.  Plus, with the kids, we feel its easier on us, the kids, and the wait staff if we get in and out early before a place gets hectic. 
When we try a new place, we like to first try the old standbys to compare.  However, we deviated a little this time.  We usually get a vegetable pakora to start, but got the pakora platter this time, which had both paneer (cheese) &amp; vegetable pakora.  The vegetables we more of a hash brown, or blended veggie patty, instead of individual fried veggies- very tasty.  The paneer had a green, spicy sauce inside; also very tasty, and 2 of the 3 kids approved.
For main courses, we tried the chicken tikka &#34;sizzler&#34;.  A little different than We are used to, closer to a regular tandoori chicken, but still good, none the less.  Our usual saucy dish was hijacked by our daughter.  She usually just lets us order, as we all share, and we know what everyone likes.  But she decided to open a menu and pick something out, so we went with it.  She chose the chicken curry.  It was very good.  Different, as we typically get a tomato sauce based dish.  As the description says, this has a traditional sauce.  I would order it again, though would probably want to make the rounds on the menu first just to try different things.  We also ordered the mutter paneer, which is a vegetarian dish of peas &amp; paneer in a creamy sauce.  We ordered everything mild, as we didn&#39;t know what we were getting nito, and didn&#39;t want to turn off the kids.  The mutter paneer was so mild, it was almost sweet.  We would probably order this spicier next time.  We had to order 3 full entrees since everything is a la carte, which raised the price we are used to for the cuisine.  We do like the places that offer a &#39;thali&#39; as it provides enough side dishes that we don&#39;t have to order more entrees.  But I suppose the kids are getting older, and they get more expensive to feed.
As we were finishing our meal, every table was full and there were several groups waiting for tables.
We will probably be back.  As we try more of their menu, I can foresee I will likely raise their rating."

Where have all the boston market&#39;s gone? They have a promo from July 7 to the 13th which is BOGO except for the discounted single dinners. I have not had boston market ever in store so I was excited to give it a try. The staff was super friendly and quick to take the order. They bring the food out to your table for you. The half chicken meal was delicious, the skin of the skin was well flavored. With the sides you can&#39;t go wrong with the loaded mash potato a blend of cheese and bacon! and creamed spinach. After your done you get up and leave without even having to clean. The only one detracting value is that as you ate you noticed the food is a bit on the saltier side, but otherwise simply delicious.

Pro: family style options, clean, friendly staff, lots of delicious sides

Cons: slightly on the saltier side

Hidden gem: 
Sign up for the email club to get coupons. Promo now until July 13th buy one get one free coupon the website. The dark piece meal is nicely discounted as well"

One of the best Boston Market experiences that I&#39;ve had.

3 piece dark chicken meal ($6.99) - 4.5 stars. I love Boston Market&#39;s dark chicken. Never dry and it comes with that thin, but flavorful skin. It comes with 2 sides of your choice and cornbread. A half dark chicken meal is 4 pieces of chicken and costs around $7.50 (can&#39;t remember the exact price, but it was less than $8). Of the sides, I like the sweet potato casserole (more like a dessert) and loaded mashed potatoes. The mac &amp; cheese is fairly good, very cheesy."

The ribs were decent, but I don&#39;t expect out-of-this-world ribs at Boston Market. The rotisserie chicken is fantastic!  It&#39;s juicy, tender, and flavorful; about on-par with Costco&#39;s chicken. The creamed spinach and veggies were nice complements.

I used to go to a Boston Market in Dekalb all the time with a friend until they closed.  Sadly, that was the last time I was there...until last night.  It was honestly just as good as I remember!

We got the meal for four people--a whole rotisserie chicken and four sides w/ four cornbreads.  Our sides were: the veggie stuffing, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and cinnamon apples.

Everything hit the spot quite nicely--it was just what I needed on a freezing January night.  It was warm, delicious, and just as I remembered (although the stuffing was a new addition, they didn&#39;t always have that).  They definitely kept the recipes the same, and I definitely appreciate the continuity!

I wish they had better coupons, though.  $1 off is lame!

But I will definitely be back!  It is worth the money, and there was enough for lunch leftovers for both me and my husband the next day!"

It makes no sense why they did that. It was my absolute favorite and I would get it everytime. I never go there anymore unless there is someone insisting on it. 

I went last week and got the Side Dish meal, no meat. I&#39;ve gotten their meats but just am not a big fan of the non-ham dishes. Their mac &amp; cheese is all sorts of amazing-Super cheesy &amp; creamy.  Their corn is always tasty, too. For my third side, I got the cinnamon apples. Yum! More like a dessert then a side. Their brownies are also the bomb.

They&#39;ve classed it up and use real plates now. Nice!

Prices are high so try to always use a coupon. This particular location has a decent amount of parking, hard to maneuver getting in &amp; out of the parking lot, and hit or miss employees in terms of paying attention to you and being friendly."

I mean, coming from the West on Golf Road, I have to make a U-Turn from one of the busiest intersections!

I recently went and ordered their $7.99 Half Chicken Special. It included 2 sides but I couldn&#39;t resist paying $1.29 for a third. I also couldn&#39;t resist a slice of their apple pie for dessert.

This is my favorite fast food restaurant because it doesn&#39;t feel or taste anything like fast food. The meals are served with real plates and silverware. Free refills on Coke products. 

An employee comes by to clear plates, offers extra napkins and refills, and will bring To-Go containers for leftovers. A sign is posted with a request not to leave a gratuity but it&#39;s really hard to resist."

I love their chicken pot pie!!! Potatoes, chicken, Garvey in their pie crust! So absolutely mouth watering.

The rotisserie chicken is salty for my taste. Extremely tender and falling off bone. Great flavor, but still salty.
Green beans can use some improvements, taste like old aged green beans. 
Loaded mash potatoes has plenty of butter and bacon. It was okay.
Mac&amp;cheese was cheesy and good."

Now the closest location to us is the Schaumburg one.  Ordered from them three times in the last month.  Once for Thanksgiving (heat &amp; serve Thanksgiving turkey meal package) and then twice after that for the meatloaf cuz it was that good.  

This location&#39;s kind of a pain to get in and out of (and park), but the restaurant is a decent size and the food is always good.  Our faves are the creamed spinach, sweet potatoes, and green bean casserole...and all the meats, not just the chicken - did I mention their meatloaf is good? ; ) 

Staff here is friendly and service is quick.  And I have to say - if you don&#39;t feel like wearing yourself out preparing a huge Thanksgiving meal - this is the place to go (we&#39;ve tried the major Grocery stores, but Boston Market is by far our fave now)."

The chicken is flavorful and juicy. The sides are fresh; its mashed potatoes doesn&#39;t taste like the boxed flakes from KFC. 

And weekly coupons in the Sunday papers help soften the price by $4.

Only downside to this location is the horrible location -- no drive-through, shared entrance and exit, and no median crossing. Best to come east on Golf or north on Roselle, turn left on Golf."

Dressing: 0
Clearly out of the box and nasty. I threw three large containers of dressing in the garbage. It tasted very watery and nasty. My dog wouldn&#39;t eat this dressing.


Chocolate cake: 5
Decent not great. It came nearly frozen and very, very, cold right out of the freezer. It even got watery when thawed. 



Barbecue chicken: 6
Decent not great, a little under cooked in spots. The sauce was okay, nothing special. 


Meatloaf: 2
Nasty! Could be much better. It needed some seasoning. I would not recommend this to anyone.


Cornbread muffin: 2
I can&#39;t believe they messed this up. Lightly cooked and flavorless.


Employee attitude- 10
They seemed very nice. I really hate to give the food bad ratings, but I have to be honest."

Another thing I really like is the Gold Peak tea machine they have.  Something about Gold Peak sweet tea...  It goes really well with Boston Market food.

I like the dark meat - I can&#39;t help it.  There&#39;s just something juicier or tastier about the dark meat.  After viewing the nutrition facts for the sides and thinking that really, I&#39;m getting the same nutrition value from fried chicken, I settled on their 2 piece dark chicken meal.

The chicken pieces and onions n capsicum were doused in tomato ketchup! The chicken pieces were fried, God knows when! It was stale tasting and couldn&#39;t even finish the piece in mouth!

I know this sounds funny, but their glasses of water are spotless..this is something one must check at Indian restaurants.  Sounds of south Indian pop music echo through the room...standby.
Okay I&#39;m stuffed.  Dosa was huge, crispy, and the aloo (potato) filling was generous and spicy.  Chili chicken was vibrant and exploded with flavor.  Chick korma tasted nothing like classic korma, but it was my favorite dish. It had that toasted mustard seed &amp; coconut south Indian kick..mmm!  Goat curry also rocked, big botis (morsels).   Naan was soft and buttery. 1 naan = 4 pieces.  I read that food was served cold, but all was hot and steamy, in fact I burned my mouth.  The only thing not piping hot was the chili chicken, perhaps because they had to drain it after frying?  Either way, I sensed I had to give this place a 2nd visit and my family was glad I did!

I noticed that this place had only Indian patrons. I knew that it must be quality! After looking over the menu I asked for a few recommendations. A bunch of people came in to pick-up orders and I noticed that 90% of them ordered what the man just suggested for me. I knew I had to get the Chicken Biriyani and come nahn. It was a TUN of food and I ate until I could no longer fit anymore and there was a bunch of rice that I can use for another dish this weekend.

They were kind and patient with my questions, and the food was very satisfying. I will be going back here again soon!"

It really hits the spot after a long night of drinking.

On another note, their pricing structure doesn&#39;t really make sense.  It&#39;s cheaper to get an entire 2-entree combo plate than it is to just order 1 entree on the side with nothing else.  Go figure."

I love their Chicken Biriyani &amp; Fish Fry, and also the Chilli Chicken. Mostly, that&#39;s all I have tried there. And I have had these 3 dishes on more than 15 separate occassions. They are really good.
Pricing is slightly on the higher side. Chicken Biriyani for $8.5 is a decent buy and for the quantity you get, it is actually a pretty good spicy deal. However, the Fish Fry &amp; Chilli Chicken seem pricey for $7. 

Nevertheless, their service is on time and quality is excellent. I have also liked this place for a simple reason of being themselves and catering to the needs of the Indian crowd in Wheeling, Arlington Heights etc, unlike some of the other Indian restaurants who target all but end up compromising on the spice &amp; taste of the food to suit all palletes.

I would not go so far as to say this is an Irish Pub. It is somewhat dark, there is an enormous bar in the center of the place (which was packed), and tables spread throughout.

When we first arrived we saw the sign saying to seat yourself. We did and moved three times before anyone greeted us. Now that that is out of the way, the rest of the experience was good.

We went here on a whim on a Thursday night when we saw their special was free wings with a beverage. I had a Guinness and my wife had white wine. You have your choice of a variety of types of wings. Being more of a purist, we got them medium. The wings were a little on the small side, but all-in-all, pretty good. The Guinness was poured very well - a little foam on the top.

When we finished the wings I asked if we could order more or if we had to order more beverages. The answer was what we expected, so we ordered off the menu. I had more wings - 1/2 hot and 1/2 medium. Kerrie had a half order of nachos. I don&#39;t eat Nachos, but she said they were good. As for the wings, when you order off the menu, the wings are larger. They are not huge, but bigger than the free ones. I think they must have brought medium and mild but I ate them anyway.

When we found our table, I have to say we lucked out with the server. She was attentive and friendly. Being our first time there, you expect to see the regulars get all of the attention. But we were treated like they wanted us to come back. So, while I would say the food was okay and not great, I would go back again."

Paid this place a visit just a few minutes ago (06Mar16). We were there at around 6pm and there wasn&#39;t too many people in there. We should have taken that as a hint and ran like hell but it&#39;s Sunday so maybe that&#39;s why it isn&#39;t busy. A sign by the door states to seat yourself. We chose a booth right by the entrance and the waitress took our drink orders. All was well and the drinks came after a few minutes.

Then we placed our order. Here&#39;s when the 9th level of hell started. First off, there&#39;s no way in any worlds, in any existing multiverses would I ever be found ordering a sandwich because I hate sandwiches and I hate bread. Additionally, who in their right mind would actually order a sandwich with a mashed potato? We placed an order of hot wings for an appetizer and then I placed my order for a skirt steak supposedly flavored with adobo seasoning and grilled to your liking with a side (mashed potato). She then started to walk away without a word. Then my dining partner said &#34;and I also want...&#34; which made her stop and listen. I was not sure what she was rushing around about since there was barely anyone in there.

Our wings came and they tasted pretty good. Spicy and well-flavored. A couple minutes later, our food came and it was downhill from there. Think of sabotaging a vehicle and cutting the main break line and imagine how fast it would go down a hill while the driver keeps pushing the break in panic with both feet yet nothing happens. That&#39;s how it went. About 15 minutes later, she came back and I told her politely that my order was incorrect. She gave me this look like I am completely inconveniencing her life by saying so and states, &#34;uh....&#34; gave me another funny look and continued &#34;I&#39;ll take this back and try to get you the right one.&#34;  No apologies or anything, she just walked away. Wow! Very rude. SIDE NOTE: My dining partner was also wondering why I got a sandwich when I didn&#39;t order one.

Please note that after the food delivery, she has been by the table behind ours several times but avoided looking or coming over our table. We needed more drinks but didn&#39;t get any. I finally got very upset while waiting for my food because she has increasingly ignored us that I walked over to the bar and ordered drinks for our table calmly. The bar tender felt bad that I had to walk over and place our table&#39;s order at the bar that she walked the drinks over and told us it was on her. What a nice gesture but I am already feeling horrible.

My food came and it had no flavor. I had to add salt and pepper to make it edible. I was hungry and didn&#39;t want to make a scene so I made the most of it and ate it.

Overall, it was worse than horrible. It was hell-ish."

On the north end of the bar is a fireplace which is nice to sit by on cold days.  The majority of the place is taken up by the bar and there are eating / drinking tables surrounding it.  There is an outside patio but Algonquin is so close that I think the cars and road dust would take away from the enjoyment of sitting there.

If you&#39;re fortunate enough to be served by Tom, who works in the evenings, you&#39;ll receive nothing short of exceptional service - he&#39;s willing to cook even after the kitchen is &#34;closed,&#34; he&#39;ll make you awesome drinks and comp you without question if you&#39;ve been stuck waiting. He&#39;s an excellent, personable, and attentive bartender, cook, and server, and every night that he&#39;s there, I have a fantastic experience.

Things are much different during the afternoons and nights when Tom isn&#39;t there. Some waitresses are personable on occasion, but they have a tendency to be incredibly slow. During the day (around 3-4pm), on at least three occasions, the waitress was so slow that it took fifteen minutes for us to receive water, and an hour and a half for our entire visit, which consisted of two drinks and some appetizers. 

During the evenings when it&#39;s a bit more busy,  waitress/bartenders can be rather negligent, observed having side conversations and paying more attention to preferred patrons. They won&#39;t serve food after 11:00pm, and the drinks they make have been syrupy in my experience.

The food is good, and the drinks are a hit or miss. There isn&#39;t that extensive of a beer selection, which definitely loses some points with me since there&#39;s a high chance that the mixed drinks will be less than satisfactory. Overall, it&#39;s a mediocre sports bar - there&#39;s plenty of televisions and seating (although your service will be exponentially slower if you don&#39;t sit by the bar).

I understand that this is a sports bar and not a gourmet restaurant, but nearly everyone in our party commented on how bland the food that we ordered was. On top of that, our service was below par- we would ask for things such as silverware or condiments several times and in most cases we ended up getting them for ourselves from the waitress station or other tables.

In defense of the wait staff- the place was crowded and they only had 2 people waiting tables. I don&#39;t understand why on a Sunday when a team with a local following is fighting for a spot in the Super Bowl that there wasn&#39;t more staff assigned to work by the management. Even one more waitress would have made a huge difference.

Lots of TV&#39;s for watching sports- but the one nearest to where we were seated had a serious burn-in on the screen that was distracting while trying to watch the hockey game.

Just the right size, not too big, not too small. The weathered exterior looks like something that was plucked up out of Ireland and dropped in Schaumburg. Our initial bartender (guy) had a terrific first impression with my wife when he carded her, well done sir.
The place seemed lively enough, games on the screens, $3.50 Leini Octobers, what&#39;s not to like? 
We were not there long at all but enjoyed ourselves and kind of wish we had one around the corner from home. 
Tip - this is obviously not a real irish bar but it does a good enough job that it will suffice for Schaumburg. Unlike some newer &#34;irish bars&#34; that capitalize on a theme alone with nothing irish about them outside of the cheesy decor. 
Not sure what the event was outside of football, but the ladies streaming in the place on a Sunday evening as we were leaving  were dressed to kill something, what, I am not sure.

At any rate, as a lunch place, Finn McCool&#39;s nails it; the staff has always been fantastic in my experience. We&#39;ve never had to send an order back, and the food is amazingly cheap--and of better than good quality (especially for the price). The beer selection is better than most, and the drinks are quite reasonable; even with a beer or two for one of us and soft drinks for the other two, it&#39;s rare that we top a $40 lunch tab for the table. My only complaint is they&#39;ve taken a few of my old favorite things off the menu, namely mac `n&#39; cheese. 

Definitely try the hot pretzels with cheddar sauce &amp; the cheese curd appetizers. I like the homemade crispy potato chips alongside most lunch entrees. The Angry SOB burger needs a little extra Sriracha to be a heat-seeker&#39;s dream [they don&#39;t stock ghost peppers, unfortunately], but it&#39;s good beef &amp; respectably spicy as-is. Their burgers are quite substantial, good quality &amp; sell for less than Five Guys&#39;, so that&#39;s always a good bet. Mrs. S usually goes for the French Onion Soup or the Inside-Out Grilled Cheese. 

All in all, it&#39;s a great &amp; enjoyable lunch for amazingly little money, and it&#39;s kinda become our go-to informal weekend lunch spot."

Then she asked us if we could pay our bill before we were done because she &#34;wanted to go home&#34;. However, when she left us the bill, it was for all the wrong food, which she laughed and said &#34;it must be some food from my other table.&#34; Brought the bill back, once again charging us for things we didn&#39;t order. Finally (3rd times a charm) got the bill right and we paid. She said she would Introduce us to our new waitress, then informed us she was also leaving, but she would put more drink orders in for us. Brought our drinks with another bill! Then we had to start a tab at the bar because she was off shift. The bar tab, for the same order was a smaller bill then ordering it through the waitress?? So we had to pay 3 bills for the night. Absolutely annoying to have to pay 3 bills for a dinner and a few cocktails. I used to think this place was fun, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back...

The pace could be a little bit quicker, but a great time with friends competing against total strangers!

The atmosphere... not exactly Irish pub... more like Irish pub meets TGIFriday&#39;s?  I do like looking at all of the old album covers on the walls.

The service... mixed.  We go enough that we know which servers we want and which we want to avoid.  Let&#39;s put it this way, when it&#39;s good, it&#39;s good.  When it&#39;s bad... I hope you ate before you came.

The food/drinks:  Typical.  Drink specials on Wednesdays include a $3.50 Harp or Guinness (yum!) and $3.50 &#34;pint of the month&#34; (Sam Adams Oktoberfest this month.)  I think they have a $5.00 burger on Wednesday&#39;s as well.

Other foods I&#39;ve tried:

Chopped salad.  Pretty standard, but a large enough portion that I can get away with just that.
French Onion Soup: pass.  To me, it&#39;s not french onion when its provelone and not gruyere.  Cheese snob, I know.
Hickory Burger: Messy, but delicious.  
Fish Fry: I&#39;ve yet to try it because the menu specifies perch, but every time I go to order they tell me all they have is cod.  sad face.
Grilled chicken sandwich: Again, messy, because avocados and chipotle sauce are slippery.  The flavor is good.
Moretti&#39;s pizzas:  If you want pizza, you can get a fix here.

I drive by this place all.the.time, but I&#39;ve never ventured in, mostly because it always sounded to me like a cheesy Irish theme bar, and I&#39;m not Irish (didn&#39;t even get to eat my Lucky Charms when I was a kid).  
Upon setting foot into the restaurant, I came to the realization that it IS a cheesy Irish themed restaurant/bar (at least my expectations were on par).  They have typical bar food and a large assortment of drinks.  I decided to go go the safe route and get the grilled cheese with tomato and bacon, because it&#39;s pretty hard to screw up a grilled cheese, AND this one promised cheese on the outside and on the inside.  I do love me some cheese.  In an attempt to health-ify my lunch in the slightest bit, I opted for a side salad instead of chips or fries.  When I asked for Italian dressing, I got a semi-dirty look and was told they don&#39;t have ITALIAN dressing; they have BALSAMIC...oops.  The grilled cheese was everything my stomach could imagine, and the salad was pretty tasty too.  The portions were big enough that I barely finished half the sandwich, and like a good little girl, I finished my salad and took the other half of the grilled cheese home for later.
All in all, if you&#39;re looking for the type of Irish bar that only an American could dream up, Finn McCool&#39;s your Huckleberry.  For as good as the grilled cheese turned out to be, I just might be back for more."

My girlfriend and I showed up at Finn McCools one sunday afternoon to grab a bite to eat. Before we even entered, we were both overcome by a feeling of dread and forboding...perhaps it was the greasy smell which permeated from the kitchens smoke stack?

We entered this &#34;Irish Sports Pub&#34; establishment, only to discover it was filled to the rafters with middle age, midwestern corn eaters in their football jerseys, eyes glazed over gazing up at the 300 flat screen televisions. The airliner-taking off volume of the televisions was surpassed only by the sorority girl-turned waitress who, microphone in hand, shouted slogans about &#34;$2.50 Bombs&#34; to the peanut gallery.

With a fair degree of trepidation, we took our seats at the only table available (complete with its own 1000 decible speaker afixed above it). 

The menu is pretty standard bar food...difficult to screw up, and features such traditional irish fare as McTacos, pot stickers, BBQ meatloaf and even pizza (which is snuck in through the back door from another restaurant across the road and pawned off as their own). 

Reinforcing the irish theme of the place are neon fixtures, witty hand painted signs making vague references to the old country and a few ceramic beer steins on a shelf which I suspect were actually german spies from bavaria.

Throughout the experience, the sorority girl continued to scream at the crowd, reminding them that noon on a sunday was the perfect time to take down some jaeger bombs and assorted shots..

The food...my girlfriend bravely ordered the stew which was on &#34;special&#34; that day and was immediatly asked if she would like &#34;soup or salad&#34;...apparently she didn&#39;t think soup would go very well with stew, so ordered the salad instead.

The salad came - a bed of machine shredded lettuce, a few traumatized and lonely veggies and ranch dressing spiked with blue cheese crumbles, pretending to be blue cheese dressing.

I ordered the Turkey clubhouse on flatbread...this was deli turkey, an over abundance of shredded lettuce (which had escaped being a salad), and some shredded cheese borrowed from the local taco bell. It didn&#39;t taste bad at all...in fact, it had no taste.

The beef stew came...it was as black as night...a slick of crude oil bathing what appeared to be strips of meat. I did not ask to try it and my girlfriend was kind enough not to offer.

After lunch, we left the establishment in silence. My girlfriend was nearly shaking with anger and I was afraid she was going to dump me on the spot."

This white haired man spent his life hunting and fighting for justice and love. He reportedly loved a good time with friends, enjoyed good drink and food, would not settle for poor service, and believed in giving proper praise. Well Finn would visit and re-visit this place named for him. 

The traditional Irish foods are really good, the burgers are okay, the beer selection is nice, the staff is friendly, the prices are alright, the place does need a deep cleaning, and the restrooms are a bit neglected.

I first went there for new years eve this past year.  They had an awesome deal.  I believe it was $45 8-12:30 for everything except shots.  This also included a crap load of appetizers. I could be wrong about the time but it was something awesome like that.  
I went with a younger type of crowd though and it seems like the crowd there is slightly older.  Not by much but enough to make a difference for us.  There was a dance floor and a bunch of us wanted to dance the night away but a lot of people just sort of stood around.  The peoples fault, not the bar!  ;)  Regardless, it didn&#39;t stop us from dancing!

The second time I went there, it was St. Patrick&#39;s Day.  I still had a fun time that night too.  We ordered one of those personal table tappers.  I think it was $20 or $30 but we found $20 on the floor so that was a plus for us!  We had a table and stood around observing and having a really good time.  People seemed a little crazier for this holiday than new years eve, but I mean, what holiday isn&#39;t crazier than St. Patrick&#39;s Day!  Oh and the bar is Irish... that helps too! 

Fun place, I wish I could get there more often for big parties.  If you have a group of people and there&#39;s a holiday or even coming up, go there.  Good food and a really friendly staff."

Granted first impression are important, but don&#39;t you guys believe in second chances?  

Finn&#39;s started doing pub trivia, which they call &#34;Quizzo&#34; on Wednesday nights around 8.  I went with a group of friends and we all thought it was a blast.  Mix in a few of those giant table tappers with pub trivia ( about 2.5liters of beer served in an ice cold glass tube you keep at your table...i can&#39;t really describe it much better except to say that they&#39;re awesome!) and you&#39;ve got a great night!  

One of my favorite things about Finn&#39;s are the chips!  I was never a fan of crinkle cut fries, but they offer chips which are homemade and amazingly crunchy!  I also found out they have Acoustic Bands on Thursdays..still need to check that out but I can&#39;t imagine that it wouldn&#39;t be good."

We sat at the bar and the bartender took good care of us and made some suggestions, too. The menu had a wide variety -- burgers, sandwiches, salad, standard bar food, and some Irish entrees as well. I ordered the St. Patty Melt (on rye) with fries and a cup of the French Onion soup, which the bartender suggested. Thank God for her suggestion. It was seriously the BEST French Onion soup I have ever had -- anywhere! Including 5-star dining. I was completely surprised! The burger and fries were great, too.

I wonder what their electricity bill is like. Typically when I&#39;m in this area, I might be at Stadium playing Buck Hunter Safari or Moretti&#39;s, &#34;trying something different&#34; in mind finally dragged me in. There were some corporate happy hour types and then the early 20s crowds. Good space for groups; couples and singles have plenty of space to sit and chill or grab a seat at the four sided bar which is stocked with its own TVs. They offer food which I didn&#39;t get to sample since the kitchen closes early. On a post connected to the bar are markings in red leading to a red phone. It reads &#34;pizza hot-line&#34; I suppose its hard lined to Moretti&#39;s, the bartender says not to pick it up, it&#39;s a line just for the use of the bartender. Why have it there in red and wanting to be grabbed if we can&#39;t use it to order? 
The bartender which helped us that night was not sweet, inviting or available. At the bar, it was slow, although there were many tables with groupings of people. When I asked for the specials she told us about two of them, $3 Sam seasonals and $3 Stoli cocktails. She failed to tell us about the most popular special of the evening, looking around I noticed there were many table toppers in use. Table toppers are tall funnels with spigot and a beer carrying capacity of about 6-8 pints. Typically the charge is around $16-$20 dollars or the price of the number of beers inside. She failed to share with me that they were on special for $10.. mind you she had a table topper sitting on the bar while she talked to us and it wasn&#39;t being held for anyone. I think she just didn&#39;t care enough to share the details. I can assume any number of reasons why she didn&#39;t give up the info and this on top of the already non caring attention wasn&#39;t helping her tip. I now wish I approached the Milfity buxom bartender for service, from the moment she walked into the bar she had already made eye contact and let us know she was there, just in case. That&#39;s service. 

Finn has got their own parking lot. I don&#39;t remember seeing any coin games, though they could use a couple. Outside seating is available but with the 30 foot policy, to smoke you would need to exit the premises.

The doorman was friendly and their bathrooms were clean. My friend was having her birthday party and she had some tables reserved, but not nearly enough. All went well when many of the patrons left, having finished their meals. The party slowly took over the whole back section.

She had a birthday package Which included appetizers and All you can drink from 10p-1a for $20 per person. This does not include shots. 
I was having Bacardi and Cokes, which were decent, meaning not watered down.

We were served Nachos and a sort of sampler platter. I did not like the Nachos, they were dry, I guess you could say. Their buffalo wings were good, The fried shrimp was good, but they had this beef kabob thing that was delicious!

The D.J started at 11p.m I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the norm or if it was because of the Hawks game. He started playing some 80&#39;s rock and slowly went into today&#39;s top 40. It was just o.k, much like the rest of the place.

The only real problem was that their were approximately 25 of us and only one server, and you could not get your drinks from the bar. I think she did the best she could, although I think a few people couldn&#39;t get any service from her. I do believe she had other guests besides us. Anyway it was all you can drink, they had to save money somehow!

There&#39;s stain glass windows, mosaic floor, and plenty of flat screen tv&#39;s. The majority of my time there they were playing classic rock music (which I was happy to hear), but by 8:00 or so the music went off and they started some type of trivia game, and instead of music you were stuck listening to an MC organizing all of that.

Good beer selection and priced normal for the suburbs.  They have the table top beer taps for those interested in more than a pint or two.  They looked interesting but I was the only one drinking so will have to evaluate their efficiency another time :-)

The food was very good!  I had the Saturday special - half slab of ribs and chicken fingers with fries and cole slaw.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the chicken and fries were crisp and hot.  My cousin and his wife had the steak sandwich and fried lake perch.  Both excellent as well.

The service was exceptional. Friendly and happy to accommodate ingredients in a particular dish to suit those ordering, however, it doesn&#39;t always have the desired results. 

The egg drop soup is spot on perfect as well as the appetizers, which are served up on a sampler. But, the main courses just seemed to lack any distinctiveness. The curry chicken failed to distinguish itself from how it&#39;d be served at just about any other place and the noodles in my wife&#39;s dish were a bit on the burnt side. 

Overall, it is absolutely Chinese food, but of the run-of-the-mill sort that doesn&#39;t place itself at the forefront of begging regular return visits."

The crab meat pockets (ragoons) are to die for!

The guy who usually answers the phone is always super nice. He takes my order without any issue ( I omit certain veggies) and it&#39;s pretty much hassle free. And the delivery guy is always really polite. Technically there is another little chinese hole-in-the wall place even closer to my apartment which I&#39;ve never tried, but the first time I called they couldn&#39;t delivery because they were short their delivery person.

Never let down.  Many chinese places give me a queezy stomach, but this one does not, so that&#39;s always a plus.  My three favorite parts about this place are the owners who are more then friendly, the fried rice (this is real good stuff if you have never had it, or have been turned off from another resturant&#39;s fried rice, this stuff is different and delicious), and how all the food is made to order.  They do NOT use bagged kits and heat them up for you.  This place also does NOT use MSG.  Love this place, try it!!  

My favorite dishes.
Sweet and Sour Chicken (great day of, not so good reheated but that is because of the breading)
Beef with Broccoli (great day of and reheated)
Hunan Beef (great day of and reheated)
General Tso Chicken (great day of and pretty good reheated, again breading)

They definitely get a star for their service. The guys working there are very friendly and efficient. I really wish the food was great so I could patronize here regularly, sadly it was just meh.

The honey chicken is unlike other Chinese places...no yummy, creamy honey mayo type of sauce. It was more like a sweet and sour sauce with a hint of honey. I had high expectations as this dish was $13, more then the average $8 dish on their menu. The price must be because of the huge portion though. I only ate 1/4 of the dish and am completely stuffed as I write this. The chicken was a tiny bit dry but the deep frying was great on it and the sauce was just average. However, as I said, not the normal honey chicken.

The eggrolls are much smaller then eggrolls at other places and again they are just average in taste. Nothing spectacular.

The food is all average, service is great, prices are good for the portions. It pains me to say it when the owners were so nice but this is somewhere that can be skipped and I won&#39;t be a regular at Absolutely Chinese."

It is in a little strip mall.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef off of their lunch menu &amp; the price was great.  

It was only $6.95 &amp; it came with white rice or fried rice, &amp; soup.  So for $6.95 I got an Entree, Rice &amp; a Hot &amp; Sour Soup.  We also ordered a side of egg rolls.  The waitress was nice &amp; the service was pretty quick.  

They had a pretty good selection on the menu &amp; their prices were all pretty good as well.  The soup came out it was a small size because it was on the lunch menu but it was nice &amp; hot &amp; it was delicious.  The Egg Rolls came out &amp; they were just as good.  

Finally the entree arrived &amp; I was already starting to get full from the appetizers.  The size of the entree was pretty good especially for such a great price.  The food was spicy just how I ordered &amp; it was very tastey.  The food was hot &amp; tasted fresh &amp; I found out that they don&#39;t use MSG in their food so it made for a better taste &amp; didn&#39;t make you feel full right away.  From the appetizers to the entree, the food was delicious.  

Overall this is another good find in Chinese restaurants.  The food was delicious &amp; the prices were just as good.  The place was clean &amp; the service was good.  The waitress kept coming back to the table to check up on us.  Overall I would eat here again if I was in the area."

Unfortunately they rarely change.  Most of the items are pretty good, but the sweet items tend toward syrup-like sauces.  There are no spicy items, but you can add red oil, if you get some in a small dish at the start (it, like all condiments is not on the tables).

At about 11:15 I walked in to an empty restaurant that had an empty buffet table.  No one was around so I just grabbed a chair at the nearest table and sat.  After 30 seconds or so, one of the employees walked in from outside and asked if they could help me.  &#34;I&#39;m here for the buffet&#34;.  He curtly tells me that the doors open at 11 but the buffet is 11:30.  I politely dispute this based on what the menu I took off the counter and was now holding in my hand says.  The reply was buffet opens at 11.  No point in arguing and I can&#39;t wait since I have limited time for lunch, I went to Fusion Land instead.

If they changed the buffet times and I had an old menu, fine.  But when even the current menu clearly states the buffet starts at 11, that just annoys me.  

Too bad, the food here was good the last time I was here.  Now that I know 11 means 11:30 I will still give them another shot.

I&#39;ll still give 2 stars instead of 1 for the crap service just because on my last visit the food was good."

Rice was good, not dry, good flavor, beef was good also, had some dried noodles that i was unsure about but i ate them anyway. My issue was the quantity, it was lacking. The food was not that good that I felt it was qualify over quantity.  After paying almost $8.50 (that&#39;s with tax) i was still starving.

I did not do the buffet but did carry-out for lunch.  I was expecting generous portion sizes per the norm of Chinese carry-out.  This was the smallest quantity of food that I have ever received out of any Chinese restaurant.  You will NOT have left overs!  With that being said, my crab rangoon was soggy.  The rice was fried but with no other proteins added, no pork or chicken in this rice.  The flavors were above average, however the Kung Pao chicken seemed to be pulled from the buffet pan rather than individually stir fried for me.  Flavors are good enough but the size stinks!  For $6, I can do better in the area."

Turns out that the food was fantastic!  The best Chinese food I have had in a very long time.  Highly recommended.  Service was very good as well.  My only complaint would have been that the temperature of the place was very cold.

I can&#39;t believe that anyone would give them less than 4 stars.  I ate once at the restaurant and took carryout the other time. Both times were fabulous.  This is not 5 star cuisine, but for what it is, a casual Chinese place in the burbs, it earns 5 stars in my book.  Food is served super fast, service is above and beyond friendly, and the food is excellent.  If you like typical Americanized Chinese food (pretty much everywhere), where vegetables are soggy and lacking and your meat is drowned in heavy, MSG loaded sauces, then this is not the place for you.  If you like a large assortment of fresh, crisp, properly prepared vegetables cooked delicately and properly in lighter sauces, then you should give this place a try.  I loved it!"

The ambiance was pretty much what one expects from a strip-mall storefront. The pot-stickers, though, were fantastic. The dough was light, crispy, and every bit as good as the dumplings one gets in Chinatown. 

I had the Szechwan beef, and was quite pleased with the quality and texture of the food. My girlfriend had the honey-chicken, and the taste was excellent. The presentation of the food was quite a bit more than I&#39;m used to from similar restaurants, and the staff was unceasingly friendly, courteous, and quite attentive. 

If you&#39;re looking for some good Chinese in the northwest burbs, I&#39;d give it a shot."

I ordered kung pao chicken, which is a staple at Chinese restaurants and usually pretty flavorful. AC&#39;s version was bland and the sauce was runny, although there was a nice assortment of vegetables. I ordered this spicy dish &#34;extra-extra&#34; spicy, but what I got was about a 2 out of 5 on the spice meter. My wife ordered chicken chow fun and said it was OK, but nothing special. The crab rangoon were large and fairly good, although they weren&#39;t filled to the brim, and they were a tad sweet for my taste. One positive is that the portions are large, so if you find something you like, you can get two or three meals off the biggest size. All in all, it was pedestrian Chinese food that is cooked for white suburbia."

Both times I&#39;ve been to francesca&#39;s I&#39;ve experienced this. I ordered the Alaskan halibut the first time. This was the best fish I&#39;ve ever had. It was prepared with creamy polenta and a sauce that made it&#39;s $30 price tag worth every dollar. I went back specifically for this dish and to my disappointment it wasn&#39;t on the menu. I ordered the seabass with mushrooms and leak sauce. Holy Christ. This chef is amazing!!!!!!!!  Again the flavors worked together so well. The fish didn&#39;t have any hint of that ugly fishiness. It was perfect. 

The first time the staff was a little creepy. They were all lines up on the back wall staring at everyone eating and talking amongst themselves. It gave a very awkward feeling like we were being talked about. The food was so incredible that I went back regardless of the servers. The second time I had an amazing server. Very friendly and filled my cup the moment it was empty.  A much better environment than the first time.

Move over Bob Chinns. You have nothing, NOTHING on francescas!!! I can&#39;t wait for my next visit!!"

The big thing was that the service was super fast....like courses arriving before you are done with the next. It&#39;s a Tuesday night, 1/2 dozen empty tables....why are you hustling me out the door? 
Overall more curb appeal than actual diner appeal."

I&#39;d heard great things about this restaurant and was always curious when driving by, so last night I finally made a reservation and ate there. We started with drinks from the bar, which tasted fine but had too much ice and not enough of the actual cocktail. 

For dinner, we started with the risotto appetizer. I LOVE risotto, but hated this one. It had very little taste aside from the goat cheese, which I wasn&#39;t a fan of. I ordered the Penne Alle Verdure, which was again lacking in taste and very underwhelming. I thought to myself &#34;I could totally make this myself at home for way less money&#34;.  My boyfriend had the roasted chicken and my friend had a gluten free pasta. My boyfriend did like his dish and my friend said hers was okay, but nothing special.

Our service was good. He was timely and pretty friendly. The food came fast and he accommodated my friend&#39;s gluten allergy. No complaints there! 

Overall, maybe my expectations were too high coming into this experience, but for the money ($125 with tip for 2 drinks, an appetizer, 3 meals and a gelato), I really believe could have gotten a much better meal somewhere else. I will continue searching for a good suburban Italian restaurant."

We both said at the same time how it was the closest thing to being in Italy or parts of Croatia.  The bread alone was like being back in Italy.

We attended a family event here and took up two of their adjoining semi-private separate dining areas (you can still see out into the rest of the restaurant, I&#39;m not sure if there are curtains that could be closed or not).  Upon arrival our water glasses were filled right away but it took quite a while or the servers to come by and take drink orders (10 minutes after we sat down). After that initial slowness all the service was quick and very gracious.  The water glasses were promptly filled each time and each food course came out quickly.

Each table dined family style from the pre-selected catering menu and we had: minestrone soup, dinner salad, rigatoni in a creamy tomato sauce w/parmesan, Pollo arrosto alla Romana (rosemary/lemon chicken w/potatoes - delicious!), Italian sausage w/bell peppers &amp; onions, and for dessert cream puffs filled with vanilla ice cream &amp; topped with chocolate sauce (children had cups of ice cream rather than risk them dealing with the slippery cream puffs that would certainly have ended up on the floor otherwise).  Everything was good and there was plenty of food for each table but the chicken dish was the stand out with that delicious sauce.  The warm Italian bread on the table was very good, as well.

All in all it was a nice place to host an event and from what I heard they made it very easy with the planning, options, etc."

The pastas are fantastic (I recommend the rigatoni if you&#39;ve never been). The pizzas are very unique. My favorite thing I have to get every time though is the carpaccio.

This is my second time visiting Francesca&#39;s. First was for a bridal shower. At the shower (held in the private back room) the service was great and the food was pretty good. We had appetizer of pizza that was passed, which was my favorite of the courses. We also had a mixed salad and a rigatoni pasta (good but salty). 

Visited again for our anniversary dinner and food was pretty good. We had the carpaccio to start; I thought it was good and I enjoyed the addition of endive and radicchio however I thought the steak was almost cut too thing where it didn&#39;t hold up amongst the mushrooms/lemon/caper mix. It was still very good. For dinner my husband got the farfalle with ham and peas which was really good. That was the best thing we got that night. I got the lobster fettuccini special. It was good but my husband&#39;s was better. The fettuccini could have used another minute in the sauce to soak it in. Next time I would like to try the risotto and white fish dishes. 

They also brought us some free moscato di asti with cherries to celebrate our anniversary which was a nice touch. 

Again, found the dinner enjoyable and reasonably priced. Looking forward to visiting again and trying other items."

As soon as I walked in I was greeted pleasantly and had nothing but outstanding customer service during my entire visit.

We began with a drink at the bar and our bartender Rene (who also ended up being our server) was extremely personable.

I ordered the Rigatoni alla Norcina, a pasta with sausage, pancetta, and three cheese sauce.  The pancetta made the dish!  It was much better than the Gnocci A&#39;Emilliana that I had eaten previously at their other location.  Someone in our party ordered the gnocchi and the portion was quite small just as it was at the St. Charles location.  He was finished eating significantly sooner than the rest of us and seemed disappointed in his portion.

I love that they box up your leftovers for you!"

The service was absolutely great - I loved our waiter. He was polite, patient, attentive, and very accommodating. The food was also delicious. My favorite was the Rigatoni alla Siciliana and the Pizza alla Schiacciata alla Toscana. The rigatoni was the perfect amount of spice and flavor; the lemon on the pizza added the perfect touch to the truffle oil and parmesan cheese flavors. It was a bit too much mozzarella cheese for my personal taste but I enjoyed it nonetheless. We also got the bruschetta and the asparagus salad, which I thought was alright. The bruschetta was a bit more goat cheese than actual tomatoes. Overall really enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back! :)"

This was my first time here as I&#39;ve been to Francesca&#39;s N. only both on Taylor street and in Northbrook. This is under the same restaurant umbrella. Same menu layout and concept and a small selection of fresh, quality food. All are equally delicious. 

They write their menu, so you know the items sometimes change. The menu is small and not overwhelming. Service was excellent and the food was unreal, shut-the-front-door, out of this world. You get unlimited hot table side bread. You can order custom scratch made pizza-what my friend ordered. 

Probably some of the best ravioli I&#39;ve had in quite a while. It was Ravioli Alla Sorella. That sauce, made with wine, and light scratch made ravioli elevated the dish. A touch of spinach, red peppers, and pieces of chicken, is a dish worth the while. Rich yet light and flavorful. I&#39;ll visit again."

They serve great food, even rotating their menu every so often which helps change things up. I absolutely love their gnocchi, so get it while you can because it often sells out when they do have it. They serve bread with oil and cheese when you first arrive, and their menu is filled with great pastas, pizzas, and salads. I also recommend following up with some tiramisu or other yummy Italian dessert they serve, because they are good :). The only thing is they have paper on top of their tables, mostly because they give crayons to kids to let them color on it, but it takes away from the fancy, intimate feel of the restaurant. But, my family loves either ordering take out or going in to Francesca&#39;s when we crave really good pasta."

I would have appreciated if they could have let me know given the menu wasn&#39;t even an option and there was nothing on the website re: the change. While the food ended up being decent, it was a hot mess by the buffet. I get that there were kids there but the wait staff need to do a better job of refilling and cleaning up the buffet station faster - it just wasn&#39;t very appetizing.

In the are, searched Yelp for a nice spot. Lacks a little bit of everything from service to food. Not impressed at all with the atmosphere, decor is nice but no ambiance if you arrive before the dinner rush. It felt like we were just a practice run at 5 pm. Staff was either lingering or walking around in the dining as if they had not opened yet. Our server was friendly but smelled like he just finished a cigarette and was awkward and not very well trained, no polish. Caprese salad in an Italian restaurant deserves way more than the presentation and flavor offered. Pasta side with a basic garlic oil, spinach, tomato toss was so al dente it was more like not done and salty beyond edible. We eat out a lot and enjoy fine casual dining, almost always have dessert with a cup of coffee, even when we are stuffed. Skipped dessert and chalked it up to a loss."

We ordered drinks and they arrived about 5 minutes later which was pretty fast for a Saturday night. We immediately placed our order for our food thinking it be a wait since it was ind of busy but again we only waited maybe like 30minutes for it to get there.
My girlfriends and I ordered pasta and their portions are quite big we asked for a box! Another thing I really like is that they have Free Valet parking as well.

Today I joined a group of coworkers at the bar (around 4 pm, not one other customer inside there except our group of 9 ladies) to celebrate a birthday. The waiter we had at first was the douchebaggiest snarky punk A-HOLE I have ever encountered.  We decided to order some appetizers about 15 minutes after we sat down and asked if we could have a menu. He said- (I shit you not) &#34;you said when you got here you didn&#39;t need any menus! I&#39;ll be over in a bi.t&#34; and continued to roll silverware for the next 3 minutes. He got our group of 9 people ONE menu. We asked for more and he brought us only one more.  Honestly? It&#39;s like he was trying to be jerky.

Then, to place our appetizer orders we had to basically drag him away again from what he was working on and he started walking away and I had to shout my order as he was rushing from the table. If I was a manager at this restaurant and witnessed how rude he was to us, I would have fired him on the spot. We are all reasonable, kind people and are teachers and definitely understand if it is super busy or something but being downright rude for the sake of being a snarky jerk? Absolutely not. Most of us were pretty upset by him and said we didn&#39;t want to come back here because of his behavior. 

However, I did give this place 2 stars because it must have been the end of his shift and the guy that took over was super sweet and wonderful and the pizza tasted really good. Due to our awful treatment, I won&#39;t be back."

We sat at a booth in the bar area and aside from the over-bright lighting there, it was relatively comfortable.  (But those pin lights shouldn&#39;t be in the faces of people when they&#39;re eating...).
The menu is small but there&#39;s items available that aren&#39;t listed, and that&#39;s what I had: Chicken Parmigian, a Caesar salad and a tequila gimlet.
The salad was good and the chicken parm was excellent!  My associate had the pasta special with seafood and he was very happy.  Overall, a very good place that&#39;s worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area."

She could not be more easy to work with!  The first reason I picked this place was because there was no room charge, you could bring in a cake with out being charged, and everything was included in the cost of the menu plan.  Many places add on tons of extra charges, Francesca&#39;s doesn&#39;t!  

They allowed me to make changes easily to the menu, and made it clear they could handle last minute changes like a gluten issue easily as well. Julie gave lots of impute and helped us with decoration ideas as well.  My emails were responded to quickly, and put up with my 50 questions! 

On the day of everyone helped us bring in our decorations, introduced themselves, and doubled checked the menu and timing of service. They were OUTSTANDING!  Two guys helped us bring our gifts out to our cars as well. I have never seen better service before.  The food was wonderful as well, it always is. 
Thank you to everyone at Francesca&#39;s!"

If you&#39;ve been to other Francesca&#39;s restaurants, the food is consistant, traditional, and oh so yummy. There were a few things, however, that really stood out to me and why I&#39;ll always consider going to a Francesca&#39;s for a small event like a baby shower:

* they don&#39;t charge for the room reservation!!! Literally every other place that we looked at either had a minimum number of people (20 or more) or charged at least $150 for the 3 hour event. When Julie, the coordinator, told me that they only charged us for the food we ate (and of course tax and gratuity), I was sold!

* the variety of menu options for our event was great! We could do a family style, sit down plated, or (what we chose) a buffet appetizer course. They had a variety of menu options as well as a variety of price points, based on the quantity of food and how long the service lasted. Their special events options made it so easy to find an option for us! 

* the appetizer buffet was perfect for our baby shower of 13 people! We started with passed appetizers of chicken skewers while we stood around and chatted. When we sat down, we had a buffet of white pizza (delicious!!), bruschetta, and a risotto. I loved that they charged us per person, but refilled the buffet as many times as we needed during the hour of food that we paid for. AND we got to take home anything that was left! When our food time was finished, they just left it out for us to nibble on while we chatted and opened presents. Not only was the food delicious, but no one left hungry.

* I left Julie know that we had one of the guests who was allergic to gluten. They were AMAZING with providing us with gluten-free options for every piece of the meal! They provided gluten free bread, a small plate of gluten free bruschetta (which they kept refilling!) and one of the pizzas was made gluten free as well! All this, with no extra charge to the event!

* one word...doughnuts! Francesca&#39;s is affiliated with Glazed and Infused and we were able to order a tray of 50 mini doughnuts for $35! They have a variety of doughnuts including maple bacon (yum!!!), pumpkin chocolate chip (a seasonal but very yummy), and even did a gluten free for our guest that is allergic to gluten! Although you have to ask for the option, it&#39;s a great way to get something different!

I was so pleased with the service, the food, and the overall experience! This is definitely going to be one of my go-tos for events AND a nice dinner :)"

The menu is relatively small compared to some restaurants however most of what they do on that menu is done right. The offerings are generally made with few fresh ingredients. Very Italian in this approach. Pasta portions are large as you would expect but not Maggiano&#39;s size. However, most pasta dishes are done with a few fresh ingredients and I really appreciate the chefs deft hand. They have an eggplant and mozzarella cheese pasta dish that is quite outstanding. It&#39;s vegetarian friendly but there are of course several meat dishes that are quite good. Appetizers and salads are a bit pricey however the salad themselves usually have some high-end ingredients and my experience is that they are fresh and served quite cold which I appreciate so despite the higher cost it&#39;s well done and worth it. Entrees can range in price so if you are looking to either split a pasta or eat on the cheap you can order some of the lower priced pasta entrees. Wine menu is excellent and the wine has always been good. Atmosphere is casual but elegant.  I&#39;ve seen couples out for a romantic dinner, larger groups and families with children. Overall the wait staff in my experience has been excellent."

I was here for a luncheon meeting recently and was unimpressed with the food.  The food was served family style and included salad, chicken with capers served on spinach, pasta in a marinara sauce, and tiramisu.  The ice tea was incredibly weak and the bread served with the meal was not very good. With the exception of the tiramisu the food was very bland and would not encourage me to return and spend my own money on a meal here.  My recommendation is to spend your money elsewhere."

Francesca&#39;s also offers a really pretty party room for wedding and baby showers and a decent sized bar for when you need a cocktail or four. 

Will you find uber creative dishes akin to Chicago&#39;s Italian scene? No. But you&#39;ll find items that supersede the traditional chicken parm and fettuccine alfredo. I was especially satisfied with the mammoth tortellini portion - not only was the spinach and chicken tortellini flavorful and filling, but there was enough pasta for two additional lunches after I made a sizeable dinner dent. Talk about value, folks. 

As mentioned, the service is exceptional here. Servers are just as friendly and accommodating to couples and families and are often going far out of there way to ensure a pleasant dining experience. So, at the end of the day, if you&#39;re seeking fresh, fairly straight forward Italian eats in Arlington Heights that won&#39;t break the bank, Francesca&#39;s Tavola is a great choice."

Not sure how and why they&#39;re rated so highly, but I know my Italian food and this was pathetic. Both my dining companion and I couldn&#39;t eat our entrees it was so bad. The risotto was so heavy and so al dente. The shrimp pasta we ordered was again so al dente it was inedible. Disgusting, the pasta was all stuck together. The shrimp was tough. Server had to be flagged down to get our check. Do not come here, it would be a waste of your time and money."

We were greeted and seated immediately.  I personally do not prefer the style of seating where you are seated at separate tables, but on a big long booth on one side with chairs on the other, but that was my only complaint.  We were served bread with seasoned olive oil and grated cheese without asking.  

The menu has a select number of meal choices, but it is a good variety and we have never been disappointed.  I am a vegetarian, and I have not had trouble finding something on the menu to eat.  Our waitress was attentive, but also embraced the Italian spirit of &#34;relaxing with wine&#34; for a while before ordering, and I did not get the sense that I was either rushed or forgotten.  

My meal was absolutely delicious.  I got some pasta dish with mushrooms, artichokes and goat cheese, and it was so tasty.  Their sauce is mouth-wateringly flavorful.  We also had wine, which was wonderful.  Very smooth and flavorful.  It was the Avalon Cabernet.  The tiramisu was perhaps the best part, although everything was so delicious it is hard to say what was the best part.  Anyways, the tiramisu was not too sweet, but sweet enough so that the subtle hints of the cocoa came through.  The ladyfingers were soaked in the rum and espresso, but not saturated.  It was absolutely perfect.  I was full, but could not stop eating.  

I will definitely be returning to this place because they know how to combine music, food, ambiance, wine, and service to make an exceptional dining experience."

I recommend the burger panini on the brioche bun.  The meat is cooked to perfection, the lettuce fresh.  The bun is fresh and tastes like its homemade.

The fries were good although its an Italian place so I understand why they weren&#39;t better.

For desert try the ice cream cookie sandwiches. You won&#39;t be disappointed, it&#39;s worth the extra calories."

We were greeted warmly, our glasses were always full, our waiter was very nice and helpful, and everything was timed perfectly. 

Their menu always sounds great (I don&#39;t really like that they hand-write the menu...it&#39;s hard to read), but the food is disappointing. It lacks flavor. I got something that the Cheesecake Factory sells (it was almost exactly the same), but it tasted bland. For that reason alone I probably won&#39;t come back. It&#39;s not worth the money.

ANY app/salad + ANY entree + ANY dessert for $25.  an amazing deal when a lot of the entrees themselves are $25.  i only give 4 stars because the pasta entree i&#39;ve had both times (pasta primavera) was very bland and could use more vegetables.  the other vegi choices have always been something too heavy for my taste - gnocchi or risotto so i&#39;ve opted for something &#34;off the menu&#34;.  huge plates of carpaccio and prosciutto were passed around the table because of course all portions are too large for one person.  i recommend the snow pea salad or the green bean salad - nice to have salad &#34;options&#34; other than the usual mixed greens or caesar.  the desserts are the best part of the meal (apple crostada!) and if you come with a large party, every dessert on the menu can be ordered and shared!  a very affordable family/big group dining experience with enough change to spare to splurge on some bottles of wine."

The expectations weren&#39;t really met although I wouldn&#39;t say that I wouldn&#39;t come back either. The portions were large and at a good price.

The bruschetta appetizer is a bit small for the price but is done relatively well, especially the choice of cheese. I wish the mussels they offered used the Prince Edward Island variety but that doesn&#39;t seem to be too common around Chicagoland. The broth was pretty good but not great.

I found their &#34;prime rib&#34; (steak) to be prepared in a very oily manner with an herb mixture that I didn&#39;t really like too much, similar to the one at Wildfire. The meatball sandwich had pretty good meatballs and crispy bread but the salad was a little heavy handed on the balsamic vinegar. Their creamy pasta was kind of excessively creamy and oily while their broth and vegetables one had an alright taste but was a bit too oily as well.

Fortunately their profiteroles were delicious and both crunchy and creamy at the same time.

Oddly, like some other restaurants I&#39;ve gone to recently I found the appetizers and desserts to be better than the main entrees. This restaurant is a decent alternative to Biaggis although it gets busy pretty early so make sure you put in a reservation. I would give it a higher rating if they could preserve the taste without making the food so unhealthy with oil and salt."

I liked the place and the food that evening.  I ordered one of the specials (of which I can not recall the name and they do not post the specials online).  It was some sort of hand rolled ravioli like pasta with a meat filling and a non-red sauce.  It was very tasty.  The service was good but seemed to taper off after our food arrived.  That could be due to getting close to closing though.  At that point I was 3 of 5 stars and would return again.

Until 2:30 am came along and I was purging what was left of that food.  So while it was tasty, no amount of tasty would be worth the very uncomfortable morning and following day I experienced.  Since I tend to have a cast-iron stomach this had to be REALLY bad to cause this reaction.  I can only imagine that ill food prep or components are the cause of this ordeal.  I cannot recommend nor would I walk into any Francesca&#39;s ever again."

I cannot say enough positive words about my experience at Francesca&#39;s Tavola. I urge everyone to ignore any negative reviews because my experience with this restaurant was like a dream.

I reserved a party room for a family member&#39;s surprise party, months in advance. Not only was the Events Coordinator, Julie, immensely helpful... she went above and beyond to answer all of my many questions, and she allowed us to tour the space beforehand. The staff allowed us to store our cake in the cooler on the day of the event, and they did not charge a plating or cutting free. Julie&#39;s kindness, attention to detail, and professionalism will always be remembered. I highly recommend Francesca&#39;s for any birthday, party, or event in which a private party room is required.

Julie&#39;s incredible service was absolutely reflected in the service and atmosphere of the restaurant as whole. The space is beautiful and pristinely clean. Servers were friendly, and the bussers here were, no exaggeration, the kindest, most thoughtful, and talented busboys I have ever encountered. One amazing busboy (whose name escapes me! Possibly Renee?) asked if we would like something to drink as we were setting up, he helped us put up a banner, he brought out a lighter for the cake and cut perfect pieces, and he wrapped all of desserts up for us to take home.

The food was amazing. I highly recommend the risottos and Pollo al Limone (that sauce was incredible). All of the courses were spaced out nicely and never overlapped, which I appreciated since it enabled us to use the full time in the room. The tiramisu and profiteroles for dessert were delectable. Our party had 32 people, and this room was the perfect size. 

I cannot thank Julie and the staff of Francesca&#39;s enough for their assistance and genuine kindness. Props to the chef for his amazing creations. And the bus boys here deserve a promotion or at least major special notice-- we were all blown away. Francesca&#39;s is highly recommended, and I will definitely return when I am in town. (I prefer Francesca&#39;s to most Italian restaurants downtown!) Thank you for making our event so special and memorable!!"

My mom and I worked with Julie in their event department while planning the dinner. Every question we had Julie responded with urgency and was very helpful in assisting us with our menu for the special evening. We were able to do a tasting about a month prior which also helped. By the time the big day rolled around, both my mom and I were able to relax and enjoy our family and celebrate the Bride and Groom. All of the wait staff were extremely attentive, but not over-bearing. Not to mention, the food was EXCELLENT! Better than our tasting. We will definitely be back soon!"

The ambiance is classic Chicago Italian, not too brightly lit, beautiful bar area, lots of white linen tablecloths and napkins.  Whether you eat at the spacious bar or in the dining room, the service is excellent.  Prices are average for the area, and they have a nice beer and wine offering.  The bartenders and wait staff are friendly and really know the menu.  Every meal has been great!  The prosciutto Modo Mio, risotto with leeks, corn and prosciutto was creamy and very good.  Carpaccio, and Prosciutto with Figs are two more favorite appetizers.  We love the Spaghetti Con Frutti Del Mare, and Roasted Grouper and Tilapia, all favorite entrees.  I highly recommend this establishment."

It was one of her favorite places and I had never been there before and always up for trying new places for me. Made reservations and had no issues getting seated. The staff  was very friendly. The food was delicious as well. The atmosphere was also very warm and appealing. My one issue was when it came to dessert. I had called the restaurant a couple days ahead and asked if they had any traditions or did anything special for someone&#39;s birthday. I was told they did and they even verified my reservations and asked what my girlfriend&#39;s name was. So I was pretty set in thinking they were going to surprise her with the birthday dessert. Alas, that never happened. At the completion of dinner our server came by with the dessert menu and asked if we saved room. I was waiting for the birthday dessert. Nothing. So we went about our way. I wanted it to be a surprise so I didn&#39;t even bother to pursue it. To me, it would just simply ruin the surprise element for her to see me ask when it was set up in advance. Fortunately, my girlfriend did appreciate the gesture when I explained to her afterwards how disappointed I was with that happening (or not happening). I should have excused myself to go to the bathroom and followed up before dinner was over, but was convinced it was already a done deal. It&#39;s a minor mistake in the big scheme of things, but a bummer in celebrating her birthday at dinner. Outside of that, it&#39;s a nice place to frequent. The other bummer was that they were out of my first two beer choices. I guess it jsut wasn&#39;t my day to really enjoy my first time there."

The menu is handwritten and difficult to read, and they have no idea how busy -- or not -- they really are. They told us the wait was 1 hour 20 minutes - 30 minutes. We glanced around, and the restaurant was half-empty. The hostess told me, &#34;There&#39;s a ton of people coming in five minutes with reservations,&#34; so we went to sit by the bar. 10 minutes went by and not a person came in. All of a sudden, the hostess grabbed us and seated us at one of the many empty booths. Hoorah... one success.

I ordered a chicken dish which had some garlic sauce with it. I asked for it without, as I get very sick from garlic, and sure enough it arrived floating in the garlic sauce. It almost seemed like they went out of their way to put extra. Even my family, who usually pick on me for being so picky, thought it was ridiculous. I couldn&#39;t eat my dinner, and the waitress didn&#39;t even ask why when she came to pick it up.

We hadn&#39;t been to Francesca&#39;s since 2006 when one of their waiters spilled wine all over my expensive handbag that was a gift from my grandparents. They never offered any compensation, not even a free coffee or dessert, but my mom was craving their chicken after all this time.

Strike two, and I won&#39;t be giving them more money so they can earn a third."

The place was about half full - I sat at a tall table in the bar - no bartender was present, but they were using the bar to serve food if desired. Service was a little off - it seemed like their bus staff was serving that day. Nice people, but I didn&#39;t get the sense that they knew service. This was magnified when I asked for some grated cheese not in my rigatoni entree, but into the olive oil plate for my bread. Well, the server stacked it at least two inches high!

The decor was a little different - a copper top ceiling in the bar that I&#39;d not seem anything like it before. They were playing 80&#39;s music - really?

I guess I&#39;d go there again - maybe for dinner to see if they have an A-Team that works at night. Not really like any other Francesca&#39;s I&#39;ve been to before."

I usually meet friends here because I lnow the GF menu is extensive, and no mater my mood there is something for me!   However gluten-free should still be tasty. Not bland and uneatable; covering the whole thing with garlic didn&#39;t make it better. 

This is the first time I have ever been disappointed at Francesca&#39;s.  I usually love it!! Something was way off the evening we were there.   It was not crowded as it was the start of spring break in Arlington Heights.  There were empty tables. As well as chairs available at the bar.  

***Take the Penne with Spinach and tomato off the menu. It needs more tweaking. It needs  flavor.  

$5 martini night on Friday nights is a good deal.  This is usually what lured us in and then we realize we are hungry."

The first time the service was awesome and the food was quite good.  I had the gnocchi with tomato basil sauce and it was awesome.  My hubby had pasta with pot roast which was ok and we had the apple crostata for dessert which was amazing.  This visit was on a Sunday and I guess it was busier than they expected because less than 2 hours after they opened they were out of both of our first choice dishes and also my second choice dish.

The second visit wAs on a Monday and I got rigatoni with sausage and mushrooms.  It was ok, nothing special.  The many reason I ordered it was because nothing else on the menu sounded good to me or was food that I eat (I don&#39;t like mussels, scallops, or veal).  My husband ordered the lasagna which was what we both originally wanted to order when we first went.  When the lasagna was brought out it was totally burnt so we sent it back.  Then a new one came out and the center of it wasn&#39;t even hot.  We also ordered the apple crostata again because I had liked it so much the first time, but that wasn&#39;t nearly as good as it had been on the first visit.

Overall, will I be back?  Probably not, the food and service are extremely inconsistent and the menu varies so much that I don&#39;t even know if anything I like will even be on the menu."

Menu was handmade and printed off of a printer or copier.  Very impressed as what was available was what was bought that day or so.  Fresh came to mind.

Drinks were disappointing with short shots and lots of ice.  Come on guys!  Even a double was watery. Get smaller glasses, larger pours &amp; less ice or replace/retrain/remotivate the bartenders.  Next time will order wine.

Dinner specials do not have salad included, so ordered one.  It was very nice sized with O&amp;V dressing, tomato, cucumber and good mound of lettuce.

Appetizer was special beef carpaccio and it was wonderful with capers and freshly shaved parm cheese.  Very yum.

Dinnermate had fish which looked good and it was not shared.  A good sign.  My pasta with muscles and clams was abundant in pasta and shells.  Very good, made fresh tomato sauce.

Once we waved off dessert the waitress abandoned us.  Could not even get her near to order another watered drink, but that was all for the good.

This has good food, marginal service, crappy drinks and a nice atmosphere.  And you could talk at your table, so noise was minimal.  Give it a shot...it will probably be a lot larger that what you will get from the bar in return."

I was already a fan of the Francesca&#39;s chain, but they did an amazing job on my shower.

Both event planners I worked with were great.  The first (who later moved to a different location) had developed a BRUNCH event menu.  That was the best idea ever!   All the menu options had great selections, but the brunch was different &amp; fun.  The items we chose were delicious (it was last August, but if memory serves it was mascarpone french toast, eggs w/Italian sausage &amp; polenta, a mix of caprese &amp; meat sandwiches, &amp; fruit).  It was a lot more food than we could actually eat!  All of my aunts &amp; cousins, &amp; my mom&#39;s friends from her neighborhood raved about it.  They were so happy to escape the typical shower luncheon of chicken &amp; pasta.  They also made mimosas &amp; punch (non-alcoholic for the preggos). 

The party room is very cute &amp; sunny.  It would be great for a variety of events. I&#39;m looking forward to hosting a party there--I keep looking for a good reason!  The prices for the event were very reasonable, as well.

Note: I&#39;ve also had dinner here a few times, and that was always excellent.  Still hate the ugly xerox menus. :)"

We came to Francesca&#39;s for a birthday dinner and left pretty unhappy.  Sure, the service was good (it was empty on a weeknight) and the bread was okay.  And the a fore mentioned half price bottle of wine.  But aren&#39;t we really here for the food?

Their martinis are great. They have a wide selection. I asked them to put a graham cracker crust on the key lime pie martini and they were happy to do so. 

Love the olive oil and pepper for the bread. The bread is gooood!

Both parties I&#39;ve had the vesuvio chicken. It&#39;s small, though. For $16- $18 I kind of expected a full grown size chicken. With this one, I could eat all the meat on the thigh in one bite.

Potatos were great. The bruschetta is also good. 

All in all, consistently good service. Good food. LIke the atmosphere alot, though on the weekend nights it is LOUD.

Give it a try."

My husband and I have been dining here for years. This month I filled out the comment card and to my surprise won a raffle and get $10 off once a month for 12 months. We are expecting our first child any day now and I appreciate that for the next year I am guaranteed at least one &#34;date night&#34; a month (thankfully my parents live close enough to babysit!)

We went for our first &#34;date night&#34; last night. I had the special linguini with scallops and a creamy tomato sauce--fantastic plus leftovers, yay! My husband had the salmon which came with avocado and asparagus and some other tasty looking bits. No appetizer or dessert this time around but only because there is not enough room (38 weeks pregnant will do that to a lady&#39;s stomach).

The manager, Rian, who informed me of my raffle prize, also sought us out to congratulate us on our growing family and thank us for dining with them. The wait staff is always very friendly and the busboys do a fabulous job refilling water, iced tea and boxing up leftovers!

In the past I have also gone here for some business lunches and the tilapia with capers and white wine sauce is always a winner. 

Wednesday nights are great since $25 will get you an appetizer, entree and dessert.

And when we went earlier this month we split a caprese salad made with grilled peaches instead of tomatoes (it was a special that night) and it was super tasty!

My absolute favorite menu item is the shell pasta with ham, peas, mushrooms and creamy tomato sauce--it is so good on a chilly night!"

The service was fabulous.  Our waiter was a mid-20&#39;s young man about 6&#39; or so tall with short hair and an athletic build - sorry, I forgot your name and feel badly about it.  The waiter who tag-teamed was not quite as tall and had curly hair.

All questions were answered and we decided on the price fixe option for $25.00.  My husband and I chose to split an appetizer and salad instead of choosing one or the other.  We ordered the bruschetta with mozzarella and were so happy, the bread was perfectly toasted and the topping was out of this world, tangy and basilly with creamy mozzarella - everything was so fresh.  It tasted like it was made to order. 

The salad was amazing too, We ordered the Insalata alla Francesca - romaine, endive, radicchio, blue cheese, fresh veggies - extremely fresh food.  I didn&#39;t need salad dressing for this creation.  My husband ordered the house Italian and was delighted.  

When the main courses came out, we were still amazed at how good the food was.  Mark&#39;s was a sausage and onion pizza bursting with flavor on a cracker thin crust.  I had the pork chops with a mushroom and artichoke heart sauce - YUM! WOW!  TASTEBUDGASMIC!  

We shared food, enjoyed our conversation without being hovered over.  Our servers came to the table exactly when we needed them - no more, no less.  If it hadn&#39;t been for the noisy family bouncing around in the booth behind me we would have lingered.  After being jammed in the back by a dad and a kid who couldn&#39;t manage to sit still, we decided to ask for the bill and get the included dessert to go.  (Note to hosts, hostesses, and others who seat restaurant customers - when a couple is having a romantic dinner, try to steer noisy people away from them and definitely do not seat them in the booth behind!)

We ordered the creme brulee and drove home, so completely happy with the meal and the service that it made up for the birthday/anniversary debacle.  When we got home and got into the creme brulee - MORE TASTEBUDGASMIC!!  

What a meal, and great experience!  :)  

When you go, one of the cool things you will notice is the menu - the standbys are in print but most of it was hand-written as the menu offerings change constantly at Francescas.  Ya gotta go!!!!  You cannot beat the customer service or the food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

We were there a few months ago celebrating my graduation and opening a new business.  We were extremely impressed by the service, and the flavors in the food.  We started with a modern take on a bruschetta that had grilled peach, mozerrella cheese, fresh basil, and a basalmic vinegar reduction.  

We both had a salmon dish, hers was more of a Madiera, and mine was more of a picatta with capers and lemon butter (yum).  

The bartender was a great one, very friendly, and came over and served us each a small glass of champagne, because he had heard from the manager that we were celebrating a special occasion.  

When it was all said and done, we felt like we were treated like royalty, and it was a very nice treat, since we do not get out too often, especially not to places like this.

Last time everything was perfect and were seated upstairs where quiet.  This time after explaining in detail why we needed a quiet location as special people in town after 10 yrs.  We were first in the restaurant and put in main room that filled with noisy people and could not talk at all and that was only time we would see them.   

Some dishes came out late and cold like they forgot to heat.  Pasta on a couple was sticky and balled up in chunks.  They took back but didn&#39;t return until the rest were finished, plates removed &amp; standing saying goodbyes, so took home.  

Felt very rushed and yes they take your food and unfinished cocktails if you don&#39;t watch.   They always pick it up too before asking if finished which should never happen.   They need to wait til plate is pushed back or ask in general is anyone finished with plates.

Upon arrival we were seated in a strange booth that was really awkward for just two people. After asking to be reseated, we were welcomed to a different table. 5 min later the manager came over to make sure we were alright. It truly was great customer service- not over done or neglected. 

Our meal was delicious and the ingredients tasted very fresh! I would describe the food as authentic Italian with a modern twist.  The half price bottle of wine was really the cherry on top. 

The only downside was the music playing. It appeared that some pop/rock radio station was on. The ambiance would have been infinitely more appealing if some sort of Italian style instrumental tunes were in the background."

The chicken was good and tender, overall good flavor.  I took off one star due to the steak meat. The Steak taco meat was over salted and although it was warm you can smell the &#34;cow type&#34; freshness in the meat. Typically in Mexican cooking more lime and seasonings are used to add a better flavor and aroma in the meat. The place was very clean and cashier was very prompt and attentive.
I would re-visit again.

Important to note:
There are  7 Mexican restaurants that I have counted on Irving park road between Bartlett Rd and slightly east of Barrington. I kind of wonder if most if the reviews here are for the correct restaurant ?  Overall this appears to be a clean establishment. I haven&#39;t seen them use a microwave."

I would call this our favorite mexican restaurant in the area, same guy has owned it for all the years we&#39;ve been in streamwood, love to support my local business owners!

We order take-out from there regularly, have never eaten-in. We usually get the burritos which are amazing!! The service is very good, but sometimes they have a hard time juggling the restaurant and the take-out cause the waitresses do it all!

However, half of the times we&#39;ve been at the restaurant, my orders got messed up.

The next time I came my wife and I only ordered an enchilada platter and a chicken flautas platter. When we got the bill it seemed a little high and when I checked the receipt, we were charged for three platters with a chili rellanos on the bill which we didn&#39;t have.

I do not go there to eat flautas, hard-shelled tacos, burritos or other American inventions.

And that is why I like it.  They have an extensive menu of authentic Mexican dishes, most of them no one (unless you are into Mexican cuisine) has heard of and would probably not try.  Most of it, pretty good.

What&#39;s worse it that when I brought it in to tell them, they didn&#39;t seem at all concerned and said &#39;that will happen&#39;. Fine. I won&#39;t be back.
Also, they frequently get the order wrong, the staff is unhappy, orders take too long and the prices for the same order will vary. The prices are also too high for quality of food.
When they first opened the food was pretty good, but last time I went there it tasted like a lot of stale/spoiled ingredients were used.

But one thing has always been consistent and improving, their food.

No discredit to any burrito fans out there, but don&#39;t go to La Fogata to order something so generic you can find literally anywhere else.  Instead, opt to try of their many MANY specialties and you will be happy that you decided to take your taste buds for a ride.

I recommend just about anything on the menu, but I&#39;ll try to narrow it down to my favorites.

!) Tacos with Al Pastor Pork: Simply amazing.  It&#39;s a marinated pork that is spit-grilled with grilled onions and hints of pineapple.  The pork is so tender and flavorful, with just enough sauce and a slight hint of spice.  --FOR THE ADVENTUROUS DINER, try the cabeza or tongue tacos.  Cabeza is basically beef cheek meat that is a little fatty but super beefy tasting.  And tongue, well do I really need to explain it, if you&#39;ve never had beef tongue you should give it a try, it&#39;s super soft beefy goodness.

2) Mole de Olla: A traditional Mexican soup with a flavorful and spicy broth base.  Has a good variety of perfectly cooked veggies.  

3) Pambazo : This is straight of the streets of Mexico City.  It&#39;s a sandwich with chorizo (Mexican spicy sausage) and potatoes, topped with lettuce, sour cream and cheese, all in a traditional soft telera bread that has been dunked in a slightly spicy tomato sauce, and then grilled.  It sounds messy, and believe me it is super messy, you will have to eat this sandwich with a fork, but it is delicious!

4) Gorditas: Try the steak or chorizo gordita on this one.  It&#39;s basically a thick tortilla pocket stuffed with beans, cheese, and a topping of your choice.  It is crispy fried on the outside, and hot and melty on the inside.

5) Quesadillas:  This is a large thick tortilla, it tastes home-made but I&#39;m not sure, folded in half and filled with melted cheese and the topping of your choice and then grilled.  I recommend again the chorizo quesadilla.  FOR THE ADVENTUROUS DINER, definitely try the Huitlacoche quesadilla.  I have yet to see another restaurant offer this.  Huitlacoche is a corn fungus, yup you read that right, it&#39;s basically a Mexican truffle that is tastes earthy and mushroomy.  It is finely diced with grilled onions.  It might sound and look a little strange, but definitely worth trying.

6) And finally I&#39;ll recommend the Milanesa Torta.  It is a sandwich with a pieces of thin cut breaded steak topped with lettuce, tomato, avocado, cheese, onions, and sour cream, all inside a soft telera bun.  Basic, but very tasty.

Oh and it goes without saying that their Horchata (sweet rice drink) is delicious as well.

So to sum it up, try any one of my recommendations and you will get to experience a true taste of Mexico and what La Fogata is all about! :)"

i ended up with the shrimp burrito. the massive amount of choices was too much for me to handle. buuut, it was bomb. so amazing. perfectly cooked shrimp, guac inside, all sorts of flavors with every bite. ugh so good. normal burritos run for $4.75 (steal), shrimp was a little more pricey (~$9). the guac was different, the bf wasn&#39;t a fan, but i loved it. instead of the usual 90/10 ratio of avacado to tomatoes, it was more like 70/30. neither bland nor too salty, just right. they make it tableside too if you dine in!

if they can make a shrimp burrito THAT delicious, i can&#39;t wait to try everything else!"

This is our regular place to call ahead when we want some good Mexican take-out.  Some of their prices might seem higher than average but their portions are HUGE!  We usually get 2 - 3 meals out of just one dish from there, depending on what we get.  I have yet to try something there I didn&#39;t like.  If you don&#39;t call ahead you&#39;ll most likely just wait 10 minutes for your food."

I am a gringo, but my wife of over 5 years hails from the heart of Mexico, and she and her family have taught me much about REAL Mexican cooking.  So much for my qualifications.....

When it first opened, La Fogata immediately separated itself from the myriad burrito stands in the area by offering a wide variety of menu selections from the basics (tacos, etc.) to food which I had never heard of (huitlacoche quesadillas, hauraches, etc).   

The multitude of menu selections ensures that whether you are looking for just a quick snack or want to sit down with the family and enjoy a full dinner, you will not be disappointed. While the prices may be a bit higher on some items as compared to some of the &#34;$4.00 burrito special!&#34; joints, the superior quality of food at La Fogata is well worth it.

The quality of the meals served on every visit is consistently delicious, and I can honestly say that there has never been a meal in my many, many visits that has disappointed me (though there have been some that made my eyes water!)

Standout selections include the huitlacoche (corn mushroom) quesadilla, the pechuga Fogata (seared chicken breast &amp; poblano peppers in cream sauce), and chilequiles (tortilla chips simmered in salsa).

While the restaurant is not very big, the space is well used so it is cozy by not cramped. The dining area and bathrooms are always clean. Waitstaff have always been pleasant and attentive.

If you are looking for authentic Mexican recipes which are well-prepared with quality ingredients, then La Fogata is definitely the place to go.  If your definition of &#34;Mexican food&#34; equals &#34;cheap burrito&#34;, then I encourage you to broaden your horizons and learn what real Mexican cooking is all about - and if you still only want a burrito, the Burrito Fogata will be the best you have ever eaten!!"

I&#39;ve been here a couple of times already and the quality of the food is great. I have most often order tortas, but this time, I ordered a flor de calabaza quesadilla, and let me tell you it did not disappoint. In fact, this was the best item I&#39;ve had at this restaurant, and that is because the tortillas are handmade and the flavor of it is very authentic. Also, the quesadilla was perfect not lacking cheese neither was loaded with cheese. Every bite of it satisfied my taste buds. The only down side to the restaurant was the little towel where they bring you the tortillas in which my mom had because she ordered menudo. The towels are dirty and don&#39;t seem to be washed daily. So if you&#39;re considering to eat here and order a plate that involves tortillas tell them to bring it to you in napkins or paper towels instead their nice knit towels."

We stopped in one night for the first time. We enjoy Mexican food and wanted to try this place. Our first Impression was that as we were the only none Latino customers in the place we were made to feel uncomfortable. We frequent a couple of Mexican restaurants where this is common place and we have fun with it as do the owners and patrons. I think it is a compliment to the restaurant to want to experience this. Not the case here. We just wanted a nice dinner. From the waitress to the guys behind the counter to several of the patrons it was clear to us that a message was being sent. I will give credit based on the food and not the way we were made to feel. The food for us was as bland as the way we were treated. No thanks!

The food is much better. I&#39;m hooked on their beef res (beef soup). It&#39;s a great deal. For only $9 you get a huge server of beef soup with large chunks of meat, vegetables with a side of rice and tortillas!

My boyfriend ordered the goat cheese mushroom burger and asked medium rare. It came out well done, no pink at all. They don&#39;t season the meat. The onion rings was the only thing good on his plate. 4 huge ones. I ordered some Italian sausage pizza. I really wanted to love it but I didnt. The skimmed on the cheese big time. And even after letting it sit 10min before picking up a slice, the toppings slid off. My peanut butter shake was very good, fyi.

The staff seemed unwelcoming and just stared at us. There was only one table dining when we arrived, btw. I can say Danielle the waitress makes up for the awkward ambience. She seems very nice. Almost too nice to be working there. A note to the chef, please don&#39;t wear uniforms with bleach stains on them. Yes, my boyfriend notices everything. 

So, if you are in the mood for onion rings &amp; shakes come here. Get it to go to avoid the weird stares. But then again you can save yourself a few dollars and head to Culver&#39;s and get the same thing."

I deducted a point for the slow and inattentive service (womp,womp, womp) and another half point off for the strip mall location. ( ugh I hate myself for those deductions)

Pizza: #7 (ham, buffalo mozzarella, arugula, and cherry tomatoes) I would rate this pizza a 3.5 star. points taken off for the salty meat and the dough is great but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. There was too much arugula and not enough cheese. I will definitely come back to try the margherita pizza but will order extra cheese, maybe fresh cheese on top!

Pasta: rigatoni/vodka sauce with chicken sausage. Now we&#39;re talking, the homemade pasta and the delicious sauce makes this dish top notch imo. This dish was loaded with flavor and the pasta was perfectly al dente. And at $7.99 for Saturday special, it&#39;s even better! Must have dish for sure. 

Dessert: panna cotta- so fresh and light! Great way to end the dinner.

Prego!"

big-chef-burgers-schaumburg-2,Peter T.,VP5wjC-QIeKvUv6_E-laBA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,91,2,zEZbY9g9dlYPJcOsDtLPPw,4.0,2015-07-19,"Classically trained chefs open burger restaurants.  As sign of the times, one suspects, and capitalizing on an &#34;American craze&#34; the past few years.  I don&#39;t know what started the current infatuation with burgers, tho I thought personally it was a reflection of the economic downturn - people still wanted to go out for beef, but steaks had become a little dear on menus.

In any regard, chef Crisitano Bassani, of the classic Italian Bapi Restaurant in suburban Chicago, got bit by the burger bug and opened &#34;Big Chef&#34; in Schaumburg.  It&#39;s kind of tough to spot, set back in a strip mall, but if you&#39;re heading east on Alqonquin and you hit Meachem, you&#39;ve just missed it.

I was on my way somewhere else and the sign caught the corner of my eye, I made a quick uey into the parking lot and walked in.  Mid afternoon, Sunday, and the (perhaps) 60 seat eatery had one other table of four occupied, and a table of about ten young men who were just finishing up.

Unlike most new fangled burger restaurants these days, Big Chef has table service and linens.  A server brought a large bottle of water, a tall glass of ice, and the menu (how did they know about me and the water thing?).

The menu offers a number of interesting combination burgers (around $12 with one side), brick oven pizzas, and huge salads.  There is a full bar, with about ten stools in front of it, and an open kitchen design with a bar and stools facing it, as well.

Every day there is a special deal for extended hours, whereas any burger, salad, or pizza is $8.99.

I went with the bacon burger, which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and a well-melted spicy cheddar (don&#39;t you hate it when there&#39;s a slice of cold, unmelted cheese slapped on a burger - I sure do!).  You have  choice of buns from white, pretzel, onion, or wheat. Patties are a half pound of fresh ground hormone free angus.  Side choices are fries, sweet potato fries, house made chips, rings,  mashed or slaw.

The meat came as ordered (medium rare) accompanied by massive onion rings, with a light &#34;panko-like/herb) coating, very crispy.  I opted for the pretzel roll, which is almost always my favorite, but the results can be good or bad, depending on the recipe.  Some pretzel roll doughs are laden with molasses, and it&#39;s too sweet a bun for a savory burger, in my opinion.

The patty itself was very flavorful, and the vegetables fresh and crisp.  I didn&#39;t feel the need to salt either the meat or rings, which is unusual for me.

I recommend your try Big Chef.  Desserts and ice cream concoctions also available."

The place is clean and has an open floor plan. The people give you a friendly greeting as soon as you walk in, but as you can see from the picture, there&#39;s not a lot of &#39;atmosphere&#39;.  And it&#39;s not like I need atmosphere or some kind of theme going on before I can enjoy a great burger, but their burgers are not that great.  They&#39;re goood, but not great.  And even the home baked chips I got as a side with my burger today were dry and over baked. So I&#39;m not sure what the appeal is.  I would think if a place has &#39;burgers&#39; in its name, they should be amazing.  Red Robin has more impressive burgers, for the same price.  And Red Robin has unlimited fries!  So I really can&#39;t go above 3 stars on this place."

I went on a weekday night to place an order to carry out and the restaurant was completely empty. It&#39;s a nice space and very large so whenever somewhere like that is empty it signals issues to me. I asked to place an order to go and the whole process was insanely awkward. I was made to feel really weird, stood there awkwardly as I waited for 23 minutes, wondered why the order took so long to prepare when I was the only person in there....the whole thing was just odd and weird. They need to learn how to handle carry out orders better. Perhaps have some seating by the door for people waiting or offer for them to sit at the bar.

The food is very pricey and honestly there prices should be knocked down a couple bucks on nearly everything. When I got my bag of food though, man did it smell good! I ordered the truffle burger and that truffle smell was just intoxicating.

I seriously expected the food to be horrid based on everything else but it was so freaking good! The truffle burger had ingredients that all melded so well together and was so juicy and flavorful. It came with sweet potato fries that has amazing seasoning on them! Seriously some of the best sweet potato fries I&#39;ve ever had. My friend ordered one of the pizzas and sadly for him it was overcooked. I could visibly see it burned on the edges and he said the taste was forgettable.

I&#39;m so conflicted on whether or not I&#39;d go back. The food is amazing but everything else is pretty wack. Time will tell."
big-chef-burgers-schaumburg-2,Bob R.,0ql-awhVLO50urRBZH74og,"Palatine, IL",1,1,1,208,24,m7tRIyzjbKVWnPUh-dhZHA,3.0,2015-02-22,"I was eager to try Big Chef - being a big hamburger fan I&#39;ve been impressed with some of the new &#34;premium&#34; burger joints that opened over the past few years.

We tried a Groupon and went to Big Chef at about 6 PM on a Saturday night. The space is nice. We&#39;d been to the restaurant that was in this space before Big Chef, and I&#39;d say Big Chef did a nice job redecorating. The wood pizza oven is in the corner and the smells from it are wonderful. The bar is nice. The ambiance is nice.

There were plenty of tables open when we first arrived and were seated immediately. But, throughout the hour or so we were there the space filled to the point where there was a wait.

We ordered an appetizer of their hot wings, and I ordered a beer. For dinner, my wife had a salad (chicken) and I had their regular burger with their homemade potato chips.

The wings were well done, which is the way I like them. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t really call them &#34;hot wings&#34;. They did have a hint of Tabasco, but I would only call it a hint. Otherwise, they were really flavorless. The burger on the other hand was very good. There were several options on bun type, and I opted for the pretzel bun - the right choice. The meat was flavorful. It was slightly crisp on the edges, but still juicy. It came with a pickle spear. For the side, the potato chips were very good - not overly salted. My wife said the salad was good too.

The downside to all of this was the number of servers per table. There appeared to be only one regular server and one who was helping (a little). When we first arrived and there were only a few tables filled this was not a problem. But, when the place filled up, getting anyone&#39;s attention was very difficult. Even getting the check, which is usually easy in placed (especially when their is a wait for table) took too long.

So, overall the experience was good. For the type of service they provide, I would say they are overpriced. If they improve their service, the quality of the meat and the crafting of their sides would be worth the cost."

One guy was there besides me; that&#39;s not the best sign. I sat at the counter and started with a peanut butter and banana shake. It had a really strong peanut butter flavor to it, and ona  hot day, it hit the spot. Just one problem, I had two big chunks of banana in the bottom of my glass. Come on, the banana has to be blended completely! 

I ordered a patty melt and sweet potato fries. The fries were really good, topped with cinnamon sugar. They were also crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I was hoping for honey mustard to dip them in, but none was available. The burger was ok. It was pretty juicy, eventhough I ordered it medium and it was cooked gray all the way through. Even though I didn&#39;t get a beer, they have a very impressive selection of craft brews, many of them local. And all bottles of wine are half off on Tuesdays, that&#39;s a pretty cool deal.

It was a pretty decent overall experience. But living 40 minutes away, I can&#39;t imagine going out of my way to return."

The service was excellent and fast (thank you Mandy!), and the best part... the pizza was outstanding.. and cheap!

The pizzaiolo knows what he&#39;s doing with his brick oven pizza, the (thin) crust was beautifuly blistered in spots. It&#39;s one of the best pizza I&#39;ve eaten in a while.

I went for lunch with my fam today, and man were we disappointed. :( The service was really really bad. We had to wait 10 minutes just to have our orders taken. The waitress was just chatting with some people at the bar that were clearly regulars. (I&#39;ve worked service before and feel that the bartender should not have tables all the way across the restaurant - it just doesn&#39;t work.) 
I was also really disappointed to receive a can when I ordered a Diet Coke. C&#39;mon now, the fountain pop is half the reason why I go out to eat. I have cans of Diet Coke in my fridge. It was brought to me AFTER the food, by a busser, not the waitress, and it wasn&#39;t even cold.
The food was just not very flavorful. My burger was missing items that I&#39;d asked for and was over-cooked. My husband&#39;s burger was well done when he asked for medium-rare. He ordered the bacon and bleu cheese burger and it was very lacking in both. Both of our burger patties were tasteless. The fries were cold, but that&#39;s not surprising, considering how long they sat at the window for the waitress to pick up. My kids did like their chicken tenders, and the pretzel buns were good, but other than that the food was a huge let down.
The waitress was very polite and personable with our kids, but didn&#39;t seem to know what she was doing. She didn&#39;t write down our order and then had to come back and ask again what we wanted. She forgot to bring me my drink. Once we got our food it took me 10 minutes to get her attention for her to fix my burger. We had to ask her for ketchup at least twice. She just meandered around so slowly! It was also very frustrating to see one of the managers standing in the kitchen eating bacon instead of checking on the restaurant, since it was fairly busy for 1 server. About 10 minutes after we finished eating I got up and asked the waitress to bring us our check. We were dying to get out of there. Can&#39;t say I&#39;ll ever go back."

This is a place to have an overpriced WRITE OFF FOR TAXES!

I got the paradise and he got the Tex burger.  Both were pretty good, especially their sweet potato fries!  Service was really good and they were on top of things . We will be here again, but will try the pizza next time"

Three different ones ordered at our table along with yummy sweet potato fries, golden fries &amp; crispy homemade chips. Today (Friday) they had $5 martinis and knockout desserts (flourless chocolate cake and tiramisu) that are $5.00 everyday. Can&#39;t wait to try the brick oven pizzas next time."

Was it the sad silence of the empty restaurant floor, or maybe that the craft beer signs out front referred to bottles only since there were no taps? It was probably that the place had no designated bartender, the pizza oven was down and no one gave me a food menu until one nice lady noticed my very confused look of flipping through the bar-top&#39;s promo papers. 

I thought, &#34;This is going to suck.&#34; But if nothing else, Yelpers are up for the adventure and the joy of writing a scathing review. But then my buger came out. I crunched down on a sweet potato fry and it was damn tasty. And then I tried a sweet potato fry in the spicy mayo and THAT was damn tasty. So I chomped into my pineapple &amp; gruyere buger and it was fantastic. Juicy, seasononed and sweet - it was the perfect regular ol&#39; burger. 

Based on the overall service, I should probably knock this down to three stars. But I hope they can get it together because the food is really good! While everyone that worked there was very nice, it was very unprofessional. Servers and managers/owners were all congregating in different areas near the bar on their cell phones (do that in the back like everyone else, duh). Lots of swearing, joking around and even a guy still in his jacket off-shift behind the bar. With an experience bar manager that understands scheduling and ettiquite, this place could probably do really well. 

** To the owners: No &#34;build your own burger&#34; on the menu? Fix that. Also, the burgers are overpriced, as others have said. As a lover of burgers and buger joints, the MAX should be $10 burger + $0.50 a veggie topping or $1 a meat/cheese topping.  $13 for a cheesebuger with pinapple is rediculous. There is too much competition to be on the expensive end of this with no specific ambiance."

The ambience here is dumpy, waited pretty long for an ok tasting but super expensive burger. The chips look good but taste bland. 
Biggest issue is that I paid $12 for a burger &amp; chips and both were subpar. Oh well on to other burger joints."

Everyone was disappointed. It was 12 of us that ordered from here. 5 of us asked for NO onion but got onion. 3 of them ordered the Turkey burger and could barely swallow because of how dry it was. I ordered the Spicy burger and asked for NO tomato add cheese and instead I got tomato and no cheese. There was also supposed to be spicy mayo on my burger and there was none at all so I was left with a dry burger. What really topped the cake was myself and another coworker decided to go with the Cole Slaw for the side and the Cole slaw had to be spoiled!! It smelled SO bad we couldn&#39;t even eat it and had to throw it out. Most of us where still hungry because we couldn&#39;t even eat the food. For a place that has the name Burgers in their company name you&#39;d think that&#39;s what would be the best. I would of rather gone to Mcdonalds for a burger. 

Never ordering a burger from here unless I am at the restaurant so I can send the burger back if it&#39;s not right."

I think the food is amazing, and being a new restaurant in the area, I like that it is not crazy busy all the time.  I get personalized service every time and they are all so nice!  

The truffle burger is what I go back for every  time.  In fact, the owner sees me enough that he knows exactly what I am likely to get!  My kids get the sliders and the fries every time.  I have brought friends there as well, and I have only gotten positive feedback."

When my coworkers and I arrived,  we were asked to sit anywhere. Menus weren&#39;t brought to us. We had to get our own menus.  There was hair in my calamari, I didn&#39;t notice it until the end. I asked the waitress about it she said the manager said NO because you ate it already.  They offered no apologies,  showed no concern about the hair in my food. Then we saw the manager put his hand in the fries and then from those same fries they plated them for the customers.  No one was wearing hair nets.  This place looks nice but the service is subpar to say the least.  I would go to Culvers next door if I were you."

Used groupon, ordered iced tea waited 10 minutes no drinks!  Entire place has one waitress, burgers are overpriced - $12 for an average bar burger.

After three visits, all I can say is the food is average to poor, and the service is awful. Burgers are okay. Not a lot of flavor. Generally undercooked. Fries are soggy. Calamari tough. 

However, the worst part is the awful service. Maybe, the service people would like to do a good job, but there aren&#39;t enough of them. Our waiter was running around serving half the restaurant, seating people, expediting food etc...  He was way too busy. As a result, food came to us after camping under a heat lamp for 10 minutes. He never returned to ask if the food was okay. Never asked us if we needed another round of drinks. Never removed the dirty plates from the table. Did everything he could to avoid eye contact to the point we had to chase him down after 15 minutes to finally get a check and get the heck out. Other tables remained un-bussed long after people left. Terrible. 

One warning. Most food was low average, but turkey burger is truly terrible. It was cooked, but was weirdly soggy. It was completely inedible."

My first trip, I ordered two burgers and two orders of fries.  I would definately go back for these items!  The sweet potato fries were amazing and the burgers were cooked just right. 

The second trip was for two pizzas, as we had heard that they were rated very highly for them.  Do not get the pizza.  For the price that you pay - I would have rather had Papa Johns.  Not enough toppings, not enough flavor."

Solid burgers and a good deal at the &#34;lunch special&#34; price. Chef still rather shouty.

Burgers sounded good, and to be honest, we were a bit tipsy and didn&#39;t look too close at the cost. Absolutely fantastic burgers, no question!!! My only complaints are 1) price and 2) portions. My husband ordered the big chef burger with sweet potato fries and I ordered the truffle burger with onion rings. Both burgers were delicious! But if we&#39;re paying $40 for a burger and sides, I expected the sides to be a bit more. I opened my box first to find THREE onion rings. Really? So when my husband opened his, I was curious at the amount of sweet potato fries, it was not a lot, and for kicks we counted. Nine. Not like they were huge or anything! I will say that both the onion rings and sweet potato fries were delicious, but for the price,  we should have had more. Quality of the food, no question: 5 stars. Price: 4 stars (delicious food can be pricey). Portions: 1 star, a side of onion rings is not 3 rings. The food was great, but for $40 I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll order again."

My coworkers and I ordered pickup from here on our lunch break and me and my coworker both got the wrong buns, I ordered my burger with pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar cheese and requested onion and guacamole on the side and my coworker requested guac as well - they left the cheddar cheese on my burger and forgot everything else we requested. My other coworker ordered mozzarella sticks which we did not get even though we were charged for them and our other coworkers ordered chicken sandwiches both of which were dry and under-seasoned. To their credit they did come deliver the mozzarella sticks they forgot and the guac but the delivery driver got lost and ended up getting lost and driving to Palatine when we work down the road from the restaurant (less than 5 mins away) and by the time the guac got here we had already finished our burgers and the mozzarella sticks were soggy. The owner did give a $15 gift certificate because of all the trouble which earned them another star but I was not impressed with this place at all."

They both tasted like ice cream out of carton. I had cheddar bacon burger on onion roll and onion rings. Burger very plan tasting and onion roll was flavorless. The onion rings claim be homemade they had a seasoning breeding that was not good. They seemed like frozen rings to me.

My daughter had the slider meal with the home made chips. Her two sliders were White Castle sized. The chips looked home made but some where crunchy and some were not. My daughter said they had little to no flavor.

The bill for the two meals was $ 30 . There is no value here and can not recommend the burgers or shakes to anyone."

I recently went here and got a bacon burger. I was so disgusted by the smell of the meat when I took a bite I almost threw up. The meat for both my burger and my boyfriends smelt like dirty carpet a dog had peed on. I&#39;m not joking. I have two dogs. I only took one bite of my burger and that was it. The server offered to get me something else but I&#39;m so repulsed by their meat I didn&#39;t want to eat anything else. 

No, I won&#39;t be going back to big ch for ever again or recommending it to anyone."

Stopped in for dinner with my fiancé and sister. It seemed like a place that had good burgers but honestly the two we ordered were rather bland  : the Italian burger and then the one with truffle oil and a fried egg. I was excited that you get to pick your bun - because I absolutely love pretzel buns. Still didn&#39;t save my burger, though. What was AMAZING for some reason was the spinach salad! It had cranberries, Romano cheese, almonds and pears with a light lemony dressing. Ate every last bite of that, as well as my fiancé&#39;s side of cole slaw. And I usually don&#39;t eat a whole lot of cole slaw. 

There will be a next time, I predict, because I am compelled to try their pizzas! I spotted a wood fire oven, I think. The ambiance is nice, and it was definitely a plus that the manager (or owner) stopped by the table."

THEN, I saw that Chicago Magazine named it as their #7 best pizza in Chicago.  Took some coworkers today and we were all thrilled with the pizza - WOW!  The Chicago Magazine was spot on - the pizza crust is perfectly thin, but still substantial enough to be tasty and filling.  The toppings were amazingly fresh and tasty.  Thumbs WAY UP for Big Chef.

I ordered their bacon cheeseburger w/ fries and a vanilla peanut buttet shake. They said 45 min to an hour. It took them almost 2 hours to deliver my food!! I gave them a call to check the status, a man picked up and told me &#34;she left 5 minutes ago&#34; then automatically hung up. I was livid. Upon arrival, their delivery driver was flustered and didn&#39;t have any change. I sympathize for her because I know how stressful that kind of position can be. On to the food.......the fries were stale. It felt and tasted like they were just nuked in the microwave and thrown into the to go plate.The peanut butter shake was very liquidy, I don&#39;t think that was a shake, rather just plain milk with peanut butter. The burger was okay. Nothing spectacular. I feel like the only thing fresh about my meal from &#34;Big Chef&#34; was probably the lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle that came with the burger. I would NOT order or come back to this place again. Terrible service, and food is not fresh."

Cons : service is slow , we waited close to 30 minutes for our food to arrive , a long time since we were the only customers waiting for food.  Diet coke in a can ,  a big NO-NO for me .

We walked in, no-one at the front, so we weren&#39;t sure if we were supposed to sit wherever, or wait to be seated. Finally, someone came over , &amp; asked us if there was a certain table we would like to sit at. I thought the woman was OK- not overly friendly for sure. I would think they would ask if we&#39;ve ever been there before- no she didn&#39;t. 
So our waiter came -Dimitri- he was nice. Again, never asked if we e been there before- I think they should! So, we ordered wings- very good, &amp; I had the patty melt &amp; fries- good - Larry had tex mex burger- said it was great! He had the onion rings w/ his.
There was another server there- she dressed like she was going to the gym- thought that was interesting-
Some man came over &amp; asked if we&#39;ve ever been here before &amp; how was everything? That was nice- but no idea who he was. 
Oh! &amp; I had cider &amp; Larry had some beer- I guess some people were upset they don&#39;t have draft- but didn&#39;t matter to us

The wood burning oven pizzas are being made with less toppings than before and they are making more mistakes...  
And, I&#39;ve never seen an owner yell at his employees as much as I saw last night - I&#39;m surprised that they didn&#39;t just walk out/quit on him right on the spot...

As noted by some, the burgers have become more expensive.  However, its fair to say that $11.50 for a specialty burger (The Spicy Burger) with a side of Onion Rings is a very fair price.  Quite in line with the Ram Brewpub a mile or so way.  The 2 burgers we had were quite good; with my wife&#39;s being a bit over the &#34;Medium Rare&#34; asked for.  Onion rings were as good as any - real onions in a seasoned &#34;shell&#34;.  As we were one of only 2 tables occupied @7:30, it was very quiet.  No shouting at the staff as before; service was calm and appropriate.  Perhaps too dead for a good future, however.  Signs indicated that any item is $7.99 for weekday lunch, a real bargain."

Unfortunately our waiter decided he also wanted to watch the game.  We had to chase him down constantly.  We ordered 5 pizzas, 2 beers, 2 shakes and a salad to start.  We all quickly drank our waters (never refilled).  And he brought the beers with the pizzas.  We chased him down to order a 6th pizza and 2 more drinks.  He never asked us if we needed anything.  Pizzas were good, but the service was horrible!  So bad it will probably keep us from going there again.  Suggestion to management.  If your staff wants to watch the game, let them stay home to watch it.  We would have gladly ordered more drinks and dessert if we were asked."

More to the point - it has become a marketing trend to get people to pay a few extra bucks for some ground beef in a bun.

Then the Big Chef comes in and throws down a burger so good - that I felt compelled to admit that I might eat a meal west of Harlem Avenue.

The setting is kind of west coast pretentious - like it was a sushi place that just couldn&#39;t survive. We sat down and were greeted by a lovely young lady - then another to tell us that the other was going to be our server. 

I ordered an Italian Burger (go figure). My buddy ordered a plain cheeseburger. When he asked about his cheese choices - she rattled off a list that just didn&#39;t stop. (She named cheeses I never even heard of.) 

He asked for his medium well. She asked how I wanted mine done. I said that the Big Chef should make mine the same way - it easier that way; right?

Right.

The Italian Burger is made with  1/2 pound of Fresh Ground, Angus Beef. They top it with sun-dried tomatoes and fresh Buffalo Mozzarella. Then they add a handful of fresh arugula. Arugula?  It works! 

They have four choices of buns. When that happens - you go pretzel. Everything is better on a pretzel bun.

There is a wide choice of sides. Unlike most burger joints - the side is an adult-sized helping. So many burger joints throw seven fries on a plate and call that a side order. The Big Chef generously gives big helpings. 

I got the fresh chips. They were perfect. 

My buddy got the onion rings. I got a bit misty. Fresh sweet onion - perfectly battered and fried to perfection. There have been few onion rings better than the big onion ring at the Big Chef.

Very good service. Perfectly prepared food and plenty of it. If you have to be that far west for any length of time - it is good to know the Big Chef has your back."

We came on a Sunday early evening, and we were surprised by the 50% off pizzas happy hour.  Naturally we had to try it, but I hate to say it, I&#39;ve had better frozen pizza at home.  If I remember correctly, they had a wood-fired oven, so from my experience of having those kinds of pizzas, it&#39;s best to eat it nearly as soon as it comes out (within 5 minutes).  Our waitress was nice, but looked like she was overworked, as there were 3-4 other tables, and there was one other gentleman who wasn&#39;t really helping (not sure if he was the manager).  We could clearly see from where we were sitting that our pizza was sitting under their heat lamp for a good 5-10 minutes before we got it - seemed like they were waiting on our burger to end at the same time.  In addition, we had gotten a strawberry shake since our waitress raved about it - and again, sat on the counter for actually closer to 10 minutes before someone picked it up to send it over...and you know what happens to those blended drinks after they sit - they start to separate!  The place really wasn&#39;t that busy, but with the one waitress doing everything, that didn&#39;t help the service at all.

We ordered the margherita pizza - unfortunately a bit on the floury side (a lot was used and left on the crust), The crust itself seemed a bit stale, probably from sitting under that heat lamp for a while.  I&#39;d have to say it was below average.

On the other hand, the burger meat quality was great...but cooked more to medium-well as opposed to just medium.  I really thought that if it would be the last thing to come out for our order (with the whole everything coming to us at the same time), they wouldn&#39;t overcook the meat!

I have to revisit the fact that they place really wasn&#39;t that busy, and somehow our bills were also mixed up with someone else&#39;s at the end. - Yes these things can happen, but a little teamwork from that gentleman would&#39;ve helped.

Saving grace?  Sadly I would say the waitress (sorry I can&#39;t remember her name) was really nice, and after remixing my shake with the straw, it actually was quite good.  If the service improves, I would go back, but I wouldn&#39;t order a pizza."

While the space is a little odd (it bit more on this later), the food was good.
I had the traditional bacon cheeseburger (medium rare) with a side of onion rings.

The burger itself was done closer to rare than medium rare, but that wasn&#39;t a problem for me.  For others, expecting actual medium rare, it could be.
The meat had a coarser grind to it, like it may have be ground in-house.  I prefer this texture versus the extremely fine grind that tends to get rubbery when packed into a burger.
The burger was flavorful, the traditional bun was as expected.
They offer a spicy mayo on the side, which I recommend.  It&#39;s a very nice compliment to a regular burger and even better for dipping fries or onion rings.

As for the onion rings, the jury is still out.
Rather than a batter, they were covered in more of a breadcrumb mix.  Not bad at all, but I couldn&#39;t tell if they were made in house or if they came out of a frozen bag.
They were a fine compliment to the burger and a beer, but nothing particularly memorable.

As promised, a bit about the space.
It&#39;s the end unit in a strip mall formerly known best for La Margarita and Tin Pan Alley (remember those places?).
It sports an open kitchen, which is cool, but does cause a problem when someone burns something.
The place is decorated somewhere between casual and upscale, but it comes off a little odd with flat screen strewn about as well.  It feels like it is trying to be everything to everyone but it doesn&#39;t execute any one fully.
Again, not bad, just a bit odd.

My complaint about the parking might be a bit petty.  We arrived, the restaurant was not full, which we could tell through the floor to ceiling windows.  We felt we had lucked out with parking right in front of the restaurant.  A second check of a sign notes that all the store front parking is 15min only, violators will be towed.  For the entire mall.  I don&#39;t know if this is a property management or store requirement, but it is absurd.
We ended parking deep in the lot, fighting snow and ice mounds just to get in the place while perfectly good, empty spots right in front of the restaurant went unused.

We will likely be back to Big Chef.
It&#39;s a good burger, prepared well, for a somewhat reasonable price ($10 for the bacon cheese burger with side)."

The overall decor of the restaurant is very nice. The ceiling is a little weird with the spray on stucco and the music choice was strange for the type of restaurant.

I decided to give it a try.  I haven&#39;t been to an IHOP in years.  For breakfast I usually go to either Wildberry or Richard Walkers; or, if I want a more home cooked feel, Uncle Bill&#39;s Diner is great.  I&#39;d put this on the same level as Denny&#39;s, but, I&#39;d choose Denny&#39;s over this.  

This place is nice and clean, although it is still brand new so that is expected.  I went on a Friday around 3pm and ordered breakfast.  There were about 3 tables seated, including myself.   I ordered an Orange Juice and water, then my meal of eggs, hash browns, sausage, &amp; french toast.  I was getting a little annoyed because I finished my orange juice and water pretty fast, and my food nor my server returned for another 17 minutes.  Finally, when my food came I ordered another drink.  I don&#39;t mind waiting for food, but, at an empty breakfast place usually 10 minutes is all that is needed.  When 20 minutes was approaching I started to wonder if they gave the cook my order ticket.  So, the food came, and it actually looked really good (pictures included).  The eggs were done well, the hash browns were alright.  The sausage is cheap and kind of tasteless, but that was expected.  The french toast is pretty bland as well;  processed, packaged, &amp; probably frozen then heated when ordered.  Again, that is what was expected, but, it just wasn&#39;t very good.

She was also not very receptive to the fact that my grandmother was having a bit of difficulty understanding menu items. My grandmother speaks good english but the waitress would seem confused until I explained to her myself. 

we both ordered veggie omelets and they tasted pretty good, but looked a little sloppy (this is not why I rated them 2/5). However, the hash browns that came with my order were subpar; the top and bottom were sort of burnt and congealed and the middle was just mush. 

Finally, I tried to use a mobile coupon for my order. One waitress told me to go to another and ask her, she asked me to go to another, etc. for about 4 waitresses. Finally the last two conferred and decided that they only accepted printed coupons. I explained to them that they could mark my coupon as redeemed to ensure that I didn&#39;t use it over and over again (because clearly ten percent off at IHOP is just that great), but they still refused.

I was not sure what to expect exactly but we definitely enjoyed our time there. It has a little bit of out door seating and the inside is not very big. There are maybe ten tables and plenty of room at the bar to sit. Its a great spot to watch a game as they have 2 TVs that were visible from our table. We were a little rushed into ordering as we did not know that the kitchen closes at 9 but the ordered a jalapeno poppers and greek fries for appetizers and a greek burger and chicken sandwich for the meal. Both were very good and the appetizers were solid. It is reasonably priced and the amount of food you get is maybe a little above average. Overall I liked it a lot and I will go there again to try more of their menu but it probably will not blow you away.

Here we&#39;ve lived in Mt. Prospect for 20 years now, and just stepped into this place for the first time.

Yes, it&#39;s a dive bar.  Small and cluttered.  It&#39;s pretty clear that there are a lot of regulars that find their way here.  While not ton&#39;s of staff (the bartender seemed like the only one working the front of the house), I never saw anyone looking for a drink. 

And the food -- all I can say is, I&#39;m looking forward to trying more of it.  The burger was pretty darn good.  If they had malt vinegar on the table for their fries, the place would be darn near perfect.

They don&#39;t have much on tap, but they did have a pretty good selection of beers in bottle and can.

So, if you&#39;re looking for a different hangout in downtown Mt Prospect, give this place a try."

You&#39;re not going to get anything fancy here, but that&#39;s not what anyone comes in here for. Instead, have a few drinks and BS with the people around you. Grab a better than average burger or good value steak and you can even get flaming cheese, Greek-style. And believe me, they don&#39;t skimp on the flames. Oopa, baby!!

Added bonus is that just before dinner time...happy hour time...they&#39;ve got complimentary munchies near the neon menu/special board at the back.

All in all a great place to have a few cold ones or meet with locals over well-poured drinks and very reasonable, tasty food."

I have been coming here for close to a decade.  I&#39;ve seen countless big name as well as some up and coming comedians.  Always a good time!  Most the time you can meet and greet with the comedians after the show.  They will sell tshirts, cd&#39;s, or whatever else that you can buy and get signed. 

I&#39;d suggest taking a look at their calander and seeing if you like anyone coming soon.  Then order tickets and have some laughs!

Their food is actually really good too!  If you book for dinner &amp; the show you will get seated early and get great seats.  Although, most seats here are just fine!  It&#39;s only kind of bad seating at very crowded shows when they open up the left area of seating.

Overall the prices for the tickets are great, the shows are fun, and you can see some big names right here in the NW Suburbs."

The comedians are always funny and the atmosphere is chill. The venue itself is surprisingly nice. The club always has great headliners as well as up and comers. 

My main gripes would be: 1. $4 service charge per ticket via online, 2. Food is basic on it&#39;s best days. Skip coming here for dinner and just have drinks as your two item minimum.

The set up is pretty nice as there really isn&#39;t a bad seat in the house. I haven&#39;t tried their dinner option, but have ordered food here. Their buffalo wings are okay, spinach artichoke dip is good, their nachos were decent, and their fries with the mayo garlic sauce is my favorite!

The thing to know about this place is it is located inside or next to the mall. Right next to Texas De Brazil and each show we have attended is pretty much first come first serve on tickets. The only one time I wasn&#39;t too fond of my seats was when we were sat at an angled position as I didn&#39;t feel as connected to the show if I was more adjacent to the stage.

There&#39;s a two-item minimum here, but there&#39;s plenty of things you can order that tinkles your fancy.

The Improv Comedy club was superb! 

Food - excellent

Staff - excellent 

Shows - excellent 

The crowd was diverse and the people were all polite. The decor is reasonable and the seating is carefully designed to provide everyone regardless of their seats with a good experience. My advice is show up a whole hour early. If your show says 30 minutes be there a full hour before then so you can be first in line to sit right in front, because they do not have a reserved section.  

This isn&#39;t the type of place you go to mingle, but hey strangers things can happen! Overall, it&#39;s a fun place to go with a date or a group of friends."

The bar and waitress were wonderful so I hate that tbjs review has to include them, but we were harassed and told to shut up by staff members after the comedian had asked for commentary. Not exactly the reaction you would expect and clearly a venue not prepared for small comments here and there. Their food tasted like shit and we paid for at least 2 drinks per person, meaning we already spent too much money. When asked for the manager Christine...she did nothing but tell us we were in the wrong which is never the way you handle a situation when customers (us) are getting flicked off by people next to them because we are laughing at certain comments made by the comedian. This club is completely unprofessional and I will never go there again. If Nick Swardson can cancel there 4 times, there is a reason for it. And my favorite reason for never going back is the way my mother was disrespected when she did nothing but have fun with the comedians so FUCK THIS CLUB.

Parking is crazy as it is located in Woodfield mall. Did not try food but would recommend pre show dinner reservations to get the best seats if you are going to an early show.

You enter on the ground level but the show is essentially in the basement of the mall. It offers a full service bar, a full menu during the show, pre-show dinner, and complete wait staff. 

The menu offers traditional appetizers and several entrees. The prices are reasonable for both the show and the food. The drinks are on the high end for what is offered but it is not overly pricey. 

The seating people process is weird in that you are seated wherever the wait staff decides. You can arrive 40 minutes early and be placed in the back or arrive 15 before the show begins and you are seated in the safest place in the establishment.

Having lived in Los Angeles for many years and visiting many comedy clubs there, it was much different here in Chicago area.  Only a few clubs.  

We have attended several shows, Loni Love and Bobby Lee to name a few, and  the service has been excellent.  Very friendly and constantly checking on you.  The only hard part is trying to get the check.  I guess they want you to stay longer.  We always order our first round drinks once we seat, then the 2nd round during the 2nd comedian act before the main event.

There is ample parking since it is located in the Woodfield Mall.  Just outside the main entrance you&#39;ll find their ticket booth.  I purchase mine online to avoid &#34;sold out&#34; shows.  If you&#39;re trying  to park close you may have a difficult time depending on your show time.  If the mall is still open and there&#39;s a lot of shoppers for what ever reason you may have to park a ways out.

Pricing on tickets will vary depending on the line up.  On average, for 2 tickets, including service fee and taxes, it could run from $50.00 to $80.00.

I haven&#39;t been to a comedy club yet that allows cameras.  That part sucks for me.
The service was excellent helped to make the evening a special one that we could remember fondly.

The line can get pretty long especially if there is a special event and you do not want to be at the back of the line.

My only compliant is that the process they have with getting people inside and seated seems to be extremely disorganized.  We had people jumping the line, cutting etc.  The individual up front the second time I was there was not even paying attention and people started walking in. Ugh!

Food &amp; Drinks...I would suggest the cheesecake (YUM!) and pretty much anything on the menu, EXCEPT for the Nachos!  What a disappointment, but I guess if I&#39;m not at a Mexican restaurant, I should prepare myself.  There&#39;s not meat... NO MEAT??  There is a two item minimum, which is standard at most comedy venues.  I do not drink a lot and for people who don&#39;t, they do have festive non-alcoholic drinks!

My husband and I caught a show on a whim a couple weeks ago and it was super fun! Who knew this was hidden in the basement of Woodfield Mall. Two drink minimum (or item, really, if you&#39;d rather eat) but that&#39;s OK for a night out. We saw Loni Love and she was quite hilarious. The first local warm up gal was embarrassingly awkward, but the second warm up guy was pretty good. It&#39;s nice inside and seems like view would be decent from almost everywhere. Just get there a little early to get a closer, better seat. I&#39;ll definitely go back!"

It was a late lunch affair with drinks in the bar area before sitting in the auditorium for the comedic act.  The venue is in the basement located in Woodfield Mall.  It is dimly lit with nice carpeting and furniture.  

The bar has a good selection of beer, wine and spirits with a knowledgeable bar staff.  We were served hors d&#39;oeuvres by polite wait staff that was appetizing.  The space was large enough to accommodate the 100+ or so people we had attending.  They have a mix of tall boy tables and a few chairs and couches in the bar area.  

The dining area that centers to the stage is stadium style rising towards the back.  This provides good viewing from every seat.  The food here for lunch was good and was served buffet style.  

We were entertained by Brian Hicks and Rocky LaPorte.  They were certainly funny but at times struggled to gain the audiences approval.  I&#39;m not sure if it was us as a company or them.  I think it was us.  They were professional and talented.

We ended the afternoon in the bar area as people got their checked coats and went on their way."

It can be a pricey night out, but it&#39;s worth it, especially a double date or with a group of friends.  Good thing to know is that each person needs to order two items off the menu, so we have had dinner out and then just order drinks there."

My family and I came to the 10:15 show on Friday 11/27. We had been told to arrive at 9:45 so that&#39;s what we did. Upon arriving at the door we were made to stand outside for over 20 minutes in very cold weather. The attendants told us we had to wait for the people from the prior show to exit. 
Because of the cold, the 20 minute wait was extremely uncomfortable and felt like forever. 

I was this close to asking for a refund to leave. This is no way to treat customers in wintery Chicago weather!!!! 

As we waited for the prior show audience to exit, it dawned on me that we were waiting for the last stragglers to come out, who had been meeting the comedians and asking for autographs after the show. What if these fans had decided to stay and &#34;hang out&#34; for half and hour more? Would they have made us wait?

This was completely unacceptable. 

Now I&#39;ll know not to come in the winter months, and not to come for the second show."

The atmosphere is absolutely wonderful and is perfect for a date night, a night out with friends, bday parties, etc. The comedians who are scheduled to appear are always awesome. I&#39;ve seen about 15+ shows there and all have been hilarious! 

So, the cool thing is that they serve dinner during the show. I recommend arriving earlier so you don&#39;t have to worry about ordering while a comedian is on stage. The food is pretty good. I love the Improv burger! My husband and I usually split an appetizer and the burger. I would stay away from the taquitos...they were sooooo bland....gross! 

The only reason I gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because there is a required 2 item minimum per person. That&#39;s fine if you have complimentary tickets, but buying $50+ tickets and then having to be required to purchase 2 items/person can =  a pricey night.

Again a great venue...very intimate...great comedians...and pretty good food. You must check it out! :)"

I took off one star because of the long wait standing in line, we were supposed to go in at 10:15 but it was closer to 10:30 we were very annoyed watching people from the last show leave, why would&#39;t they have more of a gap between shows??

We ate before the show but did get drinks which to us were watered down. 

Anyway we saw Frank Townsend who was absolutely hilarious, we laughed the entire time.  I do not remember the names of the two openers but they were funny as well.  I would recommend this place but honestly be prepared to wait."

What I could not get over was the sound system. It just plain sucked.

So I find myself traveling to Schaumburg to see many of my favorite comedians very often.  As a matter of fact, I usually prefer to see them here because it&#39;s a more intimate setting and, if you&#39;re lucky, they will stick around after the show for meet and greets.  Tickets are reasonably priced for a venue where you will be sitting so close to the talent - IMO.  

So, as for the 2 item minimum - you can make of it what you will.  Yes, it can get pretty pricey - if you order drinks, if you order food - or you can order two sodas and leave it at that.  Personally, I like to make a night of it, get the &#34;with dinner&#34; tickets, get in early and have an appetizer or two and a drink.  You got people trying to make an honest  living here...having an appetizer isn&#39;t going to break the bank. 

As I have mentioned, I have been here many times, in all that time everyone I have dealt with has been super nice which also adds to a great experience.  Looking forward to my next visit in a few weeks!"

The tickets were reasonable and The Improv is pretty close to home, so we bought some tickets online and our evening was all arranged. Woo hoo for double dates!!

My hubby works in freight, so his hours stink. I met my sister and brother-in-law outside of The Improv and I hoped my husband was shortly behind us. We went inside, went downstairs and proceeded to wait in line. The wait wasn&#39;t bad at all even without pre-gaming cocktails. 

Once inside, we sat in the very front stage left. I couldn&#39;t believe how lucky we got!  We were there to see Louie Anderson and I was pretty excited. The three of us were pretty cramped at this little table and we got cozy with the two ladies sitting next to us. I couldn&#39;t imagine how tight it was going to be once my husband arrived. 

We ordered food and drinks. The prices were not impressive. Nothing seemed appropriately priced. This was a disappointment to me. I&#39;ll let my sister tell you about her food, but mine was cold. So back to the kitchen it went. It was acceptable when it returned. Nothing was impressive though. 

The show. There were two opening acts. Some things were funny and some were just pointless. That&#39;s how it goes during these sort of shows, but there were a few awkward moments that I wish didn&#39;t happen. My husband wandered in right before Louie Anderson came on. So at least it really did end up being a double date. And he ordered some food. It was served pretty quickly, but he wasn&#39;t a big fan. 

Louie was just what you would expect. He&#39;s funny. He cracked jokes at his own expense. Some of his jokes fell a little flat, but the vast majority got laughs from the crowd. It was a good show and I&#39;m glad that I went, but I wouldn&#39;t eat anything there again and I would prefer to go if someone else is paying."

Even if you do not order the dinner package they still have the option to get appetizers for all of the shows. 

Going to the later show is a hit or miss bc either the comedians will stay on longer or cut it short. 

I am not a fan of having to walk down the stairs and struggling  to find parking especially with holidays your better off going to pf Chang next door and getting valet service.  Downfall that you will have to wait later on. 

Always tip your servers because they will take care of you. 

I would have given it a better rating if the location was not in a mall. I say move to Addison IL over there they have a bunch of vacant places not in a strip mall with lots of parking."

Cons: food was disappointing.  Basil pesto Chicken entree was tough and chewy as it was most likely pre cooked and just warmed up and not prepared fresh to serve.  Mashed potatoes also re- heated.  Green beans were actually very good. Beware on what you order.  The salad was adequate.  Desserts also have the appearance of being made off site and just served.  May be better off with just drinks and appetizers.

When we came for just the show, they had to put us off to the side with two strangers at a little table. We joked when their food arrived &#34;oh, thank you for ordering for us!!&#34; When its super crowded service was slower, and I think they do require purchase of a drink with the ticket too...

Parking was difficult to find in the lot in front of the venue; however if you roll around a few times one should open up. I strongly suggestion arriving very early when you&#39;re seeing a big act to avoid the long lines that spam from inside the venue to outside. Also, you have to purchase a minimum of two items which is not a big deal at all. I do not like their drinks,  I&#39;ve purchased the cherry coke, not good at all and I believe I&#39;ve purchased a fruity cocktail and to my surprise it was not good either. The appetizers are pretty good. I&#39;ve ordered the fried ravioli,  calamari rings,  and buffalo wings and each one was tasty and satisfying. The venue set up is done well and is downstairs from the entrance. The place seats quite a lot of people. If you do arrive late to a packed showing be aware that you may be squeezed between people.

I seriously cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard. The best part was that this was FREE and I would most definitely pay to see him again. He created a boy band with the audience that was amazing. 

In regards to the post by MiriamB , it was a free show and he was working on new material, obviously. If you&#39;re easily offended then a comedy show is not for you. Was this your first comedy show?"

They have great deals in several places, including right at their site. Very smart. If you check in on Yelp you get four free return tickets! (At least for now). 

This was the first time we went for dinner. It was a Thursday night a few weeks ago and when we called to reserve our tickets they asked if we wanted to do dinner and we decided to go for it. It was a totally different experience than last time and we really liked it. We were given front row seats (if you go for dinner you get better seats closer to the front) and I was excited (but nervous because I am not one for attention from comedians!!!) to get to be so close. They have different seating times for if you have dinner or not. 

I am so mad at myself because I wrote down the name of our server but can&#39;t find it anywhere. She was FANTASTIC. She was young and petite with blond hair but I just can&#39;t remember her name. She was clearly a hard worker and did such a good job. She was patient with the people around us too. She was quick with refills and was good with suggestions from the menu. We were really impressed. We got the green bean appetizer and thought they were really yummy (but the portion seemed a little small- we could have kept going and going!) At the recommendation of our server I got the chicken caesar salad and she was so right- there was a ton of chicken on it and it was really good. My husband loved his burger- Pesto Portabella and said he would totally get it again. It does add up cost-wise but if you use their deals that helps quite a bit. 

The restrooms are nice and clean.

I thought that by the end of the night the bench/booth seat was super uncomfortable. They also seat people right next to you on the benches/booths in the front row and we felt very up close and personal with the other guests! I guess that&#39;s part of being in the front row.

The comedians are great and they really draw excellent and well known ones which is fun. I love the vibe and the look. I think we will definitely be coming more often now after such a good experience."

You have been warned! They are in Woodfield Mall (between Sears and Lord &amp; Taylor. Near Texas De Brasil) be prepared to circle around for parking lot. 

Here are a few things 
- Arrive early, you get better seating. It is first come, first serve. 
- Sign up for their email/text list, they will give out free tickets (just pay for their $3 processing fee per tix) or go to goldstar.com for half-price tickets.

I&#39;ve been here numerous of times, loving it each time and never running into any issues or complaints. A few weeks back, my boyfriend and I went to see Rickey Smiley, and boy was it PACKED! We were one of the last 40 or so people in line and had to wait over 30 minutes before they started to let us in, and even then, it took a long time until we got seated. So, if you know the main act is popular, I highly suggest coming in as early as possible. Since it was only us two, they said we would be seated with another couple since there were no extra tables, but we got lucky and had a table to ourselves. 

No matter where we have sat, the views have been great and seating comfortable. It&#39;s  a fairly large circular room with dim lights, which is great because it&#39;s never too dark where you can&#39;t see the person sitting next to you. I&#39;ve never been here for dinner before the show, but as most of these clubs require a minimum 2 item purchase, I always come hungry and ready to drink. Everything we have gotten from the food menu, has been delicious - spicy chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, and the Improv nachos. Service has been on par as well, bringing out the food and drinks quickly, and checking on us once throughout the show if we would like anything else. 

We laugh our asses off every time we come here and even the openers are funny. We went to a show back in February, and though the headliner was great, I felt myself laughing more at the jokes coming from the three guys before him.

I&#39;ve recently received an email that I won free tickets, so of course I signed up for them but I did pay an $8 fee. Unfortunately, something came up that weekend and we didn&#39;t end up going, but it was a really nice gesture through Improv.

I&#39;ve always seen it but never been inside of it. I&#39;m pretty much saying what all these other reviews are saying but it&#39;s from my personal experience. Place was pretty full when I went for filipino comedians. There were even non filipino people there in the audience so this is just a good date place I guess. Expensive though. The 2 item minimum is killer. Over all for 4 people with tickets, food and drinks, it was like $200. for cheapest i&#39;d say just get 2 soft drinks for $7 total.

If you wait long enough, they usually discount the tickets from like goldstar.com. I bought mine during the presale, and then two days before out show they were selling for 50% off, so I suggest you wait unless it&#39;s a big name. 

The tables are up close and personal with one another. I turned my chair to face the stage and a random guy was literally right next to me. Because of the closeness, I got bumped every time the waiters walked by me. A little annoying but what are ya going to do. It is first come first serve so you might as well just come for dinner and get a good seat. I had the improv burger which I must admit was pretty delicious. And it was probably one of the cheapest entrees on the menu so def recommend that."

It&#39;s a good deal.

The venue is clean, kept up. The staff is friendly. 
The food isn&#39;t bad and the drinks are plentiful.

Sometimes you may get a crap server but, for the most part, they are eager to booze you out and keep that tab growing. 

It&#39;s a comedy club so taper your limitations. 
However, for a comedy club that&#39;s intimate, it&#39;s a lot of fun and I love going here again and again.

i was in town for a conference, and we had a group outing to the improv.  basically, we had the whole place rented for just our group.  lots of fun.  we had drinks and appetizers in the bar areas.  the bartenders moved the lines through fast.  drinks were meh.  food was pretty good.

they served a buffet dinner.  they had a little trouble keeping the food trays full, so there were a few times the line got held up waiting for them to refill things.  food was ok.  chicken, steak, fish, potatoes, salad, bread.  they served cheesecake at the tables.  i&#39;m not a cheesecake lover, but tasted it, and it seemed ok.  huge slices... impressively big really.  not sure how anyone finished it!

I got to meet him and you can just tell he loves doing what he does and it makes it so much better. Our server was really nice. We sat front row and we never had to look for him but he wasn&#39;t annoying either. He knew when to be around. The food there is expensive though for what it is and they don&#39;t give you many choices.

Each show varies in price (more well known people are more money of course). 

We came here for dinner first. You have to get 2 items per person, which I personally think is stupid, but whatever. We had 2 appetizers, shared a meal, and got a drink which was plenty of food. The menu is not very big, and I really think the drinks are food are overproiced. Especially the drinks  - $10 for a mixed drink in a 8oz glass??? You kidding me??? Heck no, never again. But, the food was pretty good all things considered. The staff is very friendly - everyone greets you like you&#39;re going to be their bff. Our waiter was really nice...but sometimes slow. It took him forever to take our order, but after that it wasn&#39;t too bad.

The atmosphere is fun - looks like the stage from Seinfeld (who has been there by the way). It&#39;s cozy. so be prepared to get pretty close to the people next to you. ** Definitely make a reservation, otherwise you may not get it (first come first serve).** The show itself was a good time - they had 3 different comedians and it lasted a long while. **I also recommend going to the first show, because if you come to the second one you have to wait in a long line outside to get in (you have to wait for the first show to clear out).** Overall it was fun and we will come again."

Tony Rock was the headliner and the person who opened for him happened to be this cat my guy knows.  I lucked up on 50% off tix to the show via Goldstar (one of my go-to sites for event discounts). My suggestion to saving on shows here is to scope out their calendar on Goldstar and wait for the offer for the comedian&#39;s show you want to attend. I was way in LA when the Tony Rock tix dropped and 1am PST I took my discount thirsty self on there and proudly paid $26 for 2 tix.

 The process of will call was very efficient and timely, just showed my id and was given our tickets for entry. Once inside I saw what people meant about every seat being a decent one, because it is a more intimate theater. I was keeping it light and just had juice and water for my drinks since I was headed to a party afterwards. Some people didn&#39;t keep it light though like my friend from work and her crew, who kept yelling out to Tony Rock about their pitbull named Kilo.

They draw some big acts occasionally but the regular comics flying through town to check out material have been solid.

5 stars for the entertainment - the host comedian and opening comedian have always been hilarious - and of course the headliner has never disappointed, either.

5 stars for this location (interior) - it is a decent-sized space, very clean and laid out perfectly with a staff that is courteous and friendly.  The only downside to the location is due to it being located at the mall, it will most likely will take you some time to find a parking spot among all the crazy drivers &amp; oblivious pedestrians in the mall parking lot.

3 - 2 stars for the food - but that&#39;s quite typical for a comedy club.  Their menu, while limited, does have some variety.  I&#39;ve had a variety of appetizers, drinks and full dinners here - most are good or average, with the occasional item that is sub-par. The prices are a bit higher, also typical for a comedy club.

At least I consider $30 tickets plus 2 $9 drinks a little spendy. Especially in the suburbs. In a mall. Plus everything on the menu is overpriced for what it is. However, neither their price nor my disdain for all things suburban is the reason for this pitiable 2-star review. The reason for my review is the service. 

First, upon arriving to meet my group, I let the host know I was meeting a group. He asked the size, and I said &#34;6 or 7.&#34; He replied with great certainty that they haven&#39;t had any groups that size. Which is funny, because my group was in there.

Next, even though we are among the earliest people to arrive, we are seated in the side section rather than the still-empty center section.

Now, what really takes the cake is our server. She is slow to greet, slow to bring drinks, and slow to take our orders. When she finally does, she managed to get the entire group mad. No kidding. I was shaking my fist in the air yelling &#34;Yelp will hear about this!&#34; as I balanced my pitchfork and torch. But in seriousness, she had taken 3 orders (2 orders of chicken tenders, nachos, and fries) and come to me. I asked for her opinion as I attempted to decide between their &#34;vegetarian options,&#34; nachos or fried ravioli, when she stops me to tell the whole table that we are supposed to be ordering entrees and not appetizers. She continues on to say she&#39;ll let it slide this time but next time she&#39;ll have to move us further back, with the non-diners. What?! We aren&#39;t sharing an order of fries, lady! Every single person ordered their own appetizer. After adding guacamole to my nachos it was the same price as a sandwich. The chicken fingers are $2 less than a chicken sandwich, and the 2 ladies who ordered them also got fries, so I think we&#39;re even, you maniac. The other  laies come to the Improv at least couple times a year. They said they had never had anyone cop such an attitude. 

I don&#39;t think I&#39;d give them further business.

On a positive note, 2 of the group absolutely love the chicken fingers. One says they are the best anywhere and she always looks forward to them. To bad that--at $10--they don&#39;t count as dinner."

There was a table of four who talked at a normal volume throughout the entire show (they must have chatted through the announcements that said no one comes to a comedy club to hear someone else&#39;s conversations). Eventually, an usher came to tell them to quiet down, but by then the show was almost over. The first time I went here I saw Joey from Full House. It was so fun! The second time I came was for my birthday and the opening act was FAR funnier than the show. I was a bit dissapointed."

I have been here twice now and have had a blast each and every time. Both times the comedians kept me laughing. I must say though, the main act is not usually the best one out of the performers that night!

The food Is fairly good. The calamari is very tasty, the cheese sticks are edible but the crust and the cheese separate the moment you bite into it so you are left with a crust in hand and cheese out. 

All of the drinks that I&#39;ve had have always been good. Beware, the fruity are very fruity and sometime have a taste of pure concentrate juicy which I usually am not a fan of. The sex on the stage is a good choice ;-) 

The views are the best from center or higher up closer to center. Last time we sat to the the left of the stage a little in the bad and our views were a little blocked by some people, but I saw the comedians the whole time anyways, just had to do a little bit of dodging around heads.

The service has always been okay, but not perfect. I feel like they always disappear and do not choose to come back until the end to bring the check. Meh, not the most attentive staff.

The waiting area is huge since you have to stand in this winding line before getting in. I would suggest coming early to ensure a good seat, especially if you are vertically challenged and can&#39;t see over tall people.

I found that Gary Valentine from the King of Queens was the headliner on a Friday night, so I bought some tickets online and we were on our way. 

We went to the second seating that night and really enjoyed the whole show from beginning to end. The opening acts were hilarious and I &#34;belly-laughed&#34; more than once that particular evening. I almost think I was that annoying person with the too-loud-laugh in the audience. Sorry, people. :/

It was pretty dark in the audience, so reading the menu was difficult, even for someone like me with pretty awesome vision (knock on wood!) There was a 2 item minimum here, and we had already had dinner, so we each got a few drinky-drinks. Too bad, it wasn&#39;t until my second glass of over-priced Beringer, that I realized they had sangria (missed that on the menu)....so now I was forced to order Sangria....wouldn&#39;t you have done the same thing?  It was delish!! 

I really wanted to get a small app, but I had heard from more than one source that their apps are fairly greasy, so we skipped them. Probably a good idea.

The facility was pretty decent and the whole &#34;underground&#34; comedy club thing was pretty fun. I used the restrooms both at the beginning of the show and right afterwards...gotta be honest-- the restrooms were pretty bad. Not a fan of places where there are 10+ employees standing around chatting and a facility that needs cleaning. Gotta be honest, that&#39;s kinda sad. Management should probably look into this. I regret to inform you that I have to deduct an extra star for this.

There are food &amp; drinks services here and they require you to have 2 minimum (excluding the food I believe) per person.  If all fails, you can get a nice $8 Voss water in a fancy glass bottle.

The improv is a great choice for a girls night out or date night just the same. Depending on the act, ticket prices vary, but the two-item minimum is a constant. 

I prefer the later seatings, where the two items can be two drinks or an appetizer and drink. I always feel awkward if I&#39;m sitting anywhere up front eating, it makes you an easy target for the comedian!

The setting is intimate, I&#39;ve only ever been to one show where I didn&#39;t have a great seat. The service is okay, I feel as though they need more staff on the floor, but servers are always friendly and courteous. 

The next time you are there, sign up for their email list, I get offers for free tickets all the time (not name acts, and you still have to pay the $3 service fee per ticket.) a night of comedy for two for $6 plus two drinks is totally worth it, and if the no-name comic stinks, it only cost you $6 plus the drinks you would&#39;ve paid for somewhere else anyway!!"

I had a good experience both times. This is a newer theater so it is very modern and very clean. The waitstaff is very attentive and slips quietly in and out without interrupting the show. This was a &#34;date night&#34; and we had dinner first (food was good) and then saw a few opening acts and then....The Wayans Brothers (Shawn and Marlon)! -who were hilarious! Ironically, my other time here I came to see Damon Wayans. I have never been here for a &#34;less famous&#34; comedian, but all the openers were really funny so I think the club is pretty choosy about who it puts up there! It would be interesting to go and support lesser known comics. Opener Ryan Budds was especially entertaining. It&#39;s fun to learn the names of the comics who are &#34;coming up&#34; because they might have headlining shows one day too that you can go and support!

If you are looking for something interesting and different to do, this is a great place. In the heart of the Woodfield area, it&#39;s only about 30 minutes from Chicago and if you needed to stay the night, there are plenty of nice hotels around."

I never really thought much of it until I absolutely needed to go. You see I caught wind from my friend that Chris Kattan was going to be there, and I am probably the biggest Kattan fan on the planet, like in high school I was known as Mango girl (don&#39;t ask) so immediately had to purchase tickets that night to his show. Google helped me get there, and thanks to the zoom feature I could see exactly where it was located. By the Sears entrance lower level; although there is a giant light up marquee in the parking lot, so really you can&#39;t miss it. I apparently don&#39;t drive that side of the mall much. Duh. 
 It was very reasonable in price for the tickets, but I recommend buying the tickets in person if possible just to avoid the processing fee. That is my only gripe, and it&#39;s a small one. When you walk in there is a ticket counter and stairs going down to the lower level. The lower level has a nice bar area/lobby that has a nice touch. We lined up and got seated inside the club within no time. I gotta say I am impressed with this club! It&#39;s spacious and has a great layout. I don&#39;t think there is a bad seat in the house. My only other comedy club experience was at Zanies and it wasn&#39;t even close to this nice, it felt like a movie theatre/restaurant with a well lit stage up at the front. Nice!
There is a 2 item minimum purchase however so keep that in mind. I didn&#39;t partake in any alcohol but I got an iced tea and shared some appetizers. It wasn&#39;t bad it was bar food quality but that&#39;s what I had been expecting. I liked the fried ravioli so I would say that was good enough to get again. The iced tea was bottled and I was given decaf unexpectedly. Decaf is a 4 letter word for me so I wasn&#39;t thrilled but I was just happy to be there so I didn&#39;t make a commotion. The servers here were great too btw, no complaints!
The show needless to say was fantastic, and I will definitely be going back, especially if you know who is in town!  I would have been that person to go to another show but my male counterpart thought it was best not to be a creep.  *insert sad creep face* 
It would be nice if there were more advanced warnings or marketing on guests here as well, but I guess that isn&#39;t always possible. 

All in all it was an easy and fun night, and I will be back even if it&#39;s to see some other comedians. It&#39;s just a nice change of pace and a great night out. I definitely recommend it, and remember unlike the Alamo Woodfield really does have a basement."

We picked a date and I tried to make reservations. The staff did not know how to use the certificates. After calling back the second time we got that straightened out. The show was an hour long with 3 other performers prior to Pablo Fransisco. The openers were funny and had their moments however, when Pablo came out what a difference. He was so poorly prepared. He had no act and only talked about his bald spot and the blinding lights. He was sweating profusely leading me to believe he was on something. He did not even come close to performing like his you tube videos. 
In some aspects I feel that it&#39;s not the comedy clubs fault for this review but then again they did hire him. I do agree with a previous review in that the sound system has some faults on the sides. The whole show was hard to hear from the sides."

The list of talent we have seen here is huge. Carlos Mencia X2, Jeff Dunham, the late John Pinette R.I.P., John Witherspoon, Pablo Francisco and Taylor Williams. I&#39;m sure I missed a few. The talent is always the BEST!! The venue is where I have a HUGE PROBLEM!!!  The sound system is junk. It&#39;s the size of a sound system I would put in my garage not my man cave.  It needs to be doubled in size at least. It seems like who ever installed it said &#34;it sounds great&#34;. To bad it was not a professional that installed it or tested it with a room full of people laughing. Having 5 small speakers over the stage is not enough!!  There needs to be additional speakers throughout the room. I hate not hearing the talent because the crowd is laughing so loud. It takes away from the show."

It&#39;s a change from the dining and bar scene that good old Schaumburg has to offer. And hey, you always get a few laughs out of it. 

The Improv Comedy Club is great for a date night, girls night out, or a fun group event. Just like any other venue, there&#39;s the good, the bad, and the annoying.

The good. 
- They pack the house which always makes for a ton more laughs
- Every seat is a good seat. Well, except the front rows...unless you enjoy getting harassed by the comedian.
- Discounted tickets are available at Goldstar.com
- Hilarious and fairly famous comedians frequently make cameos (Loved seeing Robert Kelley!!))
- Friendly staff
- Shows are offered in both earlier and later show times.

The bad &amp; annoying
- Two drink/appetizer drink minimum for purchase. I typically go after dinner so I&#39;m definitely not hungry for fried apps. As for the booze, if you&#39;re not a drinker ((or not in the mood)) you&#39;re in a slight predicament. Let&#39;s not forget how overpriced the drinks are.
- Service is fairly sloooooooow. I get why, but still. You have to wait for your server to come take your order, the orders of the 20 people around you, and then wait for all of those drinks to be delivered. Sheesh. 
- Seating is quite...intimate. They pile the people in, which is good. However, I prefer to not sit on top of people I don&#39;t know. 
- Seating is first come, first serve, so get there early! 
- Located in the bowels of Woodfield Mall, so parking can be atrocious

Overall, the Improv Comedy Club is a good time. Keep an eye on Groupon and Goldstar for discounted tickets...and get ready to laugh your ass off."

The venue is in Schaumberg, and we were coming from the Southwest Suburbs so travel time was about an hour.  The Improv is actually attached to Woodfield Mall, so if you know where that is your all set.  We were going to a 915 show, so we arrived at about 845 and were surprised to see a line that was about the length of a city block, of people waiting to get in the building.  Everybody seemed a little shocked that this was the line for ticket holders, but alas it was.  The reason the line was so long, was because they seat you as you come in, so they need everyone to remain in a somewhat organized fashion so they can seat them first come first serve.  It did seem like they had plenty of room inside of the building to have these people line up, but they didn&#39;t go with that option.  Once inside, the building/room is nice.  It table style seating, and most tables have 4 chair to them.  They claimed the show was sold out and they would be double seating people, meaning if you were a group of 2, you would be paired up with another group of 2.  Luckily, this didn&#39;t happen, but it sounds like its something they do regularly if they are overbooked.  The seating arrangements were ok, view was decent, chairs were standard wood chairs not too comfortable, but not terrible either.  

There is a 2 drink min at the club, I got 2 soda&#39;s and it totaled to about $7.  They also have food, but didn&#39;t get a chance to give that a try.  They start the shows off with a host who does a few minutes of stand up, followed by another warm up comedian, followed again by their headliner.

I would come back to the improv if someone I liked was playing, but it is a far ride to just check out on a whim."

While Mr. Lee was HILARIOUS, this review will be specifically about the venue and the service I experienced. 

First off, I went to the second show and the first show was letting out when I arrived. Therefore, I had to stand outside with my party and wait for entry. Not such a good thing when temps are in the teens. The Improv can do better than that in my opinion. It&#39;s located in the burbs, not downtown Chicago for heavens sake!

The venue itself is gorgeous! Spacious, modern and accommodating. There isn&#39;t really a bad seat in the house but it can get a bit weird if you wind up at a table with strangers or have to sit with people at your table directly in front of you. 

I ordered the BBQ sandwich but it wasn&#39;t really what I expected. It was very similar to a McRib sandwich as opposed to a pulled pork style chicken sandwich. It wasn&#39;t that good so I had to force myself to eat half of it. That turned out to be a good thing because it made me sick as a dog afterwards. 

The drinks were fair. Not the worst but I&#39;e certainly had better.

All in all, it was a positive experience. If the comedian is enough of a draw then I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it to check the Improv out.

TIP - Stay a little while after most of the crowd clears out. We did that and we got to meet Bobby Lee. He came out and greeted everyone that was still there and take photos.  Don&#39;t know if all the comedians do that but you never know so why not stick around?"

Its true.  On this evening we definitely had a great show (for the life of me I cannot remember the names of the comedians) but it was a great one.  Being a week night they weren&#39;t well known but they were down and out funny.  One of the guys kept on flirting with me (I was very close to the stage) and was tearing up the hubby who is luckily a great sport.  We had so much fun.

I needed a good laugh, it had been a very stressful couple of days.  My hubby knew that and for about $100 we had a great evening.

Don&#39;t expect gourmet food, that it is not.  Its generic and something you can get anywhere else but the laughs are totally worth your trip."

The theater was really nice and a lot bigger than I though. Having mostly been to comedy clubs in the city that are small and packed, basically sitting on the people next to you, this was a nice surprise. There are lot of seats and it is spread out. That being said the tables are still small and for a crowded show it would still be a little packed.
The stage isn&#39;t that big, but it appears you can see from just about anywhere. Of course there is a two item minimum and for me and a buddy who did not want to drink our tab was $15 for four soda&#39;s.  Drinks looked about right to a little pricey, but at a comedy club the drinks are going to be a little over priced.
The sound was good and I had a pretty good time. I would go back for a comedian I really enjoyed. It is a bit of a hike for me, but all in all it was a good time.
The line outside before the show started was long. And I didn&#39;t get why they needed that because there appears to be room on the inside for lines."

I was unaware that you had to get at least 2 things when you are there. Which is annoying especially since the place has expensive items on the menu. The drinks are $10 bucks and weren&#39;t that good at all. Do NOT get the prime rib taquitos, those things tasted awful. The shell of it almost broke my teeth that&#39;s how hard it was. Barely any meat inside and very tasteless as well. It gets also annoying with them being over attending. Its like every 5 minutes they come to the table and see if everything is ok. Cant enjoy the show with people bugging you like that through out the show."

I only come here when they offer &#34;complimentary tickets&#34; and I say it in quotes because if you order them online you have to pay $3.50 per ticket for service fee.  Otherwise you end up spending $40+ per person with tickets and their two item minimum purchase. The two items you can purchase could be drinks or meal items but everything is costly with apps averaging $9 and beer $4-5 and soft drinks $3.50.

The facility is nice clean, spacious, and a nice design. Complete opposite of the Zanies sardine can in the city.

The food is eh because some things are good and others completely bomb. Things that should be good home runs like improv nachos, prime rib taquitos, and hummus are tasteless or poor flavor. I would recommend the showroomfries, the burger, and the wings (jumbo wings).  They&#39;re solid choices.

I&#39;ve seen a lot of shows here over the years. Out of the three comedians you see one is usually really funny and two are okay funny so you&#39;re bound to get a good laugh in at your visit.

Overall it&#39;s a great experience and I recommend it for a good night in the burbs."

This was not one of those night. 

Back story is this place is in a Chicago suburb and the Cubs are playing in the playoffs. They have recliner seats in front of big screens that you can eat off of dinner trays. We just sat at a booth

We waited 30 minutes for our table which wasn&#39;t terrible. We had drinks at the bar so once we got seated we didn&#39;t need anything except for a little time looking at the menu. Our waiter came back to our table 25 minutes after we sat down. Once we order a couple of my coworkers ordered a refill which didn&#39;t come out until our meals did. About 25 minutes later for a couple orders of meatloaf and a burger. One of the guys reminded our server he needed a refill of Diet Coke at that time and that is when we got our refills. 

The next time we saw our server was at least another 30 minutes when he just brought us our check. 

The Meatloaf was below par and not in the golf way and the service was not great. That is why this trip got two stars."

The look of the tavern is very nice, with a laid back type of feel. Nice ambiance and the choice of eating indoors or outdoors.

I had the Westwood Chicken Sandwich which itself was delicious. The balance between the various parts of the sandwich was great. My sandwich came with fries which seemed a bit over fried. The seasoning on them masked this a bit. They were edible but not the most enjoyable.

In general our waitress was very nice and attentive to our needs. Unfortunately the service was pretty slow, with food taking close to 40 minutes to come out. For a lunch break that was just too long. I&#39;d probably come back again but only if I knew I had time to kill."

We were going to go somewhere else but the wait was over an hour so we decided to come here. They had a wait too, about 30-45 minutes, but compared to an hour and given the fact that we were starving we figured it was still worth the wait.

My guess was there was a wait at both of these restaurants because they were the only off-chain restaurant within miles and after travelling so far we really wanted to avoid places we can dine at anytime. 

We got our table notification text a little before the 30 minute mark and were escorted upstairs. That when we noticed a bar on the second floor that may have been open seating, next time we know! We wanted to sit at the bar since they offer the full menu service but there was no place to sit.

The table, or should I say, couches we were seated at was a nice touch, plus they were super comfortable! At first there was another couple at our table, guess they had the same idea as us to try sitting at the bar and figured that table was part of the bar. But it wasn&#39;t, also good to know. It was a great spot, overlooking the first floor and bar with a giant TV screen.

The food was great. I was hesitant to order the salmon because I always order the salmon and it&#39;s just to be healthy. Never do it because it is the best tasting dish on the menu. As soon as I told the waitress I was even considering the salmon she lit up and told me it was one of their top 3 dishes! So I ordered that and my husband ordered their house burger, which also looked pretty good. We also ordered some chips and guac to start.

I must emphasize how spot on my waitress was about the salmon!! One of the best, if not the best, I ever had! I think I only enjoyed one salmon fillet more and that was only because it was at an uber expensive restaurant. This was sweet yet tangy and the price was totally affordable. Under $20. The guac and homemade tortilla chips were also delish. My husband was very happy with his burger. 

The food came out fast and fresh so we made it to our evening concert with time to spare. Great way to spend our last night of our Chicago trip!"

The atmosphere and setup of the restaurant is very cool and welcoming. There is a bar area inside along with a dining area with several tvs. Then there is a very nice outside section also with a bar and tvs above the bar.

There were 4 of us. We ordered the chips and guacamole as an appetizer. Entrees ordered at the table were: a burger with the patty, bacon, and an egg with the side of fries. The French dip rib sandwich with the meat juice and horseradish (on the side) for dipping served with a side of fries. The special artic char meal. I ordered the cranberry chicken salad and the crunchy pig and lobster roll. 

The salad is large, definitely dinner sized portion. Chicken, dried cranberries, pecans, and Bleu cheese. The crunchy pig and lobster roll (6 pcs): avocado, a little white rice, lobster, Jalapeño and bacon. Both very good! 

We also ordered drinks. I had a couple martinis including the mangoberry and Hollywood nights. Both good, but Hollywood Nights is a must order. It&#39;s green with a cherry at the bottom. It says it&#39;s sour but if anything it&#39;s a bit sweet and tastes mostly like pineapple juice. It&#39;s amazing.

She tried to clean up act after I stared as she gave a third table their order.    She afterwards bought the soy sauce then later said the sushi makers must&#39;ve left early for the night.    Whatever. 

The Signature roll I ordered eventually arrived and I have to say it was far from it.    Granted its a bar and sushi probably isn&#39;t their specialty but since they advertised quite a few choices,  they should at least make it decent. 

As much as I don&#39;t want to play the so-called &#34;race card&#34;, my friend and I were the only black folks in the restaurant.    Even if I wasn&#39;t relocating soon,  I won&#39;t be back ever."

They do have a good selection of beer and cocktails (it&#39;s a bar). While entering, the place looks really spacious and open. We were seated upstairs and it was actually really neat because they have recliners (I believe) in front of big screen TVs where you may enjoy the game while being served food and drinks.

So, we started with the seared tuna with some asian slaw for an appetizer which was quite delicious. The waitress was attentive at this point, coming back with drink orders, taking the order quickly so no complaint so far. Then, she disappeared for a little bit. When our entree came, we had to move dishes around because the table hasn&#39;t been cleared for a while even though we&#39;ve finished the appetizers way before the entrees came.

Someone else brought the food order to the table. I tried my mango salad and it was actually good and then the spicy tuna rolls. The rolls were not at all spicy to my standard and they were fairly average-tasting. Sure, this isn&#39;t really a sushi bar but they do have a sizable sushi menu and I did notice several people ordering them. Dining partner thought the fish and chips were &#34;nothing to write home about&#34; and mentioned that Applebee&#39;s had better fish and chips.

Overall, I think if you are looking for a place to have drinks and maybe some appetizers, then this would be it. Otherwise, I really wasn&#39;t too impressed and perhaps the wait staff could dial down on the attitude a little. I noticed how almost everyone of their wait staff (the ones I&#39;ve seen upstairs anyway) were walking around like they were angry at the world. Smile, life isn&#39;t that bad."

At Westwood Tavern in Schaumburg, you get all of that but the food is much better than what you would expect from a sports bar. 

The great thing about Westwood Tavern is the variety in food options. They have taken bar food staples and kicked it up a notch. You can get your nachos, burgers, tacos, and flatbreads to accompany your beer but you can also get sushi rolls and sashimi if bar food isn&#39;t your thing. The foot long grilled cheese caught my eye - it&#39;s a twist on grilled cheese and tomato soup by adding braised short rib beef with smoked gouda grilled mushrooms. I decided on giving my cholesterol a break and chose the grilled salmon and green beans instead which was delicious and the healthier choice. 

The venue is great for groups whether you are with a rowdy crowd to watch the game or to enjoy a nice dinner with the family. There is enough space where you can be surrounded by screens to watch several games at a time or prefer a quieter setting away from the sports fanatics. Service was excellent and the prices are reasonable with food portions larger than expected."

This restaurant has a nice, clean modern looking interior with custom beer taps on the table, fireplaces, outdoor bar, and tons of TV&#39;s. The reason I&#39;m giving this restaurant 3 stars however is that the prices are a bit high, even for the suburbs --- and the food is really not special enough to justify these prices. Even the appetizers are priced high enough where a small bite and one of the drink specials will set you back around $20 easily. The entrees are not a lot better, where the portion size suggests that you&#39;re eating at a fine dining establishment (but this is really fancier looking bar food). 

Overall, stick to the drink specials and grab food elsewhere if you&#39;re hungry."

Went there with the family on a friday night and that was the vibe. I don&#39;t know how it is on other nights though.
The server could have been a little nicer, she didn&#39;t introduce herself and didn&#39;t even crack a smile the time we were there.  Our food came out as what we ordered, didn&#39;t wait for a table and will probably try it another day."

The set up of this bar/restaurant is pretty great, probably my favorite part. They have a downstairs and an upstairs with bars on each level. TVs are everywhere and they have large booths and tables so this place is great for groups. Some of the booths even have taps right at the table which is pretty sweet, not to mention leather lounge chairs placed right in front of TVs! Plus, outdoor seating! How great is that? Seems to be a pretty popular after work spot.

Their menu is interesting because they have quite the variety; typical bar food such as burgers and wraps, but then they also have things like tacos and fish and a pretty extensive sushi list. Both times I&#39;ve been here now I&#39;ve gotten the fish and chips. I&#39;m honestly not sure why, they have way more exciting menu options! Must have just been craving fish frye on those days... who knows.

At Westwood you&#39;ll find a huge beer list as well as signature cocktails and of course a full bar. They have a daily drink special list as well.

Now to break down the good stuff...

Tavern Fish &amp; Chips - three pieces of fresh cod in a beer batter paired with malted vinegar &amp; seasoned hand cut fries ($15). This is very good! Fish had the perfect texture and the seasoned fries are bomb dot com.

Pulled Chicken Nachos - cheddar &amp; jack cheese, sour cream, jalapeños, tomatoes, lettuce, green onion, guacamole, and roasted salsa ($9.50). Great for sharing with a group! Nothing mind blowing, but definitely pretty damn delicious.

Cucumber Strawberry Press (signature cocktail) - Effen cucumber vodka, strawberry puree, and sprite ($8). Refreshing and delicious! I&#39;m a sucker for anything cucumber lately and this cocktail combo hit the spot just right.

Service - friendly but honestly pretty slow. Both times I&#39;m been here (on a Thursday and Friday night) they&#39;ve been really busy, but still, good service is still expected. This is really the only reason I couldn&#39;t give the last star!

I will definitely be back to Westwood. I&#39;m really intrigued to give their sushi menu a whirl!"

Employees: our waitress was awesome. She was always on the ball of everything and never was too annoying when checking in. The people greeting had some attitude and I felt like they didn&#39;t really do the place justice but decided to let it go (girl with big glasses). Our waitress was awesome, let me add again (blonde). 

Atmosphere: very welcoming and had a home appearance. So much fun and warm (definitely hate being cold in a restaurant) I really enjoyed the surroundings. 

Food: everything, AND I MEAN everything I had was amazing. The cornbread was perfectly cooked (filling and more dessert bound for me) but had a sweet feel to it. The maple butter was the topping that was out of control experience. Loved it with the cornbread. The trio sampler is so worth the try, you will not be disappointed by the appearance and  juiciness of the food. It&#39;s worth it especially if you want to try a few things. I got the southwest salad; for me it had too much seasoning but it was good. I would go for anything but a salad after all the stuff I tried for the night, you really will not be disappointed here."

Westwood Tavern was nearby, and the casual atmosphere didn&#39;t frown upon our yoga pants and messy buns.  It isn&#39;t a divey restaurant though; I like spots that can be super casual or slightly upscale.  The dark wood tables and cozy booths scream &#34;upscale Schaumburg,&#34; while the beer taps at the tables and TVs bring you back down to earth.

I didn&#39;t partake in the table tap, but how cool and convenient is that?  Purchase a beer and refill it at your convenience, no waiting!  You do pay by the ounce though, so be careful!

I love the diverse menu at Westwood Tavern.  Burgers, salads, and even sushi!  I had the best turkey burger here, topped with apricot and cranberry, and STUFFED with brie!  The fries are sprinkled with parmesan.  I dipped them in the housemade ranch.  These are no ordinary fries.

The beer menu (if you&#39;ve decided to skip the table tap) offers many local brews on tap and in cans or bottles. I went with a Goose Island Green Line.

Westwood Tavern is a comfortable atmosphere that isn&#39;t too sporty or too snooty.  My friend and I loved our food and could&#39;ve taken a nap in the booth after an hour of sweaty yoga.  It&#39;s near Woodfield Mall and much more worthwhile than the chains within the mall."

This place is not far from my hotel and my office.  The bar is quite large.  Has a pretty decent sized horseshoe shaped bar with a bunch of big screen TV&#39;s over the bar.  All around the bar are tables and booths.  Scattered all around are move TV&#39;s.  They have an upstairs space that is quite big, lots of tables for dining in.  They also have a decent sized outdoor space with a bar and TVs.  Decent amount of bar stools around the bar and about two dozen tables.  Overall, it is a nice vibe...seems a little upscale, but it is quite casual.

Each night they have some sort of happy hour special...some sort of beer or martini special.  They menu is quite vast.  For good, they have some decent sushi. I enjoyed the jalapeño rolls, signature rolls, crunchy pig and lobster roll, ahi tuna sashimi and freshwater eel.  In addition, they have lots of standard bar fare.  They have burgers, wings, salads, flatbreads, tacos and some signature entrees. 

They have about 15 beers on tap.  Those taps consist of macro and micro brews.  They also have 50-60 beers in bottles.  They have your standard Miller Lite, Corona, Coors light...as well as some nice breweries like Victory, Allagash, Lagunitas, Great Lakes, Oscar Blues, Two Brothers, Deschutes...etc.  Plenty of beer styles, IPAs, Hefeweizen, American Wheat, Stouts, Porters, Pale Ales, Rye beers...A more than ample selection. 

The staff here is just fine.  They always have plenty of help.  Our waitress (different each night) was always around, but not nagging.  They were quick to answer questions and you never waited around for another drink (not that I had that many).  

Overall, this is a great place in Schaumburg.  If you are looking for a nice casual place, stop in.  There are always a ton of people here, but with all the space, you are not bumping into people.  It is a more professional crowd (if you want to consider me professional)."

It&#39;s was awesome 10/10. The interior is classy yet casual, the booths were large and comfortable but had little space for your feet (large box under table that I assumed had the table kegs in it)

I ordered the sushi Osaka style which was the best sushi I have ever had. I then got the prime rib dip which was good (not great) the Aus jus sauce was really salty but it was fine other than that. My girlfriend had the southwest chicken salad which was great and very comparable to cooper&#39;s hawks southwest chicken salad. Also had a couple martinis for 5$ martini wednesday.

We sat in round booth: and because they somehow thought it cool to put x2 beer taps in the table you sit at... this literally negates ANY leg room you would otherwise have... i.e. you have Zero Leg room because there is a large box/posts etc UNLESS you sit sideways.
Food: Appetizer: We got the &#34;Crunchy Pig&#34; Lobster rolls= Not terrible, not great
Entree: She got Fish Tacos: Said they were flavorless as well as the salsa was weak:
I got the 1foot long brisket grilled cheese. 
It was OK but nothing special for sure.
(Think Long piece of white bread w white &amp; american cheese with flavorless roast beef on it, along with a small cup of (likely canned) tomato soup for dipping. Fries: While I&#39;m admittedly picky with fries, these were obviously re-dips/had been sitting for a while... as far as catsup none was ever offered.

She told me that the Westwood Tavern is the place to be for food, drinks, and fun.

And as such, I tended to believe her. We met up here at 11am and the restaurant / bar had a few people already sitting in there. It&#39;s Friday after all and people want to start the weekend already. Don&#39;t blame them one bit! The parking here can get crazy, as it shares spaces with a mall adjacent to it. Thankful that I quickly found parking nearby the restaurant, so time wasn&#39;t wasted. Westwood Tavern can be characterized as being like dining in Buffalo Wild Wings or maybe Chili&#39;s type of setting. I had already eaten breakfast an hour earlier, so all I did was order lunch, but in a take out box. While I wished I had some alcohol with my friend, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t - since I had to drive 3 hours to Green Bay from Schaumburg that day. Still it was a nice venue to hang out with my friend, whom I haven&#39;t seen since 2010. My friend had some alcohol though, pretty sure she can handle one while driving. Lol

Westwood Tavern is located at 1385 N Meacham Avenue in Schaumburg, IL. They accept credit cards, as usual and they serve definitely comfort food and burgers for the masses. For the most part, the ambiance here was decently louder than I had thought, but not so quiet to where it was a problem. The lights were kind of dim, but not so much to where it was mood lighting. After all, it was 11am! Kind of weird to have that, unless they were saving $$ on electricity. Prices here were normal, where it can range from $6 to $10 for burger combos and $10+ for other delicious entrees. The service here at the Westwood Tavern was pretty good and nice. It was quick bite for lunch and we had the waitress take a photo of us after the meal. It was good. I didn&#39;t think the restaurant was air conditioned when we were there, but I could be mistaken. Oh well.

For me, I got the Chicago burger, which ended up being eaten at a rest stop on the Illinois / Wisconsin state line. It came with French fries and it was satisfying. The burger itself was pretty good, juicy, and delicious. Had to find a place for liquids to wash it down, but all was good. My friend also had a burger and fries, which seemed good and delicious as well - at least she ate most of it before getting full up. Still, I wasn&#39;t too impressed with what Westwood Tavern had to offer. Although good service and good food was adamantly was there, I felt like there was something lacking. Maybe it was the air conditioning. Not sure though. 

Since my Schaumburg friend loves to go here with her friends, maybe it&#39;s a good ideal place to hang out after work or on the weekends.

Support local!

I like the place. The decor is fine. Nothing amazing but I am not expecting Italian architectural design either. I absolutely love the chairs upstairs. Who doesnt tho? Their patio is phenomenal in the summer, minus the mosquitoes. They have specials everyday and a fun list of beers on tap and bottles. Great food choices are the natchos, the guac, pot roast, grilled cheese, I also like their salads as well. What I dont like is their sushi. But then again if I visit an american sports bar I am not bound to have some kick ass rolls. I am bound to overpay but not necessaily love them. 
Except for the fact that the older suburban crowd has pretty much infested the joint I think it may be one of the best places in Schaumburg."

No other signs of vegetables at all (minus the fried onion straws on top of my pot roast). I would highly recommend getting the corn bread here though.

However, I was surprised to see during my most recent visit that I was charged an extra $2 for a couple of dipping sauces for my fries. Not to mention the fact that these sauces came out in a bowl, not a tiny sauce cup and I barely made a mark in it.
We even had to ask the waitress what the charge was because it was under &#34;additional taxes&#34; or something of the sort, like they tried to find a way to charge us when they normally don&#39;t?

Really, I have no idea, and in the long run, it&#39;s only $2. I just thought not including any sauces with your fries, not telling us there was a charge, and then charging us for &#34;taxes&#34;, was kind of shady.

For future reference, Westwood, I would let the customer know there&#39;s a charge and maybe give them out in smaller cups so you don&#39;t have to charge $1 for a side of ranch."

The only thing I would like to suggest to them is this: please put wasabi into a separate ramican container when doing carry-out.  I got salmon nigiri today, which was great, the fish quality was on point.  The only thing that ruined it was that, due to being carry out, the nigiri rolled around all in the wasabi, so by the time I got it back to the office, it was covered in wasabi :(

Love the food, love the staff and the atmosphere, just don&#39;t love wasabi all over my sushi.  I usually only use a pinch, which is why i didn&#39;t ask for no wasabi.  Better luck next time I hope."

We had to ask Daria for items we wanted a number of times. A lot of their food is fried and few healthy options. They brought our dinner when we had just started our salad.  We asked Daria to take it back and bring it when we were finished.  She had someone else come over and try to serve it to us.  We again asked that they return it to the kitchen so we could finish our salad.  The restaurant is extremely noisy.  It was very cold sitting by the window and my husband kept his leather jacket on all night.

While working in the suburbs, Westwood was our post-work spot for drinks and appetizers, especially during patio season. Loaded with a full bar and fireplace, their outdoor seating is convenient and well-staffed. The only thing that would improve it would be a view of something other than the parking lot. But hey, it is the suburbs. 

Mid-average pricing here, but ask for drink specials. I love their tacos and nachos. The serving sizes are quite large so be prepared to share. 

What I love most about this joint is the atmosphere. Even inside, you feel as if you&#39;re not in the suburbs. It&#39;s got that semi-dark atmosphere that makes it mysterious enough for evening outings, yet appropriate for an escape during the work day. Prefer for a professional lunch, too!"

Although there were 2 parties of 20 to 30 people in the upper area where we were placed, we had service perfect for our occasion - not rushed but not too slow. We had nachos and cornbread for appetizers - both full of flavor. Us girls split a caesar salad and fish fry - perfect for us after the warm up. The guys got bacon wrapped meatloaf and the foot long  beef brisket grilled cheese. Amazing food. Drinks were just great with a full beer and wine menu - including gluten free beer. We had cocktails that were mixed well. Dessert was the perfect finishing touch. Jimmy, our server, was very warm and attentive. Overall the meal was affordable and we had leftovers to look forward to. (well, not the meatloaf, it was devoured as it was served over mashed potatoes with onion straws on top.) This is our new great place to go! It was loud, but it was a Friday night. We just wish they opened up earlier on the weekend to watch Premier Soccer League.

They spent most of the time talking to each other about their  love lives and ignoring the customers.   I was super annoyed as a patron when I ask for a glass of water to accompany my dinner and get an eye roll.  Maybe the eye roll wasn&#39;t intended for me but either way very unprofessional.

I ordered the foot long grilled cheese. The sauteed mushrooms and tender braised short rib meat really made a classic American comfort food taste a little more sophisticated and unique. The fries came out lightly seasoned and crispy; very enjoyable. And no visit to Westwood is complete without a little banana cream pie. The homemade graham cracker crumbs are moist and chewy, they almost remind me of a soft brown sugar cookie. Throw in the homemade custard, whipped cream, caramel, and plenty of bananas...for six bucks? It&#39;s tough to find a better dessert value than that! 

Service was solid, they brought me some jalapeno aioli for the fries. Although I would have liked a to go container for it when I asked for the fries to go. I know I could have asked for it, but I didn&#39;t want to be too difficult. All in all, I had a very good experience."

I ordered a roll of their sushi and their salad.  The sushi roll was pretty bad.  I didn&#39;t really wanted to finish it.  I wish I remembered what kind of sushi it was, but the fish wasn&#39;t very good and neither was the rice.  Their salad was amazing though.  It was large enough to be a meal (which I was scared I would still be hungry).  The salad had cranberries, pecans, and a cranberry vinaigrette. YUMMY!  My dad had their corn bread appetizer and their meatloaf.  The corn bread tasted too sweet and had a weird texture.  I didn&#39;t care for it.  The meatloaf was pretty salty since it was wrapped in bacon and had friend onions garnished on top.

You can&#39;t go wrong with the Mexican roll and any of the burgers, though the Chicago burger is my personal favorite. The beer menu could be a little more robust, hence my 4/5 stars, but overall Westwood is a solid option in the NW burbs."

It&#39;s very spacious, and even when it looks like it&#39;s mobbed, it&#39;s really not. (Keep in mind I&#39;m a big guy, seating is most important for my comfort). You will get seated right away, you might have to walk a bit from the parking lot, but it is worth it. I am not one for waiting, EVER. The seating is too notch. I come here if I want a classy atmosphere, good bar, and great food. Upstairs they even have a lounge area with recliners and flat screens in front of the leather recliners. You can eat in the recliners to if you wish to. The food is spectacular. All your typical American food with some extras like bacon wrapped meatloaf which is terrific. They have very good quality sushi too! Try the Spicy Tuna Osaka Style. It&#39;s very good. I will admit, sometimes you can get a server that is slow or having a bad night, but that can happen everywhere. Sometimes a server can be rude too. When it does happen I have said something to management and they take care of me better than anywhere I&#39;ve experience a complaint at. This place to me, one ups any bar/restaurant in the area for quality, style, comfort, and affordability. Their prices are extremely fair for this type of ambiance and quality. If I could, I would be coming here every day, twice a day!"

The staff is always polite, friendly and accommodating.  I&#39;ve gone with just one other person and also for parties.  

Not much about the menu really interests me, but the skirt steak arrachera (?)  is really good.  Not offered on the weekends/Sunday though. 

Otherwise, my go-to choice is the southwestern salad, and they&#39;ve let me pick a different dressing for it. 

Also, awesome place to watch soccer matches, as well as other sports.  One time we watched international little league :D"

When I went I had one person with me, and we did enjoy it, but not as much as we would have if we had more people with us. We weren&#39;t exactly in an upbeat mood so the atmosphere didn&#39;t really fit with us at that time. However the food and service was really good and I would definitely come back again.

It was The Best .. But a few new bars have opened so they&#39;re getting a little bit competition... One thing that&#39;s good for them not for customers is they are always full on most nights.. Love their drinks and food too.. Good enough variety for vegetarians to choose from too"

The times that I have been here, there have always been some kind of game on, the last time being this weekend, it was Preakness/the end of a pathetic game 2 of the Western Conf. Stanley Cup semi-finals.  But I digress...

I&#39;ve always been able to find something to eat here. but I tend to linger towards the fish tacos(for what it is, it&#39;s actually pretty filling) the fish and chips(standard pub fare)and the sushi.  I know, sushi at this place?  How can it be that good?  It&#39;s actually not bad.  Fresh ingredients, pretty standard rolls, I&#39;m telling you, a tight wrap with good rice goes a long way.  

The menu is two-sided, with one side dedicated to the items with ABV% and the other half to food.  But there&#39;s something for every taste as far as food goes flatbreads, apps, burgers, there&#39;s even a fish option if you&#39;re so inclined.  My latest discovery at Westwood was the Tavern Chopped Salad.  Yum-O.  I wish it was chopped romaine, but I&#39;m fine with iceberg.  Topped with sliced avocado, hard boiled egg, chicken, BACON and bleu cheese and tossed with ranch dressing, I thought it was plenty big for one to tackle, and probably the right size for splitting.  I had to really dig deep to down this dish(omg, I didn&#39;t mean to alliterate that LOL) since I wasn&#39;t going to be able to store my leftovers soon enough and with the summer-like temps we had this weekend, I wasn&#39;t chancing it.  I killed it.  

My wife had the sweet chili salmon with the sautéed green beans, holy schnikes, the green beans were so good, I wish they were offered as their own side dish.  Sautéed with garlic and tomatoes and who knows what else, I ate the rest of her plate after I finished my salad.  

Like I said, I&#39;ve always liked the food here, and we&#39;ve always had good service, whether dining with just my wife or with a 20 person dinner party, service is always tip-top.

Haven&#39;t had a chance to eat on the patio, for some reason it&#39;s always freezing cold or burning hot when we come here.  

For a solid meal and a beer while you catch the game, Westwood delivers the goods!"
westwood-tavern-schaumburg-3,Sarah S.,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,3545,44,Proa2Wdv47yLutbUOuBtbg,5.0,2014-03-31,"I&#39;ve been to Westwood more times than I can count for drinks, many times for food (they randomly have sushi), and a few months ago I had my company&#39;s holiday party. 

Every year, I plan the company party and this year I knew I wanted to hire a casino company to come in. I then had to find a venue that had a nice bar package (we&#39;re a company full of social drinkers), good food and would allow us bring the casino company in. Enter the hidden gem to hold parties: Westwood. I had no idea they had a basement that was huge where people hold company parties, weddings and other events. Not only that but it&#39;s an AWESOME space. 

Westwood was so great in the planning process helping me with the food &amp; drink options and ensuring all was secured for the night of the party. They let me come in 2 hours before the event started to get everything ready. Much to my surprise the place looked beyond fantastic! It was the holidays and they had a couple of beautifully decorated Christmas trees, red tablecloths and very nice place settings along with centerpieces. I had bought poinsettias for all the tables but really they were not at all necessary as they had such nice centerpieces. Our initial bartender I introduced myself to was meh and I was pretty happy when i saw him roll out and another, much more friendly guy come in. They were really good about taking care of us the whole night though they did put a tip jar out. I let all our employees know that we were covering the bartenders tips for the whole night when we signed at the end, so no need for the double dipping.

They had hookups for music and you can play either CDs or bring in an MP3 player to hookup. The sound was great plus their was a mic so I could do my thing. My thing being making annoucements &amp; such not singing. :D

We did a buffet for all of our employees for the night and everyone was really happy with the food selection &amp; how tasty it all was. 

We also had our own personal coat room &amp; bathrooms for the evening.

To boot, the pricing was incredibly reasonable. I believe that we had to meet a minimum of $1000 of food &amp; drinks, then the room rental was at no cost. We were way above that so it was perfect.

I know Westwood is good for meeting friends for drinks. I know it can be great for a casual bite to eat, too. But now I know what a great location it can be to hold events, as well. I highly recommend the Chicago Room in the basement to others and wouldn&#39;t hesitate holding another function there myself."

From the food to the atmosphere, this place is my favorite restaurant to go to.  My cousin brought me here my first weekend moving to the Chicago suburbs.  Now, I take all of my friends and family here when they visit! It&#39;s a great place to come and watch football, basketball and hockey or enjoy a lunch or dinner with some friends. 

They have booths for groups that have taps at your convenience!  This is great for bringing a group here to watch the big game.  The servers are always very friendly and are more than happy to get the tap started for you.  I&#39;ve never had a bad server at Westwood!  Calling ahead is no problem - and they are very accommodating. I&#39;ve tried almost everything at Westwood in my time of going here, however below is my Top Food List picks: 
 
My Go To: Tavern Burger w/ Fries &amp; Jalapeno Aoili
Appetizer: Margarita flat-bread w/prosciutto chips
Sushi: Green Dragon
Salad: Southwestern Buffalo Ranch
Sandwich: Grilled Cheese
Desert: Red Velvet Cheesecake"

He has been here before and suggested to get the foot long grilled cheese but said its not directly on the menu but they can make it. So when our server Alex (Alexandria) came to take our order my friend said &#34;Can i get the foot long grilled cheese, with just the 3 cheeses on it and bacon&#34; okay and soup and fires okay with that. He said hes and i asked for the same thing. When our food came we looked at our sandwichs and there was mushrooms and some type of brisket. When we asked our server what did she give us. She said &#34;thats what you ordered&#34;. We said &#34;no we said a grilled cheese with the 3 cheeses and just bacon&#34;. Then she informed us that they don&#39;t make that. We were confused because for 1. He got it before. And for 2. We specifically said &#34;just the 3 cheeses and bacon&#34;. She failed to understand what we wanted and failed to wite it down properly for the cooks to make it as we ordered. So it was her fault. 

Not to mention she messed up our drink orders giving me a diet coke when i asked for a coke and giving my friend a coke when he asked for a sprite. And then we had empty drinks for over 10 minutes. Which ruined our meal even more than the messed up sandwiches. She barley came to our table and was never around. And after we were noticeably done with our meals, ya know with our napkins on our plates and plates stacked up. We had to wait an additional 10 minutes for her to notice and bring us our bill. 

Needless to say i was very disappointed"

That said, we went for lunch and that vibe was not there.
Our server was nice, but not great with refills or checking in.
The food was okay, again, not memorable.
I ordered the Fish Tacos.  They come as &#34;build yourself&#34;.  The Fish was seasoned well, but overcooked which made it dry and not flake-able. The toppings that came with were gauac, tomatoes, onion and cilantro.  There was also a large helping of black beans and rice.  
My friend ordered a special with was Buffalo Chicken with Tots.  The chicken and sauce came all mixed in with the tots - like a casserole.  He thought it was good, but the tots were soggy from too much sauce.
All in all, okay, would go back in an evening setting for drinks and to try another selection of food."

It was a Thursday night, but not busy at all. Maybe 4 tables were taken. The interior is very modern with white cushioned booths and a mini bar area. 

The service seemed a bit slow and considering how not busy they were I would have expected quicker service. However this wouldn&#39;t change my mind about coming here again. The location is private but walkable from my place which is great!

Now, the food..... that was great! I ordered the Chopped Cobb Salad with no avocado. My only negative is I would have liked the tomatoes a bit more sliced (or Chopped up) but I enjoyed it nevertheless. My friend ordered breakfast for dinner (they serve breakfast ALL day which is awesome). He had two eggs, with shredded hashbrowns and two fluffy pancakes. He enjoyed all of it and would definitely eat here again. I, of course, had to try a little. I&#39;d have to say, I haven&#39;t had pancakes that good in such a long time!! Definitely recommend them!!!"

Yep, you guessed it.... Maria.  Not much has changed.  She still doesn&#39;t remember who ordered what.  She still stops by seldom and even after our bill was paid, she never managed to get all of our dishes picked up.  She&#39;d pick up a dish here and there but getting them all picked up at once was not in the cards apparently.  I give a star less due to my omelet being overdone.  (sigh).

Food was good but needed some seasoning. Quesadilla was amazing, salsa- I&#39;d jar and sell it! Calamari- good, but not great, sliced too thin and it makes it easy to over cook which was our case, however our 4 year old still enjoyed it. My ahi tuna wrap definitely was missing some salt as well as my hubby&#39;s hash-browns. Our server also forgot my husband&#39;s soup, but we didn&#39;t complain since we were pretty full because portions were very generous. I&#39;d give this place another shot."

The plus is, the food here is quite good with good flavors, portion sizes, and prices. The small negatives are that the open layout lends itself to potentially being noisy, plates could be cleared faster, menu layout could be improved, and the kitchen can get too busy at times. With that said, the strength of the food is enough to overcome these small issues.

The loaded fries here are delicious, a huge portion of crispy fries topped with cheese, green onion, sour cream, and bacon. Enough to make one full before they start a meal, even when sharing with several other people.

Linguine with garlic shrimp -- Generous portion of (6 large) shrimp with a delicious creamy sauce, asparagus, and sun dried tomatoes. The sauce was slightly thick for me but still delicious.

Not-your-mother&#39;s-mac &#39;n cheese with Andouille sausage: Nice bouncy texture on the pasta with melted Swiss, smoked gouda &amp; cheddar cheeses. Topped with baked parmesan bread crumbs. Not as salty as one would believe with 4 types of cheeses that work together well. The slight sear to make the andouille sausage crisp was a nice touch.

Classic benedict: Nice crisp hash browns and perfectly poached egg. I really enjoyed the hollandaise sauce which was smooth and creamy but not very salty so it did not distract from the other elements of the dish.

Cafe burger with truffle chips: Not bad, but nothing special for a burger. The truffle chips were a little on the soft side but had a flavorful seasoning.

Overall, the more unique menu and execution of dishes that&#39;s offered at Grove Kitchen is worth returning for although a few improvements to the customer experience to complement the food would easily get this restaurant many more 4 and 5 star reviews."

Stopped for breakfast the other day and was very disappointed. The coffee tasted horrible and they charge you $2.85 for it. I think they must use well water as it had that taste to it. I ordered 2 eggs with ham and fruit. The small bowl of fruit looked like it was days old. I didn&#39;t even want to try it. The eggs were tiny. When the waitress asked how things were i told her the coffee tasted horrible and the fruit looked spoiled. Her response was the owner buys very expensive coffee and she didn&#39;t know why the fruit looked like that. The total bill was just under $15.00. They did end up deducting the coffee.

Stay away from this place."

To our surprise and delight after hearing some negative buzz and seeing the emptiness of the place at 10am Saturday, this place was great.

As already mentioned, since place was maybe half occupied, we didn&#39;t have to wait and were seated promptly. They serve Intelligentsia coffee which is great. Our service overall was pretty good. Waters and coffees were refilled when necessary, food came out at an appropriate time, and our server was nice and friendly.

I got a skillet with chicken sausage, gruyere, and jalapenos ($10.5 skillets including 3 ingredients). The sausage was abundant. Everything tasted fresh. Over easy eggs were cooked to perfection. The only slightly iffy thing was that the hash browns could have been browned a bit more. Nonetheless, all was tasty. Pancakes were fine, but are better at other places mentioned. Some biscuits and gravy connoisseurs at the table said that theirs was a definite standout and may be one of the best that they have ever had. In particular, they noted the biscuits to be actual fresh flaky buttermilk biscuits. The rancheros benedict special was also a hit.

Overall, food was quite good and tasted much fresher than the Red Apple. I didn&#39;t feel as lethargic afterwards as I normally do at some of these other places. Service was pretty good. Place was spacious and open. Atmosphere was fine. Nice addition to P-town."

Was warmed welcome once walked in. Asked if seating was good for me for what they picked. Was immediately served bread and water. 

Saw that they had broccolli cheddar soup. I had to have to try it. It was very good. Not overwhelming cheese flavor and plenty bits of broccoli in each bite. Loved it.  Was only 4.50 for a huge bowl. Not going to complain at all! 

Next. I had pretzel bun burger ordered rare. It was perfectly cooked. Fries were delish as well. It did not taste prefrozen at all. It was all  for 10.00

Service was very perfect and atmosphere was mellow and laid backed. Relaxing night for a friday night. The waitress was awesome and friendly. Checking in on right times not when I had food in my mouth or hoovering around. Customers all were relaxed around me. 

Definitely a better food fare than Alemars."

Split the Santa Fe salad and veggie panini with sweet potato fries. Yum!! The fries were crispy waffles and the salad had just the right amount of kick. Returning to try the goat cheese and beet salad I had debating ordering. I love that this restaurant is so close to me!

This time it should be breakfast. It started off with me ordering a fresh orange juice. The waitress told me its not fresh squeezed anymore. Its out of a can. Well thanks, I&#39;ll stick to water then.... 
We ordered Smoked salmon Benedict and just simply 2 eggs over-easy with toast and hash-browns. I had to send the first eggs back, cause the eggwhite in there was still liquid, which was super gross. Since we were sitting outside I brought my  plate inside to the host, which was completely overwhelmed with me and the &#34;return&#34;. Luckily the bartender jumped in. She was very nice about it, smiled and said no problem. We&#39;ll take care of that. Couple minutes later another plate with a new egg arrived. A little better, but still not perfect over easy. How hard can that be, seriously!? 
The egg benedikt my husband ordered were ok, but the english muffin under it was either frozen before of just old. It was hard, not fluffy, just not good.
Too bad.... we&#39;ll not be back...."

I went for breakfast this time around. Restaurant was about a forth filled. Took awhile to have my order taken and to get my coffee. Order was simple, eggs over easy, bacon crisp, hashbrowns and wheat toast. Food took about 15 minutes to come out, which for the amount of people in the restaurant and how simple my order was, should not have taken that long. Food was not hot when it came out, like the serve forgot to pick it up so it jusy sat out. Eggs were over cooked, bacon was under cooked and the hashbrowns had no flavor. Plus not able to get a refill on coffee because my server was nowhere to be found untill my check was handed to me. 

Never again will I spead my time or money at this place."

Their pancakes are amazing, and they have really good homemade chips, and their soups are good as well.

This place has a better ambiance and higher quality food than a lot of &#34;high rated&#34; restaurants in palatine. Personally I think a lot of the other places are highly overrated. The Grove Kitchen is unique and enjoyable."

The first weekend in a long time with out the kids to enjoy breakfast together. We sat down and waited nearly 20 minutes before our waitress came to take our order. When she finally came back with our food about another 20 minutes had past...mind you they were not that busy. One of our orders was wrong. When we pointed out the error they offered to correct it...however my fiance was most of the way done before the manager came over. I suggested that I was not interested in getting my breakfast remade due to the fact we would both have eaten our breakfast alone. My request was ignored and they brought the new skillet back and it was wrong too. We then sat there for another 20 minutes with empty drinks and the waitress seemed at this point to be ignoring us. I was still waiting on the hot sauce I had requested. 

The manager did not charge us for the skillet boxed it up and insisted that we take it home. Yet it was still wrong. We both decided that the restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere...however it did not make up for the extremely poor service, inability to get an order right...and their ability to make a bad situation worse by charging us $12.50 for a skillet. 

If you are into over priced, poor service and being ignored....this may be the place for you.

Needless to say we will most likely never visit again.

I might try it again for lunch if Deb is working. Was jonesing for breakfast and re-routed myself from my initial choice, Billy&#39;s. (Well, at least now I know. Keep going down NW Highway.) I tend to like my eggs and bacon served hot not moderately warm and, my table un-sticky. Could just be me. The bus boy was polite and the waitress was friendly. Oh, and the music is horrible! Blaring pop-ish dance music is as intolerable as screaming children. However, the remodeling from its former Alemar&#39;s days is a favourable diversion from the same old, same old in the area."

Great outdoor dining service and food two weeks ago. Bad experience today for lunch. Today, fries were cold but ham and cheese sandwich was hot and delicious (even though the kitchen didn&#39;t add mustard instead of mayo as I requested) when it arrived and the server seemed to be missing steps in our dining experience today. We first sat, unnoticed, it seemed, for 7-8 minutes.  No water, no nothing. Server walks up and asks if we&#39;re ready to order. Well, by that time we were, considering all the time we&#39;d had to look at our menus! First thing we did was order...you guessed it...water.

Here&#39;s the deal: It&#39;s always clean and the bussing staff are top-notch, always on it. My struggle is that we dine here and it&#39;s pretty good.  Then we dine here and it&#39;s really not.  Yes, we keep coming back, I know, but when it&#39;s almost next door to our house and it&#39;s the only restaurant we can walk to, we can&#39;t help but hope our visit will be a good one, ya know? I sincerely hope they can get it together soon. We&#39;ll probably be back while the weather is still good to walk, but if traveling by car is an option we wouldn&#39;t think twice about driving right past Grove Kitchen to Deer Park and a chain restaurant."

Went in for lunch yesterday and I know why it took so long. The place is very nice.There were four of us. I had the mac and cheese. My wife had the soup and a patty melt. Everybody commented on how good the food was. The two guys that I met there for lunch said that they went when the place first opened and it was fair. They both said that the food and the service were much better this time. I never went to a newly opened restaurant that didn&#39;t have some &#34;just opened issues&#34;.

The staff could not remember the soup of the day, she didn&#39;t remember it for another two tables as well, so I kind of gave her a hint after I finished my soup of the day which could have come right out of a soup can.

The truffle chips, were potato chips with Parmesan cheese.  The adult grilled cheese didn&#39;t have any cheese.  Menu was pretty boring. Never did get the refill on the coffee

I am hoping that they can work out all the kinks management was on-hand and really seemed to be trying, but they really need a rewrite and a decorator.."

They only gave two settings and three water for 4 people.  They brought another setting but it was dirty and they had to replace it.  

The pancake (buttermilk) were to heavy one looked a little under done.  The poached eggs where over cooked with a lot of browning.  My son who will eat any type of fries did not eat more than one because they where over done.  

Hash brown where and the scrambled eggs where good.

The service was very slow our waiter took his time.  I had to wait 15 minutes to get the check.

What a disappointment, after looking at the menu prices I decided they must really do something special to charge prices at least 1/3 above comparable fare restaurants, that was the disappointment, they were no different and at best just average to slightly below average.  The decor was nice, a clean look but the look takes a back seat to the food and the food was as I said, average.  

Maybe they have some dish that is truly special, a signature entree but I wasn&#39;t made aware of it ... also, $2.50 for a cup of Intelligentsia Coffee is crazy, go to costco and buy starbucks Italian roast and I&#39;ll give you $2.50!

I hate to say this but they seem like one of the old greek run diners with everything mediocre, just warmed up prepared food from SYSCO.

I ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich with fries and cole slaw.  The roll the sandwich was on was not substantial enough to be able to hold the sandwich.  It was more like a large hot dog bun.  Consequently, I had to eat my sandwich with a knife and fork.  The cole slaw had no taste whatsoever.  None.  Salt and pepper helped the flavor, but not much.  The waitress stopped by the table a couple times (when she could tear herself away from her newspaper) but never removed the dirty dishes &#39;til she was ready to bring the bill.

She ordered an egg white omelette while I got the Seared Ahi Tuna Wrap. Both meals were good. The omelette was on par with any other breakfast restaurant and yes, it was slightly pricey, but they seem to use a lot of organic ingredients and cage-free eggs, which personally, I don&#39;t mind paying a dollar or two extra for. I was pleasantly surprised with my wrap, being that tuna can be a risk. It seemed fresh and the wasabi dressing they had with it was really good. 


As for appearance, I was a fan of the modern decor, my mom not so much. It seemed like something you&#39;d see at a trendy bar downtown, a little odd for this type of restaurant, but not bothersome. Our waiter was average... not super friendly but not un-friendly, either.

Overall based on my experience, I&#39;d come back here again. Plus, it&#39;s nice to have options in Palatine, especially since there aren&#39;t many sit down restaurants in that area of the town."

One ordered Not Your Mama&#39;s mac and cheese with the bacon and sausage - delicious and a huge portion that&#39;ll make a nice lunch tomorrow.  Creamy, crispy bacon and sausage.  Another ordered the chicken francese - lightly breaded chicken with a side of broccolini and mashed potates.  I had the grilled salmon with spinach.  I had asked to have broccolini in place of the rice, but got both - no worries even though they charged me for the extra vegetable.  My husband had the rice, so nothing went to waste.  The salmon was large enough so I&#39;ll have a nice treat tomorrow.  Huge salads came as part of our meal (not that common anymore, so that was a nice surprise).

Some of the bacon was freshly cooked (and tasty) but some had been sitting around for who knows how long (dry, hard -- why do they do this?).

The pancakes were &#34;rubbery&#34; and the service kinda slow, especially for a slow period.

The background music ruins what could otherwise be a promising dining experience. Good potential with a few tweaks."

I was just okay. Nothing special. The calamari was fair - tasted fresh, but was overcooked. I ordered the &#34;grove rueben&#34; sandwich, which was just so-so. It wasn&#39;t fresh like you&#39;d get at a deli, but since this isn&#39;t a deli it was as good as you&#39;d expect. The corned beef was a bit chewy though, and the rye bread (which I ordered toasted) was soggy on the side that was touching the plate. I didn&#39;t like that bc it made me think that the sandwich was not made to order. The sweet potato fries seemed fresh, but they weren&#39;t very flavorful. 

Anyhoo, the food wasn&#39;t horrible, but not great either, so I probably won&#39;t be going back there - not with so many other great restaurants in the area."

We were very pleasantly surprised at the quality of our dinners. I had the broiled trout special with a delicious asparagus yogurt sauce and fabulous grilled zucchini and carrots.

The atmosphere is appealing and we were excited to try the food.  We ordered the mini sliders for my daughter after reading the review on the Kraft mac and pizza - sliders were delicious and homemade.  Unlike the sliders, the burgers that two of the adults ordered were not - they appeared to be packaged burgers and cooked well done, despite asking for medium.  Sounded like the over cooked meat was happening at the two tables near us.  I received the wrong sandwich (Reuben) but that was correctly quickly with the right one. Average as far as sandwiches go.  

I was watching the manger floating around and he was spending more time at the bar area mingling with someone that we thought was maybe the owner instead of checking how tables were doing in the big open area.  Saw several servers running to correct orders with the kitchen and wondered if it was the servers not catching the wrong orders or the cooks not reading them right - however, frustrating for all.   

The server asked the Manager to visit us so we could talk to him about the burgers being overcooked and my wrong order - he took the defense and the first thing said tp me was &#39;it&#39;s day 3&#39;.  Disappointing to hear because I am a customer whether it&#39;s day 3 or day 28 - we know it&#39;s day 3, we&#39;ve watched the building being remolded for quite some time however; we are still a customer and could have been a return one.  

My take on their food - pre packaged and average.  Unless this place makes a change to the quality of their food - something more homemade vs packaged, not sure it&#39;s going to make it.  If trying to be more swanky than a diner in the end, the  product should represent that!"

There are just too many great places to experience for the same amount of money.  It&#39;s got a nice location, plenty of parking, lots of seating, but in my opinion (was there for lunch) the food was a maybe a step above going to Marianos and picking a sandwich up from their pre-mades in the deli case.....nothing special....but then again....are they trying to be?  It doesn&#39;t look like it.  The service was OK, some guy was rushing from the kitchen to take our order, but was quick....It&#39;s pretty much a basic place to get a quick bite to eat...but I&#39;ve gotten better trekking thru off beaten paths at mom and pop shops for less than half the price.  If you&#39;re going to charge a premium for some scrambled eggs and bacon, put a little more into it....but....they are paying a high rent or mortgage on a premium location on a corner like that, with some substantial overhead....I&#39;m thinking...short on the talent in the kitchen.  If you cook at home are a foodie or just appreciate and are knowledgeable of GOOD food...I&#39;m not sure you will be impressed.  3 out of 5 stars only because maybe once is not enough to rate."

My wife had the Chicken Francese and I had the Chicken Marsala.  Both were excellent.  The Francese had a nice light crust along with a light sauce, very tasty with a hint of lemon. 

My Marsala also was excellent.  A wonderful mushroom wine sauce, and you could taste the hint of wine  

Both meals were excellent.  They took long enough, maybe 15 minutes or so, to know they were made to order.  So many places today will serve a similarly named plate in 5 minutes. 

The before dinner bread plate was very taste, as were our dinner salads.  Attentive wait staff and the chef stopped by the table towards the end of meals to ask how everything was and answer a few of our questions.

On the way out, we asked for a menu to go so as to see the breakfast fare.  We will definitely be back."

First impression was very positive.  The work done inside was a significant improvement - open, airy, nice bar as you walk in.

I had a traditional breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash browns, etc.) while my wife had eggs benedict.  Both were great.  I ordered wheat toast and was served wheat pancakes.  They offered to bring me toast but I opted to try the pancakes instead.  I&#39;m glad I did because they were really good - wheat pancakes are difficult to do well in my experience.

Bottom line: we were both very pleased with the atmosphere, friendly service and excellent, high-quality food.  We will definitely return."

We have been here twice. Once right before Christmas, and another time a few weeks ago. 
It&#39;s a nice looking place, clean and modern. But, again, after taking years to renovate, they couldnt get a decent heating system? Going to the bathroom is like sitting your butt on an ice cube. Tables in the east side of the restaurant are cold too. 
Their coffee? Usually I am a three cup plus one to go person- I barely finished one cup. Bitter is a good way to describe it. 
The hash browns came out overcooked but my omelette was decent. 
The truffle chips? Would be decent if they actually put anything ON the chips. 
The prices are just TOO high for a neighborhood restaurant. And it would nice if the management/owners conversed with customers rather than sitting at the front booth all the time.
Probably won&#39;t revisit until I hear about a few tweaks to the building and the service."

Mac and cheese let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kraft mac and cheese for $5.00 kids menu kinda pricey from a box which  costs 79 cents.

My husbands beer came out fast which she told us she was surprised about because she said the bar was so slow. My son and I waited 15 minutes and had to remind her we were waiting for our drinks. Then the excuses started... There were no clean glasses she said. Which was clearly untrue when other tables were getting their drinks. The appetizer (flatbread) came out and was really good, about 5 minutes after the appetizer we received our drinks. The food came out next and my fries were ice cold and my sons Mac and cheese was
2 colors from sitting so long. We complained to who we assumed was the manager (tall blonde woman) she took my sons Mac and cheese and handed me a plate to put my fries on so they could be heated. This was shocking because I would expect new fries not just microwaved food. My sandwich was ok. My husband liked his soup although again the temperature was off. We had to ask other servers for refills. The family at a nearby table waited 45 min never got their drinks and got up and left.

First was dinner: Buffalo Chicken Wrap is made with Sriracha, not Buffalo sauce, and the Sriracha is in the ranch, not on the chicken.  Rueben sandwich had extremely tough corned beef, came out of the kitchen cold and soggy and they forgot the swiss! A rueben without swiss?  Kids pizza was over sauced and Kraft Mac n Cheese took the longest our of our 6 meals to come out of the kitchen. Fries were cold, but we did visit on the third day of business, and Tom the owner checked in on us several times.  We chalked this up to  &#39;the first week&#39; and vowed to come back.
Fast forward three weeks and we visited for breakfast.  Eggs were &#39;okay&#39;, not warm when they arrived at our table.  Hash browns tasted &#39;oily&#39; but were cooked to our asking of &#39;crispy&#39;. Overall, their breakfast menu is overpriced for the area.  Coffee is branded as Intelligesta, but at $2.95 for a cup of black coffee, even Starbucks is cheaper! 
We would love to see this restaurant do well, but the prices are a bit high for the area the kitchen could use some more training on the menu and parking lot could benefit from a redesign or expansion. 
Average Price per person: Breakfast $15, Lunch &amp; Dinner $15 without drinks.

Owner Tom, if you are reading this:  the restaurant is too NOISY!  invest in some sound absorbing tiles on the ceiling."

This place is facing an identity crisis; it can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s going to be a bistro or a diner.  As other reviews stated, the service is very hit or miss. Servers forget about the options with each dish (not that it matters because the kitchen will decide for you and by the time the food gets to you).  All three of our entrees tasted like they sat too long under the heating lights in that the rueben and burger were both on the dry side. My kid had pancakes, but had to wait even longer because server only brought 2 sets of silverware for 3 people. There is a bar in the front...why?! I disagree with other posters here that the food is very good. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s not bad, just not anything new (and there are plenty of options within a 3 mile radius of Dundee and Quentin for dinner). I always try every new restaurant and will keep an eye of the posts here to see if the reviews start trending better before returning."

It is very close to my house and I was greatly hoping for a good neighborhood eatery.  The place was gutted and completely redone inside.  I would compare it to a Chipotle style interior. Extremely contemporary all the way down to the glasses and plates. I sat at the bar and ordered a coffee ($2.50) and decided to get the &#34;Grove Ruben&#34; on marble rye with sweet potato waffle fries ($10).  The the whole thing was nothing special.  Fries were good and sandwich was average.  My problem with this place is that it appears they have taken more time worrying about the trendy interior than the actual food, which for the price is definitely not worth it ($16 for coffee and a Reuben after tip). It seems they want to put Inverness/ Barrington prices on a sub par restaurant in Palatine.  My guess is this place won&#39;t last that long unless they intend on upping the quality of the food or lowering the price of the food."

It takes time--sometimes lots of time.  That said, we called our first order in.  Arrived at the store about 30 minutes later.  

I heard the cashier tell the person in front of me that her order would be ready in about 20 minutes.  Hearing that, I thought, I should be in good shape.  I still had to wait about 10 minutes.  Got the chicken, took it home.

Chicken was delicious and crispy even though it was sitting in a bag for a while.  And, we got a surprise--a good one.  We had ordered two thighs, two drumsticks.  I noticed that the drumsticks were small--but then, instead of two drumsticks I had been given three!  Wow!  I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t happen very often, but lucky me.

The coleslaw was tasty--but we had ordered a medium and were given five little coleslaw cups.  I guess it equaled a medium, so I&#39;m not complaining.

By the way,Harold&#39;s has grape pop in cans.  I love grape pop and can&#39;t find it very often.

Yes, the service is discombulated, the wait is long, and maybe there&#39;s a free-form filling of your order.   However, Harold&#39;s does have the best chicken in the area.  I&#39;ll be back, but I&#39;ll be calling in my order.  

PS:  I had received a flyer that touted on-line ordering.  I asked about this and was told they were still trying to get it together.  Like I said, I&#39;ll be phoning in my order."

In my opinion, the service is horrible. This time, I attempted to call in my order, while driving home. I was put on hold, and left on hold for 12 minutes before hanging up. During the  time I was on hold, I could hear the individual who put me on hold having a conversation with a couple different people. After hanging up, I attempted to call back multiple times, but the line was busy. I arrived at Harold&#39;s about five minutes later. To my surprise, there was only two customers present. I, again, called and let the woman at the counter listen to the busy signal. She asked, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; I responded that it was the phone at the restaurant. I told her I had been put on hold and left there for 20 minutes. She picked up the cordless, looked at it, then nonchalantly commented, &#34;17 minutes.&#34; I asked her if she was familiar with this restaurant&#39;s service reviews. She responded, &#34;No.&#34; I asked her if she cared. She said, No.&#34; Shocked, I asked, &#34;So you don&#39;t care about having a job?&#34; Before she could respond, I asked asked if the management felt the same way?&#34; She responded, &#34;I make suggestions to the manager and they don&#39;t listen to me, so..&#34; I placed my order, purchasing seven wings. I asked her to wrap the bread separately, paid, then settled in for the typical 20-30 minute wait. To my surprise, my order was ready in about five minutes. When I arrived home a few minutes later, I discovered my toasted bread underneath my rock hard chicken wings. I tried to call the restaurant to complain but there was no answer. I tossed the meal, because it wasn&#39;t fit to eat. 

I have been a Harold&#39;s Fried Chicken customer almost 40 years, and have never experienced anything like described here. Harold&#39;s is known for cooking chicken to order, which obviously was not done in this instance. I must give this restaurant kudos for excellent chicken on my second visit, which was a vast improvement over my first visit. I have never before written a restuarant review, but the horrible attitude of the order taker on duty tonight (Saturday, May 28, 2016 at, 10:25 p.m., was troublesome and motivating. I&#39;ve been an employer for many years -- including being the owner a restaurant. I fired people like this one. I only regret that I don&#39;t have the power to terminate both the cook and clerk in this instance. I won&#39;t be returning to this Harold&#39;s, even though I reside about one minute away. I don&#39;t expect this establishment to remain in busy over the long haul."

I went in and ordered at there counter. The guy told me 20 minutes. I gave them an extra 10 minutes sincere ask the other reviews said they are a bit slow, which they are. You have to remember they makes each order ready to order. I don&#39;t think they use the same coming process as say a popeyes - pressure cooker thingy. 

THE FOOD:
The chicken were tasty in my opinion. Good amount of crispiness still after I got it home. The liver was awesome; better than Brown&#39;s chicken liver, their liver sometimes leaves me with cotton mouth. The okras were good too. They are bite sized version so it&#39;s not a whole okra fried but indivually cut and fried. Overall there food was good in my opinion. 

THE SERVICE:
They can use more people working which is probably why they haver so may order mistakes. They probably need a class in customer service. If they can get that right they will do well in that area. 

I&#39;ll give them another try for consideration."

You will just waste your time and money. So I ordered the 2 thigh combo with biscuit and fries. And hot sauce on the side. It took 40 mins to get my ordered. I was the only customer at this time. When I finally got my meal. I got a loaf of bread instead of a biscuit. And hot sauce all over my fries, chicken and bread. The menu clearly says biscuit,not a loaf of bread. The taste of the chicken is not as good as popeyes chicken. Good luck to whoever orders here."

They told me 10 minutes for Catfish and Dark and it took 20. Some people before me were waiting over 35 minutes. The lady also is not very into her job, more like she could care less about serving me.

Catfish and Dark  is 2 pieces of Catfish a Thigh and Drum. The menu makes it seem like you get 1 piece of catfish and 1 piece of dark.  Menu needs clarification.

Price was 11.99 for Catfish and Dark with fries and bread.

Catfish - pretty good crunch to the crust, decently flavorful crust, good fish flavor but fell apart a bit too easily with a fork. You have to eat it with your hands.

Thigh - juicy crunch chicken but flavor is lacking. I prefer the flavor of Popeyes to this but the crunch is a bit better.

Drum - same deal as the thigh.

Fries - think steak fries but smaller, very powdery, not good at all I threw most of them out.

Bread- not sure why the bread is there, it&#39;s kinda just useless. It&#39;s just a slice of white bread.

Mild sauce - it&#39;s not hot, it&#39;s more of a sweet sauce, decent.

Hot sauce - it&#39;s a vinegar based hot sauce, decently hot but not super hot but the vinegar is something that turns me off greatly."

I got my son the chicken strips meal, it had three chicken fingers and fries for $5. It was an excellent value. The chicken strips were huge and juicy and nicely battered. I&#39;m really glad I tried it for my son. Much better than the Village for a kid because of the freshness and size of the white meat and the  less crunchy batter of the chicken. The fries were just fine, a bit soggy and without any salt. He doesn&#39;t care for fries that much and the chicken filled him up, so in this case it was fine, but I may skip them if I ordered at the store. I also appreciated the excitement the staff had for their chicken and the packaging of my chicken. It was much nicer than the plates everyone else just gives out. Lastly, the chicken does take some time, but I watched it get dropped as I ordered it so it is nice that it&#39;s made to order. 
The chicken was good enough to warrant another try at their store, and per the reviews, I shouldn&#39;t do it in a night I&#39;m in a hurry."

I am no chicken expert, but i dont think even the biggest thigh takes that long to fry. The hot sauce is basically dollar store Louisiana hot sauce. Fries are frozen.  Service is apathetic. If it wasn&#39;t for the coupon i used,  i would never have tried to find it in this ridiculous strip mall it&#39;s in.

  Prediction: this place is out of business in 9-12 months.  

Tell the kid behind the counter to use the belt,  pick up his pants and stop licking his fingers when handing out cups. 

Advice : pay people to run the place that look like care about the customers&#39; time .

If you go in knowing that--I think the rest is gravy.  All the food is cooked to order---I&#39;m thinking a bunch of folks have complained and in front of the register there&#39;s now a sign that says expect to wait at least 15 minutes.

Like most, excited to have a Harold&#39;s in my hood.  Called to place my order and the guy taking my order was actually very pleasant.  He told me 25 mins (16 pieces, okra, fries, liver).  I was busy running errands and actually got there 35 mins after---my order wasn&#39;t ready yet, but within 5 minutes everything was packed and I was off.

So mental note--call first and tack on 10-15mins to whatever time they say.  The place is definitely on the small side so looks like more of a take out kind of place as most other locations are, but some seats are available if you want to hangout there a further smell like fried things.  

Liver was excellent, seasoning on not bad either, mild sauce pretty good--a little on the vinegary side.  Okra encapsulated in breading was nothing exciting, fries not that exciting either---but I suppose if you douse in sauce it makes it not so bad.  They&#39;re known for their chicken so really can&#39;t see anything else being that exciting and that&#39;s ok--because there are other places for other food if I want something else.  My service overall was fine, nothing super good and nothing super bad.  I&#39;d go there again--but only if I call to order first."

Like a baby learning how to walk for the first time. I&#39;ve been waiting since last summer for this place to open and I had such high hopes. I think the high expectations so early in their business was harsh. Cost isn&#39;t an issue - sure it&#39;s more expensive than the other Harold&#39;s and similar businesses I&#39;ve frequented, but it&#39;s fair. It costs a lot to have a small business in Schaumburg! You gotta make money somehow. Just pretend you&#39;re buying it from Whole Foods so you&#39;re okay spending more than you think. But the quality of the food, in my own opinion and experience, is worth the price. I noticed reviews have pointed out low quality, but no I am not comparing this to Popeyes. It&#39;s much better. I love that the meat falls off the bone from the wings. My Harold&#39;s order has been the same since I met my husband 9 years ago - extra lemon pepper with mild sauce on the side. They did it just the way I&#39;ve always had it.

And the wait time improved! I had told myself to give them time. My first time, I had waited 45 minutes for a 2 piece. But today I was out in 15 minutes and my catfish &amp; wings combo, with a side of fried okra, and I were on our way home! I had asked for it to go thinking I was gonna be there for a while lol hopefully business stays like this!"

STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!

This place is not the real thing. The service, the food quality and the most important the RECIPE is not the same. It&#39;s basic run-of-the-mill fried chicken place, just double the cost. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a half a notch above a good Popeyes experience except it will run you double and almost triple the price. 

I had the fish combo, tilapia and wings. I didn&#39;t get tilapia and they forgot the wings. What I ended up with was a super salty and fishy catfish meal! Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I grew up on catfish, that&#39;s the only fish my father would fry and it was a special occasion believe it or not, when he was having a good week money-wise he would get is tilapia. I know good catfish and good catfish is something that Harold&#39;s (all the city locations) have proven they can do right, but this suburban imposter is merely that, an imposter with a barely tolerable imitation. 

This is not the real thing folks, this will not give you the real Harold&#39;s experience! It&#39;s like comparing Waukegan to Chicago, yea it can appear to be the same but one cannot truly be compared to the other if you honestly look at the bigger picture.

Anyway. I called and the complained and they said sorry but they couldn&#39;t do anything since 

their policy is: Buy At Your Own Risk

Btw it also took 35 minutes to get the wrong order and the fries are also NOT Harold fries

The space inside is nice, but this particular location is currently plagued by what seems like inexperienced management in addition to the usual opening issues that a new place has.

The menu by the register looks like a photograph of a different location&#39;s menu, blown up. Which, while cheap, would be OK if the menu items and prices were accurate. Unfortunately, they&#39;re not. The least they could do would be to update the pricing on the menu - heck, use a sharpie guys!

We ordered some chicken tenders, a mixed 4-piece with mild sauce, an order of fries and some fried okra. The chicken is all served on a handful of fries, on top of a piece of white bread. This does a good job of keeping the chicken crispy, but renders those fries inedible.

All of the food suffered from a lack of seasoning, the fries and okra were a little underdone, and most of the chicken was overcooked and dry. There were a few pieces, however, that were cooked better than the rest and those were delicious. The sauces (hot &amp; mild) are really a must have here, make sure to get one either on the chicken or on the side. The wings with sauce were the best thing on the plate.

I&#39;m hoping that the owner/management will correct some of these issues and I look forward to giving the place another shot. It could be a great chicken place for the Schaumburg / Hoffman Estates area."

Called my order in ahead of time, one 6 piece and one 4 piece. They told me 20 min but when I arrived I waited about another 15 or 20 min. The girl on the reigster wasn&#39;t too bad...just seemed uninterested in her job or the customers. Chicken was ok, not enough sauce, coleslaw was a &#34;NO&#34;, &amp; I&#39;ve had better fries out of the oven.

2nd time I went was HORRIBLE. Called my order in again, this time 18 wings and the girl on the phone asked when I&#39;d like to pick it up - I said 30 min. Now, most people with common sense would politely tell you if your order would take longer due to orders ahead of yours - this didn&#39;t happen. I got there 30 min later and waited in line for almost 10 min with 1 person waiting in line before me (he just walked out). So the funky attitude lady behind the counter asked me....wait she didn&#39;t ask me anything just had this ridiculous look on her face. I gave her my name and told her I was there to pickup my order I called in...this chick just walked away behind a curtain! Ummm hello? Did you not just hear me speak?? 

The place was full of people sitting or standing around with no food but pissed off looks on there faces. One lady who eventually got her order left only to come back 2 min later because her order was wrong. After waiting another 15 min I just left...needless to say no one ever told me anything about my order.

I don&#39;t know what kind of tom foolery is going on up in this place, but the excuse that you just opened is not acceptable. The long wait times for chicken are bad (you&#39;d think I was ordering duck), but the pissy attitudes and unprofessional of your &#34;front of the house staff&#34; is disgusting.

Definitely not the Harold&#39;s I grew up on and know. Been to all of the locations and they are ALL exceedingly above this one. Believe the other negative reviews because they&#39;re true. Seems like this is someone in the restaurant business that clearly shouldn&#39;t be. I will not be back...can fry my own chicken quicker and serve myself with a smile.

I wish I had read the reviews before I patronized this Harold&#39;s. The photos of the food doesnt even look good. I was excited to finally have a Harold&#39;s close to my home so I don&#39;t have to drive to the city. I placed my order online and I thought it was pretty easy and simple. The online site sent me a confirmation stating that my order will be ready in 20 minutes. I got there in thirty minutes and told the cashier that I&#39;m there to pick up my online order. She walked directly to the cooking area without saying anything to me and came back with the cook (im assuming that&#39;s who he was) He was polite and told me that  and they stated that they did not receive the order and that they will have it ready shortly. I did notice that he didn&#39;t say how long but I assumed it will take 15 minutes. I 

When I walked through the door I did notice that there were 7-8 individuals just sitting around. No one was eating something told me not to place my order when the man told me they never received my order. 

I came back 20 minutes later and the same individuals were still waiting. 10 minutes later 2 people canceled there order. One lady was waiting over 35 mins and one man had to get back to work. So he basically missed his lunch hour. 

The food

I order two chicken orders and a small order of gizzards.

The sauce does not taste like Harold&#39;s original sauce it has more of a ketchup flavor. 

The gizzards were fired soft and some of them were not fully coated. The ones that I ate were not seasoned. When I bit into one that did not feel full cooked and eating one gizzard that tasted more like a piece of liver. I was done!!!

The chicken was fried soft so there was barely any crunch to the chicken. The flavor is okay since I don&#39;t like to much seasoning on my food. The fries were barely done.

Needless to say I will not be going back."

This one is located in the same strip mall as Fox and Hound and right next to Richard walkers. Is this place just opened two weeks ago, it was extremely clean on the inside. The first thing that I noticed was that there was no bulletproof glass. If anyone has been to the other locations, you know what I mean. It is a large location with approximately 6 to 7 tables and a barstool area where you can eat. Did I mention how clean this place was?

I began to order my food and decided to go with the four piece so I can try each part of the chicken. I also asked for mild sauce on the half of it and hot sauce on the other half. The mild sauce is not as good as the other Harold&#39;s locations. It is far inferior to uncle Remus as well. The hot sauce on the other hand is great. Get the hot sauce. 

This place is definitely the black sheep of the neighborhood. Located in an upscale area, Harold&#39;s just does not fit it in. However I was super excited to see up there as I have not been to one due to the extreme locations of the others. This was supposed to be my savior. The crowd there is mixed. Black folks white folks yellow folks brown folk. Everything. While waiting for my food I noticed many people asking questions. Unfortunately the staff there is not trained properly yet.

The chicken: 

The breast had no bone in it. This confused me a bit. But I am glad to eat a piece of chicken with no bone in it. Unfortunately this breast was ridiculously dry. It was a struggle to even tear it apart. Not good. Through away 70% of it.

The leg was extremely crispy and flavorful. I generally hate the leg but this was tolerable.

The thigh. Generally my favorite piece of chicken. Unfortunately it was dry chewy and rubbery and lacked flavor. Not happy. I expect my thighs to be juicy.

The wing. This was by far the best piece of chicken. Let this be a lesson. Everyone should just stick with the wings. With hot sauce. That will definitely be my next meal there.

Overall the chicken was lacking something major that the other locations do great with. At each location I&#39;ve been to besides this one, you can see the seasoning in the chicken. On the meat. In the meat. All over. At this particular location i did not see ANY. This was greatly disappointing because I enjoy that thoroughly. Hopefully as time goes on they will figure this out.

The fries and bread were soggy but I do not think they were meant to be eaten.

The menu board price and the price is on the table are drastically different. So is the phone number. There is a sign on a piece of paper that says cash only. Hopefully that will change as well.

Yes. I will go again and give it a chance redeem itself. Perhaps I screwed up by forgetting my Mystic."

We ordered the 24 piece chicken with extra sauce and 8 piece mixed chicken and a side of fries. We called ahead and they told us the food would be ready in about 20-30 minutes but it was longer, probably closer to 45 minutes although there were other people there with about the same size order we had. They had space for dine in but it seemed that most people did carryout. The chicken was light, fell off the bone and flavorful, not greasy like Hooters. We enjoyed the food even though we didn&#39;t have the signature piece of bread with our order. 

My tips are:
Call ahead. You can find the menu online.
Bring cash... It&#39;s a cash only shop although they use an iPad so a simple attachment could change that.

The chicken is amazing and has a good taste to it, but doesn&#39;t taste fake and chewy like the Harolds Chickens I&#39;ve had downtown. It&#39;s real meat, finally!!

And the sauces are just enough, it&#39;s not drenched to cover the taste of the chicken, but it&#39;s perfectly there to add flavor. 

I love this location and love the staff and food! New regular chicken spot for me."

It&#39;s not always like that but it&#39;s a crap shoot on how it will be, just take the chance.  Aside from that it&#39;s the best fried chicken in town for sure, aside from Popeye&#39;s which is across town in Hanover for me.   Fried chicken is made to order hot, crunchy, n juicy inside, not sitting under a heat lamp drying out for the last 1/2 hour.  Thing I hate about Schaumburg is it&#39;s patrons... (maybe populated with aging folks or just flat out broke) ..quit being so cheap, diversify, open your palettes and support your local restaurants and keep this one going.

7 pc. chicken wings w/ hot sauce over wonder bread, and french fries.. boom!

If it looks busy and you have time, put your order in, walk over to fox n hounds and grab a beer for 30min come back and your order will be ready."

I waited for this location to open for months and it failed every expectation. It&#39;s too expensive for the wait time, poor service and mediocre food. The chicken was not good. The catfish was ok but it was small, I felt so ripped off for what I received. My first time going was during a &#34;soft opening&#34; in which I was told the menu was wrong and they charged me more than advertised, the wait was over an hour and my order was completely wrong. There were some &#34;managers&#34; who spoke with me and said they would throw in some extras but they must have forgotten. 

The second time is when I ordered the fish...wait wasn&#39;t as long but they didn&#39;t put my sauce on the side and my orders with mild sauce had barely anything on it. Two failed attempts, I will never go back."

Can&#39;t (and don&#39;t) believe any of the smack reviews people are posting about this particular Harold&#39;s; this restaurant continues to do right by me.

I ordered a perch and dark and had a couple people ahead of me.  It took 45 minutes to get my food which is just ridiculous. Nobody apologized for the wait, the people working didn&#39;t seem at all interested in much of anything.  They all came out of the kitchen at various points to greet someone and in the meantime a few of us customers hung around, waiting.  There were no smiles, no apologies for the delay (and I have no idea why there was a delay), no thanks for coming...no service at all.  

I finally got my food and was home in a few minutes.  I opened up my bag to see that they didn&#39;t include either of the hot sauces I was supposed to get.  The chicken pieces were small and mildly tasty.  The perch had a good flavor to it. The fries were average at best.

So essentially I paid a fairly high price and waited 45 minutes for average food, without everything I ordered, and with no one thanking me for coming, apologizing for the wait or even smiling.  None of that makes me want to come back..."

She asked them if they had opened a location in the suburbs and they asked her what was she talking about? She told them a location in Schaumburg opened up and that they were using their name or something very similar to their name. They told her that they are going to check into it. Looks like an imposter trying to profit off of Harold&#39;s Chicken Schack&#39;s name. So beware...

Tried eating there about 3 weeks ago. Went on a Friday night around 8:30 PM. Place was full of customers waiting for their orders. 

I waited for about 15 minutes to place my order but no one seemed to want to fill it. For the most part nobody was working the register. Once a girl came out to take a couple orders ahead of me then disappeared behind a curtain I can only assume to go in the kitchen to help with the food. She came out another time to give a person their order but then quickly disappeared behind the curtain. After 15 minutes of this I left and went to KFC down the street. 

From the Yelp reviews I guess I made the right decision. Who knows when I would have been given my order if I was able to place one as there were about 30 people standing around with receipts in their hands and no food coming out of the kitchen. I won&#39;t be back unless the reviews improve on Yelp. I had high hopes for this place and hope they figure it out soon. If not they probably won&#39;t last in Schaumburg."

Popeyes alone is 10x better then this place when it comes to the price and service. Wouldn&#39;t recommend unless things change."

I scrounged Yelp reviews to see what the deal was and I don&#39;t think they do the place justice. I used to live in the city and the food here was exactly the same as the location I used to frequent in Rogers Park. Honestly the most important thing to me is that the chicken is crispy,  good quality, and fresh- and this met those standards. Plus- it&#39;s made to order which is the reason for the longer wait times. If you&#39;ve ever made fried chicken you know you can&#39;t do it right in less than 15 minutes so I would just prepare yourself for that. Plus their hot sauce is to die for- a little hot, a little sweet, mostly tangy, delicious! Not huge on their fries but that&#39;s not why I come. I&#39;ve tried calling a few times when they should be open and gotten no answer (after A LOT of tries) but when I&#39;ve gone in and gotten through the staff has been very nice.

When I received my order I noticed the sauce and the coleslaw were missing.  I was given a  small cup of slaw and told it was the large $1.80. (measured at home it is just under 1/2 cup) I asked are you sure - he said yes there are more lil ones inside each order (there wern&#39;t).  I drove home to find my order completely incorrect. So drove back to wait more for him to find order, had to ask him to please start my order over to speed it up.  I got 8 piece white chicken only , a 7 piece wing with fries (Forgot the bread too), and one large slaw it was $32 and some change and he said he had no change to give from 35 so I said - just add it to the tip jar.  90 minutes later I feel like I was ripped off more than once.

I purposely took a chance and ordered waaaay ahead of time just to see if their response time would be better than a few days ago when we first tried them out. Not only was the order not ready in had to wait an additional 30 minutes for my order. This is ridiculous for a total of eight chicken wings. Even if the order doesn&#39;t drop until you arrive this wait time is ridiculous. There was not a wait when I arrived so I do not understand this wait time.

When we informed the girl that we have been on hold all this time all she could say was that she just got there so it wasn&#39;t her who put us on hold. No I&#39;m sorry or anything. Once we asked to speak to a manager we were told that no one was there and that we can come back tomorrow to talk to someone. Why am I going to take time out of my day to drive back up there to talk to someone? Just give me a name so I can call and talk to someone. I had to tell them I could just call the BBB or she could go back there and find someone for me to talk to. The head cook finally came out to talk to me but no one seemed genuine about their apology. I finally got a name of a manager they said I could call the next day but when I called the next day I was told that the manager was not there and not coming in. Supposedly I spoke with the owner who didn&#39;t seem to know his workers names and when they work!! In the end I was offered a 10% discount on my next order. Does that even cover taxes?!

Several other times I have attempted to go, to be greeted by &#34;Closed for Routine Maintenance - Open again at Noon.&#34;  The couple of times I saw this sign, it was after Noon.  Once, after seeing this sign, I went back again at dinner time, and the sign changed to &#34;Closed to due System Upgrade.&#34;   I went last night, armed with cash (just in case), they were open, but after waiting in line to order, I was told they were out of certain pieces of chicken, so I could not order what I wanted.  Okay, I decided to change my order, but then they were out of coleslaw.  While I was waiting, several patrons were asking where there orders were, and when they got their orders they were wrong.

So obviously the lady that checked in on my order lied.  It was another 20 minutes before my order came out, 1 hour and 30 minutes from when I called it in. I was not the only one experiencing this kind of service. The place was crowded and they were obviously overwhelmed but this whole time they kept telling new customers their order would take 20-25 minutes. Based on people&#39;s overall demeanor, I suspect others with larger orders waited longer than I did. Multiple people walked out saying &#34;last time I come to this place&#34;. One guy left knowing he only got part of his order. This place cannot last but every day it stays open is a crime."

I realize commercials shouldn&#39;t always be trusted, but theirs did a good job of making their fish look real tasty. They also make it sound like a family restaurant, so I wanted to give it a try.
Well, it&#39;s less family restaurant and more fast food atmosphere. Actually, if I was to compare it to something, I&#39;d say the old-day (1980s) Browns Chicken. However, I was impressed by the food. The fish really does flake open like the tv ad, and the cheese poppers, which I got instead of the fries, were also good. 
The sweet tea was sweet enough to be sweet, but didn&#39;t overpower the tea taste. 
Saturday, the special is their custard pints (buy one, get one). Notice though, &#34;pint&#34;. I thought we were getting small individual cups. I had no idea how big they were. So we picked them up on the way out, after eating to keep them from melting. 

Pros:
-fish is good, fresh
-good selection of food (not just fish)
-lots of seating
-friendly employees 
-reasonable prices
-clean seating area (relatively)
-good parking

Cons:
-condiments are all Hintz (HFCS in everything)
-fast food atmosphere
-everything&#39;s fried
-It actually reminded me of a Southern Ponderosa or fish version of Browns Chicken (if anybody remembers them)."

Since being back on the chicken wagon, I stumbled upon the magic that is fried chicken at Culver&#39;s. 

I know chicken and these people know how to fry some! It&#39;s extremely juicy, well-seasoned, and perfectly crispy. I mean it&#39;s like home made! What I mean by that is that it doesn&#39;t have that &#34;manufactured&#34; perfect taste to it...it tastes like I made it...like my mom made it...know what I mean? You can get a 2-pc or 4-pc and it comes with a choice of two sides of either fries and coleslaw (my fav) or green beans and mashed potatoes.

You can eat here to cure a hangover with greasy cheeseburgers, enjoy some pot roast or grab a frozen custard sweet treat. I am a regular diner at Culver&#39;s throughout the area. I love their fried chicken, pot roast and pork tenderloin sandwich. I recommend the pork tenderloin sandwich with mustard and pickles only. They hand-bread this tenderloin which means be prepared for crumbs on your chest and lap if eating in the car. 

Their fries are always fresh, but ask for salt if you want there to be any on the fries, because it seems they do not salt their fries much, if at all. Ask for this at the window to expedite service. You may also ask for ketchup. Their cheese curds are also a fun side to any meal. It&#39;s a surprise mozzarella or cheddar bite every time and they are always served fresh. 

The pot roast is another one of my favs, but make sure to ask for extra gravy (on the side) because even though it&#39;s tender and pull apart-able with a fork, it can be a little bit on the dry side, but the gravy fixes this problem. It&#39;s seasoned well and with mashed taters and green beans, you are all set.

I&#39;m not supposed to eat ice cream or anything like it, but we went for ice cream this weekend. I tasted my boyfriend&#39;s cement mixer and it was very good. He chose the most random of toppings- kit kat and crunch, but it really worked!! Yumm-my!

The reason for lack of stars 4 and 5 is because I have ordered chicken sandwiches from here twice now and both times, the chicken was pink in the center....hence, I did not eat my entire dinner either of those visits. :(

Fairly quick drive thru service for a place that really does make a lot of their items fresh. They have very friendly employees.

The shrimp was crispy but the inside was not cooked the color of the shrimp was transparent w/c means it is not cooked through.On the other hand I have to say there were positive things like the fish and shrimp did not smell fishy,the buns were fresh  and good size,The coleslaw was acceptable.

Today, I got to the drive-through window, paid, and they handed me just the mixer and told me to go wait with the rest of the &#34;parking lot&#34; of customers whom I&#39;ve watched wait for their food for several minutes already. It&#39;s NINETY DEGREES OUT. That mixer will be a WARM PUDDLE before my food eventually gets to me. I handed it back and asked if they could bother keeping that cold until the rest of my food was ready. The same thing happened at an earlier trip, but at least I was inside and could use their ice cream freezer while I waited several minutes for the rest of my order. You&#39;re got speedy ice cream mixer folks? Great! But then keep the orders cold until the rest of the order is ready! Especially with the long wait times for food.

And even creating my meal from scratch, it shouldn&#39;t take over five minutes to drop some fries and grill two wafer-thin patties.As a drive-through, it&#39;s a failure. We were just lined up, parked, waiting for our food for a ridiculous amount of time for a drive-through.

Overall, I&#39;m a fan of eating here... once in awhile!"

I was &#34;that&#34; customer who made her answer 1,453 questions about the custard/toppings/combinations/what I could and could not get/what sizes.  But she was SO helpful and patient, and really knew her stuff!

I got the pumpkin pecan minus the pecans (yeah, that happened)...and the brownie blast one.  I thought the pumpkin one was like eating amazing pumpkin pie in spoon form.  My brownie one was good as well with huge chunks of brownie in there.  SO good.  And yes, I got two for myself.  It was that serious.

I didn&#39;t try their food yet, but I will when my daughter has her fundraising night for her school there next month and report back about that.

Tonight they have actual &#34;pumpkin pie&#34; as their special, and you bet your bippy that I am going there to get my custard on!!"

Food: Unless you are a vegan, vegetarian, diabetic, or in any way concerned about your health, what&#39;s not to like about Culver&#39;s? They offer a pretty spectacular array of items that you do and don&#39;t see at the competition. Feast your eyes on this crispy chicken sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ZNPbk3HBH-2JeOghsdXQ?select=OGvxO-eAVjBME3TtMoCZ8g). This thing was juicy and crunchy to the max. Fiber fans can enjoy the ever dazzling array of sides like green beans (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ZNPbk3HBH-2JeOghsdXQ?select=369X5x_1NPWf-2n-EwmEfw) and the fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ZNPbk3HBH-2JeOghsdXQ?select=1woFN2hlb1rUerdelRpFFQ). The beans may look healthy in the photo, but only because it&#39;s hard to see the tablespoon or more of melted butter. Absolutely delicious. They also have sandwiches (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ZNPbk3HBH-2JeOghsdXQ?select=ddp6OXNnBn-aMWupXSzhmQ) and butterburgers. I didn&#39;t get to try the latter, so I guess I&#39;ll just have to come back. Finally, their creamy, sweet frozen custard will knock your socks off. 

Atmosphere: Typical fast food interior reminiscent of a love child between a Norms and a Wendy&#39;s. They have a thing for the color blue. Also... how can I put this lightly? Expect to see many customers who could probably successfully enter the world of sumo wrestling. 

Service: Order at the counter. Everyone here bleeds friendliness. 

Synopsis: Yum but what with all the fried and buttered items this can&#39;t be healthy at all."

They have good food and a clean facility.  The employee&#39;s at this particular location are always very courteous and work to make certain you are satisfied.  

I&#39;ve tried about everything on their menu and most all of it is top quality for a fast food restaurant.  Their strawberry cheesecake cement mixer will make you feel like you&#39;ve died and gone to heaven if you&#39;re into strawberry&#39;s or cheesecake!

I usually order take out so I can&#39;t speak for dine-in but they are usually fast with my order 15 minutes or so. They do get pretty busy, whenever I go there is usually a line of people waiting to order (I order ahead to make it go by faster). They are a bit retro as they take orders by hand, they don&#39;t use computers and they only have one person taking the orders and processing credit cards at the register so here&#39;s where things might slow down a bit.

My steak burrito was hearty and hot. I could only half but the bright side is I have lunch for tomorrow!

Free chips and free refill on the horchata on dine in only. Their salsa is hot.

TIP: although they have table service, you still go pay up at the counter when you are done. When we got done, there was a rush of people so checking out took a while as we waited in line again after customers who were ordering."

My eating companion had the beef fajitas.  It took all my self-control not to scarf that dish down when she offered me a bite.

No review of a Mexican eater is complete with a comment on the chips:  Homemade served with a fresh chunky style salsa.  Plus two more salsas on the table.  All three were tasty!

However, I have had a few negative experiences which reflects my demotion. Overall the food is consistently great, thats not the issues. 

The negatives are:
1. I have found a piece of hair in my taco - not once, but twice. One was a short white hair. It made me lose my appetite after that incident.

2. I always call my order in ahead of time. If Dahlia and the regular woman running the cash register with her are not working, I am guaranteed to have my order wrong. I get the same thing EVERY time. I order 2 Taco Specials, steak. That means 2 dinners with 2 tacos. EVERY time she puts me down for 1 taco special (which has 2 tacos, rice, and beans). Even when I assure her i want 2 dinners, she can never get this correct. Pick up my order is never as easy when these two women are working. It gets extremely frustrating because I&#39;ve been there when they have messed up other customer orders.

The entire finding a hair in your taco has kind of left me scarred. This place was my weekly taco spot... but I&#39;m sadly inclined to look elsewhere."

This small restaurant is located in a small strip mall, it doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside, but they serve delicious food and have very reasonable prices.  When I walked in there was a large family having dinner with several young children, and several other diners also eating in.  

I placed my order at the counter and took a seat at one of the booths where I was promptly served fresh chips and salsa, they were good but the chips could have used a bit more seasoning and flavor. I had the Carne Asada which was served with a fresh side of guacamole, refried beans, rice, 2 small onion bulbs, a cheese tortilla and huge cut of churrasco - it was delicious.  Everything tasted so fresh and full of flavor. Since I had read several reviews recommending the tacos I also tried the pork and carne tacos, they were equally fresh and delicious.

At first I have to admit I was a bit concerned about the quality due to the unassuming location, however the reviews did not steer me wrong. As I enjoyed my delicious dinner I observed many people coming in to get orders to go, clearly a busy place even though it was a Monday night.  The service was very friendly and attentive, they kept coming around asking me if I needed anything and clearing plates.  I had a great experience and  highly recommend Los Burritos if you are in the area."

This place definitely falls into a similar price category as Chipotle and its REAL Mexican food. 

We have only order steak burritos from here so I&#39;m really only allowed to review on the burritos and the restaurant itself. 

I have driven past this place a million times and I still can&#39;t believe we JUST started going to this place. We walked in, not knowing what to expect. We each ordered the steak burrito and I got a side of rice. We took the food home to eat and thoroughly enjoyed every bite. 

We have been back a couple times since our first visit and the food has been fairly consistent. There sadly has been one time we brought them home and they were very greasy. I was not a fan. When we got toward the bottom of the burrito, it was a pool of grease. I get that these things can happen, but it was not just a little. It was a lot of grease. 

We will totally be back but it may be only for a four meal. We&#39;ll have to see!"

This time, though, totally different! First of all, for a fast casual Mexican restaurant, it took over 20 minutes to get our food (tacos-nothing too elaborate). Then my husbands horchata tasted strange like bleach. When he asked the cashier if he could switch to diet coke she literally sat there and argued with him!! Seriously?

This is a pretty small joint, there is definitely room to sit and eat or you can take it to go. They have a decent sized menu - I thought it was pretty comparable to most Mexican restaurants I have been to. Everything is very simple and self-explanatory. The first thing I noticed - this place is dirt cheap. Awesome! I ordered 3 tacos and a horchata for $8. I&#39;ll take it! Not to mention free chips and salsa. You definitely get your money&#39;s worth here and then some!

I absolutely needed to get a horchata, because you can&#39;t get real horchata anywhere else! It was exactly how I had pictured it! The tacos were very filling - just the right size and right amount of filling. I thought the meat was seasoned perfectly - I got steak and chicken tacos. My friends were ravings about the chorizo and burritos as well.

We all finished everything on our plates - so it must be pretty good! I would definitely come back."

They have really, really good food for prices that aren&#39;t ridiculous.  This ain&#39;t your normal taco bell, here, people.  Honestly, it&#39;s probably cheaper than TB, but I digress.

My friend picked this up for us one night on her way over.  She said it took FOR.EV.ER to get the food, and it wasn&#39;t that busy.  That&#39;s a double-edged sword.  Because on the one hand, if you&#39;re just there on your lunch break for a quick meal, it might not be as quick as you need it to be.  However, it&#39;s easy to see how freshly the food is prepared--I would rather have that than something that isn&#39;t as fresh and sloppily put together.

I ordered a taco salad and a torta with the breaded steak.  The torta was ok--it served its purpose, but I really enjoyed the taco salad.  Everything was so fresh and well done.  The shell that it came in was really great--it was flaky but not greasy and it held all of the ingredients in well.

I also tasted my friend&#39;s chicken taco, and it was SO good.  The chicken was even better than you would expect.  It was like pulled chicken.  YUM!

I will definitely be back over and over :)"

Back when I used to be dropped from the night shift early (around 11pm/12 am), I would sometimes swing by here on the way home. It&#39;s as genuine as Mexican food as you can get; makes me feel ashamed that I used to go to the Taco Bell close by. I had no idea this place was open so late until I saw a bunch of cars out in front and all the lights were on.

Because of the late hours, there is a security guard at the door. But he doesn&#39;t bother me; if anything, I&#39;m comforted that the employer gives a hoot about safety in the area.

My staple has been the chicken burrito meal. It&#39;s not bursting with flavor, but it tastes homemade and is very filling. Oftentimes I just eat half and save the other for later. The horchata is very good, but it disturbed me a little when I watched it being ladled out of a dirty white industrial bucket stored in the fridge."

I did order a steak burrito there before and as another reviewer said, the burrito wasn&#39;t good the beans were way over-salted and the steak was too tough to chew.
I saw other comments on staff. I think they just want to take your order and do their job. Everyone there seemed calm and just doing their work.  

For the price you can go in and get some great tacos. Better stop there instead of Taco Bell. It will be money better spent for the value."

My rating is 4 stars but I really want to give it 3.75 stars because it doesn&#39;t quite hit the 4 for me. What puts it over the top though is it&#39;s a cheaper Mexican place that goes beyond what other Mexican places offer in the area.

PROs
- Good value for the food. The giant burritos are about the same as Chipotle size and only cost $6.06 including tax.
- The grilled steak giant burrito is a great fusion of flavors. My first bite into it brought a smile to my face, reminding me of all the awesome California Mexican food I&#39;ve had in my life. However, the taste doesn&#39;t really grow on you. It stays the same throughout.
- The free chips are for dine-in only but is a great sign that it&#39;s authentic.
- They&#39;re fairly fast. The next time I order, I will do it by phone, though it only took them 5 minutes to get the food out. It&#39;s not &#34;fast food&#34; but it&#39;s speedy in how they make it.
- The menu is simple, easy to understand.
- The service is fast, and they are very accommodating if you want to sit, dine in, or just take your order to go.

CONs
- The taste isn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had. It was good but not excellent. The burrito had a 60% meat to 20% rice/beans to 20% cheese ratio. I&#39;d prefer it balance out with a little less meat. But being my first time, I&#39;ll try asking for that next time.
- The place is very clean, but does have that odor of cleaners around. I&#39;d prefer not to smell that but at least it&#39;s clean :)

Overall, it&#39;s definitely worth the shot that everyone&#39;s raving about! Try it!"

muy sabroso! I don&#39;t speak a lot of spanish but I can say that the food was delicious. I didn&#39;t have high expectation for this small restaurant that I have driven by at least a 1000 times since I have lived in the suburbs. When you enter, you are greeted by a large menu over the order counter that has many tasty mexican specials from burritos to tortas to enchiladas. There are also  the more complete dinners. I ended up ordering a &#34;giant&#34; steak burrito and chips/salsa. The burrito itself by no means is giant, more like &#34;average size smaller than chiptole&#34;, but the beef is perfectly seasoned and tender. This made my taste buds dance! I was expecting to pay 2.xx for my chips and salsa, but I didn&#39;t realize that if you eat in, the chips are free. For 6 dollars, this was a worthwhile quick mexican meal. FYI just as &#34;Edward M.&#34; said you can sit down and wait for the waiter to come up with the menu as well.

Pro- fresh ingredients, flavorful steak burrito, free chips/salsa for dine-in orders, friendly service (they didn&#39;t even cheat me out of 2 dollars when I ordered the chips

Con- &#34;giant&#34; burrito really is a medium size burrito, check out my picture if you don&#39;t believe me

Hidden deal- check out the lunch specials torta, fries, and drink for 6 dollars"

I must say I was disappointed.  The meat inside the burrito was on the cold side and it tasted greasy and quite strong, like if it had been sitting around for a few hours.

I had to throw out the salsa, not because it was hot, but because of the flavor.

The service was nothing to write home about.

Living in Streamwood, you get your choice of authentic Mexican restaurants because of the large hispanic population. I had heard about this particular chain from a friend of mine a LONG LONG time ago, when my family first moved into the area.

After reading the Yelps, I had to try it.  So, today was the day!   The storefront is unassuming and a part of a small strip mall where a Giordano&#39;s also resides.  When you go in, there is a counter and several booths and tables.  On the walls, Mexican decorations such as wooden statuettes and even a large Aztec/Mayan wooden carving hangs high on the wall.

The selection of Mexican Foods ranged from your typical tacos and burritos to tortas and even menudo.

So, much to try, so much I can eat in one sitting....*sigh* I went straight for their burritos, but you&#39;re looking at a taco loving gal, so, I got an order of those as well. Since I was in for lunch, I got the GIANT BURRITO SPECIAL, which including a 20oz drink.  I got the grilled steak, grilled chicken burritos, and ground beef tacos.

The service was prompt and friendly. I was in and out of there in no time! They asked if I wanted sauce and I said &#34;Yes&#34;.  They gave me three sauces or rather salsas in varying degrees of  heat. Mild, Medium (Salsa Verde), and Hot (a picante style salsa with a kick!)

So, first I split the two burritos so my husband and I could sample both the grilled steak and the grilled chicken.  I went for the Grilled Steak first and it definitely ain&#39;t your Momma&#39;s Chipotle type burrito.  The taste was authentic and flavorful.  The texture of the grilled steak reminded me of a philly cheesesteak. It was very yummy!

Now to taste the chicken, while also good, it lacked some flavor, nothing some salsa couldn&#39;t kick up a notch. :)  I also tried out the ground beef tacos and it was about as yummy as the grilled steak burritos.  The ground beef seasoning was nothing like I&#39;d ever tasted in a Mexican taco, but it reminded me more of Indian spices rather than Mexican. It made the taco even more enjoyable and exotic.

Suffice to say, I did not finish all of my GIANT burrito, so, I ended up putting the chicken burrito half in the fridge for later consumption.  Be sure to bring your appetite when you go to Los Burritos Tapatios because you will not be disappointed.

Overall, I would definitely come back to sample their more unconventional meats like the lengua (beef tongue) or even the non-meat chile relleno...chile rellenoito? :)  

I like how they are open very late so, if I should get an attack of the munchies late at night.  

Los Burritos Tapatios is there to satisfy my appetite for Mexican food."

This particular Los Burritos is fairly small with a few tables to eat at, but that seems to be a more popular place late at night and with customers carrying out orders.

Los Burritos Tapatios has a diverse menu of Mexican dishes, these includes Burritos, Taco&#39;s, Torta&#39;s and even breakfast dishes such as Huevos con chorizo.

As far as the food I receive, it&#39;s always excellent, giant and flavorful burritos with soft cheese, and nicely grilled meat, bean dip and lettuce. Tortas with a mountain of flavor not only in the cheese, meat, and lettuce, but in the bread as well. I recommend trying the chicken variations of their primary entrees as the chicken is delicious.

If you go in to sit down and eat, chips and salsa are provided. The quality of both the chips and the salsa are excellent and are a perfect compliment to their primary food items. 

The food at this particular Los Burritos Tapatios is slightly different than what&#39;s been found at the Glen Ellyn location which I&#39;ve reviewed previously. The salsa is a little hotter, the way the meat is prepared seems a little different leaving it with a slightly different texture. It is however every bit as good as the previously reviewed Glen Ellyn location. 

For breakfast, lunch or dinner this is a great place to stop."

Anyways, they have a variety of different food on the menu but we&#39;ve only tried the tacos, burritos and enchiladas.  Everything so far has been fantastic! You can eat in or order to go, give yourself at least 20 minutes if ordering to go since they&#39;re always packed when I&#39;m there.  The rice and beans are great along with the chips and salsa.  They have glass bottle coke and jarritos.  And if you eat at the place you get unlimited chips and salsa.

When I got home, my order was wrong-and I&#39;m sure their menu said giant burrito, but it was more like a wrap with burnt meat in it. My other order was made with chicken, when I ordered steak. I called to advise them that not only did they biff my order, but their food was inedible. I was yelled at over the phone that they didn&#39;t make this mistake and they refuse to take back their garbage food and refused to refund my money. I will never be back to this disgusting place.

The steak is perfectly seasoned, and the burrito filling is well-balanced, not too much of one ingredient.  I&#39;ve eaten here at least twice a month in the last year and a half, and only once was I disappointed in the food.

Because my lunch break isn&#39;t long, I usually call in my order so that I don&#39;t have to wait for them to make it at the restaurant since it can take almost 10 minutes, which is ten minutes I could be savoring the food.

When you walk in you could immediately tell that it was a family owned place and they made a lot of their items from scratch. Outside of the food they offer for lunch, they also sell various pastas and meats/cheeses to cook at home. 

I&#39;ve tried both the sandwiches and pastas, both of which were very good. I got the Buon Appetito sandwich, which like your classic Italian sub. The meat had great bold flavors and the bread was really good too. They also offer a create your own pasta option. I chose the gnocchi with vodka sauce. You could tell it was fresh pasta and the vodka sauce had that great creaminess with the tomato flavor. 

My only complaint would be the portion size of the pasta, especially for the price. I could literally count how many gnocchi pieces were on the plate. I understand its homemade and higher quality, but I also want to feel satisfied and not still hungry when I go back to work. 

I usually pay cash since one time they said the only credit card they accept is American Express. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s still the case.

You get a lot of food for your money, and since it&#39;s not a chain, the prices are higher than Subway or Jimmy John&#39;s.  I could only eat half my sandwich and had to save the rest for later.  The ingredients were fresh and the sandwiches were prepared after you ordered.

And the portion size makes it one of the best deals around.  I usually eat half right away and then then other half a few hours later.
Another winner at Frantonio&#39;s is their cannoli.  They are filled to order, making them the ideal texture.  The filling is nice and light with just enough sweetness to satisfy your sweet tooth.

I was disappointed.  We tried the delizioso (wrongly named), and the equivalent of an Italian sub - neither of which had much flavor.  The Caesar salad was good.  The bread was good, and the service was good, but our expectations proved to be more than the reality of the product.  
We will visit here again next time we visit Rainbow Records next door.  And, next time, we will try the pasta.  Hopefully, we will see the magic that my fellow Yelpers see in this place."

Be sure and sample the huge collections of fun sides. Our last visit we ordered the roasted artichoke hearts--so good."

My boyfriend had a prosciutto sandwich, which he also like a lot. (Full disclosure: he liked it because it didn&#39;t have too much prosciutto but had lots of mozzarella). 

As the name implies, it also has a deli, and all of their homemade pasta and sauce are also for sale frozen.

The sandwich I ordered at Frantonio&#39;s was good, but sub par compared to other local sandwich places like Algonquin Sub Shop or Capri Deli in Palatine.  It was dry, and the bread didn&#39;t seem very fresh.

I went to Frantonio&#39;s for a working lunch, and I just about lost my mind from the music.  When I walked in, they were playing Christmas music (it&#39;s the middle of February!), then they switched to a track about some guy missing his dead mother (depressing!), then they switched to a track with the Chipmunks singing along (annoying!).

I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to trying Frantonio&#39;s again.  I don&#39;t like judging a place based on one visit.  However, I don&#39;t see it gaining 5 stars in my book."

They deliver a very good Depression dog with hand cut fries that ACTUALLY look like they were cut from potatoes!  (None of the crappy food service fries that so many Greek fast food joints serve with their hot dogs.). Folks complain that the dogs at Gina&#39;s are skinny.  Yeah, they are probably Vienna 10&#39;s but make no mistake these ARE Vienna all beef wieners.  The only reason they don&#39;t rate 5 stars is due to the lack of a poppyseed bun.

The dogs, while priced well with fries are tiny!  Even my son said that there is no way its a Vienna beef dog!  Vienna should come in and make them take down the signs.  The prep area with condiments sitting on a prep table reminded me of a similar setup at many kids soccer events run by parents.(Not a good sign).

My son got two chilli dogs and a chili cheese dog will set you back about $4 here.  Again, skimpy dog and canned(?) chili: just not worth it.

The bun was soggy, squeezed around this pathetic hot dog. The ONLY flavor is the neon dyed sweet relish. I requesed no onions, which was honored. There was nothing!!! No tomatoes...no pickle. But there were peppers!! Boy were there peppers! I love these spicy little sport peppers but literally...REALLY PEOPLE, they were fatter than the hot dog! (No joke).

I ordered a single dog, chicago style (of course), comes with fries, and a pizza puff and medium drink.  The dog was good.  I don&#39;t think it was a Vienna Beef dog, there is a Vienna Beef sign there, but, it was an all beef dog.  Vienna Beef dogs are usually a little thicker.  Good nonetheless.  I should have asked to have it grilled, they come boiled, and who doesn&#39;t like a little char on their dog?  The fries are fresh cut, and they taste good.  They don&#39;t have dirty/unclean oil, they don&#39;t leave the fries out for long (because they have a steady flow of customers), they don&#39;t over salt them, not that it&#39;s possible to oversalt fresh cut fries.  The pizza puff was good (someone mentioned that you have to try it), but just your run of the mill frozen pizza puff, again, still good.  They have Coke products.

All of this was about eight and a half bucks.  Here is why I rounded down: I asked for a refill on my way out the door, and she said &#34;we charge for that,&#34; I shrugged, asked &#34;how much?&#34; she said &#34;a dollar&#34;...  A dollar for a refill on a fountain drink?  No thanks!  Consider the fact that the first drink only cost them about fifteen cents, and they want another dollar?  Aaaaaaand they only take CASH.

Anywho, when I go back next time, I will try the beef, and see how that is, and report back."

Well......I was not impressed.  The hot dog was okay, the bun was soggy. The fries were cold. They sat in a metal pan and were scooped over the hot dog. Then warm fries were poured into the same pan with the cold ones.

I thought I would try a pizza puff.  It was overdone....too much fry time....

Threw half the hot dog in the garbage along with the pizza puff. I decided to drive down to River Road and Oakton in Des Plaines and stopped by Paradise Pup.  What a nice difference.

Ordered two dogs with everything to go. These came with mustard, onions, relish, + sport peppers along with some hand cut fries. A little over $5 for this order.
The dogs were very tasty and so were the fries. Two thumbs up from this guy.

In the greater Chicago area, we are most fortunate to have some great Hot Dog joints scattered all around. (Gene + Jude&#39;s, Jimmy&#39;s, Nana&#39;s, etc., etc.)  Gina&#39;s fits right in. Good dogs, and definitely a &#34;joint&#34; as it should be.

Hot Dogs, like pizza are quite subjective as to some people having very strong opinions as to which place is &#34;the best&#34;. Not me, I don&#39;t have a favorite because there are many great places and I enjoy them all. (Most of them.)

As an aside: The lady at the counter was really nice to me, so I don&#39;t get the other reviews complaining about her unless it was a different person.
Also, the hours listed here are incorrect. I stopped in a little past 8:00PM.

As I had past Gina&#39;s many times I just had to give them a try and now I found a real good restaurant that I will go out of my way to visit!  Also, their prices are reasonable for the size of sandwich, I believe the price is worth it because their sandwiches, hot dogs and fries are so good!

Hot dogs are cooked perfectly with a great snap, and fresh toppings.  The fresh cut fries are delicious and ALMOST as good as Gene and Jude&#39;s. I do wish they included more fries. I had a double dog w/ fries, and I was still a little hungry.

They also have italian beef, Italian ice (yes, people were ordering it in winter, so it must be good), malts and other Chicago style sides.

The staff seems to be nice, and get through the crowds well. Lots of regulars in here. Decent amount of seating for a small hot dog joint too.

Just off of Irving Park road in Bensenville sits Gina&#39;s Hot Dogs and Beef. Despite having been nearby this eatery many times, I&#39;ve never actually visited before as I was unaware it was hiding right on the other side of route 83.

When pulling in to Gina&#39;s I noticed it&#39;s a small place that was at one point likely a house. There&#39;s a few parking spots around the perimeter of the building to park at. As I walked around to the door I took a look inside. There&#39;s a TV and a few seats, the inside is very small. Once I walked in I got in line and soon had placed my order. 

In visiting Gina&#39;s I decided to go for the hot dog with everything. The hot dog I received came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. There was no pickle, tomato or noticeable celery salt on this hot dog. The application of the mustard, onions and seemingly made on the premises relish was spot on. The sausage itself was a skinned natural casing dog, it was well heated and had a nice snap. Finally there was the sport pepper which added just the right amount of spice and zest. Overall this was a very good hot dog, it had a nice combination of flavors that complimented one another nicely.

The hot dog was also wrapped and surrounded with fresh cut fries.The fries were pretty good for fresh cut style fries. They were not too greasy and had good potato flavor on the inside. While fresh cut fries are not a favorite of mine, these were an example of fresh cut fries done well, so I wasn&#39;t disappointed with them as I usually am.

Overall, Gina&#39;s makes a very good depression dog style hot dog. I&#39;d recommend it if you&#39;re in the area. I&#39;ll give this place a full five stars as for this style of hot dog it doesn&#39;t get much better. One final note if you decide to visit. This is a cash only establishment, so be prepared to hand over paper money."

I travel through this area for work and have had people always tell me to stop here to eat because it&#39;s so great. I&#39;ve driven past many times and thought it looked like a total dump, but I try not to judge a book by it&#39;s cover. There are tons of dumpy looking restaurants that are great. So today I finally decided to stop and have a hotdog and fries. As soon as you walk in it looks worse inside then outside, it&#39;s like time stood still in 1977 in there. 

I ordered a hotdog with everything (which doesn&#39;t include pickle or tomato) and a small coke. I noticed the fries were siting in the basket already cooked, after I ordered the guy dropped them in again, it was like re-fried fries (gross)... The guy delivered the dog and the first thing I noticed was the yellow grease draining out of the wax paper into a puddle.  As I unwrapped the dog and fries all I could see were puddles of yellow oil all over the wax paper. I was totally turned off at that point and figured I wouldn&#39;t eat the fries and just eat the dog. I took one bite out of the hotdog and it wasn&#39;t even hot. It was also like rubber, my teeth couldn&#39;t tear it apart, so I spit it out. I stared at this pile of crap in front of me and decided to not eat it. I grabbed the tray and walked up to the counter and handed it back to the women and told her to keep it. I didn&#39;t even ask for my money back, I couldn&#39;t get out of that dump quick enough."

I drive by Gina&#39;s nearly every day, but we&#39;d not tried it. Until one afternoon when I knew I had to rush off to a hair appointment soon after I got home, and offered to pick a quick dinner up on the way.

So into Gina&#39;s I went -- it&#39;s a small place, with about four tables, plus a few outdoors with umbrellas. Their menu is basic though slightly larger than Nana&#39;s -- hot dogs, beef, a chicken sandwich, a fish sandwich, tamales, fries, pizza puff, Italian ice and milkshakes.

I was extremely tempted to try the Italian ice (I grew up eating &#34;wudder ice&#34; in Philly and rarely see it replicated) but stuck with three dogs and an extra order of fries. (Grand total: $8.98.) The hot dogs come with mustard, onion, relish and sport peppers plus fries smushed on top -- too bad, I love me a good kosher pickle, but that&#39;s OK. Just leave off the relish. 

So they&#39;re quality dogs -- Vienna beef, nice soft bun, very tasty. The fries are hand cut and were piping hot, having just been fried when I ordered. A little soft and very tasty.

Gina&#39;s is far from the only hot dog joint in town, but they are close and the prices are cheap. So the next time I have a jones for some wudder ice with my hot dog, I&#39;m gonna go hit up Gina&#39;s."

First things first, I think this place should be called &#34;Gina&#39;s Wein-ah&#39;s&#34;...has a nice ring to it.

Inside is pretty bare minimum. There are a few tables to eat at but the area isn&#39;t that large. Menu is pretty basic as well. We ordered a hot dog/fries and chilly dog/fries and 2 drinks and it was under $10. The hotdogs are not Chicago style as they don&#39;t have tomato or pickle. It was still pretty decent though. The fries are good too, they have skins and aren&#39;t too greasy.

Tried some Italian ice and it was just ehhh.... I&#39;m used to Mario&#39;s in the city and Gina&#39;s pales in comparison. It wasn&#39;t terribly bad but I wouldn&#39;t make it a point to get it again.

The guy who was working (manager I assume?) was pretty over bearing. We were barely in the door for 10 seconds and he was asking for our orders. Then I&#39;m standing there waiting to pay and he rings up some guy who was behind me. Made me feel invisible and thinking WTF? He was also so concerned about some impending storm (which we never got by the way) that he was being loud and announcing it to everyone....&#34;a storm is coming and it will be here in 30 minutes&#34;. Focus on the dogs (and making your female customers not feel invisible) and not the weather!"

I have been trying to stop here for the past year or so and finally was in the area when Gina&#39;s was open. (The past 5 times in the area they were closed at weird hours of the day) Got a classic dog with everything and an Italian Beef. For being in a bunch of Chicago books and &#34;Never put Ketchup on a Hot Dog&#34; and also being in the Vienna Beef Hall of Fame I was expecting excellence. Sadly Gina&#39;s did not produce. The dog itself was good but that was it. The bun was almost rock solid it was so stale. also very minimal toppings. Now on to the Beef. It was one of the worse beefs I&#39;ve ever had. It tasted like it was the left overs from a graduation party. The beef was dry and when I did get a juicy bite it had the flavor of as if it were sitting in water instead of beef juice. Being the huge Chicago Food guy that I am, I am always excited to get a bite of a Chicago Dog and an Italian Beef...both very disappointing, But i wanted to leave on a good note, so I got the Homemade Italian Ice, I never knew that Homemade Italian Ice came in a container with a bar code? I was really hoping it was homemade. If you need a hot dog and only have a few bucks give them a shot, but that is only if you are in desperate need of one."

Nothing out of the ordinary going here or anything particularly spectacular.  You&#39;ll just get a pretty good hot dog at a pretty good price.

The hot dog overall was tasty, it&#39;s Vienna beef after all, but really the same sort of thing you can get anywhere.  The fries were hand cut, which is ordinarily a plus, but they were really soggy and limp.  Hand cut fries tend not to be as crisp as the ones from the freezer that are dumped in a fryer, but a little shape and texture is still to be expected.

This place was really inexpensive, which is a point in its favor.  We got 3 dogs and fries, plus an extra order of fries for around 8 bucks.  That&#39;s pretty reasonable.

So it&#39;s good, just not particularly memorable.  They do have Italian ice there which we&#39;ve yet to try.  If it proves particularly good I might update my review, but until now, it&#39;s pretty average."

My friend says he&#39;s sorry he doesn&#39;t have cash on him, and what does this guy do? Not suggest an ATM. He literally starts CURSING him, drops the food on the floor, saying &#39;After all this work?!&#39; (the two hotdogs/fries from the deep fryer) and get this, &#39;Be a man; carry cash with you&#39;.

Sorry, I didn&#39;t know you were allowed to take ego trips when you rely on your customers to pay your bills.

This is 2013, most people don&#39;t carry cash. But they do share awful experiences with millions of potential customers online. I suggested the place only because my company has occasionally gone there, which I will make sure NEVER happens again.

We were in the mood for Mexican food and wanted to stay close to home. First impression was a good one. The decor is very bright and fun and the bar area looked nice, they also have outdoor seating. 
Our waiter came to our table right away and he was very attentive throughout our entire meal. 
I ordered a frozen mango margarita and my boyfriend had the ultimate margarita on the rocks.  My drink was ok, nothing spectacular about it but it did have just the right amount of alcohol in it. Next time I will order what my boyfriend had. For my meal I got the carne asada and that came with rice, beans and a house salad. Everything was good, nothing blew me out of the water but it was good. The flavors were good, the portions just enough and the price was not too bad. Our waiter (an older gentleman) was very friendly and attentive and made our dining experience with them that much better. I know I will be back for sure because it&#39;s close to us. Maybe we will just do appetizers and drinks next time."

Food: I had steak tacos &amp; they were good, steak was nice and tender. Nachos were crap, over-cooked. Cheese was rubbery &amp; half the chips were burnt &amp; the beans are definitely canned beans; not a fan. 

Drinks: I had a Michelada, I was craving them all day &amp; any Mexican knows how to make a proper Michelada, you do it with Clamato juice NOT Bloody Mary mix. I was very disappointed. 

Service: Very well, our waiter was on top of things, always made sure we were filled up or asked if we needed anything.

Pros: 
wait staff refills water quickly
Great chips and salsa
Decent prices 
Cool atmosphere 

Cons:
Service is spotty 
Food has inconsistent quality 
The place doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s regularly cleaned

The first of my last two trips, my husband found a marble sized chunk of salt mixed into his rice which he had to spit out. The food was so over salted he felt sick all night all the next day. We didn&#39;t complain. We just paid, tipped, and left. 

The second time, it was later in the evening (maybe 8:50pm) and there were very few customers. We ordered some drinks,  appetizer and both got mole enchiladas. His came out great,  mine looked like the sauce was stretched by adding water to it. The visible consistency and lack of flavor were really disappointing. I explained the problem with the sauce and they tried to tell me it was normal. I may be some green-eyed gringo, but I KNOW my mole sauce,  and i order it every time. After I sent it back i didnt order anything else and after that the wait staff completely shunned us. We couldn&#39;t get anything else, much less water,  so after 20 minutes of trying to get our check we left."

The chips were good quality and have spices on there.  Salsa and the mild salsa was very tasty as well.  Guacamole was creamy and fresh too. I ordered the burrito grande and I was very pleased with the portion, the sides and the sauces drizzled on top.  

I have been to other places where they have cheap, oily chips and waters down salsa and this place isn&#39;t it by any means.  He price is extremely reasonable.  Most dishes are no higher than $10.

Best salsa I&#39;ve ever had and I have spent years trying to find a store bought salsa that even comes close-proven to be impossible. Moral of story: TRY THE SALSA. 

Every time I come here I get their chimichanga. Which is huge, covered in yummy cheese and comes with a side of rice, beans, lettuce, tomato and guacamole.

First time coming to La Campana. I was in a group of four.

Upon arriving I noticed the decor of the dining rooms, cantina, and overall atmosphere. I would say that it was pretty on par with most large Mexican establishments, but still nicer and bigger than most

Atmosphere 4.5/5

Upon meeting with my group I was introduced to the chips and salsa, which my group told me was a little too spicy, so they ordered mild and mixed it in. Looked like their mild salsa was just enchilada sauce. And the chips were a little greasy for my taste.

Chips and salsa 3/5

We were looking to eat lighter, so I got the veggie fajitas and my date got a vegetarian burrito (no tortilla). When the food arrived, I received 3 tortillas and a sizzling skillet of only peppers, onions and tomatoes. Rice and beans were served on the same skillet. 

Overall texture of the veggies were good, and the ones that were on he bottom were over cooked, as they were on the bottom of the skillet. I was a little underwhelmed with the overall taste, nothing spectacular, and I wish there were more variety of veggies.

Veggie fajitas 3/5

Overall service was good. The table only ordered 3 entrees and 3 beverages. And I didn&#39;t find myself asking about the waiter. There also wasn&#39;t high demand as it was only a wednesday night. 

Service 4/5


If you&#39;re looking for average Mexican food that&#39;s reasonable in price, go to La Campana. I&#39;m sure they may have heavier meat options that taste more wholesome, but overall my meal was JUST OK.

Oddly enough, it was packed - probably at capacity with a wait list. The parking lot was completely full so I was really looking forward to a great meal. But after sitting down for 10 minutes, I was quickly getting the same experience as other fellow Yelpers where the service was poor and the food taking a while to reach our table. I asked for suggestions and my server recommended the quesadillas (sigh...). My server was also hard of hearing and I must have shocked him when I ordered the enchiladas mole. Apparently, he must have never had someone Asian order mole before. 

The food itself wasn&#39;t spectacular but the prices weren&#39;t bad either. The servings are large so you definitely leave feeling full. The problem is that most of the menu comes in the form of either an enchilada, taco, or burrito. There were four of us and all of our dishes looked identical so there wasn&#39;t much variety or creativity in the menu. 

La Campana still does a good job of catering to a certain demographic. This is definitely the place if you tend to only order enchiladas, burritos, fajitas, and margaritas - not too far off from Old El Paso cuisine. You might be disappointed if you are more familiar with Mexican cuisine. For the price point, it wasn&#39;t that bad but just check your expectations."

It was loud and packed, which we took as a good sign. I think margaritas are where it&#39;s at (maybe next time)!  :D Our server (Chris) was friendly and offered us a complimentary app for our initial wait.
Kind of awesome since we were curious about the guacamole. I loved the freshness and it was insanely chunky, but thought it needed a smidgin&#39; of salt.

He got the fish tacos and I got the seafood chimichanga (HUGE). It had a few shrimp inside, but had a good amount if crab stick (not a fan). Not sure if I just ordered the wrong thing or what. The tacos seemed ok.

We only had water and ended up having to ask for refills a few times.

My chicken flautas mirrored my BF&#39;s entree and we did not order the same thing ON PURPOSE. I loved my entolmatada?? (sp?) and the bistek Mexicana (stew). They were really good.

We had to ask for more salsa and the check. We dined on the patio so once our plates were taken and our cups were empty, we wondered where our server disappeared to.

Food was terrible, everything was cold, and the steak I ordered was awful, I couldn&#39;t even cut it, I split out the first bite. And when I tried my taco salad, I had enough,  I just left, went to another restaurant right away.
Oh, and the bathroom there, very dirty.
The worst thing was that I saw the employee not washing hands after using the bathroom. 
Bad, bad experience. .... 
Don&#39;t waste your money there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Seriously, I could happily fill up on the chips and salsa/guacamole. But, out of decency I also ordered an entree. 

I can&#39;t remember the name of what I ordered, but it was shrimp in a tomato sauce of some sort. I was tied between choosing that or the shrimp fajitas. I wasn&#39;t terribly in love with the tomato sauce and the shrimp was a little overcooked, so perhaps next time I will give a taste to the shrimp fajitas.

Yes, even though I wasn&#39;t WOWed by my entree, I did really enjoy the food and I would return for another try. The rice was perfectly cooked and flavorful and (as I already said) the chips alone would be worth returning for.

I thought it was pretty humorous that I specifically asked for a VIRGIN pina colada and they still brought me one with alcohol in it. Very very tasty pina colada though!

It was CRAZY busy by 7 p.m. I highly suggest if you&#39;re wanting dinner on a weekend, you get there with plenty of time. We probably waited a good 45 minutes for a table and it took a considerable amount of time to get our food and our check. But, luckily, that gave me and my girly friends plenty of time to catch up and chat. Though, if I had been on any kind of timetable, it would have been seriously inconvenient."

The rest of the restaurant wasn&#39;t quite as appealing but then I did only look in one large room which struck me as a little warehousey.  Someone came to take my order super fast and he immediately recommended their most expensive drink.  Whatever...  I chose instead a regular margarita on the rocks with salt.  It was pretty good.  Having rejected the expensive drink, service slowed considerably.  By the time my friend arrived it was nearly impossible to get an appetizer order taken.  Finally just went to the bartender.

The nachos were okay.  Chips and a spicy salsa were complimentary.  

I&#39;d been here when the place first opened and this was my second time here.  LONG time to wait.  And my experience was the same as before.  While not bad, there was nothing to tempt me to return."

I wanted a second drink with the meal but he was nowhere to be found.  

My husband and daughter ordered the fajitas (chicken and shrimp). Normally in Mexican restaurants, the skillet is full of onions, peppers and meat mixture.  Tonight, the skillet was half full of the fajitas mixture and the other half of the skillet was full of beans and rice.  HOW CHEAP!!!!!

On a positive note, when I pointed out my extremely &#34;crispy&#34; enchiladas they brought back a new plate that was much better although inside the enchiladas, the chicken was quite plain and dry."

It was a big plate filled with the steak, rice, beans and &#34;Mexican papas&#34;. The papas had no flavor and were cold.

I was told this was the place for the best Mexican food.  To me, word of mouth is important.  

After we were seated it wasn&#39;t more than 5 minutes but we still were not served or asked if we wanted anything to drink.  We had to flag down a server to help us find our server.  When he finally came, we got our water and chips.  We ordered a jug of margarita and was excited to start being happy.  We also ordered the Fiesta plate since we were not too hungry.

The margarita was too sour for my liking and the glasses did not have enough salt on the rim.  there were spots of salt missing.  Did someone already lick my glass?  As for the Fiesta plate, I was expecting a grand plate because of the reviews some people gave me verbally.  But what arrived at our table looked almost like slop.  The nachos looked burnt and toppings just slapped on.  The cheese almost looked hard and might have been someone else&#39;s order from an hour ago and just placed in a microwave to heat it back up because it was just not good.  

Have you ever watched Ramsay&#39;s Kitchen Nightmares?  I felt like I was eating everything that was prepared that morning and just heated up in the microwave.  I don&#39;t think that my pallet is too refined because I eat a lot of junk food.  For someone, like myself, who eats this way should feel like eating La Campana&#39;s food as upscale.  But it made me feel like I should&#39;ve just eaten at McDonald&#39;s, Taco Bell, Wendy&#39;s, Portillo&#39;s, or Culver&#39;s.

Great food is made with love.  What I ate that night was made with a broken heart.  A little deep, you say.  But to me is all true."

+ UNLIMITED REFILLS OF HORCHATA
+ i love seafood and I can&#39;t seem to find a lot of mexican places that offers a variety of seafood dishes...La Campana had an entire seafood section and then more dishes under their vegetarian section
+ large portions
+ good prices (2 entrees, side of guac, soda, and horchata with tax and tip rang up to about $42)

onto the negatives:
- i took a peek into the kitchen when  the doors were swinging...did not look extremely clean
- my shrimp fajitas were kind of bland
- there is a $2 charge for additional complimentary chips and salsa
- service wasn&#39;t that great...always had to catch them and ask for something instead of them offering if we needed anything

I&#39;m writing this review, because I&#39;m tired of spending money on poor quality food.  I&#39;ve been coming to this place for the past 10 years and during the past 4 months I&#39;ve gone twice and both times the food was so BLAH and plain and stale!  

I had the chicken enchiladas suizas...it was shredded chicken without a dash of salt or pepper or any seasoning for that matter, and to make them see fuller they also stuffed a spoonful of sour cream inside. The sour cream ended up curling so it looked like cottage cheese with stringy dried chicken, YUCK....who does that? The rice was hard like it had been reheated several times. I&#39;m glad I skipped out on the beans cause I&#39;d probably be writing this while sitting on toilet seat...yikes look-out. 

I&#39;m so sad...it use to be very tasty food...I don&#39;t know what has happened to cause all these changes, but they need to change it back or call Chef Robert Irvine (restaurant impossible) to fix things quickly, if not that place will go down and close the doors for good!"

This place use to be a nice place to go, but things have changed and not for the better.  When the owner was present on site, the staff appeared happy and the food was good.    Now there seems to be a new manager in town and she runs this place w/an iron fist.   Whenever  this manager is on site, the staff seems to be unhappy and hesitant to send food  or improperly mixed drinks back.

On Saturday they shorted my burrito verde order, as it hardly had any meat filling and was more salty than usual. The sour mix used in the margaritas could peel the rust off of your car,  extremely sour, sour mix. Bring your Tums.

On this manager&#39;s watch we had ordered two dinners and were billed for extra tortillas, the server originally brought out only 3 tortillas for 2 people. WT??  When we inquired to our server about the charge, the server told us the manager was checking the bills and made him bill extra for tortilla&#39;s.  The waiter appeared embarrassed by this, and couldn&#39;t adjust the bill. 
 Another time when this manager was on duty a drink was sent back because it was poorly mixed and tasted like cheap sour mix. Instead of remixing a drink, the manager decided to &#34;fix&#34; the drink (the margarita came back a brownish orange).
The drink was sent back to the bar for a second time as undrinkable. This manager actually argued with us and wanted us to pay 1/2 the drink price for the mixing mistake.
&#34;The lady protests too much, methinks.&#34; 

Usually you can&#39;t go wrong w/ the Mexican stew, shredded beef burrito, chiles rellenos w/shredded beef.

side note:  The Guacamole is not freshly made to order. It&#39;s made earlier in the day, and has a refrigerated taste. If ordering a specific brand name of  tequila, order from the bar to see the bottle and pour. Staff is unhappy and it shows in the food and interaction of servers."

The first time I went I had the chicken tostadas (back before I became a vegetarian) and the portion size was considerable especially for the price but the food was quite bland.

We were told there was a 20 minute wait on a Friday night, but within 10 minutes of sitting at the bar, our table was ready.  The margaritas are pretty standard but you can go nuts and get them with one of their many different tequilas.

I ordered the Azteca combination: an enchilada, bistec Mexicana, a taco, a tamale-looking thing, and fresh guac.  Everything was decent, but nothing earth-shattering.  My one complaint was with the guac, it wasn&#39;t chunky or spicy (George likes his guacamole spicy!).  One nice (but potentially awkward) touch was the guitar&#39;d duo who will sing you a melody during dinner.  All in all, a decent, affordable option if you&#39;re in the fiesta mood."

The guacamole isn&#39;t the best and sometimes the quality is a BIT inconsistent, but not enough to even make me want to drop to 4 Stars. We love this place. We can&#39;t go long between visits.

My sister has been raving lately about how wonderful La Campana is and how we HAVE to go soon. We were running errands in the Bloomingdale (Army Trail Road) area last night and she persuaded me to go with her for dinner because, hey, we gotta eat!

I haven&#39;t been here in years, but when you walk in you are greeted by the same fun decor and dimly lit atmosphere. The fountain with the giant goldfish is pretty cool, seeing as I like fishies!

We asked for Maria who seems to be the server my sister really likes, but she only works Friday, Saturday, Sunday. :(

The two of us were seated in the back dining room at a 4 top near the kitchen. Took a few minutes for anyone to greet us, but we did receive water and chips/salsa promptly. (Dig the water with the chips! That&#39;s how it always should be.) So they appeased me here.

Our server was a gentlemen who has mastered the art of disappearing! I was impressed by his ability to disappear for 10 minutes at a time, but appreciated the bus boy who was kind enough to do everything from get us &#34;mild&#34; salsa [which was delicious (BTW)]. get our drink refills, top off our waters, and even run our credit card at the end of the meal. He was readily available to serve us and silly me felt bad because I didn&#39;t have any cash to separately tip him with at the end. Hopefully he went home knowing with all of my gracious &#34;Thank you&#39;s&#34; that I truly did appreciate all he did and hopefully he gets to split tips with the servers because he pretty much was the person who took care of us the entire time.

My sister ordered the #41 which is what she always gets. It&#39;s some steak and a chicken enchilada. Yumm. I ordered a combo plate which arrived with the wrong items on it. Due to the fact that our server wasn&#39;t anywhere to be found after he dropped he food, I just ate what I liked and left the rest. I really found it to be a waste because you can not reheat Mexican food and over cooked rice, reheated is more like raw rice, so I said &#34;forget it.&#34;

Perhaps, we can try going back on a weekend when the famous Maria is working and give it another shot."

We&#39;ll be back in an hour they said...3.5 hours later I&#39;m calling my Mom to pick us all up and take us back to my apartment. The embarrassing part of that whole evening was that I had to walk some 3-4 miles back from my place to grab the Cadillac. Now that&#39;s a walk of shame. 

Margaritas can be pretty feisty anywhere, but margaritas at La Campana are deliciously dangerous.  I prefer their Ultimate, but the house is pretty good too.  The tequila variety is decent and the specialty drinks look like they are worth the trying.  This is a good spot to hit up for birthdays (if your a female I might add). Rumchata shots and drinks on the house.  The staff is what I would like to see in a Mexican restaurant, they&#39;re Mexicans.  Very friendly and kind enough to tolerate a group of rambunctious babes. Here comes the sad part, the food.  I&#39;m so sad and very very sorry to say that aside from all I love about this restaurant (the good times, great drinks, the crazy awesome decor, staff, patio, bar area, weirdo accordion music etc) this is not the place to go for good Mexican food.  I agree with other reviewers, it is largely flavorless and sometimes not very fresh tasting.  If you&#39;re in the area and looking for good drinks and atmosphere, perhaps some chips and salsa to go with that, this is the place to go.  If you&#39;re hungry, there&#39;s endless options in this part of town.  Hasta la vista baby!"

I hadn&#39;t been here in quite a few years, so I was hopeful that it was as good as I remembered it.  I was not disappointed.  We had excellent service, fresh chips and salsa and delicious meals.  My husband is not huge on Mexican food, so it is a treat for me to go and I was glad that we made this our stop that night.  They&#39;ve changed their salsa since I was last there, but overall it was a nice meal with an attentive server, so we will be back soon."

HOWEVER, the staff is not friendly.  We regularly order just side orders since we don&#39;t want all the rice and beans, and this seems to heavily annoy the servers.  They always seem to mess up the kind of meat that is supposed to go in the dish.  If you order one pork enchilada and one chicken taco, be prepared to get a pork taco and a chicken enchilada. Also, I usually order something pretty simple: three steak tacos on a soft flour tortila with cilantro and onion only, lime on the side.  What I get are steak tacos with hardly any meat, but loaded with onion and a ridiculous amount of cilantro.  Without exaggeration, the cilantro is SO heavily packed onto these tacos you can&#39;t see anything underneath until you scrape piles of it off.  But what is the most aggravating thing to me, is they have NEVER remembered to bring the lime.  And when you mention it to them, you get attitude.  

Thank goodness for the great chips and salsa, and the potent margaritas because without them I wouldn&#39;t be able to stand this place."

Went there for lunch today and got the beef Enchilada Suizas which was very tasty. Also ordered a Jack n Coke which was poured to perfection (Jack and then 2 small sprays of coke). Bartender also offered up two shots of tequila which was absolutely fantastic. It was a lot smoother than most tequilas, with almost a bourbon taste to it. I can&#39;t comment on price as I did not pick up the tab this time around. I will definitely return when I head out that way again."

They always start you off with chips and salsa, and I LOVE the chips. 
There&#39;s something about the consistency and flavor, but the chips are addicting.

Usually my companion and I stick to just ordering 2 entrees, but we decided to order something warm to help with the insanely cold weather. 
This was the best decision of the night! 
The zapata soup (chicken and rice) was oh so satisfying.
The broth was hearty and the chicken (shredded) was super juicy.

Now... I&#39;m a sampler. If I could have it my way, I&#39;d get sample size portions of the entire menu. 
Since that&#39;s not an option... I usually stick with the combinaciones :)
The entree comes out on an enormous, EXTREMELY hot plate and filled with goodies.
The rice and beans are always tasty. And I&#39;ve yet to eat anything from the combo that I&#39;ve disliked. 

Well done La Campana, I&#39;ll see you soon."

I&#39;ve been there on a Sunday afternoon as well as a weekday evening and it&#39;s been lively during both of those times.  The menu is quite vast with standard Sonoran items as well as regional specialties.

The complimentary salsa they provide with the chips are on the spicy side.  Maybe it&#39;s to encourage you to get a drink?  I typically order one of their combinations to try different textures and meats.  They let you order a different kind of meat with each item so I&#39;ve gotten a pork tamale, beef taco, and chicken burrito as well as had chicken enchiladas in mole sauce before.  Last time, my friend ordered the chicken enchiladas in red sauce and loved them.  The price point is very good for the value and the quality of the food is pretty good.  Another good thing about the restaurant is that it is open later on weekdays compared to other nearby ones."

I ordered chicken enchiladas with red sauce and horchata...

The place is pretty pricey and I would rather go somewhere amazing, where their food is amazing than go here again.

horchata wasn&#39;t that great I&#39;ve had better at other mexican restaurants

and enchiladas were dry inside, taste was not so great

Overall they got 2 stars because minus 1 for taste, minus 1 for quality, and minus one for price... sorry I usually don&#39;t write bad things but it was pretty bad...

What I enjoy about Giannis is that in addition to a yummy Italian meal you also have great service. Giannis has a very attentive waitstaff whose competence would rival any 5 star restaurant in Chicago. 

Is this the best Italian food I&#39;ve ever had in my life? No...
But in my opinion it is the best in the Chicago area. 

Some personal favorites are 
Minestrone Soup

Veal Marsala 

This lemon cake type thing that tastes like if a lemon meringue pie and a lemon bar had a baby 

And their marinara sauce on any noodle is refreshing"

I&#39;ve eaten at Gianni&#39;s several times before and the food is pretty good in general, but it is really expensive, and I have always questioned if it was worth it. I don&#39;t eat out at restaurants very often because of fear of food poisoning and pregnancy, but I falsely assumed that the cost and the mostly apparent cleanliness, that Gianni&#39;s would be safe. I am obviously not sure that Gianni&#39;s is what made me sick.

The food was good, delicious, actually -- but the primary reason I&#39;m reviewing tonight (frankly the vast majority of the time I dine or enjoy services / experiences - I do not take the time to publish) is because of the unparalleled service of a Gentleman named MARK.  He is the best (non- Proprietor) Server I&#39;ve experienced, perhaps ever!  Just so above good, even great - in every way.  And I know service : I&#39;m a small business owner in the Service Industry, .. my Parents owned a successful Restaurant / Bar Downtown Chicago for 12+ years, .. and I dine out often. ..  I will also add that I suspect part of how Mark (Servers / Support Staff) can be so awesome is due to the kind of approval / guidance / fostering &#39;ok&#39; of their Manager / Owner(s).  The really special requests I often make when dining are often &#39;approved&#39; by the line up of the Server.- so I&#39;d like to share the credit, of sorts.  The Gianni&#39;s Cafe really was on it.- and I loved the whole experience!  :-)
I took the time to gloat over Mark to the Owners.  But the Yelp Community needs to hear it, too. ..  Ask for Mark, and tell him the Holistic Esthetician &amp; Educator / Integrative Nutritionist from Organically Gorgeous in Deer Park across the street sent you.  Enjoy. :-)"

(other tables had bread already etc) she never came back with this... i stopped another server who was filling waters at another table and asked for our bread.. it then came. then my family came and again no personality from the server asked what drinks and was gone. now , i understand that its a buffet and no one wants to work a holiday when you want to be home with family.

We live in the city, but whenever we are out this way, we immediately put Gianni&#39;s on our list.
Their bread is awesome. Italian bread and focaccia, served with the most garlicky basil oil you have ever tasted.  If dining with a romantic mate, I&#39;d go &#34;both&#34; or &#34;not at all&#34; on the oil. It is so good, but again strong enuf to ward off the most evil Vampire. 
I normally order the Country Rigatoni with cream sauce,peas chicken and sausage.  If it happens to be your &#34;cheat day&#34; I&#39;d recommend the same.  The portions are huge,so you will have tomorrow&#39;s lunch under your arm when you leave.

The veal tasted like it was steamed, the vegetables were cooked separately...so it tasted like steamed meat with tasteless vegetable soup drizzled on top.  To make it worse, each meal cost approx. $34 - and we bought 2 of them.  It&#39;s sad that a family restaurant would cut corners on a simple meal that when done right, is fantastic and worth the premium price!  On the bright side, our server was fantastic and she tried to make things right with a free dessert - which apparently was all the chef was offering as compensation for his short-cuts.  To make matters worse, nobody of authority visited our table to discuss the issue.  I hope this is not a sign of another good restaurant going south."

If you have kids - AVOID AVOID AVOID. First of all, a few weeks ago we called this place to make a reservation. The hostess (or whomever) answered told us they didn&#39;t take reservations. No problem. Knowing that, tonight we dropped in early. First question we were asked...? Do we have a reservation. Tonight it was myself, my wife and our 20 month old. They seat us in a small table right by the bar. As far as ambiance goes, there is none. This place is tiny, cramped, and noisy when more than half full. Kid friendly? How can that be when there is no kids menu? 

To be fair, the food wasn&#39;t horrible, but far from delicious. Average at best. I ordered a build your own pasta arrabiatta with sausage and a side Caesar salad. The salad was the worst Caesar I have ever had. The pasta was fine. My wife ordered fettucini Alfredo with chicken. Again. She thought it was satisfactory.

You are looking at $20/person easy at this place, which to me gets this place more in the $$$ range vs. the advertised $$.

Our waitress was ok. But we felt rushed from the get go. It was clear although they seated us they didn&#39;t want us there. Our food came out fast, but they started clearing the table while we were still eating. The hostess almost knocked my wife into our daughter while we were trying to leave as she was moving other patrons to cramped tables. My daughter was in a high traffic area we considered unsafe. Lastly, folks waiting to be seated were effectively hovering over us, and we had trouble getting out of the restaurant as folks wouldn&#39;t even bother moving when they see someone carrying a baby trying to get through. Unreal. Where has common courtesy gone? It is absent from this place.

Yelp stated this place was kid friendly. We experienced a far cry from that. We trust Yelp in its reviews, but this place is definitely not characterized correctly (noise level not average, place not kid friendly, pricier than expected for what you get.) We will never return to this place. Consider yourself warned."

Sat at the bar waited forever to get a drink refills were equally hard to get. We ordered one appetizer not offered any bread or anything else. Other people came in they were waited on immediately.  The bartender was more interested in rolling silverware. Now the lady bartender shows up and she is so attentive to others. Never asked if we wanted anything else just took the place setting away. I said well I guess I&#39;m done thanks. She goes oh did you want something else??  I tell her no there&#39;s other places I can go have dinner. She kinda shrugs and walks away.  The food is great but so is the food at other places. Guess Gianni&#39;s doesn&#39;t need the business.

I have been craving a good baked clam for some time now and I must tell you that Gianni&#39;s were fabulous!  Plump clams - the right amount of breadcrumbs and seasoning - so delicious.  It was an appetizer sort of day, so I also ordered the stuffed mushrooms as well,  which were equally delicious.

My server, Danielle (I believe) was lovely.  During my order, I shared that I was torn between the stuffed artichoke and the stuffed mushrooms.  She cautioned me that the artichoke was pretty big, so I opted for the smaller, though totally satisfying, mushrooms.

I&#39;ll save that artichoke order for my next visit.  Would highly recommend and is my new &#39;go to&#39; Italian spot in the neighborhood."

First off, I&#39;ve eaten here twice, simply because I give places with bad food a second shot in the event the first time was a fluke.  In this case, it was no fluke.

The first time, I ordered some chicken saltimbocca wrap, and it was oily, way too salty, and way too sloppy, drippy, nasty to be &#34;wrap suitable&#34;.  I chocked this one up to a bad choice on my part and tried Gianni&#39;s tonight for a second time.

I got the &#34;Gianni&#39;s Pescadores&#34;, a $35 seafood soup (not to be confused, apparently, with their $65 zuppa de pesce, which is chock full of even more not-very-good seafood!)

Now, to my &#34;if you have the time&#34; comment...

My seafood arrived in a broth that could be best described not as broth but instead as molten pomodoro tomato magma.  The intense heat of this edible magma not only made the soup largely inedible for quite some time but also by its very nature managed to turn the seafood melange into a potpourri of rubber trinkets.

In addition to being virtually unsalted and devoid of flavor even after copious salt was added, the seafood that was in there was near inedible.  The calamari rings made me feel like I was chewing on fake rubber fingers.  The scallops were so over-cooked, they looked more like withered, shrunken, senior citizen artichokes than scallops.  There were three small clams, one of which was empty, and three mussels (again, one of which was empty).

I would suggest that if you plan to try this dish, you leave a two-day window for yourself -- one day for the molten broth to drop 800 degrees to room temperature and one day to chew the seafood thoroughly well to spare your stomach the trouble of trying to break it down.

Ultimately, I would not suggest ordering this dish, and I would probably suggest trying somewhere else to eat altogether.  I won&#39;t be back a third time."

Why?

- Really rude hostesses at the door.  Two of them. too young and too involved with their phones to greet or seat you during prime dinner hours.  Big, big turn off.  We had to ask if they were the hostesses.   ***Please fix this.  This was a huge spoiler for the rest of the evening.  My guests swore they&#39;d never come back again.

- Super oily smokey indoors.  It&#39;s an open kitchen, but the ventilation system will drive you to the dry cleaners and dermatologist for a deep oil cleanse.

+ Chopped garlic and basil oil for your bread...the cheese is nice, if they remember to add it.

- Outdoor dishes and cutlery were filthy...not sure why.  It wasn&#39;t just dust, it was dried food residue.

+ Friendly servers.

- Unseasoned seafood dishes.

- Inconsistent sizes, seasoning and cooking of the same dish over several visits (my personal test).

+ Outdoor seating is really nice - especially when you have clean utensils.

Really would like to love Gianni&#39;s.  Please make improvements."

Then to the table, being greeted by multiple people with full bread service as we sat. The waiter (Mark) started us with drinks, for the children and adults. Coke for the kids, select craft beers for myself, and one awesome looking chocolate martini for the wife. (Her birthday)

We started with raw oysters (both east and west coast offered) calamari, fried and Sicilian (the Sicilian as the waiter stated, was a little taste of heaven in each bite) which it was!!!

The service staff and wait staff was second to none!! Fast, full beverages, very attentive, honestly, amazing is the word to use.

We had soups and salad, which the Caesar salad was great, as was the minestrone soup, and the pasta fagolli soup!!

Dinners consisted of veal, surf and turf, chicken, and pasta!!! Very well presented, and flavors were fantastic! 

For the birthday girl, a over sized piece of yummy tiramisu was brought out, as well as happy birthday being sung with a candle lite! Very nice touch.

The restaurant is nice, white table cloth, close to your neighbor but not too close. Decor was nice. All employees were extremely helpfully and generally concerned of your needs.

I want to honestly thank Mark *Marc our waiter on making our visit something to always remember!!!"

Come on the bread can make or break a restaurant, the new bread was about 1inch high with no crusty outer crust and the middle was close to white sandwich bread! Bring your old bread back! This bread ruined our meal, not up to soaking up gravy (sauce), and when we asked our waitress what happened to the bread she informed us they started making their own bread and yes there have been several complaints. I like their food but they don&#39;t know how to make Italian bread! It fell apart before we even put the oil on it. Don&#39;t think we will be going back there now.

Compared to many other Italian Restaurants I&#39;ve been to, the seating was a bit cramped and service slow (especially for the lunch hour). The best part of the meal was the bread with olive oil and the mussels appetizer which used PEI mussels in a white wine broth that was tasty but not overly salty. 

The chicken parmigiana was crispy on the outside and cooked well on the inside but the portions were rather small. The pasta sauce was also a little too sour for me.

The Italian beef sandwich was executed decently but the beef was a bit too salty and the fries were a bit soggy.

The aglio olio pasta was a bit too much on the oily side without enough garlic and cheese in my opinion. Although it&#39;s literally supposed to be tossed in oil, I think it&#39;s better to try to keep it lighter and extract more garlic flavor. 

The food wasn&#39;t bad at all, but for a restaurant of this caliber I expected more attention to detail of the different elements of the dishes. Due to the high ratings from others on Yelp, I may have gone on an off-day and will probably try this again soon."

Had reservations for 4 at 6:30. Two of us walk in right at 6:29, saw the other two looking for a parking spot. Told hostess my name, she looked us up and asked about the other 2. I told her they were right behind us, but she unbelievably said she couldn&#39;t seat us until the entire party was here. What??? I could see that policy being enforced if we were walk-ins, but we had a reservation. I tried to make the hostess understand, and that my wife has a knee issue and needed to sit and that the others were still looking to park. But she held firm, then when our party arrived a few minutes later, she seated us, literally threw 4 menus on the table (would be nice to hand them out to people at the table) and left. But to add even more insult, the table for 6 right next to us had one person seated a few minutes after we were seated. Then 2 more people came a few minutes later, Then the final 3 about 10 minutes after that. So what gives Gianni&#39;s? Consistent much?

Fortunately, service was extremely good, a very charming waitress with an Italian accent who knew her stuff. She deserves to work in a better environment.

Food however was a big disappointment, first time we felt that way here, and another reason we won&#39;t be back for a while. My braciole was absolutely burned to a crisp on the bottom, couldn&#39;t even cut through it with a steak knife; that portion was inedible. My wife ordered chicken marsala, which was pretty good, but asked for an alternative to marinara for the pasta side dish that came with it. The waitress suggested oil/garlic. But when it was served, it was devoid of any type of sauce or oil at all, just cooked mostaccioli ala nude. Come on, the kitchen can do so much better, no?

With all the competition in the NW &#39;burbs, I hope Gianni&#39;s can get their act together soon. But this was a very disappointing experience and we&#39;ll vote with our feet in the future."

We had reservations and were seated right away.  Our waiter was attentive and the support staff i.e. water, bread, etc. were also very active.  The first thing that you receive upon seating is a bread dip made of olive oil, fresh garlic, salt, pepper and a liberal amount of shaved parmesan cheese.  Completely delicious with the hot out of the oven french bread.  We were there with our daughter and so we demolished the first plate, which they immediately replaced with a new one at our request.  The side salads are not huge but the greens were fresh, the salad dressings are delicious and the waiter brings fresh pepper and more parmesan to make the salad even tastier.  I like to order the chicken marsala which comes with two good sized chicken breasts, pounded thin.  The sauce is delicious although I would have loved to have had more mushrooms.  The portion size is so liberal that I took home enough of my plate for lunch the following day.  My husband loves their Country Rigatoni which is also a huge serving.  Lunch the next day for him as well!  Finally our daughter ordered the lasagna with meat sauce.  It came with a liberal amount of mozzarella cheese over the top which had been broiled in the oven until browned.  It looked and tasted delicious.  Score lunch number three for the next day.  Overall, we got everything that we were expecting at Gianni&#39;s Cafe, delicious food, attentive service, liberal portions, and the price was right considering that the food fed us two full meals.  Keep up the good work Gianni&#39;s and we will be back often."

Sometimes they charge an extra $2-$4 for switching to a different kind of sauce, sometimes they charge $5 to split a meal - and sometimes none of this applies.  It would be better to add a little to the entire menu than to up charge every time you make a change.  If not for this, I would like this place.  All in all, I&#39;m spending my money at a competitor that knows how to operate.  Gianni&#39;s was a bad experience on many occasions, from 2008 to tonight.  Good food.  Bad systems."

While waiting for my food, I noticed the regulars coming in &amp; the Gianni staff recognizing them.  That was impressive.  Since I got this via carry out, I want to go back &amp; dine in their restaurant.  

Glad to find this Italian restaurant near my home.   You should try it out."

Tried a couple of their house pastas at a party once that had the food catered and really liked it. We also had been to the deli cafe next door (yummy panini!) owned by the same people. 

We went on a friday night and the place was packed. I almost want to say it&#39;s too crammed in there because the restaurant is so small. The prices and cloth tableskirts discouraged me, at first, because we weren&#39;t exactly dressed appropriately, but then I noticed most of the guests dining were also dressed casually. There is a bar along the wall when you first walk in and every seat at it was taken. We actually didn&#39;t have to wait at all; I think we just came in at the right moment. There isn&#39;t really a waiting area, so I would suggest calling ahead to make a reservation, if possible, or browsing one of the nearby stores in the same strip mall while waiting if you are not able to be seated right away.

I ordered the cavatelli with crimossa sauce and it was excellent. The crimossa is a cream sauce with prosciutto and roasted peppers. I was tempted to order the vodka sauce, but I&#39;m picky about vodka sauces and every place seems to make it different. 

My mom ordered just plain spaghetti with marinara. We both got a choice of soup or salad with our pasta. I ordered the manhattan clam chowder, thinking it was the creamy one, but failed to realize that that &#34;manhattan&#34; part means broth based. It was still pretty good. My mom chose the pasta fagioli soup. 

It seems some people complain about the service here, but our waitress was pretty attentive and available, even though she seemed busy. 

The thing that kept me from giving this place five stars is the prices; a bit too expensive for a suburban italian restaurant if you ask me, but the quality of the food really was good, so I guess that makes up for it. Maybe it&#39;s a good thing they&#39;re expensive, otherwise I would probably go into a carb coma from ordering their pasta all the time."

As I suspected, it was from my first visit. I have returned a few times since then and while I haven&#39;t experienced anything bad with the food, overall it is just a so-so experience. 

I usually sit at the bar and on my last visit, I experienced sub-par service. What I really didn&#39;t care for was that the bartender was talking to another customer, maybe someone she knew and when she went to place my napkin and silverware down, she just tossed it in front of me and let it sit like that. It was almost as if she was saying, &#34;here ya go, deal with it&#34; - actually pretty rude. 

The food varies a bit - sometimes it&#39;s spot on and other times it&#39;s fair at best. The last couple of times I&#39;ve thought of going there, I said to myself, &#34;For about the same price, I can go to Maggianos and get Lasagna that&#39;s just as good, PLUS I get one to take home.&#34;  Why go to Gianni&#39;s when I can get better or more Italian food somewhere else? In fact, Biaggi&#39;s (another Italian chain restaurant) across the street has food that matched Gianni&#39;s with servers that pay attention to your needs.

So I&#39;ve changed my rating from 4 to 3 - and really it&#39;s 2 and a half!"

When the mushrooms arrived at our table, not only were they cold but half the size of the ones at the other table. the waitress took them back and when they came back they were still half the size, The pasta we split was average and runny for $16,95. Plus the have the nerve to charge $12 for a glass of sangria because as the waitress says they use bet good wine. Please give a break!!!! if u want to spend $55 for average pasta, drink and stuffed mushrooms and tip then by all means this is the place."

Let&#39;s explore several of the way&#39;s dining at Gianni&#39;s Café was far more disappointing and dissatisfying than a bad visit to the dentist....

The restaurant was extremely drafty and very cold no matter where you sat, so I was still cold wearing a warm sweater vest, and my girlfriend had to wear her winter coat through the entire meal.  There was very insufficient heat and poor insulation there.

Now, about the bad food: 

Our two bowls of Angel Hair Arrabbiata Pasta were served far too soft and starchy; and so mushy that it tasted more like it came from a rural elementary school cafeteria food line than any decent Italian restaurant&#39;s kitchen.  They probably would have tried to correct it if I asked them too, but after being served that terrible mushy mush excuse for pasta, we just decided to eat the mess hall dishes and get through that lunch, so we would not delay our day any further.

The icing on the cake or lack thereof, came when I was told that even though it was my birthday lunch, that I could order something BUT I HAD TO PAY FOR IT  and it was AGAINST THEIR POLICY to provide any kind of complimentary birthday dessert.  That&#39;s so cheap and not a nice position to put your servers or customers in.  What a shame and what a pity!

After paying $40 for a substandard lunch that can not complete with countless other better Italian restaurants in the area, while sitting in a cold restaurant not properly heated, I can not believe that Gianni&#39;s Café is that stingy and cheap to not even offer a complimentary slice of cake, cookie, or even scoop of ice cream on a guy&#39;s birthday.

I will boldly remember how mediocre my disappointing $40 lunch for 2 was, and I will never forget how cheap and low class it was to completely stiff me and offer me NOTHING as a small token / dessert to support and recognize my birthday.  That is really low...

The service was average at best, the food was not enjoyable, there was nothing done to make my birthday meal there special, and it seemed like everything was an upsell making the overall value of lunch there very poor compared to many other restaurants.  

I thought about ordering a chicken dish in the low teens, but adding a salad was another upsell and for a side of pasta it was another $3.50 or more.  We were also told that the only linguine and clam sauce that could be served at lunch was $21.  I can not believe the prices they are asking for the mediocre experience being provided.

There are so many better Italian restaurants with better atmosphere, service, food, and value in the NW Suburbs...  I believe it is a big mistake to go here.  

I also will try to avoid the Palatine Gianni&#39;s Restaurant which I was told is also owned by the same people.   I do not want to patronize a restaurant that is so cheap that after paying $40 for lunch, they stiff me and will not offer any small complimentary birthday dessert.  Maybe there are other restaurants that do that poor practice, but that has never happened to me before in my life after many years of birthdays at many other far superior restaurants no matter what the price range.

I asked to speak to the manager on duty when leaving to express some of my dissatisfaction and to let him know I would be sharing this bad experience on Yelp.   He came from the back, and I did not see him earlier than when I requested to speak to him upon exiting (another bad sign).  However, he was a very polite young man and at least empathetic about my disappointing experience, so I give him credit for that.  However, just a few words of empathy could not fix such a poor lunch experience.  They saw a completely dissatisfied customer leave to never come back..."

We sat outside which was lovely, but that was the only good thing about the meal. We ordered the artichoke appetizer but it was soggy and not very tasty. The bread was cold and Gianni&#39;s always serves warm and crusty bread. We told our waitress, (sorry, Marlene) and she stuck her finger in the bread!!! Didn&#39;t she believe me and what a distasteful thing to do! She brought another bread which was just as cold. I asked her not to waste it and just to please heat it up which she did. My husband and I shared the pasta with pesto. We ordered the extra ingredients of chicken and broccoli. The pesto sauce says it comes with pine nuts, but it doesn&#39;t. We ordered the same dish a month ago and it also didn&#39;t have pine nuts. If it isn&#39;t standard with the pesto sauce, then don&#39;t say it comes with it and change the description on the menu.

Our entrees were a generous portion, as I would expect at an Italian restaurant, but not overly large.  The chicken picatta was very good but not the best I&#39;ve had.  I got Aglio Olio on my pasta and I was very happy that the garlic wasn&#39;t over powering and that it wasn&#39;t too oily.  It was very light and just the right amount of sauce to give flavor but not overpower and saturate the pasta.  The person I was with said the chicken parmigiana was amazing, but I don&#39;t know how much of a food critic he is, lol.

After years of frequenting the restaurant and having so-so service but pretty good food,  just had the worst meal ever and they charged us automatic gratuity of 18% because we had a table of six.  We were one of 2 tables eating lunch for a long time and still waited over 40 minutes for lunch - pastas and chicken sandwiches.  The pastas were swimming in a ketchup-like marinara sauce and the meatballs were mealy and sticky.  

I looked for the manager and of course, there was none to be found.  There used to be an older Italian gentleman who made sure the place was running correctly.  Unfortunately, with his absence, things have really gone downhill.

The food was decent, the service was great, and the prices were somewhat reasonable.

The three of us agreed that dipping the warm and crusty bread into their olive oil with parmesan cheese and garlic at the beginning of the meal was definitely the most enjoyable item we had.

After that, we ordered an eggplant parmigiana sandwich, steak gorgonzola wrap, and chicken roasted red pepper and cheese panini. The eggplant was above average, and the steak gorgonzola wrap was tasty, though totally lacking in steak for the price. The only real downside were the chicken, roasted red pepper, and cheese panini (very bland), and the pasta salad that came on the side (even more bland). I&#39;d recommend the bruschetta tomatoes instead, because they were at least edible.

In the end, the meal tasted slightly better knowing I had the Groupon, but I could see myself coming back regardless."

However, the staff is so unsanitary we thought we were on an episode of Restaurant Impossible or Restaurant Stakeout.  

We ate dinner at the bar.  The first thing we saw was an employee sticking her fingers in beer glasses coming from the dishwasher when she put them in the refrigerator.  Then she lined up all the liquor bottles on the bar where we were eating so she could wipe them off.  I must have looked incredulous because she asked me &#34;if I was tempted by the liquor&#34;.  I wanted to ask if our having dinner was interfering with her cleaning up?  FYI, the restaurant was still 25% full.

Next, she and and the bartender ate dinner (partly with their fingers) behind the bar.  Then she filled up a container with straws.  That&#39;s right, she didn&#39;t wash her hands and put her fingers all over the straws.  

Bottom line, whoever has a beer, glass of water or soft drink is getting whatever is on her fingers, e. g. food, saliva from her mouth, product from her hair that she never stopped touching.

For the main dish I had the cavatelli Crimossa, it was excellent!  Nice homemade tasting pasta with creamy buttery sauce, roasted red peppers and prosciutto added a sweet smoky flavor.  My meal came with a nice salad (too many big purple onions) for only $14.95, wow, what a deal - took some home to share with my 9 year-old son who loved it.

Even though we had the entire interior of the restaurant they still seated outside tables and once the outside tables were full the servers were too busy to properly handle our party inside. They should have had staff dedicated separately. There was also a mix up regarding desserts that were supposed to be provided.

FAIL - Don&#39;t know if we will be back."

And Gianni&#39;s is definitely worthy of great reviews on both.  We had been there a couple years ago, talked about going back and it just happened to work out today -unplanned yet oh so rewarding.  Food=great; service=very good;  portions = ample and flavorful; atmosphere=small and quaint; overall experience = make a point to make time to enjoy this slightly hidden gem.

After a wonderful meal we opted to have dessert.  Gianni&#39;s tiramisu is absolutely wonderful!  Homemade, moist-perfect balance of flavor and texture!  The second best I have ever had...  #1 will  honor belongs to my husband- always will.  Their tiramisu is truly worth giving up whatever you choose to give up to justify having such a guilty pleasure."

You don&#39;t expect to find a quaint, little Italian cafe in a strip center in Deer Park, but that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;ll find at Gianni&#39;s.

I took my wife out to dinner and it turned into a romantic evening for two with some excellent Italian food.  She had the &#34;create your pasta&#34; with Aglio Olio sauce and shrimp.  I went with the chicken parm.  Both were excellent and the portions were sizable.

We will definitely be back and might even become regulars.  Too bad that I didn&#39;t find Gianni&#39;s sooner."

The Italian cuisine is consistently good, particularly their sauces.  The last two times we&#39;ve been there I ordered the Shrimp Portofino with Sun Dried Tomatoes in a white wine and butter sauce.  It is EXCELLENT!  

They are always busy, but not overly crowded so you can usually get a table.  During the summer they have an outdoor patio next to a bubbling fountain, which makes up for the fact that the restaurant is located in a strip mall.

We&#39;ve been there for lunch and dinner and both are equally good, but their servings are pretty big, so bring your appetite."

The prices for dinner are high for the area, the red sauce is very greasy, the corkage fee for wine is $25/bottle and if you have to get up to go to the bathroom or leave and it is near impossible on a busy night because the tables are right on top of each other so there are no private conversations.

Both times I have been there the wait staff pushed the most expensive appetizers, entrees, wines, etc..."

We wanted somewhere different, so we decided to bring the kids here for lunch one day.

We started with the appetizer platter and everything tasted like grease. The mozz sticks were on the colder side. The quesadillas were all congealed together. 

All the entrees are MASSIVE and come with fries, coleslaw, and soup. You can sub soup for a salad for an extra $1 but that should just be standard. The fries taste double fried and taste just like crispy nothingness. The soup was decent. Coleslaw tastes like KFC. 

If you have a choice, skip."

I ordered the chicken tenders, and the Buffalo chicken dip. Both were outstanding they were great appetizers to have as we had a couple cocktails and talked about work in the bar.

This is a cool little restaurant on a small little airport near Schaumburg.  The atmosphere in this restaurant is very unique. The place is definitely tailored towards the pilots in the airport in which it resides.

The food was unbelievable. I&#39;ve been here for lunch in the past and the food is really good then as well.  If you&#39;ve never been out here to pilot Pete&#39;s I would highly suggest stopping in and trying it. Drinks and good food is what you should expect.

I&#39;m glad a coworker suggested it when we decided to go to lunch.  He had the pot roast sandwich.  Without exaggeration the bun to his sandwich was easily bigger than a CD. I&#39;m not sure he finished it.  I had a turkey sandwich and soup (trying to save room for dessert.  I failed!)  The turkey sandwich was piled high like you&#39;d get at a Jewish deli.  Everything was delicious and they give you no excuse to walk away hunger.  I must return to try another of the seemingly endless dishes they had on their menu.

We came here for a little sweet treat after getting dinner somewhere else and we were not impressed by the dessert menu. The cheesecake was calling our name. 

We were seated right away, but it was packed on a weeknight! We were all surprised. It looks like they have a large menu, and specials throughout the week. To be honest I am leery of places that have too large of a menu, because it usually means that they don&#39;t do one thing well. Or anything well.

We ordered the &#34;best&#34; cheesecake...and it was so dense and...spongy. It was one of the worst cheesecakes I have had. The service was sub par as well. I just wasn&#39;t that impressed and I&#39;m not dying to come back and try more...it just seems mediocre."

The place looked great with all the decorations on the ceiling, the airline seats in the waiting area, and we were lucky to catch some air traffic while we were there.

Unfortunately the food wasn&#39;t all that great.
The Chicken strips were the best item and overall they were good.  I&#39;d get them again but wouldn&#39;t go out of my to make it happen.  Overall service was great and the refills were quick too.

We got the Mega Platter
    4 large skins, potato had no flavor but texture good.
     no frills quesadilla.  
     The wings were good but a little dry inside.  Light jerk flavor (I wish I had known about sauce earlier.)

The kids got Spaghetti and pizza.  These were bad as the sauce was too sweet and both kids (4 and 7) said it tasted weird and didn&#39;t even eat a quarter of their meal.

Stroganoff pasta.  Tender meat but they don&#39;t use egg noodles. Instead it was an al dente fettuccini noodle. I like al dente but that didn&#39;t work in this Stroganoff dish.
The BIGGEST let down? Lobster Nachos.  The meat was room temperature.  The  cheese was barely warm.  I was really looking forward to this and I could barely eat the second piece. Without being hot this was just plain gross.

We won&#39;t be going back unless the kids are excited for the airplane theme again.  If so, we&#39;re all getting chicken strips."

As you walk in, there is a window repair hanger to the side where you can see some planes that are being worked (no idea if this is staged or actual repairs?). There are some waiting area seats which are actually airplane seats.  Kinda fun, you can take some pictures with the kids if it isn&#39;t too busy.  The bathrooms are also out here near the entrance.

We went fairly early on a weekend for dinner so it wasn&#39;t too packed.  I wanna say it was around 4:30, but it did get busy by the time we left around 6pm.  They don&#39;t take reservations on the weekend, which makes sense.

The service was pretty good, it wasn&#39;t the best ever, because we had to wait sometimes for our server to make his way around, but overall he was attentive and courteous and prompt.

The food was pretty standard American fare. We got the onion blossom, which was a bit disappointing.  The onion was not well cooked and had some raw bits in there, but was tasty.  I ordered the French onion soup which was pretty delicious, and I ordered the pot roast tacos for my entree.  They were delicious.  The fries were crispy. 
Drinks here are reasonably priced.

We got to see a few planes land and take off, and even got to see a helicopter flying around (it looked like he was training).  If available the windowed seats are obviously the best for plane watching."

The Fish fry is delicious because of the batter.
For any first timer at this restaurant, you MUST try the chicken fingers !  Can be an appetizer or as a meal.  Their chicken fingers are the best I have ever had, hands down (again, because of their batter).  The honey mustard sauce is awesome - we ask for 2 sauce containers per order.  Anyone over the past 10 years that have had the chicken fingers becomes immediately addicted.  
The salads are good but unfortunately I have had too many orders come with wilted lettuce and I quit ordering salads from here.  Not sure why they can&#39;t &#34;fish out&#34; the wilted red lettuce, they should get rid of the red lettuce and stick with romainne..."

This isn&#39;t the first time we have had a bad experience. But we thought we&#39;d give them another chance. Today was hands down the worse service I&#39;ve ever had in my life. We will never be going back.

We waited 75mins to get a table when we were told 45 mins. We kept getting told &#34;it&#39;ll be another 20mins&#34; everytime we asked what was going on. Once they realized we&#39;ve been there forever they said they were super sorry. It didn&#39;t make up for the fact that we were starving and had kids with us!! 

Once we got seated we realized we got up on the back room. Where there was 4 table with adults who didn&#39;t want to watch their kids. They ran around like it was chuckie cheese. We had to get a manager to tell them to relax. That&#39;s not okay. My sister in laws 9 year old was even annoyed with them. And that says a lot.

All we wanted was a nice dinner. To start we order the nachos and they gave us dirty plates to eat off we had to send those back. Than We order our food took about normal time to get to us. Once we all started to eat While cutting up my daughters pizza we found hair I didn&#39;t know if it was mine or someone else&#39;s so I looked closer it seems okay and I thought it was mine so I let my daughter eat it anyways then...

My sister is laws boyfriend was eating a cowboy burger and stopped eat it than shows us that there was a piece of plastic cooked into his food. Like you&#39;ve got to be kidding me. That has to be the against health code of some sort. He could get really sick!!

Even though the whole bill was on the house (which we had to fight for) it was ridiculous to think how they are still in business. It really makes you wonder what service you are really getting. 

My family won&#39;t be going back nor will I. I suggest you all rethink going there as well."

Oh wait! This is a restaurant! Back to the food. The Million Dollar burger is good, but I love their pan bakes. I&#39;m disappointed that the three cheese tortellini pan bake is off the menu, but you&#39;ll be sure to find something that tastes scrumptious!

1) Some of the food is really good and there&#39;s a huge variety of cuisines so it&#39;s good for a big group. But it&#39;s inconsistent in quality so watch out...you never know if it&#39;ll be good the next time you come.
2) Somehow this place is always busy. And there never seems to be enough staff on to make it a smooth experience. (AKA...long waits on drinks, food, check, all around service, etc)
3) Even though I have a child I don&#39;t want to be around a million of them at once. This place is family central. Seriously. Almost every table has kids at it and they&#39;re always making a mess, running around, and causing a scene. Not Pilot Petes fault, but still annoying. 
4) You may find the idea of being at an airport with all the kitschy decor fun or you may absolutely hate it. Just know what you&#39;re getting into before you trek out here. 
5) The balloon room for parties is nice (and free!) and they have a pretty decent and cheap menu for parties too if you&#39;re looking to throw a fun baby shower or bday party. But again, be aware that you&#39;ll probably only have one or two (poor, stressed-out) servers running around trying to take care of everything. 

Overall, this is a decent family place to go to if you live in the area but I certainly wouldn&#39;t make a special trip out here unless your (hopefully well behaved) child is obsessed with planes."

And the Yelpers didn&#39;t disappoint again. The place is adorable, full of aviation kitsch and a great view of the ramp. We got seated pretty quickly in a booth near the windows. Our only complaint was that the hanging light fixtures over those booths are set at the perfect level to wish you had a ball cap. They are 6&#34; above your head and blinding, so you can&#39;t see anything in the room but your table mates. 

The food portions are gigantic; I&#39;m pretty sure my buffalo sandwich had a *whole* (as in double) chicken breast on it, plus the fries and soup that came with it. 

Service and pricing were just fine- friendly enough on both fronts. We didn&#39;t venture to the drink or dessert menus, but will next time."

We were also lucky that the weather was beautiful so there was an ample amount of runway activity which was incredibly entertaining to our small grandsons and adult guests as well. 
Everyone at our party kept commenting on what a great place with great food we found in Pilot Pete&#39;s! We could not have been happier with our entire experience and would highly encourage everyone to consider having your (smallish) events at Pilot Pete&#39;s...and if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll have AJ as your server!"

Pilot Petes is located off Irving Park rd just outside of the Schaumburg Airport. Plenty of parking! 

Inside the interior is decorated with many model airplanes from different generations of flight. Also, first class airplane seats for those that have to wait in the waiting area.

The food is delicious and tasty. Huge portions so please share! I had the fried Onion for app and a burger with rib meat. As someone who loves to eat I must say even I wasn&#39;t able to conquer all the food in my plate. 

Only downfall is the bar. The drinks are not that great but that can easily be solved by ordering something that is already bottled. 

Lastly, customer service is good! Very impressed"

We had early dinner and didn&#39;t have to wait long on a Sunday. Had a very friendly waiter that made sure our drinks were filled and took away any empty glasses or plates right away.  To start We all had the French onion soup, which is very cheesy and delicious. Then, for entree I ordered the Fish and Chips. Keep in mind portions are huge. There were 5 large pieces of very crispy battered fish that were very moist inside.  The dish also came with fries, hush puppies, and coleslaw (must be requested and I definitely recommend getting it). Everything was seasoned perfectly,  since I didn&#39;t have to add any salt or pepper. I did have tarter sauce to dip my fish in and ketchup for my fries. For desert, we shared the complimentary birthday cake.  It was a white cake with sliced strawberries and strawberry syrup drizzled over it.

There are many airplanes hanging from the ceiling and in display cases. You will never get bored from looking at the decor or watch the small airplanes on the runway that are ready for take off or landing.  I Would recommend this place for airplane lovers. It is also a great place for families with kids because the atmosphere is very friendly and casual."

Walking in,  you can tell this place is already not your ordinary restaurant.... the waiting area has plush purple airplane seats (yes, the kind you would sit in on a plane) and the decor is full of plane related stuff, including what might be a life size replica of Tatu from Fantasy Island (da plane, da plane!)  The restaurant is modeled after an airplane hangar, and the place is pretty damn interesting!

Being full from a late lunch where we pigged out, I thought I&#39;d go light and get a Cuban sandwich, while the wife ordered up some chicken fingers.  

Chicken noodle soup:  Looked very watery, but surprisingly had a lot of flavor and wasn&#39;t watered down at all!  They&#39;re makin&#39; the broth properly for sure...

Cream of Spinach:  Nice and thick, rich, creamy.  They&#39;re definitely making their soups pretty well, and it&#39;s a nice addition since it comes with the meal!

Cuban sandwich:  Not small.  Not light.  Good sized, good quality meats, pickles, tasty.  It&#39;s a ton of food for the price!  While not quite the same quality of what you can find in a good Cuban restaurant, the sandwich is quite good and the flavors play well together.  

Chicken Fingers:  The main attraction that drew us here, they were good.  Not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but pretty tasty overall.  If there was any complaining to be done, it would be that the meat was slightly dry... but just barely.  The coating is thick, and fairly crunchy, and seasoned just right.  The mashed potatoes that came with were just the right amount of smooth and chunky!

All in all, the place is quirky but cool, the food is good, and for the prices, you get a TON of food.  Worth checking out!

Verdict:  We&#39;ve had our fill for now, but in a few months, I&#39;d be game to come back again and enjoy the food when I&#34;m not so full... I only ate half my sandwich, and we still had four chicken strips left at the end of  the meal!  (Definitely come with an emptier stomach next time...)"

He was held up with a ground stop at TEB, so I was gonna have a couple of hours to kill.  Luckily, there was a bar and restaurant at the airstrip.  I didn&#39;t even know the airport was there, despite the fact I used to live nearby. Seems more like it&#39;s for personal aircraft, I didn&#39;t see many corporate-sized planes on the tie downs.  There&#39;s a flight school and heliport, as well.

The restaurant overlooks the runway, and it&#39;s called Pilot Pete&#39;s.   It has an aviation theme (surprise!) with large scale model airplanes hanging from the ceiling, airline seats in the waiting area, and other general air knick-knacks as decorations.

I admire the owner/manager, this place has a very long menu, seemingly no pre-prepared dishes, as well as daily specials. It has to be a chore to keep everything running smoothly. The waitstaff is clad in shirts that say &#34;Flight Crew,&#34; and the couple I talked to said they&#39;d worked there for years and wouldn&#39;t work anyplace else.

Although this place is apparently known for its version of the hundred dollar hamburger, I was in the mood for something a little different, and surprise, I over ordered.  Started with an amazing &#34;Fall Salad&#34;, which crisp greens, blueberry, chicken and damn near a half pound of feta.  Salad came with soup, and I opted for French Onion, piping hot, flavorful, with the traditional baked cheese/crouton cap.

Launched into the restaurant&#39;s version of a Cuban, which the menu says is an homage to the one prepared by Treasure Island in Tampa.  Pete&#39;s strayed a little bit by adding mayo, tomato, and lettuce, which didn&#39;t take away from the quality meats and cheese, which were amply packed between  pressed  halves of a garlic Cuban baguette.

The only downside to the meal were the accompanying fries, which were the extruded type, good flavoring and seasoning, just not a personal favorite. Overall, it was a terrific meal with portion sizes that could easily have served three.   Sandwich, soup, salad, cocktail, $40 including ti"

We sat right by the tarmac and the kids loved to watch the planes go in and out.  The menu was HUGE, and had so many choices.  It seemed like the perfect place.  We got a TON of food, mainly to try a bunch of things, take home what would reheat well, and be a little adventurous with our choices.  Well, not the kids.  They got their old standbys: pizza &amp; spaghetti.  I got pot roast stroganoff, and we got a nachos appetizer and a sampler appetizer.  The server was nice, cute, attentive. But the food was...mostly edible.  The kids wouldn&#39;t eat the spaghetti (tons of noodles, tiny blob of sauce) or the pizza (like ketchup and cheese on a large cracker), didn&#39;t even want to take them home.   My meal was a huge portion, but very bland, so we mostly ate the appies, and they were ok.  Nothing that wowed us or made us want to come back to get the same again.  Like the same appetizers you can get at any bar in the Chicago area, without any twist to make theirs different. Prices were high, but we knew going in we would be paying a premium for the novelty.  Wishing this had been worth the hype and we would have been back again for sure."

Located right next to the Schaumburg airport, taking full advantage of the airplanes parked right next to it, this restaurant was airport themed in a slightly cheesy but fun way with airplane seats in the lobby and lots of airplane models hanging from the high ceiling.

That, however, is where the promise started and ended. 

Once we were seated, no one came to take our order for about fifteen minutes. This was prime business lunch time, and we saw plenty of servers walkin around, and the place was by NO means even half full - but no one came.

After going through the (admittedly) extensive menu, everyone in my group picked some pretty standard fare - buff chick sandwich, a salad, quesedillas, and a madeira chicken entree.

Once the server took our order, we sat unattended for another FORTY FIVE minutes. Again - the place was not even half full.

The chicken madeira was overcooked and drowned in a brown sauce without much flavor. My coworker had about a third of it before giving up and covering it up with his napkin. No, he did not want a box.

The buffalo chicken sandwich was barely breaded, and just barely edible. I had half of it because i was hungry, but didnt even consider eating more. Even the sweet potato fries were totally lacklustre.

Same story with the quesedillas - lacking flavour, and served with guacomole that was literally turning brown from being out too long.

The server was all smiles and charm when it came to giving us our checks, but too much damage had been done for her to be able to redeem much of a tip.

The only good thing that came out of this visit: Now we know not to come back."

Got an amazing groupon because we have been dying to try this place out.  Came here with some friends and we had to wait about 30 mins on a Friday night, not too bad.  The decor is cute and its super inviting.  Hostess was really pleasant, as was our waiter.  

I debated back and forth between Coconut Shrimp and the Buffalo Chicken Melt.  Both seemed like a lot of food, one came with potato, veg, and a salad, the other potato and soup.  I ended up with the Buffalo and man, oh man, this sandwich was HUGE.  It could&#39;ve fed a small army.  I barely finished the first half and brought the second half home.  At home, I could only eat half of the sammy... as an open-face sandwich.  The breading was a little thick and I think that&#39;s what put me off.

Others at the table ordered Fish and Chips -- another HUGE portion and one of their wraps.  The F&amp;C is all-you-can-eat for only $9.99, but nobody got refills cause they were so full.  My hubby said that the batter was very thick on his too.

We will back, definitely want to try their Nachos and Chicken Tenders."

Cons: Called a few day before making 3 hr drive to see if we could get a reserved seat for 8. Hubs told person on phone that our hotel was about 15 min away. We were told to call before we left there but that since we were planning on coming we in around 2 on a Sat, there should be be any issue being seated right away. 

We called before leaving the hotel &amp; were told they don&#39;t do reservations. We got to the restaurant &amp; were told we&#39;d have a 45 minute wait by someone not very friendly at the reception desk.

We waited our time to be seated. 

Our waitress was an older lady, not friendly or helpful. It had to be obvious we had never been there before, but she did not go out of her way to explain things or answer or questions. It took just as long if not longer to get our food. By that time, the kids weren&#39;t barely hungry &amp; tired of being there. 

We ordered 2 kids meals that are supposed to come with few ice cream but had to remind our waitress of it.

So, it was ok for something different but due to the service, wait time, &amp; overall &#34;ok&#34; food, probably wouldn&#39;t go back."

An alternative option to Village Tavern which is always so busy. Based on some of the other reviews it appears that Pilot Pete has been sold to someone else, but the food is almost as good as Village Tavern. The one thing that makes this place unique is that they have a special menu every day. Prices are reasonable and with ample seating the wait usually is shorter than VT. The food itself is great with a wide range of options from burgers to ribs to fish entrees. You can&#39;t go wrong. I went with the Pete&#39;s combo with 1/2 slab of ribs and 4 chicken fingers which is a bargain considering you pay only 4 dollars more and you get 4 fingers instead of paying 10 for 6 fingers. Service was friendly and fast and the restaurant is very kid friendly. They have won my business, I will be back. During the day you can even watch planes as they take off. 

Pro-good prices, solid food

Con- the clam chowder soup was extremely salty, I don&#39;t know how it was prepared but otherwise the other food was great

Hidden deals- Daily drink and food specials. Call ahead to get in line early if you have a party of 8+. Reservations available Sun-Thursday"

The entire experience was really mediocre at best. Everything was so-so and nothing really stuck out. The planes hanging overhead and the flight themed crap really just cheapen the experience even further and didn&#39;t make my brisket taste any less bland.

The restaurant itself is very well decorated in airplane and flight memorabilia. My two year old daughter loved the planes hanging from the ceiling. There are TVs in every direction so it was a perfect place to watch the Bears lose yet again. We ordered a half order of nachos which was a very large mountain of tasty nachos. We were quite full from just the nachos however the steak on it was very bland. I&#39;ll probably just go with chili next time around. We also had the &#34;$100 burger&#34; which was standard fare burger if you ignore the marketing. We also had the Cuban sandwich which was pretty good. The meat in the sandwich was cold which was different from other Cuban sandwiches I&#39;ve had. The fries and soup that came with both entrees were very tasty.

Onto the service.  For a place that wasn&#39;t to busy our waitress was not paying as much attention to our tables needs at all.  And the waitress never broke a smile.  We felt like we were imposing on her.

For the food their were some goods and bad.  We started off with their loaded nachos.  Though the meat was definitely pre-cooked, the amount they gave us including toppings, satisfied everyone.  So lets talks about the FOOD.   They have EPIC portions.  No skimping here!  The standouts were their beer battered hicken fingers and their brisket cheeseburger.

The atmosphere does slightly loom like a VFW upon arrival and the bar area seemed very outdated.  However does have great seating by windows that show the runways and airplanes."

Being that I really like food, this is not the place to go for the food. The decor/atmosphere are why we generally go. In a nut shell: this place has large portions, does fried food well, and the decor/atmosphere is great for kids [they even give kids a paper plane toy when you leave]. Service is usually fine; not amazing, not the worst. If you have little kids this place is perfect. 

The first time we went just to try it. The food was mediocre. We got the lobster nachos, which I personally was not keen on. They had fake lobster [which ok...] and then a bunch of other ingredients that didn&#39;t seem to work well together. I did like that each chip was dressed BUT I would have preferred the regular nachos. I cannot remember what my MIL and husband got but I got the fish tacos. I would not order those again. The fish was fried, which is fine, but the tacos were piled SO high with silly things like lettuce and cheese that it was extremely difficult to eat. My daughter had a great time and it was fine for that.

Another time we took my dad for his birthday. He enjoys fried foods and glutenous portions [in addition to semi-cheesey decor], so, he loved it. I think that time we got the nachos [regular] to split; which were fine. I got the grilled talapia with rice and veggies and it was also fine. Nothing too special.

Another time, more recently, was for valentines day. We went with my mother and father [and husband and daughter] and again it was just as expected. The food was fine but it was more for the atmosphere. This time my husband tried the chicken cobb salad [which the fried chicken was good] and I got the salmon club sandwich, which was ok [bread a little hard to eat/too large]. Again it was fun for my daughter [and dad] as she got a flower and then the paper airplane when we left. We also saw a plane taking off which was neat. I will mention that this time we went our server was missing for a while before our food came out. I&#39;m not sure if the people expediting just didn&#39;t bring the food out and/or if the serve left for break right before but it was a little odd. Since you can see the kitchen windows, we definitely saw a lot of food sitting under the heat lamps and noticed that others seated after us were eating before us"

They are very generous on both food portion and alcohol. Their cocktail can always get me drunk, always needed my roommate to take care of me LOL!"

I absolutely adored this place as soon as I walked in. The lounge chairs in the front had airline seats and there were airplanes hanging from the ceiling all over the place. The only reason I would give it a 3star is cause of the customer service. The hostess and our waitress seemed like she was annoyed to serve us for some reason. Other than that the food was decent. Make sure to sit by the window to watch the airplanes land and take off!

I knew I was in trouble when I received my dinner, tasted a fry, and it tasted bad.  If a restaurant can&#39;t even manage to make decent fries, they shouldn&#39;t be in business.  They tasted sweet, not potatoey, almost like sweet potato fries and they were not.  Great place for kids and that&#39;s why we went, for the gimmick.  They liked watching 2 helicopters land as we left.  Friendly and attentive service.  No I would not return."

This restaurant is at the Schaumburg Airport and you can see planes coming and going since the restaurant is right next to the run way.

Even though Pilot Pete has a very extensive menu, I usually order one of two items on the menu. The Meatball Calzone or the Chicken Fingers. So this weekend I conducted a duel between the Calzone and Chicken Fingers. We ordered the Chicken Fingers as an appetizer and I ordered the Calzone for my entree.

Now it&#39;s been a couple of years since I&#39;ve been at Pilot&#39;s Pete since I no longer hang my hat in Illinois. The Calzone has shrunk. Much like your favorite home run hitter that stopped juicing up. Now, the size is respectable, but it&#39;s also gotten a little more doughy, or lets just say a little less meaty. The Calzone was alright, but not as good as I remember it. 

The Chicken Fingers were awesome as usual and Pilot Pete definitely makes the best Chicken Fingers I have ever had. These chicken fingers are definitely not frozen and put into the fryer."

We just couldn&#39;t wait forty five minutes to sit in the dining room. So, we sat at the bar and ordered dinner from there. We got seated pronto with that move.
 
The service is just OK.  But, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s because the waitstaff in the bar area might only want to just wanting to serve drinks? Not sure...But, hey...the food here is really good.  We keep coming back, right?

It looks like the thing to order is fried food here--All the tables around me were eating fried fish (I think?!)

But, my husband LOVED the special chicken and quinoa broccoli dinner they had on the March menu. He wanted me to mention that Pilot Pete&#39;s NEEDS to put in on their permanent menu!  (Please, pretty please...)

In the past he has also ordered the rib-eye steak and said that it was better than Jameson&#39;s or Outback.  I guess their garlic mashed potatoes are pretty spectacular, too...(Unfortunately, my husband&#39;s not really &#39;into&#39; sharing his carbs...)

I really enjoyed my SUPER big salad.  So, if you&#39;re hungry but want to order healthy dishes, you will definitely leave Pete&#39;s satisfied.  They don&#39;t just serve the greasy stuff!
The place is noisy, but...it is a bar...with lots of televisions...so what do you expect?

If you know a kid (big or little) that loves airplanes this place would be a real treat that won&#39;t cost you too much. The portions are large! And, the prices are very reasonable."

These two dishes were favorites of my Husband and I. My Husband chose our third favorite The Shrimp Diablo and the portion size was smaller then normal. We did notice new additions, but taking away dishes that are even featured in pictures on your web site and internet is strange. I ended up with the fish fry and the pieces were small and more breading than fish. Our server was training a new employee so we didn&#39;t cause a problem. We just ate and enjoyed the planes and the luck of having a window seat for our two kids. Just disappointed."

My sandwich called Prime Rib LT, supposed to be sliced prime rib with lettuce, tomato, and bacon. Prime Rib dried out on the grill, bacon overcooked, two small slices of tomato, and a little shredded lettuce, all on toast. My wife&#39;s sandwich, while not great, was a little better. Waitress was apologetic - not her fault. We had been there several times in the past and the food was good, so I don&#39;t know if this was just a bad day, or the quality of the food has gone south."

I ordered the chicken tenders which were AMAZING. I&#39;ve also had the fish and chips which is equally delicious. Easily serves 2.

The food was good and the portions were huge!
I saw a nacho platter that would feed a horse. I had the ribs and chicken fingers combo very good the fingers were not some frozen kind these were done in house actually could be the best chicken fingers I ever hade.

My impression from long ago was not very good. I need to update it for what it has become. There is not much around their location - they sit next to the tarmac at the small Schaumburg Airport. I recall taking my wife and I taking our son their many years ago with several other families. It was fun being with a bunch of toddlers watching the planes take off and land. But, I don&#39;t remember the food or service being particularly good.

Fast forward to 2014 - they have enlarged the location and added a very cool party room in the back. It&#39;s circular so you can get a great view of the airport. The weather this particular night was not favorable for flying so we didn&#39;t see any action. A train track runs through there and we did see a freight train in the snow - Polar Express come to life.

We ordered several trays of their different catering options. We also had an open bar for a while. Due to dietary restrictions I couldn&#39;t eat anything we ordered, so I ordered a burger from the kitchen, which was fine. I will say that the others there with us (about 50 or so) were very pleased with the food. It certainly looked good. And the deserts! They looked scrumptious.

Outside of the back room, the location was very crowded. The bar was hopping and there was a wait for tables. So, we&#39;re planning a return visit to try out the restaurant after so many years."

Chicken fingers are great. So are the salads. We&#39;ve never had to wait an extremely long time to get seated. Generous portions on all the food items. The wait staff has always gone out of their way to accomodate needs from what I&#39;ve seen. Extra bonus if you get seated by the windows overlooking the runway as the kids can watch planes land and takeoff. Good overall experience.

The whole atmosphere is comfy, and the have beautiful decorations for Christmas time. It&#39;s never terribly busy, and their price range doesn&#39;t hurt the pocket book either, so that nice!!

The have a really nice back room that you can rent out as well, that looks over the airport.  You can watch the planes take off and land right in front of you.  The room is very pretty because of how many windows there are... you get the full panoramic view of the airport... very cool.

Our table was right by the kitchen so we could see and hear the waitstaff talking to each other. That was kind of weird but I wasn&#39;t really bothered. I got a sandwich that has salmon, bacon, avocado and some kind of sauce. It was ok. I am obsessed with avocado and they put a decent amount on so I was happy. The fries were average. We also got dessert. I think it was called the mile high pie. It was a chocolate pie with ice cream and whipped topping. It was very disappointing. For a dessert there was not much flavor and the whipped topping was still frozen. Pretty gross. None of us liked it.

I had the jerk wings and chose the hot flavor. It&#39;s two wings in one so if you think you will get 10 small wings then you are wrong. I think of it like 20 wings. My girlfriend had the meatloaf and it was great too. At first I was thinking this was one of those small airport hole in the wall restaurants, but it was nowhere near it. Consider it a Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville type of restaurant. No reservations when I called for one on a Friday night. And it gets packed. So expect a wait; however check the bar area as they might have open tables there. So check there before u ask a waitress or hostess for tables. Parking is good. 5 stars and a half. Moderate price.

The chips are freshly made, brought out to the table quickly with the accompaniment of 4 different squeeze bottle sauces and salsa. These sauces were incredible!!!! Each one better than the next. And combining them into those freshly made chips was exceptional. The taco trio lunch special was perfectly priced and of outstanding quality. The flavors of the al pastor were more delicious than words can describe. Our wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive and we had excellent service. Lastly, if you&#39;re a fan of Horchata, this place has some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I highly recommend this place.

I really wanted to like this place, but it really has a lot to be desired. 
The strawberry margarita was weak, could not taste any tequila, and for $6 it wasn&#39;t worth it. 
The refried beans had a very heavy lard taste, very bad! 
The pork that everyone has raved about was really bad! 
I do have to say the rice was good.

The restaurant is very modest in decor and clean. We went on a Saturday and for awhile were surpringly the only two people there. However, the phones were ringing for take out as several people came in for pick up or to place an order. I had a bean tostada and a green tamale. The hubs had a dinner plate of beef tacos with rice and beans. Delicious. 

I also tried the strawberry margarita and asked for it frozen. I ordered the small one for $6 and it was in my opinion quite large. Another poster commented that he could not taste any tequila which was not the case with mine!

About 4 months ago I ordered  the steak taco dinner. The tacos were ok. The rice was old (lots of hard crunchy pieces) &amp; the beans were extremely salty. I informed the server about the beans &amp; rice &amp; she took my plate. She didn&#39;t come back for 30 minutes! By that time my tacos were already cold! No apologies, nothing! So flashforward to today. Apparently the place had remodeled so we figured we would give them one more try. I saw a lunch special on their website Monday thru Friday 10am-3pm. Tacos w/ rice &amp; beans for $5.99 &amp; Torta w/ rice &amp; beans for $5.99. I had a lot of errands to run so I had hoped to call in the order &amp; pick it up. I called the number listed on their site 3 times &amp; it rang a couple times &amp; I got a recording saying no one was available. Since I couldn&#39;t get a hold of anyone from this place I just decided to go there after my errands. I got there about 2:50pm &amp; placed my order w/ the girl at the register. My total was $15.80. I asked if she gave me the price for the lunch special &amp; she stated that price was only for dine-in. I explained that it did not state that in their website &amp; I even showed her the page. Told her they need to state that online otherwise it&#39;s just false advertisement!  No apology, nothing. Since my husband was home starving I said forget it, I&#39;ll take it. So I paid the $15.80. While I was waiting I brought up the issue w/ their number. I explained I called 3 times &amp; got nothing. She asked if I had the correct restaurant. I said yes, even stated the address, name, &amp; number. I showed her the website &amp; the info matched the number listed on their menus. I even offered to call the same number while I was there. I put it on speaker so she could hear and all she said to me was that their phone was not ringing!  Duh! Obviously there is a problem! Again, aftee all this, no apology, no compensation, nothing. What the hell kind of place are you all running?! Oh &amp; by the way the food sucked! We are never going back to this place! Lame food, terrible service, bad management!"

Time of my visit: Very, very late dinner

Full disclosure, I have been a regular here for a few years, so I will be a bit bias, as I know what&#39;s good, what&#39;s not, who is a good server and who is not.

Right of the bet, stay away from fish fries, not the best thing on the menu.  Chicken fingers on the other hand is the best thing on the menu (I promise, I will review them at a later date).

My girlfriend and I came here after a movie.  We decided to have something other than chicken fingers.  We ordered an appetizer (half an order of stake nachos, see the picture attached).  Even at half and order, it was hard for two people to finish them.  It was loaded with stake (I must say, pretty generously), cheese, salsa and topped of with sour cream and guacamole.

I ended up ordering full slab.  I opted out for fries (but if you have never had their garlic mash potato, that&#39;s a must!).  The ribs were outstanding, not the best I have ever had, but the taste wise up there.  The way I judge ribs is by bbq sauce, how it&#39;s prepared (smoked, baked, etc.), how the meat falls off the bone, chewiness of the meat, overall quality of the meat.  And yes, not being a food critic, I can tell.  The bbq sauce was good, the meat did not have any fat on it, it was not falling of the bone at a first touch, but was not hard enough to where it was hard to bit into it, it was just firm enough.

On to the service, as I always say, it&#39;s a big part of the restaurant experience.  Today, our server was awesome!  She was very attentive, very nice, checked up on us, refilled our water and got a very nice tip because of that.

Overall, reasonably priced for the area.  If you are in Wheaton, IL, definitely a must try.  A sold A+ in my book!"

The nachos are amazing and huge. Definitely don&#39;t order them unless you are hungry.

The best thing on the menu and what is talked about the most are the chicken tenders. They come with honey mustard sauce on the side and it&#39;s a perfect combination. The platter comes with fries and a starter (either salad or soup). It&#39;s a lot of food.

They also have amazing burgers, sandwiches and salads. Definitely a good place to go with family or friends."

Ordered what they call pork medallions but turned out to be nothing more than a VERY dry butterflied pork chop covered in sauce. It was so dry had to send it back. I then decided to order the prime rib. That was probably the worst piece of prime rib i have ever had. It was very dry and extremely tuff. Really couldn&#39;t even eat it, but didn&#39;t have the nerve to send back a second dish. My friend had the pot roast sandwich and said it was just &#39;ok.&#39; Nothing special.

&#34;But this is the SUBURBS,&#34; I moaned.

This isn&#39;t Schaumburg, Geneva, or some other upscale downtown suburban spot.  But Village Tavern is a local favorite, and the secret&#39;s out.  I met some friends here who live nearby, and they were not surprised by the wait at all.  20 minutes was bearable, but I&#39;m still shocked that this casual Carol Stream spot had a wait at all.

Yes, it was worth it.  The Chicken Tenders are massive, but looking around the restaurant, supersize me portions are the norm at Village Tavern.  I only ate two chicken tenders and had a lot leftover for lunch the next day.  If you&#39;re a fan of Chili&#39;s chicken crispers, these taste exactly the same.

The rest of the menu has a little bit of everything - burgers, pork chops, salads, soups, sandwiches, there&#39;s even a fish fry.  It&#39;s all top notch comfort/diner food.

The interior isn&#39;t anything special, but it is a comfortable environment for families, to watch a game, and it was fine to grab dinner and catch up with friends.  The service was OK, we tried to order drinks but they never came.  Our food came up pretty fast and by then we were fine with the missing drinks.  This is one busy restaurant and, aside from the missing drinks, the waitress we had was pretty attentive and split up our checks without us asking.

Probably one of the best options in Carol Stream!"

After reading the reviews on here, we decided to give VT a try.

We got there around 6:30pm and it was really crowded. The wait was about 45min for a table, however we were able to snag two bar spots right away. We actually prefer to sit in the bar area, so this was a major win. 

Our bartender was super friendly and considering how busy she seemed, she was very attentive and was happy to serve us. We both ordered drinks and took a few minutes before dinner. The place was getting more and more crowded, but it seemed like they were handling it well. I noticed back by the kitchen, the cooks put the food up on a ledge where the food runners grab it. Well what I noticed was that it seemed like food was sitting there for a very long time. I&#39;m not sure what the reason was, but it was concerning. None the less, we decided to order dinner.

She went with the &#34;world famous&#34; chicken tenders and I went with the dinner special, which was the prime rib. I&#39;m a huge prime rib fan, and even though it&#39;s not a steakhouse, this place seemed to me like the type of place that would have phenomenal prime rib, it just had that feeling. Unfortunately I was WAY wrong.

Our food came out after about 20-25min, which was to be expected. EVERYTHING was cold. Her chicken fingers, her fries, my prime rib, and mashed potatoes. EVERYTHING. Also, I had ordered my prime rib medium, which is typically a pink center, and it came out well-done. There wasn&#39;t an ounce of pink, it was completely dark, dry, and honestly terrible. We didn&#39;t want to be a pain in the butt, so we just ate a few bites each and decided we were done. 

The bill came and with tip it ended up being around $70. I must say, I haven&#39;t been that disappointed in a long time. We had read such great reviews on this place and came in with such high expectations, and they completely disappointed. The only reason it&#39;s getting two stars is because the waitress was friendly, and because they had a couple slot machines in the corner which was some fun (even though we lost). 

I&#39;m not sure if we just caught this place on a bad night or what, but I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll be back. The food was terrible, mostly because it wasn&#39;t even close to warm, and my prime rib was as dry as can be. Disappointing to say the least."

70% of the current 170 reviews talk about chicken...and I will too!

I was in the area for an event and got out kind of late. Being that this was only two blocks up the street from where I was. I figure I&#39;ll try it out. Came in after 10 pm. Notice the all you can eat fish fry. I hadn&#39;t ate at all that day. So my attention when I ordered the fish was to put them out of business.

Fish comes with a salad or soup. I asked for the Caesar salad. Was told it was an extra $1 (call it being cheap but was a little irked by this) Salad was kind of big but I guess with all you can eat pushing something out this size is to slow a few people down. I ate about half my salad before the fish came out.  LARGE size portions so much I had to take one fillet home and didn&#39;t even ask for a 2nd round. (hit&#39;s imaginary table in defeat)  So kudos to them. Due to not being that satisfied I decided to check out the yelp and notice the mention of chicken tenders in all the reviews so got an order to go. 

Service was nice and fast overall. So no complaints there.

Food wise I didn&#39;t care for it. The battered breading for both the fish and chicken were okay, but both items had the same problem to me. The meat part was to chunky. I wouldn&#39;t say tasteless just didn&#39;t have a great taste that made me want to order it again. I had to keep dipping my fish in the tartar sauce. (I usually just eat the fish without) Not to be mean but Gortons frozen beer battered fish had better flavor to me. I didn&#39;t try the chicken right away. So having to reheat them the next day they became soggy. Due the large chunk size I ended up putting in the microwave probably a few seconds longer than normal to make sure they were hot all the way through but might have dried them out. (it&#39;s white meat so it was already dry) I will say I would love to try out the nachos something I also didn&#39;t know they were famous for until after."

Our server Gabrielle was very friendly. The Diablo shrimp, endorsed by Gabrielle,  was fantastic. The sauce was reminiscent of a light alfredo in texture but in flavor there was hint of sweet with a nice spicy kick swirling in a beautiful Orange color. The shrimp was very fresh, plump, and flavorful. The chicken fingers are made Halal chicken breast. I  could taste the difference. They had a lot of flavor, very tender, and  fried to a perfect golden better. The loaded baked potato that came with it I was just as good. They gave us so much, I think I Tapped Out after about 15 to 20 minutes. I am So...... looking forward to warming this up in the morning. Hats off to the chef!!!"

After ordering. it was 50 mins yes 50 mins until we received our food. We ordered nothing complications. Just chicken tenders and a tuna sandwich. My mother ordered a bbq sandwich which she was brought a meatloaf sandwich which we sent back. Today was very poor service and I think we will not be headed back anytime soon

We&#39;ve went on Saturday for lunch and although there were a lot of people, the space is pretty roomy and there were plenty of places to eat.  I haven&#39;t checked out the bar area, but it looks roomy as well.
I tried the fish and chips platter and wow, it was pretty hefty.  Huge pieces of fish in a beer batter of some sort.  Delicious and very filling.  I couldn&#39;t finish the plate which doesn&#39;t happen often, unfortunately.  It was still good the next day with a little nuke.
I also tried the shrimp diablo.  Nice big pieces of shrimp in a fairly mild/medium sauce.  It was pretty yummy.
They have a little kids menu with some crayons.  There is a connect the dots and some other kid activities.  Plenty of tv&#39;s, although certain seats don&#39;t have the greatest viewing angles.  The servers and staff are all very nice from what I&#39;ve seen.  Both times I&#39;ve went, we brought in our stroller, and everyone was very accommodating.

One huge bonus is the multitude of tvs playing every sport you could ever want to see. Great place to meet friends or take the kids and still be able to watch your team live. They do have daily specials from apps, entrees, drinks, and desserts. I can appreciate that. Beware you will wait up to 45 min on a weekend night. Friday is fish fry and Saturday is prime rib."

Went there tonight for the first time, as it is near my husband&#39;s business. We were seated immediately (GOOD). Our waitress recommended the burgers, so I ordered a cheeseburger cooked well-done. My husband ordered the pork chop meal. Our food was served in a timely fashion (GOOD). I only ate half the burger--it was charred crispy on the outside and rare, under-cooked on the inside (BAD); served on a fluffy sesame seed bun that immediately fell apart into many pieces as soon as the burger was picked up (BAD); and they serve the burger dry, no mayo, no mustard, no ketchup, nothing (BAD). The fries were blah--what you get at a cheapo hot dog stand. My husband enjoyed his pork chop and au gratin potatoes (GOOD), but the carrots were very mushy, over-cooked and tasted the same as canned candied yams from Thanksgiving (BAD).

In the meantime, our waitress only came by once (BAD), right after our food was served, before I even noticed how raw my burger was. After that, she forgot about us (BAD), never came back to re-fill our soda (THE WORST!!!) until after we had completely finished our meal and were sitting there awkwardly waiting for the bill. Once we got the bill, we had to sit there awkwardly again for another 15 minutes, waiting for the waitress to process our payment. 

Terrible service and cooks that failed the How To Cook Burgers 101 class. Will NOT go to Village Tavern again."

I was first introduced as a tween; then I spent a couple of nights a week here in my mid twenties, and enjoyed the food on all of my visits.  I just recently visited after a long hiatus and I can see that not much has changed about VTG.  It&#39;s still dark, crowded, and smells of old grease. 

I tried the new Nacho Burger (cooked medium).  Much like the rest of their menu items, this burger was dripping with so much grease, it caused the bottom half of the pretzel bun to fall apart. So I had to go the fork and knife route.  I will say it was a tasty burger and cooked to my liking, but eating it with utensils was a bit of a turn off. 

The Chicken Fingers are alright, I&#39;m not a huge fan.  I&#39;ve enjoyed the Chicken Diablo, many of the soups, BLT, hotdog (yes a hotdog), wraps, fajitas, etc.  Pretty much everything except fish, ribs, or bbq. There&#39;s a little something for everyone, and it&#39;s all good stuff if you have an iron stomach and a short ride back to your destination.

My favorite? Honestly a full order of the nachos, with ALL of the meats, and all of the fixin&#39;s.  It can be expensive with all of the additional meat add-ons, but trust me it&#39;s the only way to go.

Maybe I&#39;m spoiled from growing up in the area, but VTG is just an average spot with average food.  It can be a fun place to come, have drinks and watch a sports game if you&#39;re bored with B-Dubs.  It&#39;s worth a try if you&#39;re in the area."

Wait staff is attentive and service is fast. And this place is always busy...it amazes. me. 

Another great service of the Tavern is that they are great at posting their specials on Social Media. So you may have Facebook on, it&#39;s getting close to lunch and THERE is the soup of the day. Makes you hungry.

That&#39;s pretty much all I would get whenever my parents would take us out to a restaurant. I could tell you which place had the best breading, which place had the stringiest meat, and whose honey mustard sauce was the most disgusting. So trust me when I say that Village Tavern has some of the best chicken fingers that I&#39;ve ever had in my life. 

For $10 you get a platter of huge pieces of chicken breast, coated in a fluffy batter and fried to a golden brown. I often asked for my chicken well done, so I could get my crunch on. The fingers come with a side of their famous honey mustard, which is good. But not great.

I&#39;ll tell you what: these always gave me a wicked case of heartburn after I ate them and more than once almost triggered a gallbladder attack. #worthit

Batter was complementary to the fish and not overwhelming like in some places where you hunt to find the fish hidden in all the breading. We had a birthday in our party of 4 adults plus 5 kids ages 4 mo. to 13.  They brought out what looked like a quarter of a chocolate cake! Enough for at least 4 people, lol!

I had the lobster roll, which was the special for the month. There&#39;s some mention about the owners of Village Tavern and Grill being from Boston in the restaurant, and so I sort of imagine the recipe is from that part of the country. It was more creamy than lobster-y, if that makes any sense.

Why? I don&#39;t know, I guess we&#39;re change averse. I have no good reason. We got there at 4:30 on a Saturday because... we were STARVING and had decided it was late enough for dinner. Thank goodness we were there so early, because by 5:30 when we left, there was a relatively long wait. 
Our waitress was great. I wish I did things like...remember peoples&#39; names...because she deserves to be recognized for being a good waitress, but ...alas... I don&#39;t. So anyhow, service was great.We were told their tenders were great, so we ordered the sampler platter to try everything. Of the sampler we liked everything except the quesadilla, but I think that&#39;s because we don&#39;t really love quesadillas... so...there&#39;s that. The tenders are amazing. So, it&#39;s probably what I&#39;ll order next time. Onion straws? Yum. Potato skins were good as well. 
 We both ordered the chicken dinner, which was on special for $9.99. It included soup or salad, but with beer cheese soup we both got the soup... It was very good but very heavy... so if it&#39;s beer cheese soup day, just a forewarning, it will fill you up. The chicken was extremely good. It was fried in their tender batter...and covered in gravy. It came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. All in all, we thought everything we got was good. 
The only thing that disappointed us about the place was the fact that we hadn&#39;t tried it earlier! We&#39;ll be back, and we&#39;ll try other things... and I&#39;m hopeful we&#39;ll continue to have such wonderful experiences!"

The soup of the day was stuffed pepper and it was phenomenal! Don&#39;t have many complaints. Only minor issues were The service was a little bit slow (they were very busy though) and the side salad is just a plate of iceberg lettuce which was really a disappointment.

I went with a friend on Saturday night and the place was packed.    There was a 25 minute wait for a table so we opted to sit at the bar.    

There was one server working the bar, which was semi busy.   They have flat screens all over so you can catch whatever sports game is on at the moment.    It took a few minutes after we got our initial drinks to put our orders in.    I wound up getting a Jerk NY Strip that was on special and my non fish eating friend shocked me in ordering their fish fry platter.

The food took a long while to arrive but was worth it once they did.   The steak was perfectly seasoned and mostly melted in my mouth as I chewed.    It needed no A1 sauce to add flavor, which was good.   My friend enjoyed his fish platter as well.   Overall it wasn&#39;t a bad alternative for dinner."

But we ordered them on a night when there was a fish special... and yes... they actually fry everything in the same oil.  Nothing quite as bad as fishy chicken tenders.

But here is the real problem.   We sit down to eat, order our food and suddenly a guy pops up behind us with full blown bag pipes and just starts wailing away.  Loudly, right in our ears.  So I wait... one song I can handle.  Then a guy with a parade drum and another person joins him and they start blasting this ridiculous noise right at us.  I go to ask the bartender if this is going to be a full set or what, because we are leaving if it is.  &#34;Oh no.. they only play one song.&#34;  That was bs, next thing you know, the full parade band from the fire department joins in and 10 people are blasting this crap throughout the dining room, at sound levels that were way above the legal limit that - yes - the fire department is supposed to enforce.

A word of caution:  The nachos are not as good as they once were (sadly).  We&#39;ve had them and watched them decline over the last 12+ years even though the price has kept going up and up.  Lesson learned, we don&#39;t get the nachos anymore (even though my hungrier half always talks fondly about them).

My hubs got his stand-by, the Juanita wrap &amp; fries, which he devoured in the blink of an eye, so I&#39;m guessing it was alright.  Everyone else at the table got some form or another of the oh so delicious chicken fingers.  Our friend got the classic platter with fries, his wife got the chicken finger salad (and rightfully ordered them tossed in buffalo sauce and drowned in ranch), and I got the ceasar salad with chicken fingers (also tossed in buffalo sauce because, let&#39;s face it, everything tastes better in buffalo).

Judging by the overall silence during chow time, I&#39;d say everyone was pretty darn satisfied with the chicken fingers.  Even our kiddos, who barely eat human food, devoured the delectable chicken, one tiny piece at a time (sans fried goodness - for their health&#39;s sake).

Dining at the Village Tavern is like coming home.  It&#39;s warm, comfy, slightly drunk &amp; just feels so damn good."

We took it off our &#34;night out&#34; list due to the poor service. Saw their ad recently and was tempted by the Sat. night $15.95 rib special. They do serve good ribs!!! So back we went and it was crowded at 8:00 p.m. While the service wasn&#39;t great, it was much improved from before. 

We both ordered the rib special, and had to wait an extra 10 minutes for napkins and the bone basket. Vegetable of the day was broccoli, which arrived limp and overcooked. Ribs were awesome, but the cooks on staff need an au gratin potato recipe. What was plated was hot, potato chunks covered with melted cheddar and some chives. No seasoning, nothing au gratin about it. What happened to the au gratin recipe of years past?

We might go back, but not any time soon. And next time I&#39;ll order french fries."

Good thing we went on a rainy day, or I might have found the lack of sunlight downright depressing. But I went here for one thing and one thing only...

I&#39;ve heard of their magical chicken fingers time and time again, most notably from respected Yelper Heidi K. So try them, I had to. And I wasn&#39;t disappointed! Just the right amount of crunch, just the right amount of grease, and obviously tasty chicken. I may actually be salivating just typing this. And the &#34;finger sauce&#34; that accompanies an order? Yum!

I also sampled my sister&#39;s cheese burger. It was okay, but paled so much in comparison to the chicken that I&#39;d say, don&#39;t bother with it. What IS definitely worth mentioning is that their chicken tortilla soup is THE BEST SOUP I&#39;VE EVER HAD! I wouldn&#39;t have minded a ten gallon jug of it to take home.

Service was just okay. We had to ask for water refills, which is never good.

I&#39;ve since made two catering orders, one large and one small, both consisting entirely of chicken fingers. Ordering and pickup were smooth. For my baby&#39;s birthday, everyone raved about the chicken (of course!) Glad to have a go-to crowd pleaser."

The honey mustard dipping sauce is my favorite sauce for chicken fingers/nuggets/strips. Id really love to watch some Bulls games there. I work a few minutes from it, so I usually take out.

If last night&#39;s fried pickle spears, which came crisped up in batter that&#39;s typically reserved for fish &#39;n&#39; chips, were any indication, I do believe that the tenders will rock.

This is the kind of fun, casual, mildly boisterous hangout that every town needs (it feels like Carol Stream&#39;s answer to Anyway&#39;s), and the free WiFi encourages a certain subset of diners and drinkers to linger. Hell, if I had a frickin&#39; car, I&#39;d study here, or at least attempt to. No promises, because beer.

We started with the aforementioned fried pickles, which took rather long to arrive, but we came at peak dinnertime so I won&#39;t be too hard on them for that. I was expecting the usual coins of pickle chips but loved the full-on spears, and even though I don&#39;t dig ranch, it served as a nice, cooling contrast to the blisteringly hot pickles. 

French onion soup needed a more restrained hand with the salt and had a generic beef broth-y flavor, but this isn&#39;t a Parisian brasserie--my hopes weren&#39;t high to begin with. I hardly needed a knife to cut through Swedish meatballs, plush and juicy as they were, yet I still used one because I can&#39;t stand to cut food with a fork. And although otherwise delicious, my patty melt required a couple of cranks of the salt grinder to bring it up to par, and a ubiquitous but nonetheless agreeable Sierra Nevada Pale helped it go down easily. 

Our server was friendly but not particularly attentive aside from knowing when to ask whether I needed another beer, which is all that really matters, right?"

On my  most recent visit, I ordered the Chicken Finger Platter with Chili as my soup, the vegetable of the day (sicilian blend) without butter (they cook their veggies in butter or oil FYI but you can request to have them not cooked in either), and I also ordered one of their new sides: Sauteed Spinach and Mushrooms (cooked in oil).

I will say that the VTG has added a few items, including san marzano chicken and salmon, as well as the already mentioned sauteed spinach and shrooms. I love the effort!

Back to my meal... Chili was very good as usual. They use a ground beef base with blend of hearty beans. You can request onions, cheese, sour cream, and jalepenos if you&#39;d like as well. As for the main dish... amazing as usual! 6 crispy, unbelievably yummy fingers with ranch and their honey  mustard sauce! I ended up dousing my potato with the mustard too! Their ranch is out of this world, too! I just actually tried the  mustard for the first time in December, and now I&#39;m hooked! I absolutely despise mustard in all its forms... except this one! Maybe I should give others a try? Naaa... I&#39;m sticking with VTG.

In conclusion, the Village is a really cool neighborhood place that has remained consistently consistent ever since I&#39;ve been going there. Their prices are very fair and haven&#39;t changed, which is much appreciated. It can get very crowded during peak times (like all good restaurants) so expect a wait if you go during these times (Friday Fish Fry, Saturday Night). 

The staff also tends to be female, and very good looking. The service is sometimes subpar, but that is not enough to take it from the upper echelon of fantastic restaurants in the Greater DuPage Area!"

I got fried chicken Caesar wrap with sweet potato fries and cole slaw. Chicken pieces were too large and the breading tasted so greasy and fell off. The cole slaw tasted sour. French fries were good. My table ordered burgers and chicken tortilla (creamy) soup which they enjoyed.

That is until today. 

Probably the main reason I haven&#39;t gone here is that I&#39;m just not a big fan of chicken fingers and I know if I come here I&#39;d have to order the &#34;world famous chicken fingers and secret mustard&#34;  at least once. Well that day has finally arrived so here we go:

Chicken Finger Platter (Around $12): Six gigantic chicken fingers each the size of a jumbo hotdog. The batter is light and crispy like a fried fish batter. The chicken itself is where the magic is at. It is unusually juicy and tender as if they brine it or something.  I have to say as someone who doesn&#39;t really care for chicken fingers that much, these are by far the best I&#39;ve ever had. (See picture)

Secret Mustard Sauce: Tastes like honey mustard to me. Not sure what makes it so special. 

Potatoes Au Gratin: came with the platter, was cheesy and good. 

Vegetable beef stew: Pretty generic tasting  except they use ground beef. (See picture)

Overall I&#39;d say this is a more than decent local eatery, it always seems to be pretty packed at night and the service was fast and friendly. If you like chicken fingers or have kids that do, I&#39;d definitely give this place a try. 

BTW: They also have video poker and some slots here which I apparently suck at. Good bye 20 dollars :(."

First, lets get down to the nitty gritty, their chicken fingers. I agree with everyone else, they definitely did change my life. There are absolutely no words that can describe the juicy, tender, full, amazing chicken inside this crunchy, savory, deep fried shell. (That was my failed attempt at describing it BTW.) All these adjectives, and it still does them no justice. Not to mention their secret recipe for their honey mustard sauce that I would probably buy by the pint if I could.

I was first introduced to this place about 6 or 7 years ago, and I&#39;ve been a regular ever since. I don&#39;t think I have ever actually gone there and not gotten the chicken finger platter with a side of their different potatoes. I&#39;ve tried all their potatoes, and my favorite by far are the loaded french fries. 

Another favorite on the menu is their loaded monster nachos...seriously....monster is an understatement for these bad boys. And they&#39;re delicious-ness matches their size. 

My only warning would be that their portions are pretty large. If you&#39;re a first timer and are going with a party of two or three, I STRONGLY recommend you start off with the nachos, then share the chicken fingers. And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you end up taking some of it home.  

As far as prices are concerned, they make me love this place even more. They have gotten TONS of recognition for their chicken fingers over the years, and they have stayed true to themselves and kept amazing prices. My hat comes off to a LOCAL business that can pride themselves in that.

The atmosphere is the perfect cup of tea. It&#39;s so relaxed and laid back. They have televisions with the game on, memorabilia of the town&#39;s history on the walls, a gorgeous patio for beautiful weather, and a HUGE bar that makes you feel like you&#39;re surrounded by friends the minute you walk in. 

As I&#39;m writing this review, I&#39;m seriously realizing this is probably my favorite restaurant ever. It definitely doesn&#39;t get any better than this, guys.....seriously."

She stated that she thought I ordered the chicken platter. Maybe change the name of the platters to defuse confusion? While the rest of my party was eating, I had to wait for my correct order. What really triggered me was not the mess up. It was the fact that the server said she will charge me for the chicken since it was cheaper. Really???? You screw up my order, now I have to take it to go and you are charging me for something I never ordered? After telling her that&#39;s in acceptable, her manager took it off.

Superb service as well. Highly recommended."

The menu is an awesome take on comfort food, at the same time ingredients are fresh . I noticed the fish batter is not uniform which means it is hand battered and delicious. Portion sizes are wealthy. All in all I really enjoy coming here  to grab a drink and food."

I am not lying.

6 pieces of the juiciest chicken you have ever had, coated in a batter that&#39;s light, fluffy, and crunchy all at the same time.  Honey mustard sauce so good that, even as someone who doesn&#39;t like mustard, you&#39;ll want to dip yourself in it.  A heaping plate of fries so golden you&#39;ll be ba da da da da lovin&#39; it.  

Do not even think of ordering anything else.

Bonus is that you will surely have leftovers, and said leftovers, when baked at 400 in the oven, taste just as good as when first served.

If you don&#39;t get in your car immediately and head to this restaurant, you cray cray, boo."

This place is incredible.  They serve the biggest plate of nachos you have ever seen for $9.95.  They are filled with cheese and toppings throughout the whole huge pile, not just on the top.  Nachos are one of my favorite appetizers and these are the best I have ever had.  You will not be disappointed.   

Next, the ribs..... they are also the best ever.  They have a special on Saturdays for $15.95 and they are extremely tender and flavorful.  I have had them several times and they are consistently great.   

They also have a great &#34;all you can eat&#34; fish fry on Wednesdays and Fridays.  The fish are incredible and tasty.  

Servers have always been friendly and attentive.  The place can be a bit noisy with all the TV&#39;s and people talking, but after all it is a sports bar, so that is to be expected.  

One of my favorite places, always very good food and service!"

As everyone knows, their chicken tenders are all the rave. But I wanted to try other things they had. I tried my first spud! I chose the chili spud, huge serving of potato topped with a good deal of thick and tasteful chili. The potato was cooked just right, you could dig your fork into it without feeling you have to cut up hard pieces of potato. I added a side order of their onion shoestring, made it a topping for my chili spud and it was the best combination ever."

It&#39;s not a place serving deep dish pizzas, it&#39;s not a place serving Italian Beef sandwiches, it&#39;s not even a place serving Chicago style hot dogs. It&#39;s Village Tavern which is what I would describe as the ultimate bar food. 

Some time ago one of my very first reviews here on Yelp was of this particular establishment, as quite frankly it&#39;s one of my favorites. However, as time has gone on and I&#39;ve sampled more of their menu I figured now was as good of a time as any to update my review here. The first thing to note about Village Tavern is that it&#39;s both loud and busy. There are lots of TVs set up, generally airing sports in just about every conceivable direction. There&#39;s a large bar with a jukebox and a Golden Tee machine set up nearby for those who want to play it. 

They have a diverse menu including a wide variety of items such as burgers, chicken, soups salads,steak,  and even ribs.  Village Tavern is particularly well known for their chicken fingers. What makes the Village Tavern chicken fingers great is three things, firstly delicious white meat chicken. The second this is a really cripsy batter that is the perfect compliment to the chicken itself and finally a special honey mustard sauce that has just the right amount of sweetness and sourness to be one of the best &#34;dippin&#34; sauces ever tasted by mankind. 

The burgers served here at Village Tavern are excellent as well. The beef has a great flavor to it, and they never overcook it so the juices stay right in the burger. There&#39;s a decent variety of burgers as well as a slider appetizer. I&#39;m a big fan of the burgers here and recommend them.

Being the hot dog critic, it would be silly of me to leave out that they serve something called a Fenway Dog. The Fenway Dog is served on a sweet tasting rolll with mustard, onions and relish. There&#39;s a pickle spear that can be added to it as well. The dog itself is a skinless and jumbo style hot dog. For roughly 5.00, it&#39;s a little pricey but certainly a decent hot dog.

They also have a giant tower of nacho&#39;s as an appetizer called the nachorama containing a variety of toppings. This is another great choice as it will feed a whole table full of hungry people by itself. 

My overall opinion of Village Tavern is quite high. My only complaints are that it can be very loud inside to where if you&#39;re having conversations with people you&#39;re dining with it can be difficult to hear, and that at times it&#39;s so busy there is a long wait and sometimes you have to park quite a ways from the restaurant as parking nearby can be impossible. Overall, I highly recommend Village Tavern in Carol Stream and give it five stars."

Ordered the chicken tender meals to go.  They threw the mashed potatoes over the chicken,  making them extremely soggy.  Chicken was very chewy.  The waitress/hostess seemed more concerned with talking with her friends than taking care of customers.  Over all fail.
Update * two hours later * boyfriend has been hunched over the toilet several times.  At least the Diablo chicken lived up to its name.... I only had the strips so I&#39;m not in as bad of shape."

It&#39;s the &#34;local joint&#34; that my sister has always been obsessed with! She LOVES the &#34;World Famous&#34; Chicken Fingers as it is what they are known for as well as the Nachorama which is way too much NACHO for anyone to intake at one time! They also have specials each night plus a Friday Night Fish Fry which I probably won&#39;t try ever, but just a little FYI!

You will find that this is the typical Carol Stream watering hole. They have holiday specials like on St. Patrick&#39;s Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Halloween, and other holidays. The wait staff are pretty attractive, too!

They do carry out, but dining in is awesome! I&#39;ve had their chicken fingers (awesome), chili (GREAT), fajitas (another good one), burritos, steak, burgers, and even their salmon when I tried to stay nutritious. That was dumb. I should have gotten the chicken that time.

This is a bar with really great bar food. I would take this for dinner over any place in the area. We used to go here in high school ALL the time and get milkshakes too. Slowly over time, those milkshakes turn into alcohol. I guess that&#39;s just part of growing up. Really good prizes plus eating outside in the summer is AWESOME!!!

I highly recommend VTG for some chicken fingers, burgers, and beer if you&#39;re in the area!!!"

The service is always exemplary, fast and very friendly, and when they make a mistake (one time the waitress brought me a chicken burrito instead of chili, I think) they fix it right away.

The mixed drinks are a little inconsistent -- sometimes they&#39;re very strong, other times not so much. Usually we just get beer, so it&#39;s not something we pay much attention to. 

The real reason we come to the Village Tavern is the food! everything on their menu qualifies as comfort food. Their chili cheeseburger is outstanding. The fish fry is also fantastic. Last time I was there I tried the Swedish meatballs and was very pleased. But I have to admit that I usually get the nachos. It&#39;s HUGE. Even when I start out starving, I can&#39;t manage more than a third (...maybe more like a quarter?) of the full order. Which is fine, since I don&#39;t mind taking the leftovers home and snacking on them for the next two days."

The sandwiches are good, the chicken tenders are good, salads are okay, but the fried fish is great. Good hush puppies and fries as well.

The one important thing to note is that they do their tenders and fried fish in a batter, not dredged, so it has more breading that other places. Still - the meat is always moist and tender and the food is consistently good.

Service is usually good, too."

But I&#39;d also like to report that the fish fry isn&#39;t something to disregard either. 

I&#39;ve only come here for lunch and we usually get seated right away.  But the wait here on Friday night was 45 minutes.  45 minutes! I don&#39;t know if it was because it&#39;s Lent or because that&#39;s their usual wait time on Fridays. But our group had their mind set on Fish Fry so we waited it out.  They have enclosed the front overhang so there&#39;s more room to wait. it&#39;s still cold, but the makeshift walls did help block out the wind. 

The fish fry was delicious. It&#39;s AYCE battered cod. The cold is still pretty mild tasting but the batter adds the wonderful crispy coating.  Now I&#39;ve waxed poetic about their honey mustard so it&#39;s no surprise that their tartar sauce is pretty good too.  I hate tartar sauce so I usually use Malt Vinegar but VT&#39;s tartar sauce isn&#39;t that bad, much milder and creamier than store bought. 

Fries and salad are pretty average.  But service is always friendly and the price is totally reasonable.  Family friendly. Lots of TVs so you don&#39;t miss any important sports games. My favorite is still the chicken tenders but if you&#39;re looking for a fish fry, VT doesn&#39;t disappoint."

I will say I don&#39;t plan on dining their for lunch or dinner again. They insist on putting on the propaganda channel Fox  &#34;news&#34; and it&#39;s very insulting to anyone who has a brain.

I remember reading all of the Yelp reviews that raved about their chicken fingers.  Our meal was terrific.  Our server, Ashley, did a great job serving us.  I was impressed with all of the menu options.  I ordered the chicken fingers with au gratin potatoes as my side dish.  The entree came with soup or salad.  I ordered salad because I love creamy garlic dressing.  This was the only part of the meal I was disappointed with.  I was hoping to get a nice, thick, very garlicy dressing.  The dressing was thin and not very flavorful.  The salad itself was really cold and had great croutons on it so that made up for it.

The chicken fingers were really good.  I don&#39;t think I&#34;ve ever had chicken fingers where the actual chicken meat was as tender as these were.  The pieces themselves were huge.  I had lots leftover to bring home.

We&#39;ll come back to this restaurant.  I thought their prices were very reasonable.  It seemed like a nice family restaurant, too."

We tried them out for a Friday evening delivery and chose our typical judgement dishes. Here&#39;s how they fared:

Egg Rolls - A: I&#39;d give these an A+ if I hadn&#39;t been blown away by the egg rolls at Peking Express a couple weeks ago. A very solid showing for a Chinese food staple.

Crab Rangoon - C+: A bummer for me as this is one of my favorites. The flavor was good but the ratio of filling to wanton was way heavy on the wanton. Lots of chewing required here.

Combination Lo Mein - A+: This was a real winner. The meat was all cooked perfectly and very tasty. None of the random &#34;what part of the chicken was THAT&#34; or overly fatty pieces of beef to be found. And the shrimp were normal size. Not the tiny shrimp you typically see in noodles or fried rice. Awesome. The noodles were a little thicker than what I&#39;m used to, but still very good.

Mongolian Beef - A+: Lots of delicious beef here with a great sauce. Perfect.

Tony&#39;s Fried Rice - B+: I was torn here. The rice is good, and you can tell that its probably not the day old rice that just got a bath in soy sauce and reheated. That said, it was a little bland, and could probably use some, umm, soy sauce?

Overall, very good and I highly recommend. The portions were large without being ridiculous. I&#39;ll be back. Or, at least I&#39;ll make them deliver again."

We are in town visiting my parents, and ordered dinner for take-out.  We got the orange chicken (very flavor-dense), sweet-and-sour pork (unlike other sweet &amp; sour flavors I&#39;ve had in the past, but this is actually a very good thing), hot and sour soup (pretty standard, well made and flavorful), ma po tofu (I&#39;ve only had this once before and decided to give it another go, since the first attempt was not a good one.  This time, I am not disappointed.  I am actually pretty sure that this is going to be a standard dish that I get from Tony&#39;s from now on), the mongolian beef (good, although the beef could have used a bit more tenderizing and crisping; I miss the crispy rice noodles you get at other places-- however, there is a lot of meat in this dish, and they don&#39;t load up with onions in place of meat like other places will), and the shrimp with pea pods (surprisingly tasty!).  We also ordered a couple of egg rolls, and wound up with two more thrown in for free (I don&#39;t know if this was an accident, but we did appreciate it!).  

I think the ma po tofu was the surprising winner, for me, although my boyfriend preferred the meat portions.  The hot and sour soup was also quite good, as was the shrimp.  

As far as suburbs go, this place is a big winner!  We will return."

We ordered it on a Saturday night based off the awesome Yelp reviews.
We have crab rangoons that were chewy, sweet and spicy pork which was hard to cut off the bone, cashew chicken that was bland and sweet and sour soup.  The soup was supposed to be egg drop but somehow between our online or and the receipt we received it was changed.
The soup was maybe the best and most flavorful so maybe the accident ended up in our favor.
The order did come earlier than ETA.  Sent us plenty of sauce and fortune cookies.  Their hot mustard was actually got which I enjoyed.

The food was fine but nothing over the moon.  I&#39;ve had better.
Good enough when hungry from running errands all day."

Then when I ordered I waited too long for my food, I had 1 hour lunch and by the time I got my food, I only had 15 mins left to eat. Their food was not fresh either and I think it&#39;s because it was 90 degrees outside and their food got rotten. The Mongolian beef tasted rotten. I got diarrhea right away.

Everything I had was fresh from this location. I have seen some other locations not have so great of food.  Now, I try not to go to these locations right before they close.  Their night food does tend to be a little older. 

The food quantity was massive.  It was so good, Orange chicken is my favorite thing to get from Panda.  It&#39;s very Americanized chineese food so if ordering from China1 is too china for you then this is a great choice. 
I do have to say the place seemed a little understaffed. I ordered online thankfully otherwise they had a line to the door and it seemed to not be moving very fast.  I did have to wait a little bit for the food to get put in but once they noticed me waiting in the line the 1 person actually making the plates for people fulfilled my order and I was out the door.

My usual order is Chow Mien, Orange Chicken and Beijing Beef. 

This location in general, is a bit dirty. The area for beverages, all sticky, and napkins everywhere. It&#39;s a bit dark and just looks sad. 
Comparing to the Panda Express at home--Rockford. The one by Red Robin and Sams Club  is a lot cleaner, more attentive, more organised and the lighting is brighter. When you walk in to the one at my home, it just feels happier. And at home they give you a fortune cookie. 

I have not gotten one here, I feel sad here, and there are no chocolate cookies here-one at home has them. 
Overall I like Panda Express. But this location is just not that great. 
And I don&#39;t plan on coming till they fix up clean-organised-attentiveness

Actually, this is after eating here. 
The food just tasted old. Honestly, the Panda Express at home-the food is being cooked the whole time; here, the food is only being cooked when on demand. So that statement, you go to the Rockford Panda, and your food is fresh, hot and tasty, because it&#39;s being cooked and new patches every minute. 
This location, just dull, run out of chow mien and they&#39;ll make it, the fresh batch won&#39;t be ready, or a batch won&#39;t be made, jus a single if needed. 

The floors here are awful-petrified by how the kid walks by checking around, and does t notices the floors?  Really I see the the whole floor and I see how dirty it is. 

I mean, to keep the name Panda and uphold its tasty Orange chicken, you must keep the place at top notch to the name of Panda Express. So I wouldn&#39;t be coming back here."

When we walked in, there was barely any food. Barely half the glassed area was displaying food and most of the pans did not have enough food for more than 1 person. We expressed our discontent to the employees and they shrugged us off. They didn&#39;t offer to make fresh food for us. We were there well before their closing time (9:30pm), and yet they looked like they were already done working for the day. We drove to the other end of Schaumburg (Barrington &amp; Schaumburg Rd) to the other Panda Express (significantly and consistently better food) and arrived around 9pm and they had plenty of food and even offered to make other things fresh just for us.

All staff were courteous and helpful.  I wanted to write this especially to say thank you to the manager John.  He is a hard worker with an upbeat attitude.  He took pride in this location.  As a manager he was out cleaning up the restaurant after other patrons and checking in on tables making sure they were enjoying their food and their experience there.  Which is much more than I can say for some more expensive places in the area.  As John was checking in on our table my 8 year nephew made sure to make John aware that it was his birthday.  John then went out of his way to make my nephews birthday special.  

That kid left the restaurant really happy.  THANKS JOHN!!!!

And the only reason I&#39;m rating this experience a 4/5 is because their grilled teriyaki chicken was a little to fatty for my personal liking."

Okay, Panda Express is not really authentic. Rather, it&#39;s as authentic as the Long Duk Dong from Sixteen Candles. A little off from the real thing but still a classic. 

I come here for one dish in particular. It&#39;s truly an American creation that even has authentic Chinese restaurants adding it to their menu. There are plenty of replicas but no one can beat Panda&#39;s. This is still the best place under all of the heavens for Orange Chicken. 

Panda Express does a great job of taking inspirations from Chinese cuisine. Recently, Panda has added new dishes that draw from Korean and Thai cuisine as well. I know what you are thinking. How can I keep going to this place even after eating some of the best Asian food in Thailand, San Francisco, and Toronto. It&#39;s simple. It&#39;s conveniently located in strip malls or food courts, the prices average around $6-7 a person, the food is consistently good, service is always quick and customer friendly, and they have Orange Chicken.

While we were eating my little one decided to make a mess of is diaper and his clothing.  So I had gone to the restroom to fix the situation.  Upon walking into the restroom, I quickly realized that there was something very missing.  They have no changing station.  Not only was there no changing station, but there was no counter in the bathroom to act as one.  So why would a restaurant chain that has high chairs for young children not have a place to diaper them??? Where is one supposed to change a diaper in a Panda Express? The floor? The table?  I mean come on really? So I did what I had to do and changed his diaper in my tiny Ford Focus on a 9 degree day.   How overjoyed I was to have to make my poor little boy freeze because this stupid restaurant doesn&#39;t have a place to change diapers.  This place is not family friendly as it would suggest by the presence of high chairs.  If you do bring your baby and they make a poop, change them on the table."

They have a ready-made tempura buffet here, but it wasn&#39;t really kept warm, though still remained crispy. I got the shrimp and pumpkin tempura, both tasty, but slightly costly. Lunch ran me $13.52.

Food was prepared in seconds while I stood there, no waiting for a call over the loud-speaker, which can get pretty crazy at lunch hour in this busy food court, so that was a plus. There are a variety of other broths to try, including spicy, so I might get something different next time.

Tonkatsu broth was not that great, the ramen place in the same food court is better, but only accepts cash.

There&#39;s a good selection of udon styles and also a &#39;buffet&#39; of tempura and fried food items (croquet, fried shrimp, etc.) to choose from. Each piece is at an extra cost, but the udon itself is priced very reasonably so it&#39;s not too bad.

My husband and I opted for the &#39;Kake Udon&#39;, the most simple one out of the rest and &#39;shrimp tempura&#39;. Both were quite good. The udon noodles had a good chewy consistency and the broth was just right--not too heavy or light.

I remember the old days when Dave Thomas was still living. Something has changed since we lost him. The service used to be very good. I remember long ago one of their signature service features was they would clear you trash for you. That stopped long ago.

The food was take-out and I brought it back to my office. I had a small Single combo. I always remember the vegetables on their hamburgers being plentiful and fresh. Not anymore, or at least not on this visit. With lettuce, onion, pickle and tomato you expect a little crunch, but everything was soggy.

The new store has a cool contemporary style. They have a variety of different seating arrangements to suit various needs: 2 and 4 person tables, bar-style for single patrons, a lounge area with cool leather chairs, and a spot in the corner were everyone with laptops congregates. 

They have 2 of those awesome soda machines that let you choose like 100 different drink options...which is awesome (I chose diet mellow yellow). 

They only have 2 cash registers and a really small space for ordering, so I&#39;m a little curious how cramped it will be during peak rush times. The drive through was well planned and has 2 ordering lanes, so I assume they are banking on more drive thru traffic...which makes sense for the area. 

My one drawback is that the front facade of the restaurant is all glass with a 20&#39; tall (+/-) atrium that has a brutal greenhouse effect. Although it looks cool, the glass made it hot and uncomfortable to sit and eat. I was just toughing it out, then my buddy mentioned how unbearable it was for him and I finally broke and admitted I was sweating too. I can&#39;t imagine how much worse that would be in the summer, hopefully they add some more window tint or shades."

The food is not bad at all - it&#39;s a thoughtful but limited menu so you won&#39;t see a hundred dishes on offer. The portions are generous without being overbearing or downright obscene like at some chain restaurants. Food tastes good and is made using quality ingredients. The prices are high-ish but in line with upscale area restaurants...you&#39;re helping pay their rent in what I&#39;m sure is an expensive location. The live entertainment has been pretty good each time...think 80&#39;s wedding singer. It got a little loud in the bar area...ask to be seated in one of the other rooms if you want to talk to your dining companions. The host staff is outstanding and the best part of this restaurant - warm, welcoming, accomodating. 

Then why the one star rating? One word - Service. The service absolutely sucks. The servers both times were about as warm or welcoming as when you call someone who owes you money. I mean, not one thing was done right both times. No drink suggestions or specials offered. Didn&#39;t check on drink or bread refills. Didn&#39;t bother coming by the table other than to take the order and drop off check. Didn&#39;t ask how the food was - it wasn&#39;t made correctly because the instructions weren&#39;t relayed to the kitchen. We asked for leftovers to be boxed and the food never came back. I really don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t throw around this accusation lightly but I&#39;m starting to wonder if it&#39;s a race thing...because I really don&#39;t know what else it could be.

If the service were better, this would be a 4-star place. As it stands now, I&#39;m afraid this restaurant has already seen all the money it&#39;s going to get from me."

It was okay, I wasn&#39;t blown away. Our drinks were great, I had the french prosecco and my husband had red wine. The bartenders were attentive and friendly. 

We were seated early, which was nice but it took a while for our server to great us. I&#39;m not sure if she was new or just overwhelmed but the whole night she was sort of a space cadet. 

We ordered the artichoke appetizer which was really good. Then we had the salad with gorgonzola and raspberry vinaigrette. My salad had a LOT of dressing so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan but my husband liked his.

Our entrees were the best part of the meal. I had a seafood pasta with white wine sauce and my husband had pasta with wild boar and a red sauce. I loved mine but it was heavy on the red pepper and VERY spicy.

For dessert we were excited to try the Nutella cheesecake but our server came back and they were out... Ugh... Then we settled on creme brûlée but our server came back and they were out of that... Ugh. I know it&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day but come on! We finally decided to get the Arancini Alla Nutella and boy were we disappointed. It was basically a fried dough ball with risotto and a TINY BIT of Nutella. We never find a dessert we don&#39;t like but this one was just BAD. 

Overall, the meal was okay. This definitely isn&#39;t our first choice for a dinner out but it was a place we&#39;ve been wanting to try."

Food and service were spotty in the past but last night was a great experience.  For the salad, went for the Pere E Noci, pear salad. Very good start.

The entire was Ravioli Aragosta and it was delicious, although next time I would probably sun the creamy vodka sauce for something lighter.  

Other diners had the Pollo Limon and loved it.  Also, the gnocchi had a great mushroom seasoning.  Cappuccino was a great ending to a great meal.

Luxury, high class restaurant with affordable prices. 
I ordered the Bucatini di Mare (see menu). It wasn&#39;t a huge serving, but it was good - the seafood was all cooked just right and the mussels were really large. 
My wife ordered the wild boar. I&#39;d never had wild boar before - it tastes like carnitas with red sauce (but maybe a little too much sauce). 
Checkin on here and get a free dessert. Tip: the tiramisu is fantastic and made in-house.

One caution (and the reason I removed a star):
We brought home the wild boar dish. I ate it a couple days later and got a headache shortly after. Then I remembered that as we were walking into the restaurant, a customer was walking out, complaining about having a migraine. I don&#39;t know what he ate, but there is some need of caution that there might be some preservative of sort in some of the food."

We went on a Tuesday night, so the restaurant wasn&#39;t full, but their bar area was nicely crowded with people. 

We ate A LOT! We got 4 antipasto dishes. We tried their spicy mussels, scallops, arancinis, and the bruschetta. I don&#39;t know which was my favorite, because we literally just about licked the plate. The sauce that the mussels were in was so good that we asked for more bread! The arancinis were HUGE! 2 come in a serving and I want to say they were the size of a baseball. Very tasty. 

For our entrees we tried the lobster ravioli which is their #1 seller, and the lamb. Both were unbelievable. They make their pasta in house and you can tell by how fresh it is. 

We were too full to try any of their desserts, but their menu is pretty big. I know they have cannoli&#39;s and nutella cheesecake! I&#39;ll definitely be back for that! :) 

I will go back in a heartbeat. In fact, I&#39;m making up excuses in my head to try it again. I&#39;m so happy that there is a nice, trendy Italian restaurant in the Arboretum. It was great to try a nice local place that has quality food!!"

I wanted to give this perfectly located place a chance to show me the service matched the food and 3 times now it has been so good as to clearly make that 1 visit an abnormal experience. 

(the Maître d immediately acted on that first occasion to apologize, offered a return meal on him, has called us out by name on ever return visit, and we have never seen anything but professionalism and genuine first class service from him)

It&#39;s new and the atmosphere is lovely, but it missed on several marks that matter. The overall review teetered between a 2.5-3. I didn&#39;t have the heart to give a 2, as I genuinely feel they are trying, but for the price-point, they really didn&#39;t deserve a 3, either.


APPETIZERS
1. Arancini Siciliani - Pretty good taste. Good crunch on the outside.

2. Funghi Ripieni (stuffed mushrooms) - Again, good taste. Decently cooked.

3. Carciofi Al Forno (baked artichoke) - Well-cooked and good flavour.

4. (Free) House bread + olives - I could have probably survived on this alone. The olives are spectacular! And, free. We&#39;ll see how long that lasts (I have my doubts - this normally costs $5-7 at other restaurants), but they are phenomenal, so indulge!


COCKTAILS
Limoncello Martini - Nice taste and presentation.


ENTREES
1. Pappardelle Con Polpette (pasta with veal meatballs) - This is where they really tanked. Italian restaurant - check. Touts homemade pasta - check. Under- and un-cooked pasta ... for $20 ... at said upper-scale Italian restaurant - ouch. I&#39;m pretty sure undercooked pasta is criminal somewhere, if not here, then certainly in Italy. There were chunks of pappardelle half-cooked or still hard as a rock and stuck to each other. The meatballs were just OK. It came with three, and two were hard and only one was well-cooked. My dish was also missing the cheese. I saw it come to a neighboring table, and theirs had it.

2. Pollo Ruspante (free range chicken with seasonal vegetables) - &#34;Seasonal vegetables&#34; usually means a mix of something like brussel sprouts, etc. Turns out, it came with broccoli and some diced potatoes. Hmm.. This would have been okay, were they cooked properly. Once again, the broccoli looked like it hadn&#39;t been steamed at all and was just put on the plate; it was rock-hard. We tried to cut it and actually needed the steak knife to get through it. We gave up after that.
**Note: This dish takes at least 30 minutes. It doesn&#39;t say that on the menu, so just beware.

3. Braciole (rolled skirt steak) - This dish got happy marks from its eater, so I&#39;ll leave it at that.


COFFEE + DESSERT
1. Espresso - Arrived cold.

2. Cappuccino - Only 2% milk available. Arrived lukewarm bordering on cold.

3. Tiramisu - Good taste. Fluffy, but not light; the ladyfinger sections were soaked.


SERVICE
Our waitress started off pretty pushy/in-your-face, and she fluctuated between there and overly nice for the duration of the meal. Timing was where service really took a hit, as much of our meal was ill-timed. For better or worse, we were in good company. A table of four next to us had three of their entrees delivered, and the fourth guy was told his was &#34;coming right out.&#34; It took more than 5 minutes for it to arrive. Our coffees came more than 10 minutes ahead of the dessert, and they arrived cold to boot.

I rounded it up to a three due to a couple things - the live music was amazing. They sang and played very well and were just a joy to have there. It really added to the experience. (Side note: It is VERY loud in the restaurant when it&#39;s busy. We could barely hear one another without the music playing.) At the end of our meal, the GM came around to our table and some others to say hi and introduce himself. They -are- trying. That said, trying only gets you so far in today&#39;s cut-throat restaurant world. I hope they make it. If they get their pacing down in the kitchen and add a couple more items to the menu (it could use another chicken entree and different sides), I think they will do great.

Update: Jan. 2015

We came back to give them another shot. The service was just as - if not more - disorganized than the first, and the food was just as - if not more - disappointing.

Atmosphere was very warm and well done. Live music was a plus and not too loud, very tasteful. 4 stars. 

Service was poor, largely absent. When 2 glasses of wine takes +15min to arrive that&#39;s not encouraging. Waiter never seemed apologetic for the delays, almost as if that was his idea of good. 1 star. 

Food was good, not great. Steamed mussels apps were good just too heavy on salt. Linguini di mare were good, ample portion and pasta was just right. Lamb chops were fair. Well seasoned but overdone. Grill must&#39;ve been too hot since filet was similarly charred hard but a touch cold in the center.  Was hopeful to try lemoncello for dessert but was afraid it would&#39;ve taken 15min to arrive. 2.5 stars. 

Overall, was really hoping to like this place more. The gen mngr was hospitable and attentive but just too much went wrong here. Prior to dinner, tried to get a drink at the bar, but was completely ignored - harbinger of how the rest of the experience went. 2.5 stars overall."

They have recently cut corners to save on costs due to the high rent in South Barrington.
The first couple of times I went, the food was amazing. However the last three times I&#39;ve been there, it&#39;s been subpar. I ordered what they called Chilean sea bass, I got the tougher whitefish (as a former chef, I know fish textures). Their risotto (which is the reason I would go) used to be creamy and cheesy. Now it&#39;s dry, bland, flavorless rice (not even the risotto grain). I tried their salmon and asked if it was wild caught. They said &#34;yes.&#34; But what I got was clearly the inferior, fat-laced, pale farmed raised salmon.  

The prices here are too high for them to be cutting corners like this, as well as lying to patrons. I for one will not pay them for food that is subpar."

We made a reservation for 730 on a Saturday and still had to wait until about 8 for a table but I understand because it was BUSY! I mean shoulder to shoulder diners. 

After being seated we were taken care of in a timely manner by a waitress and her bus lady. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. The menu was full of delicious items, pastas, meats and unique appetizers.  They have an extensive red wine menu and offer many cocktails.  Unlimited bread, olive oil and most importantly OLIVES. One of my favorite aspects of the meal. I had like 3 bowl! Don&#39;t tell my personal trainer.  

My boyfriend and I started with the Frito Mixto, fried scallops, calamari, and shrimp. I was really excited about this dish because it&#39;s all of my favorite aspects! Seafood and fried haha! It was good, not great. The shrimp tastes a bit like sulfur so they were spoiled. NOT OKAY. All the other components were good though and the Marinara was excellent.  I wanted to try more appetizers and a salad so that&#39;s what I ordered. The sausage stuffed mushrooms and the caprese salad. The stuffed mushrooms were great!!!! Very fresh, great combinations of cheese and sausage. The caprese salad was just okay. Nothing special at all and not worth the price. The tomatoes hardly had flavor. But the bufala mozzarella was good. I just want more greens in my salad even if it is a caprese. Maybe that&#39;s not very ITALIAN, just personal preference! 

My boyfriend the gnocchi bolognese and he enjoyed it. Next time I will just stick to a main pasta or meat dish because this place has all the components to receive 5 stars but my first experience just wasn&#39;t outstanding. The important part is there will be a next time!"

I went there with a friend at lunch time about a week ago. Our server was very nice, attentive and knowledgale about the menu items. The setting and decor were lovely. However, the food didn&#39;t wow me or my friend. First off, they didn&#39;t have the duck which was on the lunch menu. Friend and I both ordered the seafood dishes. Her salad was just okay. My pasta had wonderful flavor/sauce, but I wish the seafood was cooked one minute less. Pasta itself - nothing special either. Overall, it&#39;s just an okay meal. Maybe my expectation was too high considering it&#39;s in the Arboretum and surrounded by the other great restaurants, plus the price of the dishes. I would probably go back and try the other items, maybe for dinner next time."

Our server Tracy was great- on the ball with everything and also offered some great suggestions on the menu.  My husband ordered the Asparagus Risotto and it was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the Rigatoni with Sausage and it was delicious!  The noodles were al dente which was such a treat since most restaurants tend to overcook their pasta and it comes out limp and soggy.

Decor in the restaurant is classy and elegant.

I&#39;ve been wanting to go here since they opened. We went on a Saturday night and made reservations knowing everything is always packed at the arboretum. When we arrived the restaurant was so packed that there wasn&#39;t enough room for everyone to wait near the hostess section. I think this place over books. We had reservations, yet we still had to wait 15 minutes for our table and I could hear other people around getting mad about the same thing. When we finally sat down they gave us water and bread right away but a waiter never came by. Knowing how packed they were, we expected the service to be slow/bad but not this bad. We waited for 25 minutes and a waiter still never showed up to introduce themselves or take our drink order. We decided it was getting ridiculous and told the manager or someone who looked important at the hostess section and left. He said if we sat back down he would make sure someone waited on us but at this point, specially for a birthday celebration, it was going to take more than just having service right away to make us stay. We also had a movie we needed to get to and didn&#39;t want to risk slow service. 

It&#39;s too bad about our experience, I was really excited to try it but after that I will probably not be back. I hope others have a more pleasant experience."

I was looking for a place to celebrate a recent birthday and had read that this restaurant was very gluten friendly. I called Incontro A Tavola to verify this was the case and was assured that it was a 90% scratch kitchen so I could basically still order anything on the menu and to just let our waiter know and they would handle altering it in the kitchen for me from there. When I let our waitress know, she said....well...you can&#39;t have any of the pasta&#39;s because even though they can be made gluten free, it&#39;s boiled in the same water. Since I am highly sensitive, this would completely bring on the effects of eating gluten for me and was sad that they didn&#39;t have an extra pot to boil gluten free pasta in. Why go through the process of making GF pasta if you don&#39;t boil it separately. Needless to say I was extremely saddened by this, since I haven&#39;t had good pasta since my diagnosis. I ended up ordering the Chicken Vesuvio, which was very good, but I really had my heart set on pasta and arancini (which I didn&#39;t order knowing if they didn&#39;t have a separate pot to boil water they more than likely didn&#39;t have a separate fryer for the arancini)."

Fantastic experience from the minute we walked through the door that the maitre d&#39; opened and held for us right up to our departure, again having the door held for us, this time by the General Manager who thanked us for coming.
Greeted warmly and immediately by a lovely gentleman bearing a dish of kalamata and green olives (delicious) and fresh baked bread. Thank you, Alfredo, for the great service.
Our server, Mark, both knowledgeable and accommodating made a most impressive first impression, asking about our dining preferences and offering items he thought we would be pleased with. We were very pleased! He presented a relaxing pace of service so that we could enjoy our meal at our own pace.
Began our evening with Prosecco and the most divine, melts in your mouth carpaccio. My companion had a Peroni and the day&#39;s special antipasti, Carciofi - large grilled artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and a bit of mixed greens. 
My pasta course was Paccheri Tartufi, a divinely aromatic dish of paccheri noodles, mushrooms in a light truffle cream sauce. (Paired with a lovely Valpolicella) Paccheri  tasted as good as it smelled. The kitchen was kind enough to prepare the dish for me without sausage and a nice bonus were the meatballs I was given on the side in place of the sausage.
My companion had the fish of the day, a swordfish grilled with pesto- the freshest tasting he&#39;s had dining out lately. Served with parmesan risotto to die for!
Followed by a strong espresso and grappa. The bartender even came and introduced himself and asked how we were enjoying the grappa. Thanks too, to Ira!
We finished with pistachio gelato and sorbetto di limone.
Do yourself a favour and try Incontro! I rated the dress code &#34;casual&#34; became I saw people dressed up as well as folks in nicer jeans. It appears all are welcome, as long as you are presentable!"

The service was good, with just a few minor things (we&#39;ll get to that later).  Our server was Robert and he did a nice job answering any questions about the menu and making recommendations.  He was just the right amount of attentive yet giving our family space to enjoy our conversations.  The nice lady filling our water glasses was ON IT - our glasses never got below half-full.  And various staff members whisked away empty plates, baskets, etc. shortly after the dishes had served their purpose.  The General Manager also stopped by to say hello and was gracious enough to chat with Busia when she launched in to a story about growing up during the Great Depression.

The food was all delicious; it was obvious everything was made from scratch and the portion sizes were quite large (most of us took home leftovers for another meal).  I&#39;m a big olive fan so I very much enjoyed the little bowl of olives on the table along with the warm bread &amp; olive oil.  The other dishes our family ordered were the calamari, chicken parmigiana, braciole, lobster ravioli, the sausage &amp; mushroom pasta (I won&#39;t even attempt to remember the name of the dish) and the fish special for the day (which came with an amazing citrus risotto &amp; fire-roasted broccolini).  Everyone raved about their meals.

Some may feel their prices are a bit high and I would agree if you are comparing them to other local Italian restaurants (not just the massive chains like Maggiano&#39;s but smaller places like Ti Amo, too).  But the trade is you are dining in popular South Barrington at a restaurant that would fit right in at the trendiest of neighborhoods downtown as far as the look &amp; feel and their menu selections.  This restaurant gives you that upscale downtown dining experience without having to deal with traffic, parking hassles or taking the train.

I&#39;m giving them 3-stars instead of higher for two minor irritations with the service, keeping in mind as I mentioned above most of the service was quite good.  Our calamari starter arrived 5 minutes before the bottle of wine we ordered for the table (we ordered them both at the same time), and they seem to really be trying to push also ordering soup or salad and, of course, dessert. I understand the server asking about those things, it&#39;s expected, but once a customer politely declines I think the matter should be dropped and don&#39;t continue to try &amp; get us to order more.  I&#39;d expect that kind of service at some chain restaurant that involves the servers wearing &#34;pieces of flair&#34; (for fellow &#34;Office Space&#34; fans). Even when this attempt to up-sell is done in a playful manner, which this was, after a certain point it is too much - especially for the caliber of restaurant that Incontro A Tavola clearly aspires to be."

Food was great especially the special Insalata Mare. Normally would give 5 stars across the board but three relatively minor issues caused the downgrade.
1 - We were both looking forward to a veal dish and took our time ordering our entree. In fact it was more than 45 minutes into our visit when we ordered two veal dishes. We were told that there was no veal on the menu that night. Disappointing but there were other fine choices. But why weren&#39;t we told at the outset or when the specials were described. Our server attributed the lack of veal to the supplier not delivering that day. We overheard another server attribute the lack of veal to being sold out New Year&#39;s Eve. At least have a consistent story
2 - Live music in the bar area is a great idea and I am sure many patrons go for that purpose however there is no need to pipe the music into the far dining rooms where quiet conversation is expected - or should be expected. Would have been tolerable had the singer and her canned backup music were less shrill
3 - Bus &#39;boys&#39; were friendly and knew what they were doing but were obviously told to not let a dirty dish remain on a table for more than 15 seconds. Appreciate good service but this was a joke and a distraction to the point we counted the number of times the bus boys picked up something, asked if we wanted something picked up or stopped and looked. By the dessert course the number was up to 26 - 5 would have been sufficient"

This place appears to be run by an offshoot of ZaZa&#39;s in Barrington. Stop right there. 

If you&#39;ve been to ZaZa&#39;s, your opinion of their food will be identical here.

Good bread, very good salad, but so-so on the entrees.

Mine was the chicken piccata (or something similar) and it was unremarkable. 

My wife had a dish with pancetta as an ingredient that she said had absolutely way too much of it in it.

Another small problem is that we made a reservation online at 5pm...had to move it to 5:30pm (which they did with no problem) only to show up to find that they had no record of our reservation. Due to that, they seemed to put us at the end table of &#34;that&#34; room. You know, the room for people without reservations.

We also felt slightly rushed because they didn&#39;t have a reservation for us.

All in all, you&#39;re better off for Italian food at Francesca&#39;s or Carlos &amp; Carlos in Arlington Heights."

Ordered and at the hour mark, they tell us food should be up shortly.
At the 90 minute mark, we asked them to just make it to go.
Then after another 15 min it&#39;s still not ready.  They offer to comp the meals, and then finally offer to comp everything.

All the manager could say was sorry and asked if we wanted more bread, lmao!

Yeah I came to this place to eat bread, come on!  Suggestion,  spend less money on making this place look like all the other trendy places and spend some time training your staff, hiring cooks and figuring out how keep the heat on.  The AC went on twice and it&#39;s the middle of winter!  I even watched three managers who look like kids try to figure out the thermostat.

After a blockbuster week of dining -- Bohemian House (BoHo) - Wed; Everest - Thurs; and Villagio - Fri,  Incontro A Travola had a tough act to follow.

I can say Incontro A Tavola is one of the area&#39;s better Italian spots.   It holds it&#39;s own but is definitely not a top spot clear winner.  For example,  I&#39;d probably prefer Francesca&#39;s in West Dundee.   

The area is also not particularly strong in Italian restaurants. If you look at Chicago proper, Incontro A Tavola is not close to the best.   Competing in the upper circles however doesn&#39;t seem like one of the goals of the owners so this is probably to be expected which is OK.   Quite frankly though I&#39;m a bit disappointed being in the affluent South Barrington neighborhood they didn&#39;t shoot for a bit higher-end on the food side.   Super high end isn&#39;t needed but at least a primi / secondi piatti menu setup would have been appreciated.  If not this, how about at least half orders on the pasta dishes? --- sadly no.   Overall the menu was fairly Italian typical and not overly geared toward the foodie.

Atmosphere is definitely where this place shined.   I have no criticisms here.   With gold and silver accents, white linen table clothes, and stylish lighting fixtures, the ambiance was rich, romantic, and hip.   This is not to say its the best ever; just on par with the best restaurants in the area.

Service is another area I expect &#34;will&#34; shine for Incontro A Tavola.   I quote &#34;will&#34; because its not there yet.  Don&#39;t get me wrong,  I really liked my server and the small exceptionally nice crew who made me feel they truly cared about my experience.   However, it was also clear the staff were not industry veterans and at times were simply trying too hard without having the experience.   Given the effort, if continued, I believe service at Incontro A Tavola will evolve to being really top notch. 

Food.  What can I say?  It just really didn&#39;t wow me.  In fact, one dish was simply downright awful.   They used high quality fresh ingredients but creating amazing dishes is far more than just this; cooking would be easy otherwise.   So is this growing pains or something else?   At least on this Sunday, unfortunately I believe it was at least a bit of both.     There were a number of items on the menu however that did intrigue me so perhaps I just chose poorly.   

What I did try:

BREAD/OLIVE OIL/PARMESAN CHEESE:  the bread was fresh, tasty, and soft.   The olive oil was nothing to write home about but the parmesan cheese was excellent!!

GRILLED CALAMARI: exactly the kind of calamari dish folks who say they don&#39;t like calamari have had...downright awful.   The calamari -while fresh- was a bit chewy and absolutely lacking in flavor; that is other than the burnt taste of the grill marks which was too much.  To top it off, being thrown on a big plate of chopped lettuce simply was not good presentation.    Such a let down after the grilled calamari dishes I&#39;ve recently had at Bottlefork, Celeste, and even the Greek Islands.  Kudos for offering a grilled version but please Incontro A Tavola do yourself a favor and check out these other places!

CRUDO E MOZZERELLA:  Highlight dish of the night!   Both the prosciutto di parma and mozzarella were fantastic; the fresh savory flavors complimented well by the basil crostini.   The crostini were burnt however; literally toasted black.  Surprisingly,  the basil hide the burnt taste reasonably well.   I&#39;ll chalk this up to execution error.  Note, this is a LARGE dish.  I understand big dishes are in the spirit of family style Italian dining but less is more when it comes to a higher-end dining experience.   I want to be able sample a variety of flavors without taking home enough food for a week!

GNOCCHI BOLOGNESE:  didn&#39;t actually try but did order as the veal, pork, beef bolognese sounded intriguing.  Unfortunately, the general manager came over and said the house-made gnocchi didn&#39;t turn out right so in the interest of quality couldn&#39;t serve this evening.  I truly appreciate this and he offered the dish on the house next time.   That&#39;s nice but seriously next time???   You should be doing something now!  How about sending over a sample of what you think is the house&#39;s best?  As a new restaurant you should be doing this ANYWAY!

BISTECCA FIORENTINA:  The staff raved, interesting steak presentation, but just average in taste.   Rare+ ordered - served medium.  They precut the steak ensuring it would overcook on a hot plate.  The quality of the porterhouse meat was fair.   There was a lot of chewy fat marbling which I&#39;m not a fan of.   The accompanying side of vegetables was bland and lacking of presentation.

CHOCALTE GELATO / BOMBOLONI CON CREMA: Just OK on both; the bomboloni however took the edge.  My guess is the tiramisu might have been a better choice."

- Live Music: always appreciate live music, but the volume was too loud for a smaller space like this restaurant. If the music group played outside of the restaurant, the whole South Barrington Arboretum could hear it without issue (that&#39;s how loud it was!). 

- Foods: very major issue with grilled items leaving a charred and bitter taste, which over power the taste of the food. We had grilled calamari for appetizer. The texture was just right, but it was either not seasoned well or overwhelmed by the charred taste. Same thing with the filet, lamb chop and vegetables that were grilled."

Hope was not only my party planner contact, but she was our main server too and every attention to detail was not only met, but exceeded my expectations.

Appetizers for our Group of 20:  fried calamari; Crudo E Mozzarella - hands down my favorite - fresh mozzarella with proscuitto di parma, caponata and basil crostini - I think I could make a meal on that dish alone, and the pizza margherita was delicious too.

Our entrees ranged from lobster ravioli, pan-seared white fish, housemade rigatoni, gnocchi bolongese, chicken parm and filet mignon - everyone gave rave reviews about their food.

Highly recommend this to anyone in the area - I think it would be a great place to meet some friends for wine and appetizers, or for a nice date night restaurant.  We were in a private room, so not sure how kid friendly it is, but I will definitely be going back.

I had the white fish with capers &amp; a light wine sauce over spinach. $22.

Live music (woman singing Italian songs &amp; a piano player) on Friday &amp; Sat nights. It was a very enjoyable evening &amp; it was quiet enough to have a conversation...we even stayed for cappuccino, which we rarely do. Portions were just right, not too much, though not skimpy.

I had the chicken parm. Wife had spaghetti and meatballs. Portions were a nice size that had some leftovers. Dessert was great too. 

A good place to go for Italian."

I have to say not impressed. The waiter was very nice. The atmosphere was great. You couldn&#39;t rest your drinks on the table without is slanting because of the padding underneath the cloth?! The food horrible. My pasta was drenched in sauce and a ton of oil. My son got the pasta with fish. There was more pasta and barely any fish. My other son had a pizza which looked burnt. My husband had veal with a ton of potatoes not enough veggies. My daughter had the mac n cheese and ended up getting sick! The dishes were too pricey for what you got. I don&#39;t think we will be giving them another chance. I would give no stars in I could.

Grilled calamari was superb, as were the three big scallops, though the bed of fennel, flash-fried leeks, lemon beurre blanc sauce, while attractive, was all but flavorless.
Fire grilled Salmon was exquisitely prepared.  Lobster and besciamella filled ravioli was tasty, but I wouldn&#39;t have known it included lobster if I hadn&#39;t read it on the menu (I&#39;m still not convinced).  Rigatoni Siciliana was a major fail.  Salt and fennel overwhelmed what sounded like an excellent dish.  I could see the spicy tomato ragu, but my taste buds couldn&#39;t find it.  
For dessert, the Cannoli turned out to be four (five?) miniature, way too sweet examples of my favorite Italian dessert.  I&#39;m guessing they were out of big shells, but I wish my server had told me.
More than a bit disorganized.  Hard to keep track of who our server was.  We watched as at least three dishes, including our appetizers, were delivered to the wrong tables.  Entrees were delivered before we had a chance to digest the appetizers.  Espresso was delicious, but it was cold by the time the Cannoli arrived - a big no-no.  We asked our server about the free glass of wine that is offered through Sept 30 but she had no idea what we were talking about.
I had heard nice things and was anxious to try it.  The menu was very well put together.  Unfortunately, the execution left much to be desired, in terms of both service and preparation.
It&#39;s not likely we&#39;ll be back."

I was driving by and noticed that my favorite Thai place was gone and replaced by Sabroso Burrito. I was skeptical on this place because most Mexican restaurants out here are average but man was I wrong. I came in on my lunch and tried the steak tacos and they are unbelievably delicious and well seasoned. You also get a great char. I also tried the rajas con queso gordita and it was also amazing. Most restaurants out here don&#39;t even offer that on the menu so I&#39;m happy Sabroso does. Service is perfect and I&#39;ve gotten free chips and salsa when dinning in (not sure if you also get it with takeout). 

On another occasion I tried the pastor which was good but not great. Same goes for the potato tacos. I look forward to trying new things on the menu. I&#39;m also glad they have such a big vegetarian menu so that everyone can try something!"

I haven&#39;t been to the restaurant to see the interior, but I&#39;ve ordered takeout twice (husband picked it up). The most recent order was a flavor packed burrito of sorts - we doubled up on the meat (chicken and steak) and went sans carbs for a fajita type meal. That&#39;s important to note - they are super friendly and accommodating. 

Our burrito bowls were chock full of fresh veggies and perfectly cooked and spiced meat. I&#39;m salivating thinking about that meal. My daughters split an enormous burrito that could have fed each of them for two meals...so there&#39;s that. 

And don&#39;t forget the guacamole. Guac on lock, my friends. Super awesome all the way around. Sabroso Burrito has earned a shiny spot in my takeout lineup!"

As good as it gets!&#34;   and you click on that because you feel sympathetic toward the people who work there,  or you were in a good mood then,  or you want to join the bandwagon,  or you were drinking that night.

In this case,   5*  &#34;Woohoo! As good as it gets!&#34;   is simply a fact.  Found it thanks to Yelp, on a sojourn from MDW airport to Madison,  but had plenty opportunity to get tempted away on the way there.  Stopped and looked at a new Middle Eastern chain (starts with &#39;R&#39;) but the plates of kebab and rice looked really sad:  little piles of starch next to meats that had sat in tubs too long.  Then stopped at a new beer emporium - - couldn&#39;t resist having a beer, but could entirely resist the pizza, that looked like big glops of cheese and accents atop a thick layer of pointless starch (starts with a &#39;B&#39; which might be obvious).

But the burrito at Sabroso Burrito?   Excellence.   An elaboration upon the theme of &#34;burrito&#34; that takes it to the essence, and zooms the concept to new heights.  The decor at Sabrosa has basic elements, but is done with clean beauty.   The practicalities are ultramodern (swivel pay station with tip options tappable) and everything sharp and easy,  but the warmth and charm and caring of a traditional taqueria are still very much present - - and in some ways crafted to perfection.

Then there is the burrito - - it tastes FABULOUS.  It is beautifully and caringly constructed (not the dumpathon and slopathon you find at chains like &#39;Chirito&#39; and &#39;Quipotle&#39; where the main ingredient beyond the flour tortilla is another cheap starch: rice).   It is also a work of art.   Seriously, the al pastor is seared to perfect temperature and bursting with flavor (definitely NOT decaying-in-a-tub flavor), and the whole is constructed both visually appealing, and,  like, a flavor bomb.

And the red and green salsas:  more superlatives apply.   This place was worth fighting off the allure of nouveau crap chain fare, and driving a wide berth for.  And the people who work there are also,  still, 5*  SERIOUSLY wonderful."

Not sure if they cook it the night before, but it was not freshly marinated and cooking on the spit.
I took a chance on ordering it, just like the person in front of me.
I had the pastor burrito and a can of pop ($1.50 per can really?).
A nice touch was the small basket of chips and salsa.
The burrito itself was short on pastor and heavy on lettuce.  I mean who puts this much lettuce in a burrito; might as well have called it a lettuce burrito, with essence of pastor.  The presentation was excellent, but hid the fact that this was short on protein and not a good value.

Sorry, but will not be coming back"

With a growling belly and a craving for authentic Mexican food, I made the trek here on a Saturday evening.  I&#39;ll be honest; I was genuinely excited about this place after reading all the strong reviews...but man oh man do I feel misled. 

4 out of the 5 tables were taken, with only one 2-seater table left, so my dining cohort and I grabbed it.  We glanced over the menu and settled on the chicken nachos to share, she had a veggie gordita, and I went for the asada burrito. 

The nachos were very disappointing - a pile of chips with cubes of grilled chicken (the best part of the evening), smothered in some watery cream sauce.   On one corner of the plate sat a lump of dried refried beans, and next to it was their version of guacamole, which was really only tomatoes and onions with a tint of green from what seemed like a drop of avocado.  And that was their chicken nachos...no lettuce, diced onions, cilantro, etc. 

The veggie gordita didn&#39;t garner any complaints, but it didn&#39;t drop any jaws either.  She described it as &#34;eh, it&#39;s ok.&#34;

Looks can be deceiving, because my burrito was presented nicely via a diagonal cut...but the steak was small in quantity, and what was there was dry, chewy, and full of gristle.  I picked at whatever I could that seemed edible, which was mainly the lettuce filler.

Sorry Sabroso, no gusto."

Decided to give this place a try and got takeout and seemed average at best.  We ordered two steak burritos, a steak burrito dinner, and a order of nachos.  The steak burrito for me was okay but I guess the wife told me hers could&#39;ve been better.  The nachos however tasted like it was rushed and soggy by the time we got home which was only a 15 minute drive.  They did give quite a few hot and mild sauces in little plastic cups so we definitely did not run out of them.  A minus of the restaurant was that as we were ordering, there were quite of few telephone orders as we were ordering and the one other employee who was taking our order had a little trouble speaking english.

It&#39;s pretty small, so might be hard to get a table at certain times, but definitely worth it! We went during lunch time - we got the soy chimichanga, the soy taco and a veggie gordita with a side of guacamole. The gordita was standard, but I was very impressed with the soy taco and chimichanga. Chimichangas are usually deep fried, so they are usually a bit oily and heavy. This was different - it seemed more pan fried, lighter yet still crispy. The soy in the tacos and chimichanga was so flavorful and well marinated. I&#39;m usually not a big fan of soy because it usually ends up being pretty flavorless and bland, but I really enjoyed it with this meal - this did a great job with it! The salsa they initially give out to each table was also good - I  enjoyed it more than the actual hot sauce served with the meal. The guacamole was also good, however I wish they served it with a plate of chips. It comes in a bowl with 5-6 chips on top of the guacamole, which is not enough to finish the bowl with.

The service was nice, however you could tell they&#39;re still a bit new because the lady helping us had to go ask someone for all of the questions we were asking about the food. I&#39;m sure this will get better with time, as they&#39;ve only been open for about a month.

Unfortunately, we were very disappointed.

We had tacos--chicken, pork, and steak.  Chicken: Mine was just a big hunk of chicken that I could barely take a bite of.  It was nice that they were generous, but it was just dry. It would be better if it had been shredded so that any juice in the cooking would be all over it, making it moist. Pork: Something was way off with our pork tacos--the meat tasted like it had been frozen and reheated (?). My husband and I both threw those away after one bite because they were inedible. :-(  Steak: Decent. Nothing special. If you are desperate for a taco, stick with the steak.  

I had the dinner with 3 tacos and beans and rice. Very small portions in my to-go container. The beans were typical, but the rice tasted like it wasn&#39;t made that day--stuck together in clumps. I don&#39;t think it was fresh (?)

We also had the guacamole--an 8 oz container and they only gave us (and I counted them) TEN chips!  Only 10 were in the little bag!  (Really??)  So my husband and I had to divvy up the chips to be fair.  Very poor!  Of course we ran out quickly, so we had to use our forks to eat the rest of it. The guac itself was bland with too much lemon/lime juice so it tasted sour.  No garlic.  No spice. No salt.

The thing we enjoyed the most was the hot salsa. That was done well. But good salsa is not enough for a Mexican restaurant--we hope they improve on their food because Schaumburg is seriously lacking!"

I don&#39;t normally expect to use the phrase &#34;delicate flavors&#34; for this kind of restaurant, but that&#39;s what I experienced here.
Don&#39;t come for ambiance. Brightly lit with a white tile floor it doesn&#39;t look anything like most Mexican Restaurants. Four or five small tables. I think of this primarily as a carry out restaurant. With excellent food."

4.5 stars."

$.99 chips and dip are nothing fancy, but a good start and you can&#39;t beat the price. Shrimp and spinach dip isn&#39;t bad either and comes with pita bread.

Roast dip didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor but had so much meat in it I had to put some aside to get it in my mouth. Some horseradish would probably fix that.

Old fashion had knob creek which was a major plus, but I couldn&#39;t taste the bitters or orange peel.

Don&#39;t have a choice about coming back since this hotel is in the middle of nowhere, but I have definitely had worse hotel food. I would come back for convenience."

The servers are so friendly but be patient because they seem to be spread thin. The drinks are poured well and the food is ok. Their Caesar salad minus the anchovies and minus the croutons is good. On another occasion I ordered the chicken sandwich minus the bread. It had way too much cheese on it which I had to peel off. The chicken itself had a nice grilled flavor. They skimp a bit on the French fries so don&#39;t expect to share. 

This is a decent place to grab a drink to hangout or eat a light snack."

Strangest occurrence while here: Our waitress replying &#39;Fo Shizzle&#39; to me. Twice.
Worst occurrence while at Gather Bar: Realizing a cocktail was $12 and a Goose Island Beer was $8. Half Acre was $8. Whaaaat.

Overall, I liked Gather Bar and if you&#39;re staying at the Renaissance Hotel, it&#39;s a completely acceptable and lively place to have a drink. I met friends for a drink here before an event &amp; was surprised it wasn&#39;t just full of married businessmen looking for a little fun as I expected. It was also full of dance moms &amp; their kids with the little bun hairdos &amp; sparkly studio sporting warm up suits. I kept my eyes open for Abby Miller but she was nowhere to be found.

For my first drink, I had Troy&#39;s Nana Mantini. I don&#39;t get the name really but it consisted of Chocolate godiva, creme de banana and mint. I didn&#39;t get much banana from the cocktail but I sure did like it! I can&#39;t say I&#39;m sold on it being Godiva anything though. It sure seemed like it was Hershey&#39;s syrup coating my glass when I got to the bottom and scraped it up. For drink two, I ordered a Sofie (then a Matilda), both were bottled and our server presented my beers alongside a frosty glass. That&#39;s how I drink my beer at home and that pleased me greatly! Though the prices are inflated, they have a decent selection of craft beers, some inventive cocktails, and good food options.

Even though our server said some strange things sometimes, she was extremely attentive and so friendly it made my teeth hurt. 

With such friendly service, great atmosphere and good drinks, I can see why this hotel bar was poppin&#39; at 5 on a Tuesday. Ohhh and they play good music! ...and whatever is the important sports game of the day on their giant TVs."

I ordered a watermelon basil drink with vodka. It was pretty good, but came with a steep $12 price tag. I didn&#39;t realize I ended up in Chicago! But I guess hotel prices are always high. Angela P. ordered the cheese curds and the portion was huge. I stole a couple and they were good!  Our waitress was interesting and disappeared for a while when we were trying to get our checks.  There was also a dance convention going on downstairs so the bar was overrun by 8-12 year old girls wearing booty shirts and toon much makeup. Creepy."

I like classy hotel bars and I like inspired cocktails.  So I liked Gather Bar.

When I arrived at Gather Bar, I pulled into the Renaissance Hotel/Convention Center compound.  It&#39;s not hard to find though, just be smart:  park by Sam &amp; Harry&#39;s.  It&#39;s a restaurant.  So the bar must be near!

The bar was packed at 5:00 PM on a Tuesday, but it was mostly men watching the USA vs. Belgium game and a group of dance moms with their young daughters.

Cocktails have a typical Chicago or hotel bar price tag:  $12 a pop.  I had a lavender cocktail with Prosecco.  It was delicious, it was refreshing, and it was relaxing.  I enjoy trying new cocktails with &#34;inventive&#34; ingredients like lavender.  Sarah S. was a fan of her minty chocolate drink, and Taylor M.&#39;s watermelon cooler looked delightful.  

However, my Mango Mojito was terrible.  It reminded me of something I would have mixed up in college - super sweet and boozy, like jungle juice.  I didn&#39;t taste any mint either.  

Even though I was heading to an event shortly, I was hungry (note: a large coffee for breakfast and licorice for &#34;lunch&#34; is not very filling) so I ordered some cheese curds.  The cheese was squeaky and chewy like it should be!  It was a huge portion and definitely worth the $9.  The rest of the bar menu was pretty typical and it got more expensive from there.

The whole vibe I was committed to getting was ruined when we ordered and the waitress would repeatedly reply, &#34;for shizzle!&#34;  I&#39;m sorry, what was that?  Oh, was I mistaken as one of Snoop Dogg&#39;s ladies?

I wouldn&#39;t mind lounging here as a guest at the hotel, and I&#39;d surely come back, but I&#39;d be more picky about what to order.  Gather Bar is a 3.5 for me."

Located to the side of the Renaissance&#39;s massive lobby space, Gather Bar has a unique set up with long bead strands providing the barrier between the lobby and the bar/restaurant area. Staff here are friendly for the most part, with one woman behind the bar being the sole exception (she was a tad condescending and little too unavailable at times). 

Over my frequent visits I had the pleasure of having a Blue Moon Seasonal Ale, Sledgehammer wine and a cocktail to drink (I was a real fan of the wine more than anything it was perfectly balanced with little aftertaste).

For food I was able to try their shaved prime rib sandwich with au jus, the chopped salad, and best of all a killer French Onion Soup. This soup was definitely a medal winner and I actually found myself craving bowls of this perfectly cooked and flavored broth, packed with the perfect amount bread and topped with perfectly melted and cooked cheese. Unreal! A must have, I would come back to Gather JUST for this soup!

Overall a good spot to come when staying here, and given the weather this past weekend in suburban Chicagoland it was a safe option as well."

We were so glad we went. It&#39;s actually pretty casual, yes some people are dressed pretty nice (probably still from work) and some people are more casually dressed. 

First of all, the smell when you enter the main hotel lobby...so good!

Then you go up an escalator and off to the left is Gather Bar. There is this pretty peach/metalic curtain for the perimeter which gives it a weird throwback yet modern feel. They have a small drink menu, I tried the aviation gin based....it was interesting. My friend wasn&#39;t sure what to get and our server mentioned how the bartender had made a mango mojitio for another guest and my friend jumped right on that. 

We also ordered the prime rib nachos. How classy! Nachos seem to be my go-to snack while out for drinks. I wish there would have been a little more beef on the nachos, but the chips were delish. 

I loved the vibe here, and making up stories about where people were from/what they did/why they were in town. Very cool, chill hangout."

They &#34;DON&#39;T&#34; have the standard things that you would find at most Asian Buffets. A few of them would be fried catfish, boiled shrimp, and sushi. 

None of those were on the buffet, the cost of the buffet was $12.87 on a weekday. I&#39;m sure they over charge on the weekends; although, that did come with a soda, but you don&#39;t have a choice of not purchasing it.

Cafeteria Chinese food at its worst. I was suspicious of every bite I took, fearing it may have expired. One pork dumpling didn&#39;t make the cut and was promptly spit into my cheap paper napkin. Sweet and sour sauce seemed to be watered down with something; not sure what. Even the crab Rangoon was disappointing and that&#39;s a dish you can usually fall back on. They had mini egg foo young parties which were a nice surprise. They even tasted good, but unfortunately, the only brown &#34;gravy&#34; was next to the mashed potatoes and had more salt than taste. Dessert didn&#39;t even sit well. Almond cookies were soggy and stale. Coconut macaroons were tolerable when dipped in my canned chocolate pudding. Hope I don&#39;t get sick on the way home."

Great fried rice
Great veggies and chicken dishes
Seafood buffet PERFECT shrimp salmon etc 
The sauces were perfect not too salty
The management or family that works there helped me like I was family... As a restaurant owner I&#39;m very happy with the place, the food and staff... If you have had a bad experience in this place TRY IT AGAIN... My food was a HIT!!"

I don&#39;t need everything super hot, I&#39;m fine with room temperature. I do expect taste, quality, value and general cleanliness for a return visit to happen.

That said, this place is overall good. Nothing was mouth-watering great, but most was decent. Not worse than heating up frozen items from grocery store.

BEST
Butterfly shrimp was good, bordering on very good ! De-veined (I checked, it&#39;s my pet peeve). Just like if you made it at home in an actual oven. When I come back again, I will make a meal of this. It&#39;s worth the $8.89 I paid for lunch (w/ tax)

GOOD
* Broccoli- From meat dishes (in sauce)
* Mushrooms- Fresh tasting
* Pepper pork- Most flavorful meat there
* Hot &amp; sour soup- Plenty of mushrooms, warm spices, slightly sour
* Sugar doughnut- Sweet, oily &amp; decadent
* Fruit (cantaloupe, oranges, bananas)- Fresh
* Fruit punch drink- Good, flavorful (specifically tried it because one reviewer said it was too watered down)
* Coffee- Not better or worse than most diners

DECENT (not great, but pretty good)
* Chicken nuggets- Like McD&#39;s (better than typical frozen)
* Fries- Crinkle cut (similar to frozen)
* Rangoon- Sweet cheese, crispy
* Egg rolls (I prefer spring rolls, but they didn&#39;t have)
* Garlic bread (like frozen)
* Desserts- Reminded me of store-bought European style cakes... not sweet enough for me, but decent

BOO
Nearly ALL meats... eat only if you just want to up your protein intake for the day...
* Chicken- Tasteless or funky spices (grilled) or dried out (wings)
* Beef- Barely better
* Pork- Too chewy (but pepper made it tasty)
* Sweet &amp; sour sauce- Not sweet, fruity or anything else it should be
* Duck sauce (packets)- Avoid at all costs, taste like plastic

Note that I arrived at 12:00 PM on a Saturday. Food was only out for maybe an hour. EVERYTHING tasted really fresh !!

Note the times when other reviewers mentioned they were there, and the food was cold and stale. Lesson learned: Don&#39;t show up very late at ANY cheaper buffet ! :-)"

This buffet is average size, but big on price.  Drinks are included.  There was a variety to choose from - heavy on meat selections and low on veggie choices.  The food was okay.  Some things were pretty okay like the Mongolian beef and General Tso&#39;s Chicken.  These were actually spicy which was a nice change from the lackluster spicy items in some buffets.  The drink selection was nice and it was nice to get your own drink and to refill it when you wanted so don&#39;t leave a tip since the only service you actually get is the bus boy cleaning up plates.  The crab was very over cooked as was the Teriyaki chicken. Lots of the appetizers were cold or very over-cooked.  Skip the dessert island.  Most of the items were just awful, but if you want a laugh, get the fortune cookies.  Most of the fortunes are misspelled and offer really odd sayings like &#34;You are contemplative and sanalytical.&#34; (Fortune cookie spelling error, not mine.).  All in all, for $13 a person, not worth it at all and we won&#39;t be back."

If u are starving and don&#39;t care about quality or temperature then this is your place. It was fine, nothing stood out  and lacked variety. 

On the positive side, the place was clean and not full of children. As for the food, the lo mein was quite tastey and their sweet and sour was good.

All in all I would sugest to go to panda express for warmer food at the same price"

To start off, the staff sat in a corner of the place and talked so loud it was rude. Loud and shrill. I should probably move as far from them as possible.  
Next, as I went to get my food, they policed the tables, where ever I went. One lady did something and the staff lady yelled at her. All I could hear was the customer saying&#34; sorry, sorry, sorry &#34; all the way to her table. My goodness, did she spill or something ?
Now the food, typical for this kind of place. Quantity but not quality. As other reviews the food was not hot. Room temp temperature at best.

I&#39;ve had $5.99 all the time buffets that were better than this. I used to go here in high school. Now, after returning here after living out of state for several years and trying better food, I am angry. I cannot believe I wasted all that time and money here!!
The interior is not all that bad but for a buffet that was around $25 for two people I expect a little more. It didn&#39;t seem that dirty but it also didn&#39;t seem clean. I didn&#39;t think I remember ever seeing the back section of seating open even when it&#39;s busy. 
There isn&#39;t really a large selection of food. There is your typical buffet stuff and no frills. For the price I would expect a hibachi or something! Anything! They supposedly have crab legs but they never refill it. The off times they do it&#39;s enough for a few people to grab some and it&#39;s gone in an instant. People seriously wait for them to bring some out. Like in a line. 
Sadly, pretty much everything was inedible. It was gross how everything seemed to be at room temperature except the soup. The onions in the fried rice were hardly even cooked. There were tons of bones in the salmon. Everything was just ick. 
How this place is still in business and apparently doing pretty well I don&#39;t know. I will not be back."

First helped myself to an Orange Crush soda from dispenser. It tasted really funky so set it aside.  Went to different machine and tried a Sierra Mist. Yucky too. Maybe machines need cleaning or carbonation is not right. 

Next won ton soup. Won tons hard as a rock and broth tasted like lukewarm soapy water. Could not eat. Next tried hot and sour soup. Tasted like lukewarm soapy water. Could not eat. 

Next tried lo mein noodles. Not bad but lukewarm. 

Chicken and broccoli. Broccoli good but chicken had no flavor and was lukewarm. 

Pork and veggies, pork was rubbery but broccoli was good but was lukewarm. 

Chicken wing. Took one bite and that was enough plus was lukewarm.

They do coupons which are good. I&#39;m knocking off one star because I&#39;m not certain  that the dinner buffet is worth the increased price. But the frog legs they have at that time are great, so I dunno.

I came in around 600pm on a Tuesday evening.   The place was practically empty.   It is $10.49 per adult, and 2 children were about $8.00 each.   Total bill was $27.00 which is a bit pricey for a buffet during the week. 

The food options were decent, but it was clear that the food has been sitting out for a while, without being changed out.

My biggest pet peeve, they have mini crab legs, but no crackers to crack open the legs.  You have to use your hands or your teeth.  They have been sitting out a while, so they were very hard.  I asked the waiter, and his response was &#34;no, we don&#39;t have those, but people ask all the time&#34;.    Well if people ask all the time, why don&#39;t you have it?  Duh! 

The waiter was very quick to take the place off of your table, and not ask if you were finished with the food.  I went up to help my daughter, and I came back to my table and the food was taken away. It&#39;s not like this place was very busy. 

In summary, an overpriced place, subpar food, and lack of generally friendliness.  I don&#39;t recommend coming here, unless you have nothing better to do.   Maybe lunch is better, since it&#39;s a little bit cheaper."

I figured I&#39;d try a salad but the salad had some oyster that I guess someone had spilled in it by accident. Can&#39;t blame them for that but after that, I just had to ask for my money back.

I was planning to write a one-star review for this place based on the food. Then my husband reminded me that Chinese buffets (or any buffet for that matter) aren&#39;t supposed to be amazing. They&#39;re supposed to be cheap and kind of regular-tasting and filling and good for large groups of people. With that in mind, Super China Buffet is what it is -- a typical Chinese buffet. I don&#39;t know about &#39;super.&#39; 

Yet, the food snob in me (that&#39;s what I&#39;ve become these days) still wants to review all the terrible food I had. Since there were so many meat and seafood based dishes, I couldn&#39;t really eat that much. And I had...

Steamed broccoli -- cold &amp; tasteless.
Fried shrimp -- cold &amp; tasteless &amp; a lie. It was just fried. No shrimp.
Vegetable fried rice -- cold &amp; tasteless.
Butter potatoes -- cold &amp; tasteless.
Green beans -- warm &amp; tasteless.
Seafood delight -- saucy and gooey but fine.
Vegetable lo mein -- decent. The only thing I got seconds of. I was hungry!

A small salad bar with iceberg lettuce was also available. I avoided it. The deserts looked unappetizing. All I drank was water -- I didn&#39;t want to try anything else. The fortune cookies were plain (but had amusing fortunes). We also left with overstuffed stomachs and a food coma the rest of the night.

Oh, and KIDS WERE EVERYWHERE. This is definitely a family-type joint. Come to think of it, I used to eat at Chinese buffets a lot when I was a kid. I loved all the food choices and the simple, yet delicious deserts (or so I thought back then). Now, my taste buds have evolved and I crave Thai and Indian food. Chinese food isn&#39;t a preference anymore. This thinking made me realize that Chinese food is for kids. Thai food and Indian food is for adults. So I understand why my husband loves it here, he&#39;s a kid at heart (I say that with a lot of love)!

Despite the terrible food and kiddie invasion, the service here was actually pretty awesome -- this is why my review is two stars and not one. The woman that seated us and gave us napkins kept clearing our table when we were done and checking up on us frequently. She even brought us fortune cookies instead of us having to go and get some from the desert area. How nice of her!

The small amount of bills in our wallet can be better spent elsewhere; however, If you want to fill your stomachs with a ton of different food while managing your half dozen kids, come here. If you want good food, STAY AWAY."

First, Super China Buffet does not offer sushi, crab legs, or Korean BBQ. But for only $10 a person, did you really think that you would be getting all of that? The truth is that there are two other buffets that are less than a mile away where you can get all of that but expect to pay around $25 a person. If you aren&#39;t looking for those items but instead want to enjoy plates of crab rangoon and General Tso&#39;s chicken for more than half the price, then Super China Buffet is your place. I admit that the quality isn&#39;t the best but it still satisfied my craving. There were plenty of options to choose from and some surprises too like frog legs and crawfish. 

The people that come here with high expectations will be disappointed. For the rest of us, we know exactly what we are getting for our $10 and enjoy six to ten plates of Chinese food or whatever else lands on our plates."

When a place tries to offer the widest array of food possible for any price, what ends up occurring is a middling experience at best. But there is no best to Super China Buffet.

If anything, you can drop the &#34;Super&#34;, because the place is anything but with a grimy interior and overblown prices that will leave you wondering why you shelled out for such cuisine in the first place. The &#34;China&#34; is justified because, realistically, there is some Asian food found amidst the cluttered, grotesquely disconcerting offerings. Whether or not there is anything redeeming, or worth eating at all, is a difficult decision to weigh. But, honestly, there isn&#39;t.

As with most places that feel the need to put &#34;Buffet&#34; in the name of their locale, the overall offering is mediocre at best, but will most likely result in leaving full of regret.

It&#39;s always pretty empty when we go on weekdays around 11, but the people that are dining there are usual creepers. It makes for a fun experience. :P Today was no different. I must say we had no problem getting our table cleared quickly as some others have commented.

They had a couple new choices today...cheese sticks and chicken nuggets! Perfect for a Chinese buffet, right? Well they actually were good but they were obviously just frozen ones. Good nonetheless. Today I commented on all of the food being a bit better then usual which surprised me. The great thing about this buffet is they just have tons and tons of choices...I actually LIKE their sweet &amp; sour chicken.

With twenty plus reviews, I&#39;m still not sure how they managed to get to two stars on average. My fellow Yelpers, you are too kind!

The first warning sign should have been extremely rude lady at the cash register. One would think she was a mute, not even offering a &#34;hello&#34;, instead just demanding how many people were in our party when there were just three of us. She swiped my card and handed it back without so much as a &#34;thank you&#34;. You would have thought she was doing me a favor by sitting on her rickety stool. Seriously.

If the first warning sign wasn&#39;t bad enough, I noticed as we were on our way to the trays, that the place has more security cameras than a casino&#39;s cash counting room. I kid you not, everywhere you look there&#39;s an eye in the sky. Coupled with obnoxious signs on the tables that tell you what you can and can&#39;t do in the restaurant, it gives the whole joint a real  Big Brother feel. Can you give the Orwell 1984 award to a buffet? If so, these guys win.

Last but not least, a lot of the the food was cold on the display. The cherry on top of the whole experience is that I found a nice long hair in the rice. Gross! If the health inspectors were to visit this place more regularly, I&#39;m sure they would have had their license revoked by now."

Now, for $11 of sub-standard food and a small bowl of soft serve, it&#39;s really hard to justify.  Maybe if I was 16 again, I&#39;d rate this higher.

The only thing that stuck out to me regarding the food selection is that the only vegetables are green beans and broccoli.  Everything was pretty bland, to the point where I wish they piled on the MSG so at least there&#39;d be some flavor.  The staff does their job of keeping the trays full at least, but I&#39;m more annoyed by the other customers.  Kids are constantly running around, crying and screaming, and their parents just let them roam around unleashed (literally?).  I&#39;ve seen more civil kids at the carnival.

Oh, and as a general protip for all Chinese buffets: Stay away from the American food section.  Their mac and cheese looked like a nasty orange soup.  Oof."

As I walked back to my car, I could see the birds in the parking lot were eating something off the ground. It was vomit. Sadly, what they were eating was probably only marginally worse than my meal.

Sorry for the gross review, but seriously, don&#39;t eat here. Why would you? You are a stone&#39;s throw away from Ho Luck, Smiling Buddah, and Thai Garden. Great Asian restaurants are a dime a dozen in Schaumburg and Hoffman Estates and most of them are fairly cheap. 

The only reasons I can think of that you would go to the SCB:

A) You are a buffet lover and &#34;don&#39;t care anymore.&#34;
B) You have never tried any other restaurants in the area.
C) You want to spend the rest of the day in the bathroom regretting your life.

Can we all just agree that seafood sitting out under heat lamps for hours is a bad idea? If you&#39;re dying for sub-par Chinese, remember, there&#39;s always Panda Express. Don&#39;t gamble your health and happiness on the nastiness they serve at the Super China Buffet."

Anyways second, my boyfriend asked if they will be bringing out anymore fresh noodles because the ones they had out were cold (and they looked disgusting), she then said the kitchen is closed and no one else told her that, my boyfriend said &#34;we&#39;ll I did&#34; and she said &#34;okay only one&#34;......

THEN to top it off the younger lady said &#34;we have a microwave&#34; as in she wanted him to heat up his food in the microwave....... What!? I&#39;ve never heard of doing such a thing at a resturaunt. 
They have 2 pop machines and I got fruit punch from one, go back to my seat, and it tastes like water and no I&#39;m not exaggerating. So I go to the other machine and get another one.. It also tastes like water. So I drank pop which I don&#39;t really like to do that often but whatever.

- Jalapeno Chicken
- Grilled Chicken (not actually grilled, but delicious)
- Honey Chicken (with pineapple)
- Crab Rangoon (mostly cream cheese.  Not the best, but good enough)

I eat the same thing every time I go there and I can&#39;t get enough.  Every one of my co-workers who tries the odd seafood type things, typically doesn&#39;t like it.  So I stick to the deep fried chicken in sugary sauces and you won&#39;t be disappointed.  I&#39;ve never left hungry."

This place was bar faaarrr THE worst Chinese food i have ever had. There is a fast food drive-thru Chinese joint in dekalb that is better than this stuff. 

I&#39;ve come here once before and was pretty satisfied with their lunch buffet, but this past weekend my mom suggested splurging on Chinese food since shes been on a diet for the past several months. Boy was that a waste of calories for her. We walked in, i think it was 16 something for both of us to eat, and grabbed a booth. We made our first round trying to decide what we wanted first. At first glace everything looked really good. They had all the usual stuff spicy chicken sweet chicken, beef, pork, veggies, and seafood along with your standard fried rice, white rice, noodles and soups. I always start out with one of my favorites which is egg drop soup. i also got some egg rolls, crab rangoon, mongoalian chicken, and some sauted mushrooms. the soup wasn&#39;t bad just bland. everything else was dried out and seriously i don&#39;t know how.. but it just lacked any flavor there could be.. even if you doused it with soy sauce! i tried literally one bite of everything and pushed the plate aside, but kept the soup because that was the only decent thing so far. I went up again grabbed a pork pot sticker, fried rice, sweet n sour chicken and a stuffed mushroom. Geeww.. the freakin pork they used tasted like breakfast sausage in everything, and i thought i was going to lose a tooth trying to bite through the sweet and sour chicken! I said screw it i was still hungry and couldn&#39;t bear to try anything else that might make my stomach queasy so you want to know what i stuck with for the rest of the meal? egg drop soup and white rice... what a bummer :( 

My mom was equally disgusted with what she chose and went for the good ol American salad bar. To top everything off after going back a couple of times trying to find a diamond in the rough, our plates still filled with cold food piled up at the end of our table. nobody ever came by to take our stuff and when the girl did a couple minutes before we left, she tried to take away the one thing i tried to fill up on; my freakin soup.. i don&#39;t think so lol I will NEVER go back here to say the least. they supposedly have crab legs out for the dinner buffet.. god only knows what the hell they&#39;ve done to ruin those too."

While I do have my favorite places, I&#39;m rarely too picky about food.  And yet, yesterday one place was added to the list of restaurants where I will never eat again.

I think the logic behind going here was:

a) too much driving around Schaumburg looking for the Ikea store led to extreme hunger

b) How can a Chinese buffet be bad?

This is without a doubt the worst buffet I have ever eaten in my life.  The only food I tried that didn&#39;t make me sick was the little Chinese donuts and the iced tea.  Most of the food was cold and about half of it was American food.  If I&#39;m in the mood for cold macaroni and cheese and soupy mashed potatoes, I&#39;ll try the dumpster behind KFC, thank you very much.

Additionally, they consider 2:03pm on a Sunday to be &#34;dinnertime&#34;, which raised the cost of the buffet to almost ten dollars.  A rip-off for even the finest of buffets!

Add in the fact that it&#39;s perhaps the most miserable looking restaurant in Illinois and there you have it.  Thank goodness I hardly ever end up in this area, so that I don&#39;t accidentally drive past it, bringing back the demons that haunted my dreams and my bowels all last night."

They have this weird taco thing, I&#39;m not even sure what&#39;s in it, but it&#39;s a unique taste. I kinda like it. My fiance liked the honey chicken and the grill chicken. The beef was kinda slimy.

I come here often since my office is down the road, so close I could take a nice 10 minute walk if its nice out.  Actually, I should do that more often, since about 99% of the menu is artery clogging goodness!

My suggestions:  2 dogs/fries combo or the burger combo. Very classic!  But the BLT is freakin&#39; awesome too.  You&#39;d think a few slices of bacon to cover the bread and the L and the T but no no no.... you get a heaping mound of bacon and lots of lettuce and tomato.  Biggest BLT ever!  My friends also get the Italian Beef which I hear is great.  Another option I see many people get is their gyros which is on my radar!

Upon arriving here, I see that they have a two hot dog special with fries and a drink for $5.00. Bingo! I went for it.

The hot dogs were nice and fresh with all the ingredients. Pic attached. 
Pretty tasty dogs. Fries were hot! The taste of them was OK, but I am not an expert on fries. Overall, this is quite a good deal for $5.

One other note: this place was very clean. The lobby was nice, staff friendly. I will return to try some other items.

The name of the store, proudly emblazoned on the garment, was &#34;Big Peckers.&#34;  Absolutely no relationship to this place, but the name makes me think of that shirt that my parents forbid me from wearing.

Found myself without anyone else to eat with today at lunch, so I grabbed my book (ipad) and decided to pick up a few dogs and quietly read and eat.  From the outside the store looks huge, as it is part of a strip mall, and the triangular shaped roof and small sign out front create this weird optical illusion.  Inside it is much smaller that I expected.  But it was warm, and inviting inside, so that is a plus.

Food items are listed on a wall, and they have much more than dogs, but I figured since they are &#34;Big Sammy&#39;s Hot Dogs&#34; I had better start with them.  I ordered the #1...two hot dogs with everything, fries and a drink.  In the soda fountain they had root beer, so that is a plus right there.  I looooove hot dogs and root beer.  The fries were hot and fresh. Another plus.  The hot dogs looked good, but were not a &#39;full&#39; as a portillo&#39;s dog.  They had the pickle, mustard, peppers, &amp; onions.  I didn&#39;t notice anything else on them.  And everything just wasn&#39;t as &#39;big&#39; as a typical Chicago Dog as I&#39;ve been accustomed to.  It was still good though, and I scarfed them both down while plowing through a chapter.

There are two things that would make this a four-star hot dog place, in my eyes...
1. Hotter dogs.  The two dogs I had today were in-between hot and warm. Fire them up and make sure they are hot.  The hotter the better!
2. Better rolls.  The rolls were soft, but of the really soft/chewy variety.  Give me something other than &#39;wonder-bread&#39; rolls.  I may have enjoyed these rolls when I was 10, but with more than a few decades under my belt, I am looking for a more substantial wrap on my weenie.

End result, I will be back, and I&#39;ll bring my friends, but for now, it won&#39;t be on my short list of go-to places."

I was not impressed with the quality of the food.  The buns were those cloud-like fluffy white bread things.  Very cheap.  The hot dogs were generic... no Vienna beef here.

My trip to Big Sammy&#39;s cost me seven bucks.

This wasn&#39;t a bad place, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go here again."

Decent food, but the size keeps getting smaller andthe price keeps going up??
Spent $9.40 for the gyro special the other day, and there was not as much meat as in the past.

Has anyone else noticed the new cups are not the 22oz advertised?  Barely holds a 16.9 oz bottle of water......maybe 20oz at most."

This joint is like a cleaner version of &#34;Shorty&#39;s&#34; (in Wooddale) and a smaller Portillo&#39;s. Their menu has a variety of Portillo&#39;s type foods.

We ordered the hot dog, gyro and fries. 

*Pepsi products*

Hot Dog w/Everything Minus Mustard was pretty good. The actual size of the hot dog was smaller (definitely no Costco size). Though the size was small, it was decent. It came with sport peppers, pickle, relish, mustard,... not bad. not bad. 

Gyro was good. 

Lots of fries. 

I will come back again. A-OK in my books.

**It&#39;s a little on the pricier side for the food that it is. Hot dog was $2.49. and gyro combo (with fries and drink) was $8.50..."

It&#39;s been in business for a number of years and it&#39;s THE establishment in Elk Grove for gyros, cheesy beef, burgers, and more.  And even if you&#39;re living paycheck-to-paycheck, they have a sweet hot dog deal guaranteed to fill you up.  

Do you need more convincing?  Well, here&#39;s some food for thought:  in just the past few years, Big Sammy&#39;s has grown exponentially from their old location in Elk Crossing Center (remember &#34;Fradillio&#39;s Hot Dogs&#34;?) to their new location by the old Sears Hardware, and now they&#39;re in more towns too!

I&#39;m not saying you should eat there because they have a solid business model; it&#39;s just a testament to the fact that people love this place and are willing to travel to get their awesome food.  The service is good too - quick, friendly, and personable.  

I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here, and if you&#39;re lucky enough to catch Big Sammy himself, strike up a conversation with him - he&#39;s a great guy.  He travels to each location to actually do work (which I have a profound respect for) and loves chatting it up with the customers when it&#39;s not busy (which, fortunately for his business, is not often!)

I wouldn&#39;t consider them the same quality as a Portillo&#39;s, but it&#39;s a close second; and since Portillo&#39;s doesn&#39;t offer gyros, Big Sammy&#39;s is the place."

I characterize Sammy&#39;s by the good food, reasonable prices and fast friendly service. Chicago area hot dog stands can be judged by (obviously) their hot dogs and trimmings, but also by the italian beef/sausage combo.  The hot dog stacks up against the other restaurants by the copious fresh ingredients. The dog itself is a bit skimpy, but I suspect that&#39;s because they have been running a $5.00 two-dog special with fries and a drink. The combo sandwich is marked as one of the better ones that I have had recently, with as much tasty sausage and quality beef than can fit in a bun. The french fries stand out as being so good that I am willing to risk breaking the low-carb diet. Big Sammy&#39;s is a dependably good lunch spot."

And while images of Fried Green Tomatoes flashed by, I decide to park a few spots over. While lamenting my waste of hormonal imbalance and rage, I notice that the future little adults couldn&#39;t even fit the boat of a Buick in the spot, so they go zooming around to park in another - and OOPS! SMASHED the front end into a really nice pick up. AWESOME. So - they are looking around and try to get out of it. As I&#39;m walking in, the owner of the truck sees what&#39;s happening. He&#39;s big, (even bigger than Big Sammy) and he is ANGRY! So, it&#39;s lunch AND a show. And just when I think it can&#39;t get better - Big Sammy HIMSELF is manning the counter. THE Big Sammy! I place my order and he asks my name. My name??!!??!! Why, Big Sammy, are you TRYING to seduce me???? 

But, it turns out that they call out names when the order is ready. And this joint is just that friendly. Alas, my dreams of reconstructing my life to become the Sausage Queen of Chicago go darting out the door. So it&#39;s back to watching the pop tarts trying to reconstruct their headlight and front end. My name is finally called, and as I pick up my food, I say thanks, and Big Sammy tells me &#34;Have a nice day Honey...&#34;  Honey??? I knew it! He was trying to seduce me! But sorry Big Sammy, that is one hot sausage that I will have to pass on... as I am happily married.  But I would have made an AMAZING Sausage Queen of Chicago ... Sigh.

We heard about them opening up while we were signing our lease at One Arlington. (the old Sheraton that has been converted to luxe apartments) 

We stopped in one night around 8PM for two small thin-crust pizzas. 
We were seated immediately in a spacious and roomy booth. 

The decor is very warm, welcoming, and modern. 
The booths are made of black grain wood and upholstered with a comfy red studded cushion. The atmosphere is very welcoming and is one of the nicest Aurelio&#39;s I&#39;ve been to. 

The bar is sprawling, with over thirty beers available. They offer a nice selection of craft beers as well. 


Now, onto the food!
The pizza was served piping hot and covered in fresh ingredients and gooey, melty cheese! The sauce was just right, not too chunky, not too runny. The crust was incredible as well. Not too crunchy, not too soft. We have found our favorite new pizza place. 

After devouring the pizza, we decided to order the &#34;dough dippers&#34;. 
The dough dippers are basically pizza dough that are deep friend and rolled in cinnamon sugar. They&#39;re served with sweet vanilla icing. Simply sinfully delicious! 

The service and waiter was very nice. However, the wait for the pizzas to come out approached a half hour. Keep in mind, the restaurant was somewhat empty. However, I cannot hold this against them, as we came in three days after they opened. I understand they have opening pains/delays.

The green peppers tasted freezer burnt, and as you can see from the pick- were an unusual color. The sausage was undercooked and they sprinkled dried oregano on the top.  (The medium 16&#34; pizza was $16 with 1.75 per additional topping- for that kind of money we were expecting a high end pizza with fresh ingredients) Trisha, the manager could tell we did not like the pizza and offered to make us a new one.

That&#39;s about to change, and quite dramatically.
It&#39;s about time that a restaurant claimed this convenient spot. We had an opportunity to dine here on a Friday night, as part of their friends and family soft open (we got the neighbor invite!). The interior decor was modern Italian. Not the over-posh feel, the comfortable, stylish, and inviting kind. They have brick accent walls, red and black booth-backs, a stunning bar area (with 30+ beers!) and neat Italian themed art on the walls.
George, the owner, made rounds asking the diners how they liked the place, the food, and service. He had a genuine handshake, to match the genuinely delicious meal we had.
First off, we had Josh as our server. He was cool- very attentive, and confident, even though it was their first real night open. Awesome server, awesome service.
Second, the food. If I knew Italian I&#39;d insert a line about &#39;magnific&#39; (think Italian chef shouting the word after trying his own dish) but alas, I am only fluent in English. 
Try the garlic bread. It&#39;s seasoned perfectly- buttery and crisp without being overly bready. The dinner salad is HUGE. Enough for 4 people easily and it was very fresh. 
Finally, the pizza. We had a medium this crust Super Six pizza. 
You can see it in the photo below- it was truly a work of art. The crust was thin and crispy, and in no way resembled cardboard. It was cooked evenly through, no burnt spots, and the sauce was really remarkable. This was topped with pepperoni, sausage, ham, peppers, mushrooms and cheese. As I devoured my half of the pizza, (without any shame, mind you) I made satisfying groans. I would have used words, were it not for the constant shoveling of epic pizza, into my pie-hole. I had sauce all over my hands, and I didn&#39;t want to let any of it go to waste- that&#39;s how good it was.
Somebody, (my boyfriend) didn&#39;t finish his half. Three squares remained, and we opted to take them to go. Josh packaged them up along with two dumdum pops which were attached. It was a really nice touch!
Really great food. Really awesome restaurant. Really incredible staff and management.

Lunch special was a very large bowl of soup, drink, and 6in pizza for $9, which I think is pretty good. Nothing great here but a decent and affordable lunch. Will most likely be back."

It was awesome! I got the special of a 6&#34; pizza, a side salad and a drink for under $10. The salad was so packed on the plate, it was almost falling off. Lots of croutons, onion, and pieces of tomato. I got bleu cheese dressing and it had huge chunks of bleu cheese in it - YUM. My pizza was also very, very good. For the lunch special, you can have up to five ingredients. I can&#39;t wait to go back! 

The service was a bit slow, but since my girlfriends and I hadn&#39;t seen each other for a while, we were gabbing non-stop, so that was fine. My friends had the cheese ravioli with soup and the spaghetti with a salad, and they  seemed to enjoy their lunches too.  

I ate dinner at Biaggi&#39;s the evening before and I thought Aurelio&#39;s food was so much better (for much less $$$$) than Biaggi&#39;s. I think that was why I was so excited, LOL. I will definitely be back and will be introducing more friends to their lunch specials."

Took me a few months to finally get over here to try it...
Came in for lunch today... Waited at the front reception area for almost 2 minutes before anyone approached asking if I was looking to be seated...  
Was told to sit anywhere in the bar that I wanted... Sat at the bar itself...  Bartender took my drink order right away and then took another 3-4 minutes to ask if I was ready to order (menu was open and closed within the first 30 seconds - knew I wanted pizza)... All the while she just stood around behind the bar doing nothing.
Bartender (Debbie) didn&#39;t talk as much as she mumbled...  Very hard to understand what she was saying most of the time.  
Ordered a medium pizza with double sausage.   About 20 minutes later out comes 2 pizzas.  One with regular sausage and the 2nd with double sausage.  Realized that she messed up my order in the computer and forgot to delete the original single.sausage pizza.  No problem.
Ran out of water twice and she was no where to be found to refill it.
Pizza was as good as I remember from the other locations except that it wasn&#39;t very hot... It was somewhere between hot and warm.

Will be back for the food, but not the service.  Maybe I&#39;ll order to go next time."

We had high hopes as we love the original Aurelio&#39;s on the South Side. This location is far from the original in terms of quality. 

Our pizza came out and was very salty. I think it&#39;s the combination of cheeses they use. The crust was very soggy in the center as well. The outer ridge was somewhat crisp but definitely not cooked long enough with the soggy center. The pizza was also served on the oven rack it was baked on which made the pizza extremely difficult to handle. Because it was so soggy, the pizza fell through the grates. 

We also had the minestrone soup which tasted like the sauce from Spaghettios. 

We arrived at 5 and there were several servers and bussers standing around waiting for people to come in. I understand them not being very busy at that time but why is many of the staff standing in the dining room looking out the windows for customers? 

There are definitely a lot of kinks to be worked out. We were not impressed with the food and are hopeful it improves."

It&#39;s the first pizza I ever ate and I&#39;ve never found any that came close to the unique taste of Aurelio&#39;s. Joe and the rest of the family were the nicest people and you always felt like you were going to a cozy neighborhood place where they were really glad to see you. I just found out an Aurelio&#39;s opened in Arlington Heights and I was really happy that I could have my favorite pizza nearby.

A group of 5 of us went the other night. The restaurant itself looks pretty nice with the exception of some rather weird pictures -- no theme to them, pictures of food mixed with advertising posters. It will be very noisy when full b/c there is nothing to absorb the sound. The booths were comfortable but if you&#39;re a big person you&#39;ll need to dine at a table. The restaurant was seriously cold (you needed a jacket or heavy sweater). We asked them to lower the A/C, and it was ok for a bit but then they must have cranked it back up. Be prepared with a jacket!

There were many servers standing around. They&#39;re all young and neat looking but seemed a little clueless. It is new so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get better. The young girl we had was very nice. Our pizzas (all thin crust) took 1/2 hour and they didn&#39;t all come out at the same time. The pizza was delicious, tasted as I remember it from Homewood. We also got a couple orders of the Dippin Dough (fried dough dusted with cinnamon served with a vanilla sauce. One order is easily enough for 3 people and it was very good.

The problem I see is with the owner and manager (2 separate people). Joe Aurelio was the best and he genuinely took an interest in the customers and got to know many by name. The owner here seems very gruff and came around but you could tell he was just going through the motions. One person at our table gave a polite suggestion to the manager who came around and he smirked at him and seemed annoyed . The management here is a far cry from the original, something I don&#39;t understand since a franchisee is an actual owner who has a lot invested. That being said, we&#39;ll probably just get delivery because the atmosphere is a little too unwelcoming for our taste. Or we&#39;ll make the trek to Homewood. Joe, we sure do miss you!"

The place has an upscale vibe, a good bar area, and is an overall comfortable, clean restaurant. 

The beer menu is expansive, 30 or so beers on the menu, although they were out of their own signature tap...no matter, I tried a Misfit IPA from Wild Onion Brewery in Barrington and a Wobble IPA from Two Brothers that came in its own wobbly glass. Good selection.

The thin crust isn&#39;t the same flimsy cracker thin crust you get at other places...it&#39;s got substance. We had the bosco sticks, a works pizza and a pepperoni pizza. Everyone enjoyed it. We will definitely be back.

By the way, cold pizza leftovers aren&#39;t really my thing, but I just had some this morning and it was very tasty too."

The first time for pizza and salad.  There are numerous salad dressings to choose from including a poppy seed and a rare one for restaurants,  warm bacon dressing...yum.  We tried 2 pizzas the first night.  Pineapple and ham.  The other one was half sausage half cheese.  They drizzle pizza sauce down the middle of the half and half pizza so you know which half is which.  That was a perk for me because I love their pizza sauce, a tad on the sweet side.  Our second trip was for sandwiches.  My husband got their classic Italian and I got a meatball sandwich.  All of their sandwiches are toasted and tasty.  Fries are crinkle cut.  The sandwiches come with chips and there is an upcharge for fries or onion rings.  They serve Pepsi products and have very good fresh brewed iced tea. They have a full bar as well.

Aurelios pizza is our life-long favorite and we have driven all over the suburbs to enjoy it. When we learned one was coming to our town, we were overjoyed. That was short lived. Our first carryout order a month ago was 0 for 4 pies correct. All our pizzas were wrong sizes/toppings. No apologies or refunds offered. When I went back to speak with the mgmt the next week, the manager was apologetic but the owner was a complete tool. I had typed up what we had ordered along with what they had given us. Not only did he NOT apologize, but went on to describe how the mistakes were not that bad. UGH! The pies were soggy and luke warm in addition to being incorrect. TONIGHT we decided to try again and dine in. The staff were initially attentive but soon thereafter disappeared. Couldn&#39;t even get a water re-fill. 3 of the 4 pies were correct, and the one they had to re-make took forever and was shoddily done. Undercooked again, and definitely too little too late, as everyone else was long finished eating. NO ONE apologized. The owner was present but never came by. It took so long to get the check that most of our party left. When the check finally arrived, the manager finally came over and said &#34;I feel like we disappointed you tonight.&#34; He took the price of an appetizer off the bill. Again, too little too late. No apology offered.

The GOOD news is that the Aurelios in Addison is consistently AWESOME, with excellent product and service. All future visits for us will be to that location."

After taking a bite from the first hearty slice, I noticed one thing immediately that I dislike in food...TOO MUCH SALT! No need to dump a 5-gallon pail of it in the sauce; Gordon Ramsay would be PO&#39;d...lol. There is so much salt that it overpowered the flavors of the other ingredients and rendered them tasteless. The crust is different...reminds me of Reggios frozen pizza with their &#34;Famous Butter Crust&#34; which makes me wonder if the 2 are related in any way...akin to Home Run Inn. Prices are a bit steep, must reflect the high rents in the area which is passed on to the consumer. A bit pricey for &#39;eh&#39; bland pizza. Perhaps the quality is just a local thing and the other Aurelio&#39;s locations are better? Who knows?  I prefer Nino&#39;s in Buffalo Grove...well balanced flavors throughout...no overkill on salt and spices...just one darn good pie! To each his own I guess."

I got home and looked at bottom of pizza,it was not properly cooked,I called restaurant, spoke to manager,believer her name was Lisa,she told me all their pizzas are cooked to a certain amount of time per corporate guidelines and that next time I should order it well done. Dear Lisa,your lack of understanding the true problem is laughable. Your pizza oven was not hot enough to properly bake the pizza, the bottom of the crust on my pizza was not brown anywhere,and your lack of offering a replacement or credit is unacceptable, I gladly would of returned for a replacement and brought back the picked up pizza for you to see, but your lack of understanding Customer Service, and how to treat a customer has convinced me to avoid your restaurants."

mustard, relish, onion, tomatoe, peppers, pickle spear with fries and a beverage for about $5.00. Plus it&#39;s quick and they don&#39;t let you walk out without your change from a $20. really, what&#39;s not to like?

no kraut, no cheese, no lettuce, no ketchup, no problem c}:-)"

This place is just average in about every factor one would typically judge an independent sandwich/hot dog place to be. 

Their menu is certainly diverse enough. Gyros, Italian beef sandwiches, calzones, hot dogs, onion rings, etc. etc. etc. They pretty much run the gamut of unhealthy food options. The problem is that most of the time when you become a jack of all trades you manage to be a master of none, and that certainly seems like a fitting descriptor of Hot Dog Express. I do not know about you guys, but if I am planning on splurging on high calorie and/or cholesterol food, I want to get far more bang for my buck than I got here.  The hot dog was decent, but nothing special, and the fries (which did appear to be homemade) were soggy and over-seasoned. Both of my co-workers who came to lunch with me had similar sentiments. On the positive side of things, this place is dirt cheap, which is helpful if you are on a budget. 

I am normally a staunch advocate of supporting local businesses over chains, and for that reason, I will likely pay this place another visit on the chance they were just having an off day."

They have a sign that states that they serve homemade Mexican tamales. Well I say ok sounds good!! So I asked order taker/cashier as to what type of meat are in them as I don&#39;t eat pork. She states they have pork and beef supreme. So I say oh ok!! Give me 2 beef. I get back to work and open wrap for tamales they are in a plastic boil bag &amp; so not close to being homemade. of good quality.  I called to ask about and was told supreme beef means name of company who makes only the pork ones are homemade.  At $1.40 each i could have gone to grocery store and got like 6-8 tamales. I also ordered a gyros and ummmm no the meat was not of quality I know of gyros meat. Sauce was good!  I can say they do have prompt service but I wont go out of my way to go there in future. Lesson learned...

If you have a taste for a burger but don&#39;t have the $$$$ for Portillo&#39;s, come here. Their beefs, burgers and gyros are decent.

My only gripe with this establishment is the price they charge for gravy bread. It&#39;s not on the menu, but they sell it. Problem is, the price is always different. I&#39;ve paid $1.25 one day. A couple of months later, $1.00. 6 months later it&#39;s $1.50. Never a consistent price. They seem to charge by the seat of their pants. Not cool. Set a damn price and put it on the menu!"

We came around dinner time. The ambience reminded me of a classy bus station/swanky Dunkin Donuts. Nothing at all wrong with that, of course. My boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich, and I ordered a hot dog meal and a vanilla shake. Before my receipt finished printing, my meal was ready. My boyfriend&#39;s meal came soon after.

His steak was HUGE. It spanned the length and width of the Italian bun and then some.  He said it was &#34;pretty good&#34; and tender.  My hot dog wasn&#39;t terrible, but it was disappointing. They use regular, cheapie hot dog buns even for the Chicago-style dogs. It is not the same without a poppy seed bun. It&#39;s just not.

The fries were just okay. Not the worst I&#39;ve ever had, but not the best.  They get cold pretty quickly, so eat them fast or ask for fresh.  The ketchup that was supplied at our table was watery and nearly tasteless.

My vanilla shake was pretty much like drinking thickened vanilla milk. I don&#39;t know if it was the humidity and heat in the place with no a/c, or not enough ice cream, but the texture was pretty thin. But I enjoyed the taste. I am a sucker for almost anything vanilla, so I wasn&#39;t entirely let down. 

I wasn&#39;t wowed by this place, but I&#39;d give it another chance. The prices aren&#39;t too bad (hot dog with fries and a soda is $4.79), and the service is friendly and quick.

Word to the wise: soda refills are fifty cents. Skip the ice and your drink will last a wee bit longer."

I had been looking for a place I can go get a gyros from time to time along with other fixins.  Their prices are great!  I can go here and get a quality meal for cheap or I can go to Portillos and get a $10 burger.  I choose Hot Dog Express.  I can usually get out of here for under $8 per visit, which when you consider other choices (and Schaumburg does not have as many as you would think), you will spend $10 to $12, here its consistant!  After a few visits, they remember you and great you as they should.  

Their Gyros is like any other place, off the rack, onto the grill and yes, on a single pita, so how can one complain that you only get 1 pita?  Have you been to another place that gives you less meat along with more than 1 pita?  I will take Hot Dog Express.

As for their Pizza Puffs, very cheaply priced and perfection every time, if you are crazing a hot dog joint with a great menu, then Hot Dog Express is your place!"

I prefer CostCo hotdogs which was much bigger, tastier and just $1.50 including a drink.

Interior is old and sticky with layers upon layers of grease and the workers look even greasier. 

My gyros was crispy. It literally made crunching sounds as I chewed on the overcooked gyros chips inside of that pita. No bueno.

The fries were the standard thick cut frozen variety and stunk of old oil.

I tried the tamale since the sign outside said homemade. Homemade it was, corn husk and all, but the filling was scarce to none. Just a sliver of some mystery meat found only in the very middle. At $1.49 it certainly was not worth it.

Prices are fairly cheap for the amount of food received so it&#39;s great if you&#39;re on a budget but aren&#39;t watching your weight. 

With so many other better choices for the same type of food within the immediate area (one mile radius) I highly doubt I&#39;d ever bother coming back here as sanitation looks to be a serious concern here."

With a name like Hot Dog Express I decided it would be a good idea to try the hot dog. The first thing to note before I begin a further description is that this place seems to be unrelated to the other restaurant I reviewed that also had the name Hot Dog Express located inside of Stratford Square Mall in Bloomingdale.

The hot dog I received came on a dry and somewhat hard non-poppy seed bun. The pickle included on the hot dog was about average thickness but was very sour. The application of mustard, onions and relish appeared to be fine. And celery salt was visibly noticeable on the slices of tomato and bun. The hot dog itself is the skinless type, it seemed to have been unevenly steamed, One side of the hot dog felt like it was only room temperature, the other seemed warm. This felt like the hot dog wasn&#39;t steamed evenly or thoroughly.

I also received fries with the hot dog, these fries weren&#39;t particularly salty, they were the long type of fries. I wouldn&#39;t say they were greasy or crispy either, they were simply bland.

Overall Hot Dog express failed to impress me with their hot dog. The hard and dry bun mixed with the uneven temperature of the sausage itself is inexcusable for a place that one might think would serve a lot of hot dogs. Better options definitely exist. Avoid this place if you&#39;re hankering for a hot dog."

I ordered a polish sausage in a hot dog bun with fries and drink for $6.  My husband had the Philly cheese steak for $5.  My polish dog tasted ok.  Nothing special about it.  Just topped with onion, pickles, tomato slice, and a pepper.  As for the Philly cheese steak, it was cheesy.  I thought It was put on a very thick bread and not enough beef at all.

The tamale was ABSOLUTELY SPICY! I love spicy food and this made my tongue numb and stomach hurt after I ate a bite of it.

Tortas Frontera is located at the very back of Terminal 3. You keep walking and it almost feels like you&#39;ll never find it, and then it finally appears! The bars/stools were all taken.

The thoughtfulness of the parts of the torta added up to something much bigger than the sum of those parts. Everything was well balanced, but nothing was lost in the sandwich. Nothing was hidden, even when paired with the amazing salsa. 

I could eat this for breakfast every single day. You can&#39;t go wrong with bacon, eggs, and avocado but this is potentially the ultimate form of that holy alliance."

I was in Chicago for a day and when I was leaving the airport in the morning, I saw a long line. I came back to the airport later the day, and I saw a long line again. I thought the food must be good! I looked it up on Yelp and saw many good reviews, so I decided to try it. 

My flight was scheduled at 5:30pm, and I got in a line at 4:30pm. I waited about 10 minutes to order my food and another 10 minutes to get food.  I ordered Pepito. 
The service was efficient, and the staff was nice. 
While I was waiting for my food, I was able to see them making food. Everything looked tasty and very fresh. 

After I received my food, I ran to my gate which got changed, so I had to ran more. 
I got to the gate and wanted to eat my food, but I was going to wait because the boarding was starting soon. My flight kept delaying, and I didn&#39;t get to my seat an hour later than it was originally scheduled.
By the time I got to eat my food, it was cold, and bread was a little soggy, which I didn&#39;t mid at all, but it was still good. I should have eaten right after I got it though. 
My sandwich had jalapeño in it, so it was a little spicy which I liked. Fresh ingredients and nice flavor. My sandwich came with salsa.  

The portions are generous, and the prices are okay. 
I would definitely come back to try other dishes."

There&#39;s another location on campus at Northwestern, where the experience is similar.

The food is pretty darn good. I&#39;ve had a breakfast bowl here, which comes with fluffy eggs, roasted sweet potato, black beans, and a tomatillo-based sauce (if I remember correctly). If you&#39;re a fan of Mexican-style breakfasts (huevos rancheros, etc.) you will like this, too. The tortas are also generally good. I like the short rib one a lot.

Why am I docking two points? The service is incredibly slow at both locations to which I&#39;ve been. You order, you pay, you get a buzzer, you wait (on average) about twenty minutes before your buzzer actually goes off and you can pick up your food. This, while not ideal, is okay at the Northwestern location. But at O&#39;Hare, where twenty minutes can be the difference between making your flight and having to hitch-hike all the way to Seattle, this is unacceptable. If you&#39;re going to have a fast-food, counter-service business, at the very least you should make it known to customers that service may take a while before they actually pay. Ideally, you should just be faster, but Frontera tries to keep things freshly made, so I understand that may not be an option.

Go here if you&#39;re early to your gate. Otherwise, just get Starbucks."

Also, they had some old school Shakira blasting in the airport. So. 

They use local ingredients. A board next to the menu shows where they are currently sourcing their ingredients from, including surrounding states of Wisconsin and Iowa.

I&#39;m a little bit turned off from eating meat right now so I didn&#39;t order something I would have usually. I tried the mushroom torta with crimini, shitake, oyster mushroom and mojo. It had a tomato based sauce as well that was...not great.  But I just don&#39;t like tomato sauces in my food it seems, something I just need to come to terms with. The bread tasted fresh and was of high quality.  So...overall the torta was just okay for me but i have confidence that with the right order it&#39;ll be much better and I&#39;ll be sure to stop by next time I&#39;m at Ohare. 

Bonus: got some alfajores to take home with me. Should have said taste of Uruguay instead of taste of Argentina but I&#39;ll forgive them ;D I got the pack that came with chocolate covered, white chocolate covered and &#34;maizena&#34;. All delicious and made a great gift to share with the fam."

I had the chorizo torta.  Spicy but not too spicy.  Is that a hint of vinegar?  Not sure but the flavors were bold and delicious.  They also have soups and other offerings and you can order chips and guac on the side.  Food came out quickly, not that it mattered for me and it looks like you can order online as you are disembarking at your gate and they will have it ready for you when you get there to pick it up.

However, if I get to the airport early and am lucky enough to enjoy a torta at this delightful kiosk, they come in very handy! 

The lines for sandwiches are always long, but move quickly. The buzzer indicating that your food is ready also will go off pretty quickly. Meanwhile, you can grab a drink at their bar, or (insiders tip) the buzzer range goes across to the other bar in the Terminal area if you can&#39;t snag a seat at the Frontera bar. 

Reasonably priced sandwiches (same as in Bayless&#39; actual Xoco restaurant in downtown) plus decent beer, liquor, and margarita menu makes for an extremely favorable pre-flight experience if you want to pass out to avoid the inevitably awful children sitting around you."

I was about to resign to eating sad airport deep dish pizza when I found out about Tortas Frontera. I&#39;ve never had a torta before but was intrigued by all the rave reviews, especially for airport fare. At the recommendation of some other reviewers, I downloaded the mobile app and placed an order for pick-up. I would recommend doing it about 30 minutes prior to when you will be arriving; you can also set a time in advance (I chose an hour ahead). I received another e-mail notifying me that my order would be ready soon, and heard my name called about 5 minutes later at the Pick Up window. 

I ordered way too much food, just to have the full experience. I got the Pepito Torta, a cup of the corn chowder, and also the chips with guac &#34;fully dressed&#34; (aka loaded with a ton of amazing toppings). I didn&#39;t even get to dig into the chips/guac yet but I&#39;m currently nursing my food baby at my gate. The Pepito torta was INCREDIBLE!!! The braised beef short rib was so juicy and tender, and paired perfectly with the crisp bread and chipotle sauce. I appreciated that the cheese wasn&#39;t overwhelming as it sometimes can be for Mexican fare. It could have been a little spicier, but luckily I was given some green salsa on the side. The corn chowder was also very good - the corn was sweet and it was well seasoned. 

What I love most about Tortas Frontera is that the ingredients are all locally sourced, ensuring you are eating quality food. It is extremely reasonably priced for the sheer amount of food you get, but also for the fact that it is the greatest airport food I&#39;ve ever had in the US. Skip everything else at O&#39;Hare and order a torta! There are several locations throughout the various terminals for convenience."

Sat down for a sandwich, realized my flight was with Spirit, and instantly ordered a margarita to better cope with the mayhem that goes into every Spirit flight. This review is about the sandwich and margarita, not the worst airline in America.

The chipotle chicken was great, the torta bread was very well toasted, and the arugula paired well with the chicken and avocado. The portion size was good though, not a large fast food meal to get stuffed, but enough to not be hungry on the flight. The margarita too was good.

This place is at a higher price range than other places, but this is an airport so it&#39;s to be expected. I&#39;ll definitely come again if I ever have a layover to try out the pepito."

I ordered the cochinita pibil and opted for the &#34;breadless&#34; style, where you get black beans and arugula instead. They said it would be about 10 minutes and I was OK with that. I think it was actually a little faster.

However... when I opened my bowl I saw a mountain of pickled onions on top that was actually hilarious in its quantity. It was nearly half the weight of the entire bowl. After I excavated my meal, I saw that there was a very small dab of black beans, a few chunks of pork, and a scattering of arugula leaves. Super stingy. It was delicious, but really wouldn&#39;t fill up a normal person. 

Oh and uh, be REALLY careful with that habanero salsa on the side. Actually, just throw it away. I refuse to believe there is a human being who could consume it and derive any pleasure. I love heat and frequently order spicy items at a level 10 and I&#39;m pretty much always underwhelmed by their heat level. I dabbed a little of this on top of my bowl and after 1 bite had to try to scrape it off. It is like actual liquid fire. It very nearly ruined my meal, but I powered through. It even made my stomach upset immediately because it was so hot. I ended up having to get a milkshake after to quench the fire and round out my meal. I wish I could convey how hardcore I am about spice, but I don&#39;t remember the last time I had something too spicy for me to eat and this was well beyond that point."

I had an hour or so to kill before my flight and I was hungry. So I grabbed a seat at the bar. They do have outlets just a couple though under the bar. 

The bartender was extremely friendly, something you generally don&#39;t seem to experience at airport bars. I ordered a beer, and they did automatically give me the large one, I still hate when they do that. I downsized after that. I ordered the torta with braised short rip, it was delicious, full of flavor. I was so surprised, I expected stale bread, barely any meat and reheated feeling all around, but that wasn&#39;t what I got. It was crisp, fresh and tasted great. I also ordered chips with a small guacamole. That was also very good and with 2 salsa choices as well. The salsa was a little too watery for my liking, it didn&#39;t cling to the chip at all. But, still pretty good.

It&#39;s of course airport pricing with the torta, one large beer, one small beer and the chips it was $40 without tip. But, it was tasty and a great option compared to the food court next door."

Rick Bayless is a big deal in Chicago--definitely check out one of the XOCO restaurants if you&#39;re in the city--and I&#39;m glad his influence stretches out to the airport as well. I generally have pretty low standards when it comes to airport food, but boy does this place deliver.

My group of 3 got bar seating immediately at around 5:30PM on a Sunday, which I consider a great accomplishment. Lucky timing, I guess. I ordered the choriqueso torta and a pint of Tocayo (hominy white ale--goes really well with any Mexican food). At $10, the torta is a steal given how filling it is. It&#39;s also incredibly delicious to boot, with very well-spiced chorizo. I just wish I could&#39;ve gotten it with the habanero salsa instead of the salsa verde for no extra cost, but alas. The beer cost almost as much as my torta, which should surprise no one given that this is an airport. All in all, this is probably the best damn $20 dinner + drink you&#39;ll get while in an American airport. Enjoy!"

There&#39;s a reason why I always search one out if Gate Guru says there&#39;s one in the terminal I am visiting and I have time for a meal.  The guac and chips with customization options...sooooo good.  I don&#39; t like all of the toppings on the loaded version, I usually get the cotija/queso fresco cheese mix and smoked bacon.  I believe the chips are made in house.  The tortas, definitely better than some cold sub, bagel sandwich or burger.  Get the choriqueso...so salty and yumm-o.  And the agua frescas... much much better than a soda.  Is it pricey?  Yes, but airport food always is.  Thankfully I&#39;m usually visiting when I&#39;m on business so the company picks up the tab, but I&#39;ve gone here personally, though I admit I usually limit myself to a torta and a refill of my reusable water bottle at the fountain.  There is a reason why this place always has a line.  Be warned, say no to the margarita.  It&#39;s like an 8 ounce glass and it&#39;s $12 (glad the lady at the register mentioned that).  Stick with the agua frescas or grab something out of the cooler.

There are 9 options to choose from. Other than this there is a breakfast menu, Molletes which are open face sandwiches, soups, salads and beverages.

I got the conchinita pibil torta. The reason I ordered this was it came with achiote braised pork. That&#39;s something I&#39;ve been wanting to try since I saw that on a food show.

It&#39;s not &#34;fast food&#34; with queues to both pay for and pick up the food. So definitely not recommended if you are in a hurry to catch your flight. The kitchen in open and you can watch the chefs make the sandwich. There are huge tubs of chips you can feast your eyes on while you wait for your food.

While I waited I couldn&#39;t miss noticing the portion sizes. They are substantial and justify the price charged (considering its airport food).

The sandwich was a one of the best I&#39;ve eaten. The bread was crisp, meat tender and well seasoned. The salsa was one of the few truly hot salsas I&#39;ve eaten. It set my tongue on fire. I didn&#39;t add too much of it as I wanted to enjoy the Flavors in the sandwich. The achiote and citrus flavors show up nicely and lingered in my tongue after I finished my sandwich. The picked radish in the sandwich added a nice crunch to it.

Overall I&#39;d recommend Tortas Frontera. If you are in ORD terminal 3, definitely stop by!!!"

I had the mushroom here and it was great. Like, better than food I&#39;ve had at a lot of more expensive, non-airport places. The coffee here is relatively cheap, so I would at least recommend that.

If you have some spare cash and caloric intake, get the guac and chips with the fixings. SO GOOD! I literally CRAVE these chips. Even though I think $7 is ridiculous, those chips are worth it. Treat yo self."

Just a reminder that there is almost always a really long line to put your order in and a long line to get your order as well.

I went with a shrimp torta and the lime aqua fresca.  With tax it came to about $18 so not cheap.  Also be aware the tortas take a while because they are grilled to order.  No complaint on that because it was hot and fresh and delicious.  You could really taste all the nuances of flavors including goat cheese and nopales (cactus leaves).  The salsa (served on the side) was a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  I was disappointed in the lime aqua fresca which was very concentrated and almost bitter.  I kept adding more water and ice to make it more palatable.  

The space is quite small, although there are about 8 tables and even a small bar, and gets crowded very quickly.  And if there are a lot of people ordering, your Torta will take more than 10 minutes (mine took about 20 from when I ordered).  So plan ahead of you have limited time!"

I have to confess that I have only ever got one thing here, but that one thing is my favorite breakfast in America--and anywhere else for that matter. The eggs and rajas torta is a handcrafted sandwich of scrambled eggs, a generous portion of fresh avocado, fire roasted poblano peppers, Jack and Cotija cheese served with the most delicious tomatillo salsa imaginable! I get so excited to eat this breakfast that it has the pleasant side effect of lifting my mood the entire day prior. 

I have heard from friends that the other offerings are equally as good and I want to try them, but I love this sandwich so much that I am ill at ease to try something different for fear of disappointment. I have resolved that I will try the braised short rib sandwich the next time just to prove to myself that Frontera in not a one trick pony. I will report back."

I&#39;m embarrassed to say that for about 10 seconds I thought about getting a salad instead of a torta to cut some carbs and calories. I even dared to think about desecrating the torta by eating if as an open face sandwich! 

The thoughts immediately fled once I took a bite of my chipotle chicken torta - warm, spicy, bursting with flavor, generous avocado, and the quintessential torta bread which is where so many before have failed.  

It was a little piece of heaven.  If I wasn&#39;t wearing my skinny jeans I seriously would have bought another."

It came out to over 10 bucks and it was so delicious but I don&#39;t understand what everyone is raving about. I thought it was a little overpriced? What I loved about the salad was that I could taste the fresh cilantro and the fresh lime. The flavors went well together and there were layers of different flavors. The tortilla strips in the salad were delicious. I felt that they were freshly fried and gave a great crunch to the salad.

I&#39;ve heard people rave about this place. So for my expectations I give this three stars. I was expecting the best salad I had ever tasted but I&#39;ve eaten many salads that were better. The salad was a good solid three.

Next time I will try a sandwich. Maybe chips and guacamole. There was a guy waiting for a plane who ordered a sandwich, it looked good.  What I have noticed about everything that comes out of this place is that it smells really good."

If you know his cookbooks, you&#39;ll know this menu and love it. Produce is local and high quality and execution is fast and accurate. 

Moreover, it really suits my tastes. There are 6 or so aguas frescas (eg cucumber lime, hibiscus), and I had the roasted mushroom sandwich: delicate, interesting smokey flavors and well worth the precisely predicted 10 minute wait time. 

There are two in this airport, the one by gate k3 has a little nicer atmosphere but a longer line. It took 10 minutes for them to get through the  18 people in front of me - the line was just as long when I left.

Rick Bayless&#39;s Tortas Frontera now ranks among one of the best resturants in an airport that I have had.

Was here last year, but forgot to write a review, so this time while flying through O&#39;hare I made it a point to go back, get more grub, and review how flipping awesome this place is! Their menu is very straight forward and explains what is in each tortas. Yes, they are airport prices, but this is one time I&#39;d say it is worth every penny. As mentioned above, this was my second time visiting and both meals have been great, so I would like to assume their entire menu is exceptional at this point (Also based on the reviews). I&#39;d suggest adding some chips with their salsas and guac and wash it all down with their tasty juices! 

There are two ways to order and the last visit I went for the latter, one being stand in line, get a light up waiting unit and grab your food and hope you can find a place to sit (Worse case, huge food court across the way). Second and more suitable is sitting at the bar, ordering a few drinks and having your food served at the bar straight from the kitchen. If it were not for the the terrible TSA wait times, I&#39;d fly into O&#39;Hare more often and enjoy some excellent mexican food."

Also not all Tortas come with avocado. You should request it of your doesn&#39;t come with it. 

Some meats used in Tortas come packed in individual plastics bags which is might be toxic in excess. Not the best food handling practice.

Legend has it that Rick Bayless has an agreement with ohare to bury the pigs in an hole in the ground at the end of runway L14 and cook the pig there overnight.  Just like in Jalisco. You be the judge.

Initially I started at the bar, but I sat and wasn&#39;t greeted by the bartender for a couple of minutes. Eventually, I got a menu from her but after waiting around for 10 minutes in total and she still didn&#39;t bother to ask if I wanted anything to drink or order any food I got up and left. I didn&#39;t want to end up paying tip to her, so I got up and walked over to order register. Probably waited another 10 minutes in a relatively short line since only 1 register was open. After FINALLY putting in my order, the cashier informed me it would be 10 minutes for the chorizo breakfast torta I ordered. GREAT. In total, I waited over 30 minutes for food. Aside from the horrendously slow service, the food is decent. Chorizo was nicely flavored and served with scrambled eggs, onions, peppers, &amp; sliced avocados and a side of salsa verde to add as you please. A bit steep for $9 and some change but it&#39;s what you can expect from airport markups. Add $2.60 for a coffee, and boom you&#39;re at +$13 for breakfast after taxes. Not sure I can justify the slow service and price point here. Kinda wished I just hit McDs for my usually sausage mccuffin and egg at this point.

&#39;Til next time!"

It&#39;s definitely one of the better airport restaurants you can go to in Chicago, however definitely not the best.

I ordered the Garlic Shrimp Torta and it was SO SPICY. I can handle a moderate amount of spice but this was over my comfort zone. The menu didn&#39;t really allude to this so that was a little disappointing. It also lacked goat cheese - just a tiny smear on one side of the sandwich. It could have used a lot more to balance out the spiciness. 

Going from ordering to getting my food was around 5-10 minutes which is great when you&#39;re trying to catch a flight. I&#39;d probably give it 1 more try during my next layover in Chicago - hopefully this time will meet my expectations."

TIP: You&#39;ll need at least 30 mins. Line is always long, takes at least 10 min to make the sandwiches, and then 10 min to eat. Don&#39;t bother trying if you are rushing!

We tried the mushroom torta, tres queso molletes, and corn &amp; poblano chowder. The molletes was like a Mexican pizza and very delicious. Loaded with cheese and only a little bit of spice (my peppers were not distributed evenly so half had no spice and half had a lot). It had sun dried tomatoes instead of a tomato sauce. The torta was surprisingly garlicky, requiring a tooth brush before the flight...but taste was spot on! I think the chowder would have benefitted from more corn and less pepper, but was also very good.

When I saw the sign that said Frontera when I landed in Chicago I started drooling from the mouth but DAYUM my flight was delayed and it was long closed so on the flight out I made the early hike to O&#39;Hare determined to stand in line and try it. I don&#39;t k ow how many people not from Chicago know who Rick Bayless is but all the awards posted in the sign made it crowded with people. Nevertheless I was not to be deterred!!

I decided on the Mollette from the start. A simple open faced sandwich but couldn&#39;t decide if I would get the Smoked Pork or the Bacon. So I decided to get both. Both were great but I preferred the smoked pork. It was like shaved ham only not salty :). Add the slightly sweet fruit spread and the cilantro and it was fireworks of flavor. They were $6 each at an airport. That&#39;s almost the price of a dried out Auntie Annie pretzel and cheaper than some crud from Manchu Wok. 

So in short ..... Well I guess not that short. Don&#39;t miss it and if you&#39;re Not hungry buy some for later!!!

This is actually something I would eat outside the airport though. That&#39;s saying a lot. At $10 for pretty substantial sandwich, I don&#39;t think the prices are too bad either. 

I had the mushroom torta. They warned me at the register that it would take bout 10 minutes to make. I would much rather wait for something to be made fresh then get something from a food court that has been sitting there for who knows how long. 

My torta was mostly composed of oyster mushrooms and arugula, and the overall flavor of the sandwich was smokey due to the smoked mayo and the salsa it comes with. It even had a little heat to it from the peppers. The creamy goat cheese neutralized most of it. 

My husband had the albondigas with meatballs and bacon, peppers, and cheese. He was quite happy with it. 

My favorite thing was the prickly pear Agua Fresca. It&#39;s very tart and tangy. I love prickly pear! 

I&#39;d definitely come back if in the Chicago Airport."

While waiting for a flight, and hungry as hell, I happened to be lucky enough today to find a seat at Rick Bayless&#39;s joint.   I kinda knew the food was gonna be good, but hot damn, it was delicious beyond my dreams! 

I had the egg and mushroom cazuela.  It came in a bowl with fresh avocado, eggs, sweet potatoes, cojito cheese, black beans, wild arugula, and cilantro.  I added a side of habanero salsa, and it was PEFRECT!  Now there are 3 components to all of my reviews: cost, quality, and value.  This place is tops in all categories.

I am not even a fan of arugala, but it paired perfectly with the eggs and sweet potatoes.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 am, I night have indulged in one of their margaritas, which looked pretty good.

Even for non-airport food, this place is legit. But when you&#39;re traveling all day and you&#39;ve got a two hour layover and you&#39;re hangry? This place rules.

Being a former resident of Chicago I know Rick Bayless well and have an affection for Frontera, especially since their outpost in Macy&#39;s on State was my very first Yelp review. I&#39;ve been to several of his restaurants and in general I&#39;m way more into his casual style spots. Xoco was a personal fave in particular. So, I was happy to dine at Frontera and see some of the Tortas I loved here. They&#39;re all solid options but this particular time around I went with the roasted mushroom torta (cremini, shiitake + oyster mushrooms, smoky garlic mojo, poblano rajas, goat cheese, black beans, wild arugula, &amp; lime) and it was excellent. I also got a naked guac and chips to go for the plane later. GOOD CALL! Especially for a 5+ hour flight. 

Not a lot of seating so be mindful when you order during a busy period. It may be harder to eat some menu items on your lap."

The food is Latin American with  Bayle&#39;s twist. Yum. Yum. Yum.

I ordered the Choriquezo torta and I loved it! The torta was panini style - with the bread toasted and flattened. The torts had chorizo, grilled green peppers, onions, avocado and cheese. Yummy. 

The cherry on top was the green sauce that comes with the sandwhich - a green salsa that&#39;s not too hot and not too mild.

The Tortas are yummy too and the Molette is a great option if you are in a rush and can not wait for the other made to order items. 

As for beverages, I like the lime juice and raspberry prickly pear. Smart Water and Fiji are also retailed along with a few other popular beverages. 

Prices are in the $10 range which is more expensive than chain food but a much better value for the money. 

If in Terminal one, stop at this location which also has a bar area and other seating available.

Love the eggs and chorizo and. eggs and bacon. The Guac bar is also very good and a perfect inflict snack."

I usually get one of the tortas and would say the bread is the star of the show. It&#39;s of the mini-baguette variety, with a crunchy crust and a pleasantly chewy inside. The Pepito, which is a braised short rib sandwich is probably my favorite. Conveniently located around K4 gate. The orange juice is good. 

Negatives: Perhaps a bit overpriced. You&#39;re looking at paying $16 or so for a drink and a sandwich with no side. But it&#39;s the airport so you&#39;ll have that. Seating is bar counter style and a bit cramped. Sauces are either orange/habanero, very spicy and strong flavor which tends to overpower, or green/jalapeño, very mild. Something in the middle would be nice. 

Summary: My go to spot in Terminal 3 at the moment. Recommend giving it a shot if you are looking for a quick bite, though I wouldn&#39;t be a regular if it wasn&#39;t for the location."

We get to the airport early so that we can properly enjoy our meal! The line can get long &amp; takes a bit, so plan accordingly (apparently they also have an app so you can pre-order). I recommend waiting for a seat at the bar (it turns over pretty quickly), get a margarita &amp; a whole guac (not the side which is miniscule &amp; not worth the price) and order the Taqueria Salad, add mushrooms with no cheese to make it vegan.

With that said, you might be eating the best thing you could possibly eat in an airport and certainly the best in Terminal 3. I had the Milanesa. Fried chicken, cheese and pickled jalapenos doused in a little cilantro crema (which is out of this fucking world). This thing is awesome. The pickled jalapeno seemed like more of a giardiniera from a jar, but aside from that this is a damn near perfect sandwich. The place was a mad house when I got there as about a million flights had been cancelled in the previous 24 hours but even then it was only about a 10 minute wait for a piping hot, melty and delicious sandwich. It was almost enough to make you forget that you&#39;re surrounded by hundreds of angry holiday travelers that would just as soon cast a satanic spell on you as smile.

I had the Pepito torta and a raspberry/prickly pear agua fresca and it was some good stuff. Quality ingredients, really nice flavor, and overall just really satisfying. The only cons are that you get what you pay for and good things  come to those that wait. Namely, it isn&#39;t cheap (about 10-12 per torta and another 3-4 for the agua fresca) and you&#39;ve got to wait since they make it as you order so budget at least 10 minutes from the time you order (there is also usually a line so make sure you have time before your flight takes off). Anyhow, certainly beats the regular airport food you usually find (ie the food court right next to this place)."

I spotted the Pepito Torta on their menu and was hooked to try it. Luckily, the line was pretty short and everything moved quite smoothly. I grabbed a bottle of water from the refrigerated section by the cashier and ordered. The total seemed a bit high, caused by the stupid water costing almost $5, but I went along as to not make a scene. Really? Almost $5 for a bottle of water?

The sandwich was amazing, one I almost wish I could eat every day for the rest of my life. Super full of flavor, well worth the $12 price tag, even more so at an airport. I&#39;d pay that in a heartbeat at least once or twice a week to get it where I live instead of Subway or *shutter* Jimmy John&#39;s tasteless dreck.

Airports are turning it around -- see LAX! I was very happy when I saw a four-star place at O&#39;Hare and in the same area as me. 

The tortas here are pretty good and they rejuvenated me after our flight from SNA. . We ordered the Cubana and the Pepito. I think one is enough to share for two but my fiancée and I got excited and just tried each other&#39;s halves. Out of the two I like the Cubana more! We ordered the mango agua fresca but it was too sweet for us. Maybe our tastebuds were affected from the flight. Altitude maybe? Eh. Save a dollar and get a drink at McDonald&#39;s.

At the end of it all, if you&#39;re coming through O&#39;Hare, come through this place and treat yo&#39;self... cause it&#39;s pricey. But the pickings are slim out there and this is probably miles ahead of whatever else is out there."

Then, the cashier tried to sell me the tortilla soup instead claiming that it&#39;s vegetarian too when it clearly states on the menu that it&#39;s made with chicken broth.

We sat down at the Frontera bar around the corner to wait for our food, and it was more than 5 minutes before we were greeted even though there were only 12-15 people around the bar. 

Grace ended up eventually helping us out very unenthusiastically, presumably because we&#39;d already ordered food at the counter instead of at the bar, which she&#39;d assumed cut into her tip. 

Then, I asked her if the Michelada had Clamato in it and she had no idea what I was asking. I was basically asking her if it was vegetarian and since I did not see any non-vegetarian ingredients, I went for it. Then I saw her put Worcestershire sauce in there and realize that it has anchovies in it after she had already made it. We told her that I&#39;m vegetarian so I cannot drink that so if she can make a vegetarian version of it that would be great.

She proceeded to huff and puff without an apology and maid another version and dumped one third of the Modelo Especial bottle in the drink instead of giving a fresh Modelo. We ended up asking for more beer in the drink like needed, and she added Modelo Negra which is not even the same beer from the tap like it was the same thing. 

I ended up not drinking any of the &#34;drinks&#34; she&#39;d made for me because they were so awfully wrong and she was quite rude and unapologetic the whole time. Grace is one of the worst bartenders I&#39;ve ever come across. 

The only salvation was that she didn&#39;t bother charging us for the drink(s) I never touched."

He first garnished my attention by challenging Bobby Flay on Iron Chef America.  I don&#39;t remember if he won or not but to me it doesn&#39;t matter.  In comparing Flay&#39;s food in person by eating at Bolo Bar &amp; Restaurant and the more famous and now defunct Mesa Grill -both in New York City- and comparing those two vs. Frontera Grill and Topolo -both in Chicago-, Bayless wins.   

Why?  Chef Bayless&#39;s creations were memorable to this day.  Of course he was there each time I have dined at his dives.   Flay&#39;s food was only memorable I suppose for bragging rights.  Rather than another Chicago vs. NYC argument I suspect the real line is celebrity vs actual chef.   

Failing to mention another gift to us foodies, Chef Bayless&#39;s PBS TV series &#34;Mexico, One Plate at a Time&#34; would be an oversight of course as having seen every episode, I can say I&#39;ve enjoyed every plate I&#39;m been served that has this gentleman&#39;s name on it, now including from a paper plate at O&#39;Hare.

We shared the Chorizo &amp; Queso Torta that came with fresh Haas avocado and a meal sized Shrimp Salad entree.

This is really a great option if you&#39;re at ORD. I&#39;ve been subjected to too many terrible meals in airports (sadly) and I can say this was definitely some of the best food I&#39;ve had in an airport ever. I love that it&#39;s quite a casual spot since I was traveling alone and didn&#39;t want to go to a proper sit-down restaurant. I ordered at the counter  a Chipotle Chicken torta which was described as being accompanied by artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapeños, cilantro crema, tomatillo-avocado salsa ($11.00). I was starving so I opted for a chicken tortilla soup as well and was handed over a buzzer as I waited for my food. I appreciate that they don&#39;t have a bunch of the tortas pre-made and just sitting under a heat lamp. Loved that they make each torta fresh. Within 10 minutes, my buzzer notified me that my food was ready. I perched myself at the long counter opposite the bar. They had outlets all along the wall which was a nice touch to have. 

As I dug in, I was so happy. Fresh torta, great ingredients and flavorful. All the items worked really well together. Chicken can sometimes be bland/dry but this wasn&#39;t the case at TF, moist with a punch of flavour that was helped by the crema and salsa. Loved this sandwich and it&#39;s pretty huge, I definitely didn&#39;t need to have also gotten a soup but I had a long flight ahead ;D The chicken tortilla soup was quite nice as well with shredded chicken and chunks of ripe avocado. The broth was slightly spicy and had good chicken flavor. 

It isn&#39;t a cheap meal, especially considering it&#39;s fast casual; however, I would happily pay these prices for what I received. Plus, you&#39;re in an airport so they know they can up the prices. I was impressed at the quality of the food as I&#39;ve definitely had way worse food outside of an airport.

The bartenders are all quick to recognize a face and if not they introduce themselves and get to know you. Not the usual bartender  / customer chit chat but in a I&#39;m trying to remember you kind of way. 

They have an awesome choice of craft beers and you can always ask them what they have or just get up and grab one yourself out of the fridge. Personally that is the way I do. Too many selections to try and guess so I just grab my own. Huge selection of craft and bottle beers.

The food is to me the best bar food in Arlington Heights. The hotdogs are huge with a large serving of French fries for like $7.95 It&#39;s what a Chicago Dog is suppose to be. Way better than Portilios and Photo&#39;s. If I am having a good week then I am coming here for a craft beer and hotdog. If I am in need of a pick me up then I am grabbing a hotdog from here and a shot. When I am in doubt for something to eat I grab a hotdog. 

I tried the other night there Feb hamburger special. Bacon cheeseburger with pulled pork bbq and  onion ring and large side of fries. I have a large appetite and I could not finish all of it. The burger was so huge and good. You know, call them, and ask what it is called and you will not be disappointed. While there I met the owner Mike and his son Mike Jr. Hell, he didn&#39;t even introduce himself as owner and I spoke highly about the joint and he said thanks. I said why? That&#39;s when he mentioned he was Jr and they owned it. Cool guy. So it his pops Big Mike."

When I got there, they wouldn&#39;t serve me because I had an out of state drivers license with multiple other forms to prove my identity was correct, including my social security card.  The same woman that I had as my server served me one week ago. She was also vulgar and called me a punk when I walked into the door. I am very disappointed with the service here.

Well, this is the closest thing to a good ole fashioned beer bar and dive.  Plus they got some seriously good good, nothing fancy. The selection of beer on tap   and in bottle is probably the best in town. Why go to some corporate bar, went you can support a local? Go to Eddie&#39;s, polish off a few beers or cocktails and enjoys a Cubs game. Clientele  is mixed and from all walks of life. Great atmosphere.

Arlington Heights needs little bars like this and it would be a shame to see this place go to the wayside because of a simple fix.

They should really stop pretending they&#39;re a restaurant and just be what they are - a casual bar for blue-collar type guys.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  As a restaurant?  For families?  Significant other?  Never.

We&#39;ve lived in AH a long time and never tried this place so we thought we&#39;d give it a shot.  Service was dreadful and the place was dumpy and uninspiring.  

Tonight there were all of 3 tables with customers in the restaurant.  It still look forever to get our food.  We came close to leaving 3 times.  When it FINALLY arrived, it was lukewarm and mediocre (with no apology for the delay).  It&#39;s not like we ordered something that takes a while to prepare.  Meanwhile, I heard the man in the booth next to us complain that his food was not cooked properly.  He was NOT a happy customer, nor was I.

It would help that one guy was bartender and server for 3 tables and about 20 bar patrons.  

The vibe was very low energy.  One of the bar patrons was so drunk and unruly the bartender kicked him out.  Harry&#39;s isn&#39;t great but it&#39;s a couple levels above this place for sure.  Skip it!"

I have been going to Eddie&#39;s for about 4 years with my hubby and the fried chicken is always delicious. I&#39;m getting hungry just thinking of it! You get plenty of fried chicken, surprisingly scrumptious french fries, garlic toast, and coleslaw (which, since the hubby and I hate coleslaw, goes uneaten). The food is always hot and tasty. It&#39;s not to be missed!

That being said, the service CAN be hit or miss. Most of the time we get decent service but there are those occasions when it&#39;s...lacking.

Ash Devonte&#39;s Momma: Well I went here for a co-worker holiday get-together, so we went to the small private room.  It had a piano, how nice!  It was a bit small for our group size, but the food was excellent.  I only had me a cold diet coke.  I had the famous &#34;Potato Boat&#34; that Ash mentions, and I agree that they were wonderful.

Everything I ate was delicious and my husband can&#39;t get enough of the fish fry. The only negative we both agree on is the lack of servers.

From the outside, it looks like it would be a total dive. However, it&#39;s nice inside! I mean, it&#39;s still a bar, but it isn&#39;t dirty, it doesn&#39;t smell and it is far beyond the &#34;glorified college bar&#34; I expected it to be. 

My husband and I stopped in for a quick bite on Small Business Saturday - supporting our local watering hole. They appear to have a good drink selection, and at very reasonable prices. I expected regular bar food, and this was probably a step above that. My tuna melt came with bacon on it. Yup. Bacon. AND they gave me liquid cheese for my tots. That&#39;s all it took. I&#39;m in love.

Thank you, Eddie&#39;s - you are now my local bar of choice. Now if I could just get out more often..."

I ventured out in to the &#39;burbs this past weekend with a group of friends that had one mission; to find a bar and order the craziest shot that they had.  Eddie&#39;s Restaurant and Lounge came up with something called the &#34;tapeworm&#34;, which had tabasco, pepper, vodka, (something else that I&#39;m forgetting) and a squirt of mayo in the glass for the &#34;tapeworm.&#34;  I didn&#39;t hate it.  

After that, the bartender got creative with the shots and I wish that I could remember what they were, but I can&#39;t.  There was a whiskey and pickle juice, something with tabasco and midori, and something that tasted like mustard.  I&#39;m not gonna lie...they were tough to drink and I&#39;m considering getting better friends (no, not really), but the staff and the patrons were having fun with us and our crazy request.  

In addition to crazy shots, Eddie&#39;s has a solid pub grub menu.  My burger and sweet potato fries were delicious.  They also decent price on pitchers (although I can get them cheaper in the city) and they have Blue Moon on tap.  

With friendly regulars, a clean restroom, and various flat screens for watchin&#39; the tube, Eddie&#39;s was a great way to spend an afternoon."

I&#39;m not even from Arlington Heights and just needed a place to keep warm while I waited for the train. After walking in I was delighted to find 1. Flat screens with the hawks game 2. A free drink from a guy down the bar (who didn&#39;t want to talk to me, just bought me a beer...shocking but true) 3. A mega flippy cup tournament full of fun attractive ladies and gents.

Needless to say I missed my train, stayed an extra 2 hours and joined the tourney for a bit.  I would have stayed all night if I had a choice but I needed to find my way back downtown. I will 100% visit this bar again it seemed like the fun place to be on a Saturday night. On a side note both of the bartenders were courteous, friendly and SOBER! So many drink on the job and turn into a waste or an employee. I like to be the drunk one at the bar not the person waiting on me!

I went on a Friday night around 10pm. The bartender (?) was outside smoking but told us to go in and seat ourselves. He took our drink order on his way in. His first suggestion was a microbrewed IPA -- my boyfriend immediately said yes. His next suggestion was a Summer Shandy, which I took him up on. Two for two!

Our server took over from there. The burgers come fairly plain with options to add toppings. They&#39;re not huge, but they&#39;re good and cheap. We also got a huge basket of tater tots. Gotta love a place with tater tots!

The crowd was pretty mixed -- a bachelorette party, lots of people in their 40s, etc. The music is supplied by a jukebox, so it was just as mixed as the crowd. It was dance music when we came in, country for a bit, then 80s rock. There was pretty much zero ambiance.

I wouldn&#39;t go here for a nice meal, but it&#39;s a great, low-key spot for a late-night bite to eat and a couple beers."

I had the mini pulled pork sandwiches that were good and snacked on a veggie plate. The place wasn&#39;t super busy for a Saturday night, the crowd was mainly men in their 30&#39;s/40&#39;s with a few younger couples mixed in, the music was a mix of rock and roll with some alternative.

People seem to really enjoy the tots (you can even flavor them with buffalo sauce), but I&#39;m a bigger fan of their tacos and nachos. For under $7, you get nachos loaded with the freshest tomatoes and guacamole and a perfect layer of melted cheese. Even better are Eddie&#39;s tacos.

The pros are that the food is tasty and cheap.  The drinks also cheap.  I also believe it is the only bar in downtown Arlington Heights that has a pool table.  However, the service is downright abysmal.  The waiter took our order twice and still somehow managed to mess it up.  We ordered two items total for heaven&#39;s sake.  As I mentioned, the drinks are very well priced.  I suppose this isn&#39;t difficult to offer considering there are only two beers on tap.  I suppose you could order one of the wide varieties of less than ten bottled beers.  
Hands down, however, my biggest complaint is the deceptive nature of this business.  It looks like a dive bar from the outside.  The first &#34;d&#34; in Eddie&#39;s is yellow while the rest of the letters are green.  When this place was closed, they used contractor&#39;s garbage bags to block the windows.

Up until approximately 3 weeks ago it appeared that the management was doing all they could to replicate the way EDDIE used to do it for so many years. Well wouldn&#39;t you know that after my bragging about the great fish fry to friends and then putting a party of 15 people who had never been there, what came out of the kitchen that was supposed to be their famous fish fry was almost unedible. &#34;Overcooked to a point of almost being &#34;burnt&#34;, but worst of all they are &#34;screwing around&#34; with the famous light breading or coating that is almost &#34;not there&#34; but gave just enough texture to the fish that it was the perfect enhancement. What came out was &#34;glompy&#34; and &#34;burnt&#34;. So I asked for some to be cooked &#34;lighter&#34;, and it came out only slightly less &#34;burnt&#34; but the breading was not even cooked in spots. &#34;HOW COULD THEY DO THAT.&#34; Frankly I don&#39;t think this was an accident. With an &#34;ALL YOU CAN EAT&#34; fish fry; &#34;more breading, less fish being consumed per servings&#34;. Looks like a sneaky way of giving you less for your money. And sadly, most of the fish that they brought to people was left lying on the table.
After 15 years of going to EDDIE&#39;S, I doubt if my wife and I will return, unless I can see evidence that they have returned to the original way of breading and cooking the fish. I&#39;m not sure how that will happen

I hope others agree that have experience a similar event !!

I can&#39;t share the enthusiasm of the reviewer before me.  But I must confess, I&#39;ve only been to the new Eddie&#39;s once.

I tried the burger, lauded by some locals.  I have not had the fish fry.  I had the burgers at the previous iteration of Eddies, they were very good.  This was not.  First of all, they got my order wrong - I ordered a double burger and got a single.  And the place was nearly empty.  Fine.  Tthe waitress/bartender (and THAT never works well unless you only offer food service at the bar) offered 2 solutions.  One was to bring me another patty.  Huh?  After it took 20 mins. to get this, I&#39;m supposed to wait now for another patty?  Solution 2 was for me to just eat what I had and let he know if I wanted another &#34;little burger&#34; (whatever that meant) when I was done.  I told her never mind, I ate what I had.   She seemed nice enough.  But she didn&#39;t take the initiative to fix the mistake.  Food should have been taken back right away.  I also had to go up to the bar and ask for a drink refill.  Maybe since I wasn&#39;t drinking liquor I didn&#39;t rate high.

One bite in and I realized it wasn&#39;t at all medium, but more well.  Bad news.  Then and there I should have sent it all back, but didn&#39;t.  Figured I&#39;d get through the disappointing meal and be on my way.

The fries were as institutional as any I&#39;ve ever had.  Bland and thin, with no character at all.  Don&#39;t know abut the sweet potato fries but I surmise, the institutional sort as well.

I will say this, the fish fry looked OK, and so did the onion rings.  People behind me had both.  Oh, the woman behind me also had a burger which I think looked better than mine, so maybe my experience was just a fluke bad one.

When I was leaving the bartender told me to come back again, she&#39;d buy me a drink.  That doesn&#39;t fly.  I&#39;m here NOW.  This is your only chance at a first impression.  Fix the problems NOW, or there won&#39;t be a next time.

Doubt I&#39;ll go back to try the fish fry.  And I know great places for consistenly good burgers, so why bother."

We choose to play bocce because we have two league bowlers in our department so we would have a level playing field.  I have played bocce before, but it has usually been on gravel or real grass courts, here they have artificial grass carpets on top of concrete.  Which is, in my opinion, a horrible surface to play on because it is so slick and you cannot find a shot with spin and the balls just keep rolling and rolling...

But the highlight of the evening was the food and beverage service.  We had two appetizer players to share and they were delicious!  We had the bruchetta platter (they did both tomato and artichoke bruchettas) as well as Italian meatball sliders.  And they also have a great beer selection."

I would generally recommend this sport bistro to anyone who wants a fun evening out. 

The foods are generally good, but somewhat uneven in their quality.  If you choose Pizzas and Flatbreads, they are usually delicious.  The Filet Mignon Trio and various Chicken dishes were so-so.  Sunday brunches (with Mimosas) were, at least to me, better than dinners.  Their draft beer and wine selections are adequate, I would say.    

The services have been generally good, except a few occasions of late appearance of servers.  The attendant who explained how to play bocce to my friends did a really good job.  (I don&#39;t remember the attendant&#39;s name; but the manager should praise her.)"

There shell on shrimp cocktail is so good too.
Everyone was raving about the bacon at our table, I don&#39;t normally care for bacon, but I had to try a piece it was very good too!
The salads are fresh and desserts are great too. Including a chocolate fountain complete with lots of goodies to dip in it. Everyone in our group of 9 found something that they liked.

 If you leave hungry you are nuts!

Even though it was busy there they had lots of room and many tables spread out throughout their building.

I decided to have my son&#39;s little Family Birthday party here. I called ahead to reserve two lanes. I called about 8 days in advance and had no problem getting two lanes in the afternoon (which is what i wanted). They did mention that all timeslots after like 5 or 6pm were filled. So if you&#39;re looking for an evening event, i&#39;d recommend booking a few weeks in advance. 

The bowling area is so nice!! It&#39;s upscale. Beautiful room. Bright. You can select your balls. they have nice little seating areas with tables. Different styles of seating/gathering, too. Which is great! 

They have full waitress service while bowing. So we did order some food and drinks. We bowled for probably an hour and a half or so. Then we migrated into the main area and grabbed a table to have dinner. We ended up scoring a table completely off to the side by itself, which was Amazing - because we were tucked away and it was just our family. This was so nice because it felt more quaint. It didnt feel much different than being at our family dining table at home. 

Unfortunately it took about 40 minutes before we finally got wait-staff to come and wait on us at the table... but once they finally got to us, things moved along quickly. We had a nice meal, the food was great. 

I LOVED this day! We had such a nice time. We can&#39;t wait to come back with some more family members and do it again - this time we want to try Bocce too!!

Drinks were fine. Served promptly and correctly. 
Food menu is upscale for a bowling joint. My date ordered an open faced salmon sandwich and I got the tortilla soup. The sandwich was a bit dry and underwhelming. I know it said medium but it looked almost hockey puck style. My soup was less of a soup and more of a heavy stew type of concoction. The spice was good in it, just super heavy. 
Two beers, two mixed drinks, a sandwich and soup and our bill was $56."

The South Barrington location is far better. With twice the bowling and bocce courts, getting in is a hell of a lot easier. The staff here is friendlier as well..the folks at Oakbrook tend to be a bit assholish. Had a good time bowling and bocce-ing this afternoon and this is now our Pinstripes of choice. Cheers!"

We always end up in the bar. They have a wonderful bartender that always has great drink and food recommendations. Some items are pricey for the portions but I love their flat breads and spaghetti with meatballs. They even have &#34;all you can eat&#34; special where you can share and it includes salad.
Bowling is great here but limited on a busy night, I&#39;ve never been a bocce fan but I&#39;ve gone with groups who&#39;ve enjoyed it there.
Great outdoor space in the nicer months, they even have a fire pit for when it cools down at night. Wonderful atmosphere."

my issues (and granted, I think some of them aren&#39;t worth mentioning on their own, but compiled together, it made for a terrible meal):
- our first batch of water tasted like pool water. we had to ask them to replace all of them. 
- the service was painfully slow, it was really difficult to track a server down
- one of my coworkers has severe food allergies and asked if certain dishes were safe for her to eat. the waiter took the rest of our orders and came back 15 minutes later to take hers
- we had to ask for bread three times (mostly because we were starving from our food taking so long)
- when our food did arrive, they forgot my entree altogether and half of everyone else&#39;s food was cold. 

the worst part about all this is that I actually find the food pretty good here! the management was nice enough to replace a few peoples cold fries and discount the meal a bit. but the overall experience was incredibly disappointing."

After a little bit of brainstorming, Pinstripes came to mind! We&#39;ve driven by this place so many times and even stopped in once to take a look around with the intention of returning someday because it looked fun. 

This is a great place to meet up with a group of friends both big and small or just as a couple which was our case. When you walk in you&#39;re greeted with a large open meeting space with a bar, cocktail tables and TVs. Then to the right there are bowling lanes and to the left there are bocce courts. 

We walked in on a Saturday night and were able to get a bocce court without problem, but would recommend making a reservation if there is a certain time or bigger group you&#39;d like to accommodate. We ended up renting the court for a one hour slot and ordered cocktails while we played. You can also order appetizers, entrees and desserts delivered to you at your court depending on your appetite. 

Great atmosphere for hanging out, trying something different and ideal for families looking to spend time together during the cold winter months."

And at only $5 per kid and parents bowl free (M-F from 10am-12pm) - it&#39;s my favorite too! Pinstripes definitely isn&#39;t your typical league-loaded bowling alley. Far from it, in fact.  It&#39;s one of the nicest bowling alleys I&#39;ve been to. 

From the front desk to the bocce ball court, and the bistro to the comfy sofas in the bowling area, this bowling alley is gorgeous! Of course it caters more to the late-night weekend crowd, but Tots Playtime bowling every Monday-Friday from 10am-12pm definitely brings the kids out to play! Not to worry though - there were plenty of lighter bowling balls to go around. One of my favorite things about bowling at Pinstripes was the ability to add bumpers only to specific bowlers. Perfect for family bowling.

All that bowling is sure to work up an appetite and the Pinstripes Bistro has delicious food. Again, don&#39;t think &#34;typical bowling alley&#34; food. The food at Pinstripes Bistro rivals a gourmet feast. My son ordered off the Kids Menu and LOVED the parmesan breadsticks with marinara sauce and I enjoyed a delicious cobb salad. 

Helpful Tip: If you&#39;re headed to Pinstripes for Tots Playtime, make sure you get there early. Not sure if it&#39;s as crowded every week, but I visited on a Friday during a holiday week and the line was out the door!"

Great set up and very comfortable. Food is delicious, bowling and bocci are a lot of fun

The issues. Service was very bad. We were seated and given bread but no water and no drink oders taken until I finally said something. The salmon was served cold so it was sent back. We were eating our meals at different times due to this. We had to flag the waitress down several times to order refills and desserts. My girlfriend didn&#39;t get her cappacino with dessert as ordered and we had to ask yet again where an ordered item was. The food was delicious but the service was really bad. 

I hope they can up their service game. It&#39;s priced as a nicer resturant so good service is expected."

The buffet is just awesome. At $20/per adult, it&#39;s reasonable for the variety. You will get charged for pop, but I don&#39;t know about coffee or juice and mimosas and bloody marys are on special. We have a 4 year old, he was free, awesome! I believe 5 and under are free, 6-12 has a prorated cost. 

I would recommend walking the buffet first, so you can plan our your strategy. 

I loaded up on the salads, I love salads, but these were meh, I would skip next time and save the room for the other tasty foods. Surprisingly, the mostaccioli was excellent. For basic pasta, it was really worth it, and the meatball were good too. My son really enjoyed them.  

I also loved the &#39;potato skins&#39; or versions of them. They were great. My other favorites were the pizzas, salmon and chicken. My husband loved the prime rib, it was cooked more than rare, but that&#39;s okay in this setting and since the meat was tender. My son like all three things on the kid&#39;s bar: chicken fingers, which I liked too, fries and mac-n-cheese. 

My suggestions would be: get a small plate for your table to leave your silverware on, they tables are not set like this, ask for a sharper knife if your are going to enjoy the prime rib, and a spoon would be useful for a couple items as well.
For the restaurant, I wish soda, coffee and tea were included. I also wish there were more sauces with the chicken fingers, maybe ranch and honey mustard. 

I will definitely be back. I want to stay and play bocce next time too."

The execution shown from top to bottom shows it is a well managed and well led location. Went for Santa brunch and all were satisfied. However, though the food was good, not $30 good...a little light on selection and would&#39;ve loved more of a salad bar type. Their competitors and comparable price point in my mind are Drury lane and Pheasant run and as of right now, they far out class Pinstripes on the Sunday brunch front. I&#39;d still go for bowling and bocce but Sunday brunch...the injury report says doubtful."

We got there kind of late, around 7:30-8, and were seated immediately in the dining room. There was one large party and several small parties in the dining room, so not too busy. There was a large party in the bowling area as well. We ordered drinks to start, I had a Limoncello margarita and Peter had the Krankshaft beer. His beer was delicious, I really enjoyed it. The Limoncello margarita was very good! Almost like a strawberry lemonade margarita and it was so refreshing! 

In terms of food, we ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which came out in minutes! It was very good, seasoned nicely with parmesan and parsley. Not very greasy and not too crisp either. For entrees, I had the Cobb salad and Peter had the cheeseburger. The Cobb salad was dressed in a white balsamic vinaigrette, so I didn&#39;t know there was dressing on the salad. I ended up asking for more before I even tasted it, which was my bad. I ended up tasting it and realizing that the salad had been dressed. All the ingredients were fresh and crisp. Very good flavor. The burger was juicy and tender and had really good flavors. The sauce on the burger was very good as well. 

We decided to really go nuts and order dessert. He had the carmelized cheesecake and I had the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was a flourless cake served on a plate of strawberry sauce with vanilla bean whipped cream. This was an amazing dessert! All the flavors meshed really well and everything complimented everything else. The cheesecake had a nice carmelized top to it. The cake was creamy and had a nice crust to it. 

Overall, a phenomenal meal from start to finish. We will definitely be adding this to our list of go-to spots for date night in the future."

First of all they upped the prices $145 for 6 people to bowl two games is outrageous.  On top of that we had brunch which was an additional $240.  Definitely not worth it. We also had trouble with our lane which took away from the two hours that was allotted to us since it took over 15 minutes for someone to come and check on the problem.

Most people love to bowl once in a great while whether they&#39;re Roy Munson or they suck at it like me. It&#39;s a fun activities but bowling though is still popular, it&#39;s seen like an old fashioned pastime activity. Most bowling alleys are aged, dingy, with bad frozen pizza as their only dining offering. Plus, you have to be prepared for a chance of getting foot fungus. Brunswick Zones are breeding grounds of weird creepy people, in my opinion anyway. It&#39;s not the most inviting place to go to. It used to be such annoyance deciding where to go if wanting to go bowling.

Pinstripes offers a great and obvious alternative. They&#39;re brand new, modern, and quite classy for a bowling alley. However, they&#39;re more than a bowling alley. They&#39;re the Three B&#39;s: Bocce, Bowling, and Bistro.

Their location is very clean and new. Bowling there is fun and it&#39;s nice. You didn&#39;t have to feel icky sitting on a furniture from the 70&#39;s. Nope, everything still look like how they were intended to look and work. 

Their food selection was pretty decent too. The foods look like restaurant food and not bowling alley food. I have been here twice with work for dinner and team building event. First time, we had pizza, salads, and desserts. The pizza wasn&#39;t the frozen kind and they&#39;re pretty good. Not only they did the mainstream pizzas but they also had fun ones like fig and prosciutto that was superb!

The next time I was there, also with work; we had a buffet of hot food. We had calamari and bruschetta appetizers that were decent. Then, pasta with chicken and mushroom, risotto, salmon dish, and a braised short ribs that were delicious. I was actually surprised because I was expecting pizza again. Getting somewhat fancy and delicious food before bowling, I definitely felt more like Ernie McCracken than Roy Munson.

I bowled 112 my first game. Not bad, I thought for a horrible bowler like me. My only gripe is Pinstripes is an easy choice for companies to go to for their events. It&#39;s nice, fun, and all contained into one. Hell, my company had me going here twice in the last six months. Hope our event person stay creative and come up with other fun activities than bowling all the damn time. I think many other companies will also see it as an easy obvious choice. Good for Pinstripes&#39; business. Bad for having a good mixture of team building exercises. I want to go clay shooting, build a boat, beer brewing. Why do we have to throw ball to knock down pins and breaking nails all the time?

If you have to pay yourself, it is quite spendy.. $5 per game per person on Sun-Thu, and $7 for Fri- Sat. Yeah!!! Not cheap. But hopefully no doctor&#39;s bill for foot fungus.

They also cater. We got boxed lunch at work several times from Pinstripes and they were pretty good. I&#39;m just a bit pinstriped; but I&#39;d still give them the credits they deserve. The service while we were there was also fantastic. They aimed to please and very attentive to your needs especially your alcoholic beverage need. I appreciated that my throat never got dry and it&#39;s always more fun with some booze in you trying to compete with my male coworkers who took winning way too seriously. Anyway, not a bad place. A bowling alley that&#39;s nice, bright, and clean is kinda right up my alley."

My sister who just moved out to the greater Chicago area took us here on a Friday afternoon to have a small lunch and to take my nephew bowling.   I was surprised to see couches in the bowling area, definitely never seen that before! And TV&#39;s next to the bowling monitors for your viewing pleasure.  I recall the food was OK.

We had Lauren as our event planner and I was excited because I had heard great things about this place. We were planning about 30 people coming. 
Lauren never asked us to come in for a tour; I just sent my brother over there to check the place out. I paid $50 for my dad&#39;s birthday cake to be sent in from Deerfields but Lauren never ordered it. Also somehow the 30 of us were stuffed into a corner with one bocce court for an hour. It was crammed and we were overflowing onto another group that was playing next to us. Lauren wasn&#39;t even there and never told me she wasn&#39;t going to be there. I thought we&#39;d have more room when we opened the bowling, but it was still crammed
They get 3 stars and not 2 because the staff really tried to make things better. The dessert display they made was great and they took off the bocce court from our bill. I feel bad they had to fix Laurens mistakes. She obviously didn&#39;t care about my event. Don&#39;t plan your events with her"

We got it, finished it, then waited for another 15 before our waitress came to take our order for our entrees. She apologized for the wait and put our order in presumably fairly quickly. I ordered the veggie burger and it was awful. Hands down the worst I&#39;ve ever had. Patty was mushy, got cheese fell everywhere.

I also had the chicken parm, it was a huge serving with two chicken breasts, whole grain pasta. The pasta wasn&#39;t bad and I really liked that the chicken was crispy and not soggy. I had to get a doggy bag though because it was so much food.

My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya, he was thoroughly satisfied. I tasted it too, it was really good! Had a huge portion of some sort of rice. Also had a good mixture of shrimp,chicken and beef. Spicy;)

I always ordered the Pine Nut Crusted Halibut and asked for a side of fruit (I suppose you could say I&#39;m a painfully boring creature of habit). 

True to Midwestern style, the portions are huge! For the price, you get an absurd amount of halibut and risotto! The halibut was pretty good, but the reason I kept ordering this dish was definitely the risotto, which is buttery, well-seasoned, and just so filling. They give you something that appears to be melted butter on the side. I stayed far away from it. The fruit is a fairly standard rendition of the modern fruit cup. Shame they don&#39;t use fresh berries or anything. It&#39;s kind of cool how a bowling alley, complete with a bar, is the place to be on a weekday night.

Our server was Brett, he was amazing, very personable and attentive. Food was pretty good but very overpriced for what you receive. Would have been 5 stars if the food had been a bit more affordable.

This was an OK experience.  The good part was that we had youngsters and they were able to play Bocce and get out a little steam.  The challenge was that other people with their kids let them run all over and into our courts.  Rude and lousy parents, not Pinstripes fault.  Our kids behave.

The service from the bar was good.  Reasonably quick.  The waitress at our Bocce area was great.

We moved to a table of 15 for dinner.  I thought the service there was really slow and inconsistent.  Lots of waiting and lag time.  The poor girl needed some help.  

Food was OK.  Just OK.  It took a while and when it showed up it felt very unorganized.  

It is hard to judge with a large party, a couple kids, and moving from Bocce to a large table.  We had a great evening because of the party but I am not sold on the food and table service."

I had the BBQ chicken pizza. It was a little different but still good. They added corn and grilled onions , which I&#39;m not used to. It did make the meal more hearty though. 

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We played a few rounds of Bocce outside after dinner, which was a lot of fun even though I had never heard of it before. Unfortunately, the mosqiutos were out for blood that night. I wish pinstripes would invest in some citronelle candles. It would be a nice gesture to offer on the restaurants behalf. I should note they do have the bocce lanes (is that what you call them) indoors as well, but they were all taken up.  Thanks Pinstripes for great food, and a fun night."

I&#39;ve been here two or three times for dinner, once to lounge and watch bocce, and several times for tot bowling. The food has always been unremarkable, at least in my experience, until today. I can&#39;t believe the Sunday brunch they offer. For $20, an adult can gorge herself or himself from 10 to 2. While service is always skimpy at Pinstripes, the food today really impressed me. The most worthy of mention is the strawberry and balsamic cream mini waffle...mmm, I ate three today and can&#39;t wait to go back for more. There is even a chocolate fountain!

Tot bowling is offered M - F from 10 to noon, and it&#39;s a phenomenal deal. $5 for kids to bowl, free for parents, and no cost for shoe rental. That&#39;s two hours of wild fun for $5. The place is clean and really caters to the little ones in the morning, with plenty of ramps available for those who like the assistance in getting their ball rolling. There are breakfast and lunch menus available to order food while you bowl. They even used to throw in free coffee, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case any longer. 

I will say, I sometimes find it difficult to get the help I need, and the front desk employees don&#39;t always seem eager to greet and assist guests, particularly tiny guests arriving for tot bowling. But no matter...for $5 fun and delicious mini waffles, I&#39;ll deal with the lackluster welcome."

We had a 9pm reservation but still had to wait a few minutes for our lane. We were brought to our lane and our server already had quite a few lanes but was still attentive.

Both food and drinks were phenomenal and would go back for the food alone. 

Downside: Our bowling balls kept getting stuck in the ball return and we had to seek someone out to remove them. This happened over and over throughout the night and probably extended our playing time by at least 30 minutes. The other was that the music being played was weird. While it was good music it was not really lively or fun for a Friday night."

Drinks are moderately priced for the area.. I mean its South Barrington.  My vodka/club soda&#39;s were $8, but they weren&#39;t small and they made them pretty strong.  And I loved getting waited on, it was nice not having to go to the bar.

The bocce area looks pretty cool and I would love to try that out someday.  Didn&#39;t order any food either since we had dinner at Cooper&#39;s Hawk.

I made a reservation on a Saturday night at 4:15, after spending $40 on drinks and bowling two games, we wanted to extend our stay and bowl an additional game.
However, after I paid the $8 per game to continue my stay at this establishment (which would incur a higher drink ticket), I was told that I was not allowed to bowl additional games due to incoming reservations. There were at least 15 open lanes (more than enough room to accommodate incoming guests) but we were refunded our games and told that I would throw off the rest of the reservation schedule by bowling one additional game.
Being a manager in retail, I can assure you that Bree is in no way a suitable manger for an establishment of this magnitude.  She was not empathetic to my situation or the fact that she had ample room to accommodate incoming guests.  I expressed my dissatisfaction with our excellent server, James, who should be the face of you business. He was apologetic, sincere, and took the blame for the lack of business fortitude that Bree had expressed. 
I find myself having a difficult time in recommending, or returning to Pinstripes given the service I encountered. I can say with definite confidence that if I were to return, I would immediately walk out if I were greeted by Bree.

I haven&#39;t bowled since my 8th grade gym class where we got to walk across the street to this little 4 lane bowling alley in a basement of a strip mall.  Yeah that was an interesting place and in comparison to that pinstripes is amazing with its comfy leather couches and mood lighting. I didn&#39;t bowl.    I was there for a child&#39;s b-day party at 6 on a Sat night.  From what I observed it seems that from 6-730/8 it all kids groups and then from 8:30 on its adults out for the night.  Several flatbreads were ordered for our group &amp; they were all really good.   We also had the pulled pork and meatball sandwich but I did not try those.  They looked pretty decent.  They have about 5 craft beers on draft, several bottled beers &amp; a large wine list.  The service was mediocre.  

After the party our group stayed for some to play Bocce ball which was $60 per hour.  They also had a jazz &amp; blues band playing at the bar next to the Bocce courts.  It says that the band is there every Fri and Sat. There was a pretty large crowd there when we left at 9:30.

We had the Italian-American grill feast with sausage, brats, chicken and mini black angus burgers, various salads, fruits selection and desserts plus an assortment of pizzas and flatbreads. Carrie and staff directed Mitsubishi Materials USA guests to our bowling lanes, had shoes for bowlers and had the first round of beverages fast.

Many thanks to Pinstripes for holding a Yelp event a few months back and introducing me to the cool place that houses bowling alleys, bocce ball, beer and pretty stellar food. During said event, I was lucky enough to win brunch &amp; bocce ball for four. Score!

This past Sunday me and three lucky friends of mine took advantage of this brunch (normally $20pp) and played bocce ball (normally $20/hour). We all left thoroughly impressed.

When we walked in, we had to walk past the buffet spread to get to the dining room and were immediately in awe. It was huge and everything looked great. I&#39;m happy to report everything was just as delicious as it was pretty. Let me break it all down for you~
+Waffle Table with a guy making one of three yummy waffles for you - Nutella &amp; Banana, Strawberries &amp; Cream or Cinnamon Apple - all in mini size which was perfect for me to share &amp; try each with friends. The Nutella &amp; Banana is a cool option and tasted great.
+Hot Options Table - This was interesting because one dish would be bacon, the next sausage (their sausage was one of my favorite things by the way, you must get this!), then Chicken Marsala! So it&#39;s a mix of breakfast and lunch hot items. In addition to aforementioned items, there are penne meatballs, breakfast potatoes, roasted veggies and a few different types of pizza.
+Huge table with cold items - Couple different types of muffins, tons of fruit, salad with tons of topping and dressing options
+Seafood table - Unpeeled shrimp, raw fresh salmon and another fresh cold fish
+Bagels and 3 different spreads
+Omelet station! The omelet the guy made me was so good - soft and fluffy perfection! You can choose from a variety of ingredients and he&#39;ll throw &#39;em all together for you. I got two cheeses, ham and mushrooms...Loved it! He was also carving prime rib for people and there was just plain ol&#39; scrambled eggs if you preferred that.
+Cutest thing of all - Mini table for kids at a shorter level with mac &amp; cheese, chicken nuggies, pizza, fries - the usual kid fare. Great addition to the buffet!
+Dessert table - Dare I say my favorite of all the tables? It had an amazing chocolate fountain which we witnessed them monitoring making sure to keep it at peak levels for maximum chocolate covered, yum! On this table were some great options for fonduing it up in the fountain like pretzel sticks, twizzlers, strawberries, marshmallows &amp; rice krispies and then some other options you didn&#39;t have to dip in like cheesecake, chocolate chip cookies, biscotti, flourless chocolate cake, chocolate brownies with strawberries, and a bit of fruit like grapes.

Our server was great throughout our whole meal and there was no issue using my special certificate. My friends and I agreed we would go here and pay full price without blinking an eye. Fantastic food and well worth people going in for their brunch!

After brunch, my friends and I headed over to play some bocce ball. One of the workers was super nice teaching us how to play bocce and even played a round with us. I&#39;m not sure if playing for more than an hour would be much fun because we played 30 minutes and were kind of over it, but it&#39;s such a cool different option to have. There was a ton of comfy seating options around our bocce ball lane which was nice.

In conclusion, we LOVED Pinstripes! I&#39;m so thankful to them, Yelp and Candice G. for hooking us up on Sunday. And I&#39;m going to be back soon!!!"

Crank shaft was the beer we had and it was really crisp and great. The glasses were really clean in the bar and at the wine pairing. The food was just top notch you should go and check it out. They also have bocce and bowling if you like to play those. Great up beat atmosphere. Chef Edwin was a really great chef and an amazing asset to the team. Also the service from Michelle was amazing she even went out of her way to show us around that night. I highly recommend the bartender named Dimas he was very efficient, courteous, and polite.

A great place to eat, drink and be merry...they have a good cocktail list and offer $1 bocce and bowling from 8pm to close on Sunday-Thursday.  Our favorite day to go is Tuesday, for $1 burgers while bocce-ing or bowling.  Mondays are bottomless spaghetti and meatballs and chopped salad.  Thursday are $3 cocktails for the ladies, but they don&#39;t discriminate, if you have a Y chromosome, they will give you the cocktails for $3 also.  

My wife threw me a birthday party here, and were treated like royalty.  We had a food spread in the lobby between the bar and the bowling alley with a couple of tables for guests to eat at.  We had four lanes to accomodate all guests who wanted to bowl, and were given complimentary socks for those who needed a pair.  Some of our guests were even allowed to play complimentary bocce.  For the children who were bowling with us, they had the easy ramps and pull-up bumpers,  For the adults, they have a well-stocked bar.  For the price we paid, we had a great time, and enough food and drinks for 30 people.  

My only gripe is this place isn&#39;t a &#34;real&#34; bowling alley.  Just as with other bowling alleys like 10 Pin and Lucky Strike(which I don&#39;t consider real alleys), they don&#39;t keep the lanes well oiled.  So if you are an avid bowler, make sure to bring your light oil balls when you come here, because the lanes are sure to be drier than average.  

BTW, check in with 4square for a free piece of cheesecake, which usually runs $7.  To sum it up and make the most of your $, come on a Tuesday, bring a light oil ball and your own shoes, get a burger and drink water, check in on 4square for the cheesecake, and pay $2!"

What sets it apart is that everyone there was an active participant of the wedding celebration from the outdoor ceremony, cocktails and mingling with seating around the fire pit to the reception and dancing upstairs to the late night bowling and more food offered to all guests who wanted to stay after the reception.   Thank you Pinstripes for making it such a memorable and fun celebration!"

We met our friends and their grandchildren for dinner and bowling.  Our grandchildren had never bowled before.  The bowling balls were small enough and  light enough for the kids. None of us have ever played bocce ball before but gave it a try. It was fun and we had a lot of good laughs.  For dinner we started with the cheese mozzarella balls, tenderloin sliders, fried calamari, flatbread. Main course-dinner all the kids had burgers or crispy fried chicken. Adults had pasta, risotto, halibut and a club sandwich. Average prices. Waitstaff ok. To my surprise the food was very good.  We all agreed it was a great day. Lots of fun and we will do it again."

I did an event on Tuesday Feb. 17.  There were 45 people who attended. From the moment my guests walked into the door, the staff made them all feel so special. GM Melanie Mpistolarides was so awesome to work with. She was right on with all I wanted. Mickey Stott, senior manager, working the event was so prepared for my party and had his awesome staff ready for me.  Servers Jacque and Jake, and Bartender Karen worked the party that evening and were so attentive and upbeat. This was such an important night and this staff kicked butt!!!  I frequent Pinstripes and I&#39;ve never been disappointed.  I can&#39;t wait to host another event there!!! Thank you all so much!!!!!!!"

We decided to reserve a bowling lane instead. We were a little confused and thought we were paying by the hour but actually were paying by the game. The customers were really nice and friendly. We had an amazing flatbread and the drinks were good too. It was an expensive night but no complaints on service and food. I felt Pinstripes was overpriced but it was packed so I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s just me.

I don&#39;t really understand what it is.  I walked in and it seemed to be part restaurant, part meeting/party venue, part bowling alley, and a few other things I didn&#39;t experience.  I don&#39;t really think it did anything particularly well.  Also we had a 9:30 reservation for bowling, but even though they had open lanes, they wouldn&#39;t let us bowl until closer to 10:30, because some corporate event was finishing up in there, and they didn&#39;t want us to disturb them.  This caused half our party to leave, and only about 1/4 of us wanted to bowl that late.  Also, it was ungodly expensive.  For one game of bowling for 2 people with shoes was 22.00.  That to me is just bonkers.  Most of the time I bowl at the most is 2.99 a game plus maybe 3.00 for shoes.  I won&#39;t be returning..."

Jackie and her staff were an absolute pleasure to work with, excellent in communications and very reassuring on all information and details.  We truly appreciated all of the attention to detail, setting up our personal items and help to create the perfect evening for us. 
 
We have received many compliments on the service of Pinstripes staff and the quality of food (can&#39;t beat the food!).  The staff was excellent... so helpful and pleasant.

forward to planning future events with them.

However, the bowling reservation system is losing you money and patrons.  60% of your lanes should never be empty waiting for reservations.  We sat for an hour watching over half of the lanes remain empty.  Two people asking to bowl one game.  Unacceptable.  Meanwhile our service at the bar was very slow on an average night.  Go somewhere else."

Service is not good at all. For the prices on the menu it is not worth it. I was there with a table of 3. We stopped by just to grab lunch. We were there for over an hour and it only took 5 minutes to eat. The rest was waiting time. We ordered chicken fingers, soup and a salad. That is it! Took 10 minutes to get a side of Ranch dressing, which cost us $2.00. The place had maybe 4 tables full. Way too long and way too over priced. And TWO DOLLARS for a side of ranch?? No thank you.

Hollywood directors are so selfish, they don&#39;t listen to the fans!  Our suggestions to make TDKR a better film: 1. Less Anne Hathaway, more Marion Cotillard! 2. Subtitles for Bane (did anyone else not understand a word he said?! 3. Batman should have Superman-like powers (ability to fly, run super fast, stop bullets, etc) I know it would&#39;ve been hard for him to explain how he magically turned into a superhero, but it would&#39;ve been more realistic then him rehabbing himself enough to be able to climb out of a pit in less than four months.  Anyway.....

Pinstripes had live music, ample seating at the bar, and one of the most delicious pieces of chocolate cake we&#39;ve ever eaten.  My girlfriend joked that it was more like a slab of fudge than cake.  It was very decadent, very rich, and unbelievably tasty.  A generous plop of handmade whipped cream and red grape halves were on the plate with the cake.  It was a perfect way to end the night!"

1) You cannot cut your breakfast brunch buffet in half (if not more), still charge $24 and expect people to be impressed.

2) When people who frequent here a lot (I mean, at LEAST once a week) try and make a reservation in advance for bocci ball, let them.  Don&#39;t tell them to call back 2 days before, and then when they do, say you&#39;re booked.

3) When we do go there for dinner, try and have your servers at least acknowledge us within 20 minutes of us being there without making us flag someone down.

4) $18 for what looked like an ice cream scoop of Jambalaya?  And this is something that used to be in the brunch that was taken off.  Not cool.

I have been disappointed SO much by this place lately.  I doubt I will be back for a while..."

Very kid friendly, at least during the day.  They even have rolling ramps for kids to bowl with in addition to bumper lanes.

I could see the bowling getting expensive if timing isn&#39;t right. Our timing was great.

It&#39;s $10 for an assortment of sandwiches, soups, and platters (turkey). I ordered the turkey platter and several co-workers ordered sandwiches. The turkey platter came with three slices of soft, juicy, tender turkey breasts along with a slice of pecan pie (first time I tried it and it was great!) and a vegetable medley consisting of corn, asparagus, and zucchini. The food I would rate 3.5 stars out of 5, which was above average and was a pretty good VALUE. However, the service was pretty bad. 

First, they got my order wrong and as a result, brought my food out 15 minutes later than everyone else at my table. Second, they took about 5 minutes to see if I wanted a drink. Third, the fork I got had a crusty piece of gravy on the handle. I&#39;m sure these were all abnormalities that hit me at the same time, so I&#39;d give this place another shot.

They have a dinner piece for $12 (half rack of ribs and chicken) that seems like another great value. They have a bar area, bowling lanes, and a place for bocci ball. It&#39;s definitely an awesome place to have a party (I&#39;ve been upstairs to the event center where they host wedding parties and such). Other than the bad service, it&#39;s a decent place."

The service is always great, it is probably the nicest bowling alley I have ever bowled at, the brunch is very tasty and has a nice variety, and the food/drink is always great. I still think it is pretty pricey, but it is a nicer place. You don&#39;t come here to get bar food or walk into a stale smoke smelling bowling alley. It&#39;s quality. It&#39;s a treat.

I had been to Pinstripes once for a networking mixer. The food was good. Good breakfast, waffle station was delicious. Beef at the carving station was a little dry. But for $30 for brunch, I expected A LOT more I guess. The cost and the service will guarantee I will never go back again. We waited 25 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. I had to ask for silverware for the table. Our waiter was a little rude, and seemed bothered. My husband and I paid $3.00 a piece for a cup of coffee with our brunch that was only 2/3 full when it arrived. I had to ask for cream. I asked for a refill and never received one. They ran out of plates  several times when I went up and were out of some entrees I wanted each time I went up. 

So $75.00 for two of us, with tip - I left full but a little bewildered how I spent that much for the poor service, long wait with the reservation and buffet food, if it was available at the buffet. All I thought is that is the same money we could have spent on our favorite sushi restaurant for sashimi, rolls and some good beer.

The bacon, sausage, and prime rib is always delicious.  I got to have a taste of my dad&#39;s ham, mushroom, and onion omelet.  I loved it!

For dessert I like the flourless chocolate cake because it melts in your mouth.  I LOVE the chocolate waterfall.  I would love to shower in that fountain!

We got there at 10 when it started, but there was a long line and all the lanes were quickly taken.  As any parent knows, once you make a promise to an excited 2 year old, it is a challenge to change plans.  A bigger challenge was trying to get our daughter to wait patiently for her turn, as most families were using the entire 2 hour tot bowling time.  We tried to distract her with Bocce ball, but she got very antsy and hungry.  With a powerful tantrum brewing as we tried to explain that we might not be bowling after all, perhaps seeing the fear in my eyes, the manager on duty, a gentleman whose name I unfortunately forgot, tried to help ease the wait by bringing my daughter a milk. As the kitchen was not open yet, he then allowed us to run out and feed our kiddo, and reserved a lane for us upon our return at no additional cost, even though the tot bowling was over.  With the bumpers and kid ramp to roll the ball down, it was great for our toddler.  So although I cannot review the food, our daughter had a fantastic time bowling, and I truly thank the manager that went above and beyond for us.  We will definitely be returning in the future, earlier.  The waitress in our area (lane 19) also had a great attitude-I can imagine toddler hour being every server&#39;s nightmare, and though we didn&#39;t order anything more than a beverage she was very sweet and helpful getting us anything we needed.  I really need to work on remembering people&#39;s names, but two thumbs up for the staff and tot bowling!"

Service was great &amp; the food was really good. The complimentary bread &amp; dipping pesto sauce was yummy! My colleagues &amp; I had the pine nut crusted halibut &amp; the braised short beef. Both were really outstanding &amp; savory dishes. Nicely presented too. I finished every bite on my plate including the small house salad (field greens &amp; not iceberg!). For dessert we had warm cookies &amp; milk - -  simple but hey it definitely hit the spot!  I have never been to a restaurant that served just cookies &amp; milk... this place did!

This restaurant replaced the IHOP that was here. Looks the exact same inside basically but with completely different people working and cooking the food which has come out amazingly. This is probably the best breakfast I&#39;ve had in quite a while. My friend ordered the classic breakfast of two eggs, hashbrowns, and bacon, with a side of pancakes. He wished the hashbrowns and bacon was a bit more crispy but otherwise truly enjoyed it. I tried the pancakes which tasted amazing for just being plain. I ordered an English muffin and the multi grain honey yogurt pancakes. They&#39;re served with yogurt and garnola on top (3 total pancakes). The presentation was great as well as the taste. I also tried the Very Berry smoothie. This looks nothing like they make it look on yelp, but was just as good as it looks. It&#39;s blue ish purple with whip cream on the top. Very tasty overall. 

The waitress was good as well. The overall service seemed good. The bill wasn&#39;t too expensive but not too cheap either and the food came out pretty quickly which is always a good thing!

I was pleasantly surprised to see a good variety of menu items, although the offerings weren&#39;t too different from other brunch places. The coffee was decently strong as well -- not too acidic and fairly smooth.

For me, no menu items in particular that I tried really stood out -- but were done fairly well. The patty melt had a nice thick slab of beef and the fries were enjoyable. The Irish benedict was a bit flat for me on all levels, from the corned beef hash to the hash browns -- and lacked real texture contrast (should&#39;ve had a nice runny egg with crispy meat and potatoes). The crepes had a nice texture and flavor to them with fresh strawberries, however I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the strawberry cream cheese filling. The chicken and waffles were okay -- the chicken was crispy but the meat wasn&#39;t super flavorful while the waffles were a bit soft and had a nice egg taste to it. The use of gravy and/or maple syrup was necessary to give the dish enough flavor however.

In summary, the food is well priced here and they serve dishes quickly -- but it could use some refinement in both flavor and textures to really stand out."

The food was good. I wouldn&#39;t say the best. I&#39;ve had much better at brunch spots. 

I had the berry French toast, it was more on the crispy side and not fluffy at all. I asked for a scoop of ice cream on top, which made my plate a bit more pleasing.

My husband had ordered their veggie Benedict, he didn&#39;t really like it, it was &#34;too healthy&#34; for him. It just tasted like he was eating just a whole bunch of greens.

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t come back, but it wasn&#39;t that bad of a place to try. In my opinion, just a one time place to eat."

The food was much better than I was expecting.
I got a breakfast combo with scrambled eggs, bacon, and replaced the pancakes with french toast (extra .99).
-The eggs were fully cooked (not runny), but not over cooked - nicely done.
-The apple bacon was tasty, not too greasy, a long-strip of meat with less fat.
-It&#39;s really difficult to mess up french toast, but some places have done just that - not these guys though. The bread was fresh, added cinnamon, absorbed the syrup well but not too much - it&#39;s was a good soggy.

The bathroom was clean, has paper towels for drying hands, and the garbage was near the door (not only good for us, but good to know for the sake of the cooks - they don&#39;t have to touch the dirty door handle after washing their hands).

The servers were on the ball - they didn&#39;t allow for clean plates to stay on the table very long, always stopping by to refill your coffee.

The free wifi was nice, also.


The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the parking lot.
There are a lot of good spots, and I didn&#39;t notice anything wrong with the pavement or anything, but the sign coming in only says &#34;Enter&#34;. So on my way out, I thought there was another way out - not so. It might be minor, but I was confused and drove around the back, only to find there&#39;s not another way out - just a little annoying. It would&#39;ve been nice to know this first.

I&#39;d definitely go back though."

 So I had their caramel latte which was awesome defiantly coming back for another one, since I&#39;m a coffee addict. It had which I believe was marshmallow on top, tasted so darn good.
  My skillet was on point, the bacon was delicious nice and crispy. Ham was a little on the dry side but overall skillet was really good.
  I also had the apple cinnamon pancakes which I&#39;ll say we&#39;re pretty intense lol jk they were delicious defiantly coming back and trying other things on the menu. I honestly wish they had a different seating arrangements since it still kind of looks like how IHOP had it set up. But overall good job."

But long gone are the days of blue, red, and white - the building had a complete makeover before becoming Golden Brunch. What&#39;s interesting is it&#39;s still a diner but now only open for breakfast and lunch.

My friend and I hit this spot up for some lunchtime grub. I&#39;m pretty sure we were the youngest people in around Noon with a bunch of friendly silver hairs around us. Our server was also very friendly and checked in on us just the right amount.

It was very hard to make a decision on what to order as the menu is 4 pages full of delicious sounding options! In the end, I decided to stick to my no carb eating and ordered an omelette with provolone cheese, ham and bacon. Mmm Mmm Mmm! It was a large and tasty omelette, coming with a side of fresh fruit for $9.49. You can also get toast or pancakes with any omelette but I opted to leave that out. My omelette was packed full of all my choice ingredients which was a pleasant surprise! The omelette was so large I ended up taking half home.

Golden Brunch is a very welcome addition to the area with it&#39;s lovely service, great food and homelike feel!"

Service was attentive but not overly. The coffee was very good and I liked that they left an ice water carafe on the table.

We both got Benedict dishes and their hollandaise was on point. I ate my entire Irish Benedict which was pipin&#39; hot even after I spent 3 mintues photographing it and my friends dish.

I will be back cause they had a great menu and I have some other things to try. Like the IHOP space they left it unchanged because it allows for an insane capacity, especially compared to other places. Our only complaint and it sounds petty is that the place feels really yellow inside because of the lighting and the wall color."

The place looks nice and the menu looked decent but our waitress was rude my husbands coffee was burnt they didn&#39;t even have regular sugar. I ordered the tuna melt and the toast had waaaaaay too much butter and my husbands salmon Benedict was drenched in a siracha sauce that ruined the whole dish and can&#39;t forget the stale English muffin. Horrible experience won&#39;t be coming back. It&#39;s sad to think that people can&#39;t taste the difference in quality food. ALSO THE MUGS WERE ALL DIRTY!!!!!!!!!

Came this morning at 830 and it was already getting packed. The interior is modern with comfy booths and open spaces so people are not on top of eachother. Our server was friendly and got our order right. He didn&#39;t check on us every few minutes which is fine by me. They served the water with a lemon slice in the carafe. Coffee was great. My daughter got the French toast and she loved it. Portions are big..she had 6 thick slices, so needless to say we had a to go box  
I had eggs sunny side up, bacon, hash brown and pancakes. Served warm and the hash browns passed my test. Everything was good. Next time I&#39;ll try the bacon waffles. Definitely looked good when I saw a server bring them out. Good spot for bfast..and I am sure for lunch too."

Hamina, Hamina.

IHOP is gone. GOLDEN BRUNCH has taken the building- and believe me when I say, these mofos grabbed the coffee maker by the balls and made the griddle their bitch... They run that kitchen with nitro-frickin-glycerin. No joke.

Light, crispy, sweet waffles filled with bacon, topped with unbelievable battered chicken so delicious that only a side of creamy sausage gravy could make it perfect. Done.

Wait... There&#39;s more.

Potato pancakes that come with sour cream and apple sauce. Carmelized crust filled with so much love, my heart cried. So did my kid when I yanked a sample.

I couldn&#39;t try anything else. My face kept devouring my enormous plate of CnW, though my eyes did wander. 

The super deluxe omelette my dad got destroyed the plate it was served upon and the table had a lean afterwards. It looked quite delicious but there are no leftovers to speak of or sample.

Anything and everything we ordered, was consumed without regret.

Damn great cup of coffee, too. Damnity damn.

Did I mention the service?

No?

That&#39;s because it was superb. The did their job without any needless banter or bother. Friendly and fine.

Fortunate to have this establishment added to the rotation."

We had never heard of it we just needed a breakfast place. Food was great! Service was very fast and the servers were very polite. Also the place is extremely clean.

The Chocolatina Parfait and the grilled cheese were also super! I really love that they deliver, too. Good reubens and chicken caesar wraps. The wrap was stuffed so full I had to take the filling out and eat it as a salad. Good, because it was a generous portion; bad because I couldn&#39;t eat it as a wrap lol!
They also do a spectacular Monte Cristo Sandwich, which is a turkey, ham, and swiss on french toast."

Why? you ask. Because the place is so damn good!  Its located in the &#34;ghost town&#34; section of Arlington Hts where you are more likely to find tumbleweeds instead of good restaurants.  Great, prompt service, large portions of very good food.  They also have that totally awesome Greek lemon/egg soup on certain days. If you haven&#39;t tried it, you must. Entrees are large enough for two meals if you&#39;re a gal like me.  They give a carafe of ice water on the table, nice touch! I would seriously eat lunch here everyday if I won the lottery and if people didn&#39;t think I was a big weirdo who has nothing better to do but go to the same restaurant for lunch everyday.

Amazing Food
Great Coffee
Friendly Service
Spacious seating
Plentiful parking
Good prices

I like the fact that they use a thicker bread for their french toast.  I ordered the berry crunch french toast. Nice touch with the mascarpone cream and the coating is not overly crunchy. My only thing is that I wished they would of done more to the interior to look less like the former IHOP that was there before. While the colors have changed, the structural stuff of the IHOP are still used.  Overall great food and nice and fast service for a Sunday brunch :)"

The 1st time we went was a little after they had just opened. This experience was just so horrible. We were seated after a short wait. About 20 minutes of waiting for our waitress to come to our table, we ordered our food the minute she got to our table. I ordered their cream of chicken and rice soup and their breakfast combo, scrambled eggs, corned beef hash, hash browns and pancakes. My husband ordered eggs over easy with bacon, hash brown and English muffin. We both asked for our hash browns to be crispy and my corned beef hash also. I was served my soup fairly quickly which I was very pleased with. I really enjoyed the soup and that was the last thing I was going to enjoy. We waited and waited for the rest our food, but it would not come out. We finally waived our waitress down and asked how long it was going to be. She told us she would check and quickly went to the kitchen. She came back with a lousy excuse how the system was new and they&#39;re still figuring things out meanwhile everyone BUT us we&#39;re being served. Even the people that ordered after us. By the time we got our food, we had been waiting for an hour. No joke, an hour. I looked at my plate, everything looked so sloppy. It was like they just tossed everything onto the plate just to get it out of the kitchen. I&#39;m sorry, but if I waited this long then I would at least expect my food to come out as requested. Nope nope nope nope nope. We asked for crispy hash brown and corned beef hash and that&#39;s not what me nor my husband got. I mean the corned beef hash did look pretty good but it looked like it was put on heat for a short time then tossed on the plate and same goes for my hash brown. I told the waitress and she said that she would take it back. At this point, I&#39;ve had enough. If she did take it back who knows how long it would take for it to come back out. So I told her I&#39;ve waited enough and didn&#39;t want to wait anymore. She had to waive down the manager to tell him we didn&#39;t want the food anymore because of all that&#39;s happened. He did not apologize or show any signs of sympathy, all he said was okay, took our receipt and started walking to the front counter. We followed him to at least pay for the soup I ate, but he looked at us and all he said was we didn&#39;t have to pay and went about doing aother things so we just left.

We thought maybe it was just really bad experience because they were newly opened and nobody knew what they were doing. So we said, what the heck let&#39;s just give them another try. We were seated pretty quickly like last time. Our waitress came by after a little bit and we ordered right away. I ordered the same thing, soup and breakfast combo but with fresh fruit instead of hash brown. My husband ordered the golden brunch breakfast combo and asked for english muffin instead of pancakes. It seemed likes this time around was going to be a lot better. We got our food in a timely manner. But now here&#39;s the kicker, they sent me hash browns instead of fruits. I believe the same manager from last time came to our table and asked if everything was good as soon as we got our food so I told him that I asked for fruits instead of hash browns. He looked at me like I was crazy and asked, so you don&#39;t want the hash brown? I told him no and once again without any sort or apologizes, he took my plate to the kitchen. I told my husband that he was probably going to just scoop the hash brown off the plate and give it right back to me. Guess what? That&#39;s exactly what happened. Now, I know it&#39;s a hassle to redo a whole new plate because I didn&#39;t want the hash brown. I seen many places do it and I really don&#39;t care if they do it as long as they don&#39;t put it back on other people&#39;s plate. (I&#39;m not saying they do that, but I hope they don&#39;t.) Bring me potatoes instead of fruits is not a big deal, people make mistakes. What bugs me is not once did I hear anything in the lines of, hey look I&#39;m really sorry, I&#39;ll get that fixed for you. In the restaurant business, I feel like that&#39;s common courtesy. But hey, if that&#39;s how they want to run their business, go for it.

Now getting past all of that and onto their food. The corned beef hash was decent. They give you a little piece of bread with it which was stale. I was getting a strong taste of butter in both the corned beef hash and the eggs. I don&#39;t know if it was just my food or that&#39;s just how they do it, but it was a bit too much for my liking.

TL:DR
Their waiting staff and kitchen staff are completely disorganized. Went twice and both times my orders were wrong. There were also 3 other tables around us that had something wrong with their order. Food is mediocre. 
I will denfinitely never return to this place again.

The food was good and the service was great.  Other than that, nothing special at all.  I had the slim scramble which had chicken sausage, poblano peppers, and a trace amount of goat cheese.  I think for $9.50 it could have benefited from more cheese.  Portions are large.  My husband had french toast - four slices of bread which he said was good but he has had better.  Had we been 10 minutes earlier they had an early special for $6-$8 which is about $3/person savings from 6 to 9 on weekdays."

What a delight ! We were seated right away. The place was clean &amp; bright. Fairly crowded for that time on a Sunday morn, but no problem. Our order was taken right away &amp; our waiter did not refer to us as &#34;guys&#34; which we both think is very rude. The busing staff were very polite &amp; conscientious. Our food came surprisingly fast as crowded as the restaurant was &amp; was delicious ! The pancakes I got with my eggs were somehow slightly gooey in the very middle but nothing terrible. Prices were VERY reasonable.The crowd seemed to dissipate quickly &amp; tables were cleaned instantly for the church crowd that would soon be arriving. VERY clean fast &amp; efficient, &amp; as a previous restaurant manager before retiring, I feel qualified to judge. This is definitely our new favorite restaurant !"

My daughter found a bug in her soup and nobody bothered to apologize for it. On top of that I had to pay for the soup with a bug in it. Then as I was paying the woman at the register asked me how my experience was and I said horrible we found a bug in our food and half my table didn&#39;t eat because of it and her response was ok have a nice day.

Food:   Although the menu items didn&#39;t sound very exciting in their descriptions, they were both super delicious, fresh, and hot.  I had an artichoke omelet and my husband had a Mexican skillet.
Service:  Weird-o-rama!  We had four different people waiting on our table, and none of them had any coordination with the other, which left us with some insanely sub-par service.  Our waters were left un-refilled several times during the meal.  We had to ask for butter 3 times from two different people.  The first girl forgot, so we asked the second one who disappeared for a few minutes while we waited.  The first girl then reappeared without our butter and then ended up helping the second girl find some which took forever.  The worst part was that a manager was going from table to table asking how things were, but skipped ours for some reason.
We likely won&#39;t be going back since we can get equally delicious food AND good service down the street at Wildberry, Jelly Café, or Egg Harbor."

Much of the time a lot of these places will have the same mediocre house-made beers paired with salty/stale food, but The Ram in Schaumburg is different.

First off, when you walk in you&#39;re greeted by filled bourbon barrels, a clear indication that the brewers on premise are having a little bit of fun with the beer in house. Ram has ample seating, both in the bar area or in the dining room (i&#39;ve never had to wait, which is nice). The menu has a wide variety of options, ranging from ahi tuna poke nachos (which are to die for, by the way), to an array of gourmet looking burgers (faberge burger? yes please.), to mouth watering desserts such as their thyme creme brulee topped with fresh blueberries. 

Prices are reasonable and on-par with most other american sit-down restaurants, about $10-14 for a burger with side, and under $10 during lunch time with their lunch specials. Their ahi tuna melt and soup/salad lunch combo is my go to, and that tuna melt is one of the best i&#39;ve ever had!

Let&#39;s get to the beer though, ooohhhhhh the beer. While ram does have their staple beers of a variety of styles, they also aren&#39;t afraid to get crazy with seasonals and one-offs. Their staple beers ranging from ambers, to pale ales, to porters, are all very well executed examples of their styles. super textbook, nothing mind blowing, just GOOD beer. When they let their brewers have some fun though, they&#39;re able to produce some of the absolute best beer in Chicagoland. Shaun&#39;s imperial stout, &#34;Chaos Theory&#34; is one of the best stouts coming out of the midwest, as is his double IPA &#34;Juicy&#34;. Those usually don&#39;t last on the taps very long, and when bottles/cans are released to-go, they sell out in hours. A true testament to the creativity and talent of the guys behind the scenes brewing beer behind the bar.

My only complaint about ram, however, is that i don&#39;t live within walking distance. or stumbling distance, rather."

Disappointing service from the bar. Had a fly in my CLEAR vodka shot, returned it and the bartender didn&#39;t seem to be bothered by the fly (maybe it&#39;s a usual occurrence). My friend ordered a dirty martini but it seemed like all olive juice instead of a splash. My friend let the manager know the issues we were having, he also seemed unfazed by it. Again maybe this is just how they run the establishment. Our drinks were left empty for a long time, each time. We even started timing her to see how long it&#39;d take each time. (That&#39;s how bad it had gotten) 
Our new friend made a valid point, that they are so close to corporate hotels and get all the turn around. So obvious why they didn&#39;t seem to care even tho we were spending a good chunk of money. 
Anyway, if you just go for the food you&#39;ll be happy. Don&#39;t order the creme brûlée tho, the top was burnt and not hardened. Took one bite and left it. Tasted like syrup on too. Disappointing"

They have plenty of stools around the bar, tables set up around the bar area, and TVs all around. The bartender was really friendly and nice about me and my friend ordering mixed drinks that he had to blend. I read that bartenders hate having to do that especially when you go to a brewery where we should have just ordered one of their beers. He was cool about it and even joked around with us a bit.

There was just one thing that left a really bad taste in my mouth (pun intended) about this particular evening. My friend and I ordered the loaded waffle fries that comes with a side of sour cream. We were pouring the sour cream out onto our plates and about halfway, a cold fry came pouring out. I knew it wasn&#39;t from our plate since we had waffle fries and this was a stick cut fry or something resembling that. It kind of grossed me out and I kept wondering how a fry could have ended up in the sour cream. Do they reuse the sour cream or pour it back into a larger container??  I didn&#39;t want to think about it while I was there since we had already eaten most of it. I didn&#39;t get sick at all from it but just thinking back to it makes me feel a bit grossed out.

It won&#39;t stop me from going back to this Ram or other Ram locations but it definitely was a one-time bad experience."

First I would like to say, the restaurant set up is great.. Love the bar area.. Love that fact they brew their own beer..  I tried a lot of them and they where pretty good.. I settled for the Buttface Amber.. But I think the Chicago Blonde was good too.. The beer I had a problem with was the brown beer that was similar to guiness beer.. The bartender gave me a taste, but it was flat.. Meaning that the tap was not working properly.. I asked her, but she was like... Yeah that&#39;s how it&#39;s suppose to be.. I was like wow.. Really.. 

Then..... I ordered some food. I heard they where known for their macaroni and bacon balls.. So I tried it.. Wow, bro really.. They served it burnt and I opened it up and it was not cooked all the way, because the tiny piece of bacon was raw..  Holy 
sh!t, y&#39;all don&#39;t order that and if you order make sure you check your food.. 

So, then I told the bartender and she was like okay let me take it back, I saw her talking to her shift manager or supervisor, the bartender pointed at my direction.. They looked at me and they started laughing.  So, I was like okay maybe the manager will say sorry or something.. But nope, she kept on doing her thing and she walked away..  I was like wow.. Nice way to treat your customer..  

Second thing I want to say is... FU RAM Restaurant and Brewery... You should take those raw and burnt food and RAM them up your asses‼ What a waste of a great location..  I posted some pictures of what I ordered.. SMDH.."

I had not been there before, but we did not have an issue getting a table at the noon hour.

The lunch menu had plenty of options and I went with something that will end up having me return for more.  I&#39;m still thinking of the Havarti Turkey Melt.  Mmmmmmmm.

The serving size was perfect for lunch, although i would have wolfed down more if given the chance.  I had a salad with it for the infusion of some healthy option.  The sandwich was grilled to perfection, the turkey hot throughout and the cheese adding a bit of tang with its melty goodness.

The only downside was that it was a business meeting and so I had iced tea rather than a beer (of which the options are plentiful).

At least for lunch, it;s a place I would recommend.  I&#39;d also recommend that sandwich.  Finally, I&#39;d recommend going when it&#39;s not for business and have a beer!"

The bar staff were friendly, the flight (6 tasters) was only $6.00, and all the beers were delicious! I would recommend checking this out when in Chicagoland.

A friend and I stopped here after a long Ikea trip since we were too hungry to drive much farther. We spent way too long standing in the entryway of the mostly empty restaurant next to the unattended host stand, waiting for an employee to wander by. I was starting to think that we should just leave, and in retrospect, we probably should have.

The service was slow, slow, slow. We were told to choose a table, then waited for a server. And waited. And waited. We were about to go over to ask the bartender if we needed to order with her when a busboy finally came by and must have let a server know that we were waiting. We ordered everything right away because we were worried that we would never end up getting food if we let the waitress walk away.

Food was unexceptional. I had a very standard burger, which was okay. There was nothing wrong with it, but there was nothing to recommend it either. Just overall unremarkable."

The sauces were free so I got the pesto ailoi which was absolutely delicious. Also requested broccoli instead of fries and they were fine with it - so awesome! Our server was very nice, accommodating, and kept a smile on her face. The host on the other hand, not so much. What do hosts do there besides stand at the front, suggest you sit in the lounge, and then continue to stand there since I guess they don&#39;t need to seat you or give you menus if you choose the lounge.

I ordered the Mac and cheese with a side of Brussel sprouts. Each was good but I wouldn&#39;t call it great. Others enjoyed their food but not sure anyone was wow&#39;d. Our service was good, however our waitress was very chatty. She talked a lot at the table.

I&#39;ve been to this location once and the one in Wheeling a handful of times for work get togethers. Sure, their beer is good, but not good enough to make me go out of my way to come.

Food is just your run of the mill food - variety of options like sandwiches, salads, appetizers. I think the food is about $2-4 overpriced. Why am I paying 14 for this salad? I got some chicken with rice and green beans the other day for $14. Meh. I would only go for their happy hours which is from 3-6p - that&#39;s when it&#39;s worth the price!

The ambiance is nice, but besides everything I just mentioned, the service is always SLOW. I can&#39;t stand it. They are never that crowded, but the server always takes forever to take your food order. This goes for both locations. When I come during work hours, I can&#39;t waste 30 - 45 extra minutes, but I somehow do every time...."

This place is quite massive with extremely large TVs all around the bar.  A very cool brewpub type feel.  Lots of tables and bar space.  It was quite crowded when we got there, but we were able to find 4 seats together at the bar easily.  

They had 12 of their beers on tap that night.  The special that night was $3,99 pints and $4.99 mugs (24 ounces).  They had a few IPAs, a couple Pale Ales, a Blonde Ale, a German Wheat, an Amber Ale and a Gose.  I have always been a fan of Gose style and this one lived up to my expectations.  It was a nice, light, sour wheat.  Made pretty true to style guidelines.  I also had a Citra Hopped Imperial IPA.  It too was made true to style and it was really good. It is a full service bar, so if you are interested in booze or wine, they do have that as well.  

They have a pretty decent sized food menu with salads, sandwiches, burgers, appetizers and lots of bar type food.  You know, deep friend deliciousness.  The food was pretty good.  Not sure I would come here for food alone, but it was just fine while have a few brews after work.

The staff here was really nice.  More than willing to split the bills, divide up the bill between booze and food too.  

I would definitely come back here.  Decent food and some good beers.  They offer growlers if you were interested in taking beers to go.  If you are in the area and looking for some brews, give this place a try.  Though it is a chain, it is a good stop."

It looks good on the outside; parking lot packed, it was a Thursday night, it looked promising! When we got into the lobby-there was no host. We stood there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to sit us. What&#39;s really irking is that multiple staff members walked past us and we were ignored. Finally, someone came up to us and asked if we were helped and we said no. He asked if we wanted to sit in the lounge or dining room. I said the lounge because it looked really busy and fun! The game was on and it was a casual atmosphere. We again waited for 10 minutes for someone to come over and give us food menus. (However this was the lounge and it was a first come first serve basis) so I imagined it to be busy. But again, multiple servers walked past us and we were ignored. After 10 minutes of receiving no service we went back to be sat in the dining room. We at least wanted some service!!! We got sat at our table and the server said the guy would be over in a minute. We again, I kid you not, waited another 10 minutes. At least the server who sat us got us our drinks before the server for there, but it took him 10 minutes to get there. At last we ordered our food. 

The food is completely different from this experience. It came out hot and it was delicious, I highly recommend the ice cream cupcakes. The special Mac and cheese balls were really good too! 

However, the server was gone from that point. He was rushed and flustered and barely stopped by the table. The busboy was the person who came to our table and helped us out the most! We tipped him more than our actual server! 

I am a server, I know how restaurants work. The restaurant was not busy at all. The dining room had probably 7 tables filled. If management is trying to save money on labor and cut the host and most of the servers, at least have some staff on who will take care of all customers and the restaurant. The busboys were the best service of this place and our overall experience."

First, the attention to detail as far as patron (and staff) safety is concerned left much to be desired.  Two of the screws meant to secure the umbrella of the table open, fell onto to the table and the umbrella collapsed; luckily neither of us were injured.  The second safety concern I have with this restaurant is the women&#39;s restroom- the paper towels to dry your hands are not near the sinks and so there was lots of water on the floor.  

Safety concerns aside, we waited for more than 10 minutes for anyone to come take our drink or food order while we were sitting at the bar (after moving inside after the umbrella issue) and the restaurant was not even 1/3 full.  The boneless buffalo wings were overcooked and therefore far too crunchy.  We ultimately left before finishing our appetizer and beers.  

With so many places in the area that serve craft beer with great food and an enjoyable atmosphere, I would recommend looking elsewhere."

Our server was attentive, accurate, and very friendly. Seating was private and comfortable. The food was delivered promptly. 

Two of us had the fish and chips and the portions were large. However, it was bland and boring. The coleslaw was odd, no one could guess what was in it other than cabbage. One of us had a sirloin steak and for the price it was small, but cooked to the right temp. The flavor was bland, but acceptable. The fries were barely warm. One of us had a Cobb salad and it was disappointing. The chicken was overlooked and was dry and hard. The avocado, egg, bacon, were in tiny pieces and hard to see or taste. The dressing overpowered the salad&#39;s flavor and wilted the lettuce. 

I wish I had ordered a burger."

The restaurant portion was closed but the bar was open and had half price apps after 9. The buffalo waffle fries were pretty good, but make sure you ask for extra sauce. They brew their own beer and we didn&#39;t know what to get so we tried their beer flight of six, three oz pours of the home made stuff for only $6. We were told pints were half off for happy hour, so we had a few of those and I highly recommend the Heffewissen and the Pale. If you like the taste of grapefruit, the IPA is pretty good too. We later found out that beers were not half off on the late night happy hour, but only the 3-6PM happy hour. Burgers are huge, and you can go with regular, turkey, chicken or veggie. Fabrege burger was awesome."

His response was you will just have to order more Martinis..

They had a nice variety of self-brewed beers.  Personally, I enjoyed their porter.

The burger was average...like I said, not bad.

To me, this would be a solid place to chill and relax.  They had one side being more &#34;sport-ish&#34; reminding me of buffalo wild wings while the other was more dining-ish.  Very spacious and open within.

I decided to take the chance, and I&#39;m glad I did! I had just come from shopping at Ikea and thought a brewery would hit the spot. The parking lot seemed PACKED for 9pm, walked in and man this place is huge!

Sat down at a bar top, which was open seating, and waited a few minutes (just a little too long) for our waitress (who ended up being GREAT!) Saw they had happy hour deals (YESS!). Ordered the Buffalo Ranch Fries (or whatever it was). The menu didn&#39;t say onions, but the food came sprinkled with green onions. That wasn&#39;t going to fly for us, and the waitress kindly understood without any questions, brought them back, apologized for the issue, and about 5/10 minutes later we had a fresh order, and MAN are these things good! Ordered two of the brewery&#39;s beers, which were decent as well! A surprise, really.

I ordered a burger that came with fries and was really good, but with the massive beer I had, and buffalo waffle fries, I was almost full. I ate half the burger, washed it down with the rest of my massive 24oz beer (which was cheap for craft beer!!) and haven&#39;t looked back.

Decor:
This is a pretty cool looking place.  It has a huge curved barbell on one side of the restaurant, specifically on the right when you walk through the door.  There are scores of huge televisions whi v is great for all the sports junkies out there.  A good feel overall and very clean.  

Service:
I&#39;ve never had a problem with the service. The wait staff has been very curteous and kind.  They answered all my questions and checked up on us consistently. Extremely friendly people. 

Food:
The food was pretty good. Nothing out of extraordinary.  Usually I either get a regular burger with chips or a chicken wrap with their home made chips.  They have HUGE selection of beers and of course you gusset it they brew their own beer since they&#39;re also also brewery. Overall good food but nothing to boast about.

Price:
I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty reasonable for what you get.  It&#39;s probably close to Cheesecake Factory in terms of price with slightly less quantity.   

Overall experience:
I&#39;d come here with friends next time and just relax.  Definitely a recommended place to come to for the experience."

In fact, most of the time our experiences have been outstanding. This time was the exception.

The service which is typically quite good was fair at best. I&#39;m not sure our server had too many tables or she was just not a great server. We could never find her when we needed her and she was not attentive.

Even the food was not up to par. I started with their chili which was fairly tasteless. For dinner I was very eager to try their sandwich the &#34;Notorious P.I.G.&#34; The sandwich is large - pulled pork with pickled onions on a baguette. For my side, I was boring at opted for french fries. The sandwich had soggy bread, the and pork was sweet tasting (not what I expected). The fries must have sat out for a while before served as they were soft and only warm.

I was very disappointed in RAM this time. I would not update my prior review (which was spectacular) except I want to give them another chance."

I knew the first time I stepped into the place that I would have to try every beer on tap. After attempting the task at hand I moved onto their food each night I was there. I started with the grilled New York which was what you&#39;d expect a nice steak good sides next the grilled sirloin. By this time I got to know the staff and moved onto appetizers like armadillo eggs and the fried calamari. Next I was introduced to the ram grand Ruben 505. It was so good I ordered it the next day for lunch. Next I tried to conquer the salads after steaks and sandwiches weighed me down. Highly recommend the tossed Cobb salad with the grilled chicken fantastic. Happy to say I was able to try all the beers on tap and even mixed some of the beers together to make new flavors. The menu however was too vast for me to conquer till next trip.

We didn&#39;t eat any of their food by we saw a lot of it go by us and it looked really good.bi would definitely come back if i was in the area again! 
One negative thing was that they did ask my group of 4 to move table because they were having a large party come in and we were sitting at a large table.

It&#39;s seat your self and i found the waitstaff to be more knowledgeable then expected about beer products and brewing. The food is standard pub fare adequately prepared and we didn&#39;t have to wait too long for anything. 
This is a corporate brew pub which has been optimized for fast and mass production lines. In concept and execution it is very similar to granite city. The beer is brewed using the wet wort system, which means it isn&#39;t entirely brewed on site. In my personal opinion both the beer and the food was average, but  the beer has won tons of awards and  the brewers take great pride in their work. 
Luckily this place is worth going back to in order for me to see if  my avereage experience it was just beginners luck.
There was nothing wrong with the food or the beer. Four stars instead of three due to the waitress&#39;es superior knowledge of beer brewing and products."

We spent well over $200 and it will never happen again because of this manager. Also, they weren&#39;t clearing anything off the table, we literally had to ask them to remove empty plates and cups in order to put things on the table.

So many steak salads are predictable; this one was not. The roasted garlic mushrooms, edamame, and brussel sprouts made for a surprising and tasty combination.

The atmosphere and the beer was the best part. Everything else was really lacking. 

The atmosphere is darker with a lounge and a dining area, and it was decorated for the holidays. I decided the dining area would be a good fit. It wasn&#39;t too crowded, the music was at the right level, and there were plenty of TVs playing the Blackhawks game.

I tried the 2 seasonal beers they had, but I ended up getting the Chicago Blonde. I thought it was very good, and it was on special (only $2.99!). I&#39;ve tried their other beers before and they were decent too.

As far as service goes...it was disappointing. I was standing at the front for a while before someone came to help me. Some employees just walked by, even though I was standing at the desk. Once I was seated, it took a while for the server to arrive, and she wasn&#39;t very attentive the rest of the evening. She was very nice, but it wasn&#39;t all that busy so I don&#39;t know why everything took so long.

The food...bleh. Their burgers are decent, but I wanted to get something else so I tried the Whiskey Chicken. Basically it was a really small, thin chicken breast that was covered in mushrooms and a cream sauce (didn&#39;t taste like whisky at all). Had it not been in the sauce, I think it would have been dry. The cheddar potatoes were not flavorful at all (didn&#39;t even realize you could mess those up), and the veggies seemed like they were from a frozen bag. Pretty disappointing. 

Of all the places in the area, this is one of my least favorites."

It was super thin too, about 1/4 inch. I asked the server if I could order another piece of fish and basically had to order a second entree. I wasn&#39;t about to pay $32 for two thin pieces of fish that probably still wouldn&#39;t fill me up so I declined. So disappointing paying $20 for a meal and leaving hungry."

It was not quite big enough to share for two, at least not compared to most of the other restaurants we go to but it was good. I decided to go with their Rebuen sandwich. It was OK, considering this was in the Chicago area where you always hear about all the awesome beef sandwiches I had expected a lot more. It was definitely OK, I guess I should have gone with their burgers or asked what their speciality is.

The one thing that stood out was the waiter, unfortunately I can&#39;t remember his name. We were waiting on a couple of other people of our party to join but were late but he checked with us and made sure our kid got something to nibble on so our night wouldn&#39;t become stressful and have to endure some whining. He was on top of everything, he made sure we always had what we needed, that we always got refills in time and was fun and sociable. The kid&#39;s meal also came with an optional free dessert and he did an awesome job of checking with us if we wanted it without letting our kid in on it in case we for whatever reason didn&#39;t want him lot&#39;s of sugar close to his bed time, go figure!

The waiter made the experience a 4 but the food just wasn&#39;t all that great, but the others in the party really enjoyed theirs so I figure I just picked something they don&#39;t make very good at this location. I&#39;ve been eating out quite a bit the last six months and this place had the best server I&#39;ve had by far. He should be a waiter at a high end restaurant!"

We had a larger sized group (about 16 people) and while I thought it was going to be a good experience given the place was basically empty on this Wednesday night-it seems this place has a lot of &#34;rules&#34; and they were willing to leave money on the table to follow them.

Case in point- we sat out on the patio- with one server assigned to us.  She was clearly overwhelmed and the staff inside really wasn&#39;t helping her much as she was bringing the drinks out in two&#39;s.  This meant that by the time she got a round of drinks to the table, those served first were ready for a drink again.  Not particularly efficient.

And then there&#39;s that &#34;leaving money on the table issue&#34;.  It was 5:15 and we were given two menus- the happy hour menu and the main menu.  Many in our group wanted sliders so we ordered 15 orders of 2.  The server came back and said they couldn&#39;t do sliders as that menu ended at 5pm.  Really?  You are willing to give up $75 in food sales for 15 minutes?  You must have way too much business RAM. And if you didn&#39;t want us to order off the happy hour menu . . .don&#39;t give us one!

So we kept with our other appetizer order and that food was okay (typical bar food) but not without all of us talking about &#34;rules&#34; and how some really should be bent to take care of a customer need.  I get that they probably wanted all of us to order a full sized dinner- but we were there for snacks.

Given it&#39;s in the burbs, there is plenty of free parking.

Too bad for the service failure as I was the one who recommended this place based on my experiences at the other location as they can usually handle large sized groups quite well.  Oh well- live and learn."

The steaks ordered at our table were overlooked, a beer was served warm, and a drink served with random garnishes. Then, asking to split the check took over an hour and was still incorrect. When the new waitress took our credit cards she vanished for over a half an hour, made coffee, served other tables, etc. with all of our credit cards somewhere in the kitchen area. One of the receipts was for the wrong table and 10 times the amount of our bill so hopefully the amount charged to our cards is correct. There is no reason closing out a tab should be a 1.5 hour experience no matter how new the server is."

After waiting for what seemed like forever for a hostess, we finally got seated at the table. The waiter seemed very nice, took our order and after that things just kept getting worse. My plate had some yellow crusty substance stuck to it and the appetizer was extremely dry, we only nibbled on it a little bit as it was hard to swallow. For a main course I ordered a burger and asked for it to be well done. As I took my first bite I tasted something funny. To my surprise, the meat was red inside. That was the end of the dinner for me. I Left the place with a bad taste in my mouth. The story doesn&#39;t end there, I woke up in a middle of the night with a terrible stomach ache and spent most of the night in a bathroom. One of the worst experiences ever."

This was a first for me at Ram. I updated my review from three to four stars due to a new appreciation. 

From the first visit, I missed two major factors that make Ram awesome - the beer infused items and overall value. After the second and third visit, I made it a point to try the unique beer infused items. Out of the selection, the Amber Ale Chicken sandwich was the star. It&#39;s a big and juicy beer marinated chicken breast topped with coleslaw, fried onion rings, chipotle mayo, and BBQ sauce - an excellent combination of flavors and textures. At my most recent visit, it was hard not to get it again. It&#39;s that good and I definitely recommend it. The prices were reasonable and we received awesome service. When was the last time your server genuinely smiled and was on top of everything?

For the overall value, it&#39;s no wonder this place is packed whether it&#39;s to watch the game, a dinner hangout, or for some all American classics. Award winning beer and beer infused entrées, need I say more? Thank goodness it&#39;s Ram[sday]."

My personal favorite is Calamari strips. Those are lightly breaded and fried. Tender and tasty. The only thing was only 20 strips cost $10.

Another thing I liked was their skinny drinks menu. Lemon drops was great. Mango Mojoto was even better. 

Our waitress was great who was checking on us constantly to make sure no glass is empty. She has done a great job.

Been here twice recently, both times in the bar. Why? 
1) Because it is a convenient go to spot for after hours in the north shore 
2) I have not found a better place yet
I really do not dig the chainess overall and would much rather find a good third place spot but until I do, the ram is there. 
Overall my experience is that service in the bar exists, but is lackluster at best. Kind of like dating someone with no personality, it doesn&#39;t last long. 
On one outing after wrapping up a class term, a group of us went out for a drink, Ram was one of the few options that time of night (10:30-ish), and even so, the ram was dead, and pretty much chased us out after a round; and the service was more tolerable than inviting.

Another outing with my honey, same deal. Felt trapped at the Ram (not for lack of trying other nearby venues, no less than two, both a bust - see other reviews) it served the purpose but lackluster service in the bar. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am not looking for a new friend but a little bit of personality goes a long way. 

I am also finding the beer despite the brew to be all the same to me. I tried the new BAP last night. Supposed to be the disorder porter aged in flask. The beer was fine. What wasn&#39;t fine? A pet peeve of mine. They served the BAP in what I call a baby glass (see my review of Tilted Kilt for reference) but charged the same price. I hate that. If you are going to give me less, charge me less. 
I asked if they served it in a baby glass because it had higher alcohol content, no was the answer, but more due to the fact that their is limited supply of it because it takes so long to make. Supply and demand put into effect I guess, but they are assuming demand. I gave the beer to my wife, who happens to like baby glasses and enjoyed the beer too, so it was a win win for her.
Perhaps it is me, but the ram and I are on the rocks :-("

It&#39;s basically (ok, it is) a sports bar, but the food is very good for bar fare. Beer can be hit or miss but overall is pretty good...nothing life changing but decent for a suburban brewery and much better than any macrobrew. Cocktails, again, are hit or miss--their sangria is tasty but the worst margarita of my life was had here.

Pricing is average to high--most items are fair but some are just confusingly expensive (salads in particular).

Tip: avoid during Hawks/Bulls/Bears games, especially post season--or at least be prepared for a zoo, parking wise."

Alas, I&#39;m torn between a 3 and 4 star, but I guess I&#39;ll round up. 

I had a Turkey Havarti Melt and the waffle fries - the sandwich was good, but the fries were really dry (I know that sounds weird to say about fries).  My +1 got the Bacon Cheddar Burger; he said the burger itself was OK, but said he really wasn&#39;t a fan of the bacon.  I&#39;m not sure why - I also had bacon on mine.

The prices and quality of the food are really nothing to write home about so I&#39;m kind of confused regarding their success. I am really happy with the atmosphere in the bar area, but there is nothing that I (nor people I was with) were particularly impressed with.

I&#39;ve been here multiple times in the past and most recently ordered a burrito bowl and managed to get a salad instead.

No seriously, there are several other Chipotle&#39;s in the area, and they are stingy, rude, and a waste of your precious time and money!

Chipotle&#39;s are everywhere these days, but this one here....Someone is doin&#39; somethin&#39; RIGHT!  It&#39;s always good, the staff is most of the time kind &amp; friendly (unlike the one at the corner of Roselle Rd. &amp; Gold Rd... but we&#39;re not here to talk about their crappiness...but in comparing it to this location... this is worth the extra few blocks to head here @ SOW for Chipotle perfection).

The tortillas are warm and moist (not like other places that have been dry, crappy, and falling apart), and the staff serves you with a smile.

If you&#39;re a Chipotle virgin, it&#39;s easy to catch on, and a new take on &#34;fast food&#34;.  You approach the starting point and decide if you want your goodness wrapped up in a warm tortilla (or in some beefy cases double wrapped), or if you want to go with the burrito bowl option, or 3 tiny tacos.  I don&#39;t know much for the taco choice, I have seen others in my party make that choice, but it just seems like you get way less food, and meh, not my style.  I usually get a burrito bowl, with a to-go lid option incase I can&#39;t finish the whole thing in the restaurant...which is the majority of the time, as the portions are massive...massively delicious!  My husband always gets a double wrapped tortilla, because it is usually a huge burrito baby.  

After choosing your food holder, you get your pick of:
-Rice: white or brown ,
-Beans: Pinto or Black
-Grilled Veggie mix of onions + peppers sauteed together (can&#39;t get them separate, unless you ask for them to tediously pick out which pieces you do/don&#39;t want...but I&#39;ve never seen that done... I would like to have just the onions, as my tummy is sensitive to peppers, so I wish they were separated, but they aren&#39;t so i avoid this step altogether because usually it is hella busy &amp; basically always a steady stream of hungry hungry customers, so speed is essential as patron and burrito crafter)
-Meat: Spicy Barbacoa (steak), Medium-Spicy Chicken, and pulled apart pork (least spicy), and maybe another option, not sure, and they may or may not have/are introducing a tofu option?  But for vegetarian options, you can choose to go meatless, and get guacamole at NO EXTRA CHARGE, when if you DO get meat, adding guac is like 1.80 extra... I think... Not exactly sure, as the hubbs &amp; I have been trying to severely minimize our animal products so we always get guac in place of a meat, and don&#39;t get charged extra for it anymore.
-Salsa choices...spicy, and medium? Not sure, I don&#39;t get the liquidy salsa, I just move on to the tomato mixture, and the corn mix...
-Sour Cream (when I used to get it, before going Vegan-ish, I would get the sour cream and it would always be... kind of rauncy, and tummy pain, it was tangy and not good, sketchy...
-Cheese: shredded
-Chopped Romaine lettuce
-and guac... FOR EXTRA! They will always ask you, &#34;the guacamole is extra, is that ok?&#34; **Unless you did NOT get any meat, then guac is NOT extra**

Then you&#39;re done assembling your mexican grill creation before your very eyes!  You can then choose the ever popular Chips + Guac side dish, and they have a fridge behind the cashier with a variety of juices, Horizon Milk boxes, Coronas, and possibly margaritas, but I think that&#39;s new...and the different variety of soda dispension and lemonade.

There is ample seating inside, as well as outiside, great for people watching ;)

I&#39;m not supposed to drink because my liver is in bad shape. I drank too much one night and tried to ride my friend like a kangaroo. I didn&#39;t want them to know I was drunk so I blamed my gluten allergy. I used to play baseball but allergies ruined that too. I used to leave practice and cry in the mirror. I&#39;d punish myself by force-feeding brusell sprouts. One time I rode on an airplane. I, met a lady in Africa on the internet and I flew there so we could have sex. She probably had a nice chest.

With that said....this location isn&#39;t one of the best.
On my recent trip,  I&#39;m pretty sure i wasn&#39;t whispering, I had to repeat my order at least 3 times to the lady in the front.  The food was yummy but it&#39;s always a hit or miss with this one. 

Their portion size seems to be getting smaller and their price higher. But because of my addiction I always return...."

I was down on Chipotle for a while b/c it&#39;s not authentic Latin food, but I came down from my pedestal and admit now that there is a place for &#34;Americanized&#34; Latin food.   They also serve beer, which is an automatic star, in my book.  

I tried the steak tacos last time and thought they tasted pretty good.  One request is that I wish they would offer corn tortillas."

Parking at Streets of Woodfield is ridiculous any time of day, so don&#39;t even try to look for a close spot.  You&#39;ll need to park out near the frontage road.

I dont like it how they leave out the ingredients of the burritos out.  Why do they charge extra for guacamole and sour cream?  Jeez.

I&#39;ve been here two times. The first time, I settled in with my sub par tacos. I order very specifically, I basically just want &#34;a little bit&#34; of everything and I except my hot items to be piping hot and my cold ingredients to be cool. I don&#39;t need the whole jar of sour cream, just &#34;a little&#34; will do, so when I use those words while ordering, especially as you do it, and then you glob on so much sour cream that I know it will be the only thing I taste in every bite, I&#39;m going to have a problem. This time, I knew the girl on the line was new and I took my tacos, sat and ate, all while being mildly pissed off.

So again, like most other Chipotle go-ers, even if you are unsatisfied when you go that one time, you know that the craving is going to come right back and you&#39;re going to find yourself back within those walls. So I went back here again a few weeks later (we don&#39;t live around here, going to this location twice in a short period of time was some sort of fluke).

Here&#39;s my opinion, if you&#39;re going to be working on the Streets of Woodfield, you need to be the best of the best because you&#39;re going to be BUSY.

So I went back and I got my tacos, as I ordered, with just &#34;a little bit&#34; of everything. I saw that they lumped on a ton of sour cream. I got my tacos, again, went back to my table, but this time, I did something about it. I took one bite and my counterpart saw me fill with some sort of rage. As we were seated outside, a line of expletives flew from my mouth and I grabbed my tacos and marched back inside for a re-do. I basically just stood at the front of the line and I was like &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but these need to be redone&#34;. The thing is, is that I feel bad doing things like this. I feel bad marching up to the line and barking orders at you while telling you your product it sub par, but you know what, at the end of the day, I work hard for my money and I&#39;m not going to let $10 of it go to a bad product. NOT anymore. I hope I never have to go to this Chipotle again. I hope I never have to go to Schaumburg again."

To limit my carb intake I go with the burrito bowl with little rice, black beans, tons of lettuce on the bottom, steak, medium and mild sauce, little sour cream and cheese.  

This way im getting a good % of protein/carbs full of fiber/fat.  Each chipotle I go to has always prepared my burrito bowl the way I want it therefore 5/5 stars!  Lines go fast as well!"

For some reason, the burrito bowl tastes a bit better than Qdoba&#39;s, but it&#39;s pretty much similar.  I give it an extra star for carrying Tabasco products.

Like I said about Qdoba - I just do not dig massive amounts of rice in burritos.  Put refried beans in there or something.  Rice makes it bland."

After seeing Cup &amp; Vine close a few months back I semi-stalked their social channels to see when this new coffee shop incarnation was opening. Finally in mid-June we have a local coffee shop in the &#39;burg, again. There are only a few of local coffee houses in Schaumburg, so I&#39;m happy to report that it seems like Wally&#39;s is off to a solid start. 

The inside is modern and updated with a few new touches throughout like a more established &#34;cooking&#34; area next to the coffee bar. The menu itself is more built out too, with a deeper set of options for breakfast and lunch (think breakfast sandwiches with real eggs instead of heated patties, freshly made salads and other build your own sandwiches). They also have a smattering of pretty baked goods near the front. 

Coffee prices seemed on par with Starbucks I enjoyed my almond latte and breakfast goodies. Both my sandwich and my husband&#39;s were good but nothing spectacular. I appreciate the bagel as a bread option to add some flavor to their breakfast game. Maybe having some hotsauce or spreads to add to a build your own sandwich would up their game?

Regardless, I know I&#39;ll frequent Wally&#39;s in the future for a quiet work space or to grab a tasty Tugboat coffee."

I&#39;d been waiting for Wally&#39;s to open and finally saw that it was open for business yesterday.  Imagine my delight to find they still have beans from Tugboat!  The coffee is wonderful. 

I gave the interior a cursory look.  It is much brighter than a typical coffee house.  For a vision - challenged person like myself (I need a lot of light to see well) this is a very good thing. 

At least right now the hours of operation are limited.  They are not open in the evening. If you are looking for a place for coffee in the evening after a visit to the library you will have to go elsewhere.  But I&#39;ll bet that most revenue is in the till before noon so this might just be good business sense. 

In any case, I&#39;m thrilled to have such great coffee a short walk from home."
