Pizza Hut it is!

$7.99 large pizza 2 toppings ONLINE ONLY special offer! Placed our order and 20 minutes later we had dinner. 

It was fine. It&#39;s Pizza Hut. It hasn&#39;t changed in years. The flavors are all the same and the &#34;sausage&#34; consistency is also the same. If you have high expectations coming here, go somewhere else. It&#39;s Pizza Hut. Be realistic as to what you anticipate your meal being."

Now I place my order online and it days ready at 7:56p. It is now 8:15p and I&#39;m told there was a &#34;set back&#34; and that my order is just now being put in the oven. So now i have to sit in my car for 10 to 15 minutes to wait for my order to be cooked. There is a line in there as I sit in the parking lot typing this review. Its bad enough you wont deliver.

When I order the P&#39;Zone, I like to stuff mine with fresh Spinach. They don&#39;t have the ingredient so I add it at home.

I thought I&#39;d try something new today by asking for more pepperoni. This is turning out to be a bad idea. I&#39;m starting to have consequences. I&#39;m figuring out that too much pepperoni gives me heartburn.

I like their Breadsticks. I don&#39;t like theirs with cheese.

I would like to try their Hershey&#39;s Chocolate Dunkers and Cinnamon Sticks some time.  

The best part is, everything I mentioned is $5 each! The food is ready fast for a quick pick up or delivery. 

The downside is, I don&#39;t think one container of marinara sauce is enough. It&#39;s good  for one half of my P&#39;Zone. I&#39;m forced to pay extra for another container if I want some for the other half. Same goes for the breadsticks. Will it be that way with the chocolate sauce for the Hersey Dunkers?

Gyro plate as pictured was pathetic. 5 good pieces of Gyro?? The tzaiziki sauce was dismal at best. Wings were very salty and almost inedible. But the kicker was the spicy chicken sandwich. It was absolutely horrendous. It was so salt filled that I couldn&#39;t choke it down. 

Because of how horrendous it was, I had to call them and let them know. Once I called and spoke with the manager Billy, all he gave me was an OK and that he would talk to the chef. Hardly an apology which makes me even more pissed that I gave them a dime of my hard earned money.

My team ordered lunch from here for our team lunch last Friday. I got the California Chicken Panini. The size of it was average, good enough for lunch but not big enough to have half for lunch &amp; and a leftover half for dinner (see my review on nearby Dario&#39;s). It tasted ok but not particularly overwhelming for me. The chicken was bland, their &#34;signature&#34; spinach &amp; artichoke sauce wasn&#39;t a flavorful as I had anticipated from their menu explanation and the bacon wasn&#39;t crispy enough to make a difference so all I tasted in most bites was the avocado and tomato.

As far as service, it&#39;s hard for me to rate that since I wasn&#39;t physically in here. However, my 2 coworkers who picked up the order were very dissatisfied. 1 of my coworkers called in the 12 orders (7 of which were just Paninis) at 10am. They went to get it at 1145 and basically nothing was ready so they wasted and extra 20 minutes waiting on the order which made its late taking lunch.

I had a cheese dog and fries. The crinkle cut fries were okay, mediocre in my opinion with nothing special to them. The hot dog itself was good! I love me a good Vienna Beef sausage! But the cheese was globbed onto the dog in the middle which seemed a bit odd to me. So I had to use my fries to kind of spread it evenly out.

My biggest problem with this place is you wait forever for everything. I figured I could get around this by calling in an order. It was a decent size order so they said it would be between 10-20 minutes. I show up and wait another 20 minutes before the food was ready. Now if there were 10 people ahead of me and the place was full of people dining in then fine. It makes sense. There were 2 people waiting ahead of me and nobody showed up while I was waiting. So they obviously weren&#39;t that busy. 

Make sure to check your order if you call in. I&#39;m referring to your receipt. I got ripped of by $6 on my last order (that I again called on and had to wait for). I was told one total over the phone and another when I picked it up.

I guess one would categorize it as &#34;fast casual&#34;. It has one of the most extensive menu of any such restaurant of which I&#39;m aware. In addition to the expected burgers, hot dogs and fries, they feature numerous salads, panini sandwiches, wraps, pasta and more.

I sampled a double patty melt, fries, onion rings and what they call cream of chicken rice soup.

The patty melt was different and not really to my liking. The bread was marbled rye and it appeared they utilized some kind of unusual, almost lemon like seasoning in the toasting process. In addition they added pickles and ketchup without asking me. These aren&#39;t standard items on a typical patty melt. The onions appeared to be carmelized and were quite sweet. I prefer your standard grilled onions that have more &#34;bite&#34;. There are probably others that would enjoy this sandwich more than I, but it wasn&#39;t bad.

The soup was a big disappointment;watery and containing little chicken or rice. The fries and onion rings were decent, not outstanding. With more and more places opting for the fresh cut skin on style of french fries, these crinkle cuts are fast becoming an anachronism.

To their credit everything tasted fresh and made to order and the service was friendly and efficient. The interior is pleasing to the eye, but the dine in area is small and rather cramped. If they&#39;re crowded you may find yourself nearly in the lap of a fellow diner."

Overall, it was a pleasant dinner experience for a reasonable price and we would dine here again.

FOOD
Overall food was good and reasonable value.  Salads were a good size.  Hot dogs were good and on poppy seed buns.  Cheeseburger was fantastic (except the pickles - see SERVICE below).  I grew up in Chicago and was raised on Italian Beef so I am a bit of a snob on the Italian Beef (e.g., I won&#39;t eat Vienna Italian Beef - not worth it).  The Italian Beef recipe is their own and had a nice flavor.  I prefer a bit more spice (not heat), but I would definitely get the Italian Beef here again.  

SERVICE
There as only one thing wrong with the order.  We specified no pickles on the burgers and while they repeated the order back to us, it came with pickles.  Not a big deal unless you absolutely detest pickles and the picking them off still leaves the pickle flavor.

Service time was very good. We went on a Tuesday night in June around 7:00 pm. Ordered dinner for 6 and it took about 6 minutes."

You walk up and order at the counter, but there is room to sit (although it is a bit cramped with two ill positioned round tables that are between the booths).

The food was just ok.  My husband&#39;s hot dog and fries were fine. I liked my Vegetarian panini enough, although I did find the veggies used weird.  When I asked what kind of veggies were in the sandwich, the response I got was, &#34;Oh, lots of them.&#34; He then asked if I wanted avocado - which I agreed to. So how weird could it be?   Well, there were some boiled carrots, cauliflower, zucchini, spinach,  tomato, avocado, cheese  and their spinach artichoke spread.      I could have done without the mushy carrots, cauliflower and tomato - but the rest was good.  

But why was I charged $1.25 extra for avocado when avocado was listed in the description of the sandwich?   I noticed after I paid - so I wasn&#39;t going to make a big deal, but those little things irk me.

The matzoball soup was a bit salty while the cream of chicken soup was a bit thick and could have used some extra vegetables for flavor. The cheesy beef seem to be seasoned too heavily on the beef, the burger was pretty good, gyros were fine, and farfalle pasta seemed to be a bit on the salty side as well.

The panini was nice and cheese - with a whole flat chicken breast and avocados/   And the onion rings were possibly some of the best I have ever had. Nice crunchy breading.

It&#39;s so close to my Sister&#39;s house. I call ahead for take out on almost every occasion I&#39;m in the area to babysit her kids. It&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t have food in the house, there&#39;s just nothing for me to eat in her fridge. 

There are so many choices, I haven&#39;t had to order the same thing twice. Tonight, I ordered their Char-Grilled Pizza Burger. For $3.99, it&#39;s a 1/4 LB of beef with melted mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. Fries are not included so I ordered small fries for $1.39. They gave me marinara sauce to dip the fries in at no additional charge. 

The service is always excellent and the food never disappoints. If I get there before my food is ready, I don&#39;t mind. Billy is a sports fanatic. There are sports memorabilia and a TV tuned in on game highlights. He is a huge Chicago Bears fan. The walls are painted in their team color Orange!"

But what the place had in character it somewhat lacked in food.

I ordered the hot dog and fries, because I have to, and it was extremely... dull. The bun was a little too bready and it somewhat overwhelmed the thin dog and its paltry toppings: some vegetables sprinkled on and a pickle that took up little more than half the length of the wiener. All told, it was an unimpressive offering, and the fries fell short of spectacular as well.

It seems like a well-run, decent place for a lunch, but those on a hot dog pilgrimage can skip it."

Took my nephew there for lunch a couple weeks ago when he was in town visiting since he craves a good Chicago dog and I need healthier options.  Billy&#39;s delivers on both accounts!  Salad was filled with wonderful fresh greens and veggies and their spicy chicken sandwich was also excellent (that fresh touch of cilantro on top was outstanding)  My nephew thought it was definitely one of the best Chicago dogs in the area especially since it came on a poppy seed bun which several local places no longer do and then it&#39;s not a real Chicago dog.   Even their pickles were awesome.  Nephew was enticed to try a banana-strawberry milkshake and felt it was well worth the calorie indulgence.

My wife had the sesame chicken. It was so soft, I could almost call it liquid. She said her fried rice was nothing more than white rice with some soy sauce cooked together. 

I will never make this mistake again. For all the positive reviewers out there, all I can say is you are literally insane or must be eating this food while blackout drunk.

It really isn&#39;t all that bad. My parents have been ordering here since I was little. My dad will not eat at any other Asian restaurant. 

First off, the interior is not fancy in the slightest. They are obviously aiming to be a take out restaurant. After all, that is what it says on their menu! You can dine in if you would like but it&#39;s totally not geared toward that. There are only a few booths and tables. I have occasionally seen people eat in but not often. When you go to the counter you can see them making the food and it does look pretty clean. It&#39;s been the same men working there since I can remember. They are very nice and work hard to get your food to you fast. It&#39;s affordable and comparable in price to most Chinese takeout restaurants. 

The food here can be kind of tricky. I&#39;ve had dishes I didn&#39;t care for and some I love. What I really like about this restaurant is that they have some uniqueness to their food. I absolutely love their egg rolls. They aren&#39;t those tiny ones you usually see. I sometimes cut them in half because they are so big. What really gets me is the sweet taste to them. I think they may have some kind of peanut sauce in them. We also usually order the crab rangoons. What&#39;s unique about them in the absence of cream cheese. They may use a tiny bit. It&#39;s mostly crab (I assume imitation). My mom loves them so much. She hates cream cheese. I am not sure what it&#39;s called but we used to always order plain chicken. It was battered, fried, and very good. We were picky eaters as children so this was great. The fried rice is also pretty decent. 

I would like to bump this place up to 5 stars but I have had some dishes I didn&#39;t really care for. Pretty much any of the main stream Chinese food wasn&#39;t that great. I wish they would just take them off the menu. That&#39;s what Panda Express is for! I am going to ask for suggestions next time I order. I recommend giving this place a chance. They have some great stuff you don&#39;t want to miss out on."

Thing is I L O V E Chinese food, and a great Chinese place is hard to find.  And this isn&#39;t it.  The food was barely average, I&#39;d never go here again.    For instance; the egg rolls (which at first I thought were huge) were actually just not wrapped tight, and bland but OK once dipped in S&amp;S sauce.  The Chicken fried rice was ok covered in S&amp;S sauce, but without it tasted like it was fried up in soy sauce alone.  My husband didn&#39;t like their egg foo young either, said it was terribly bland.  My favorite dish is Mongolian Beef, which was spicy good, but the gravy was just ok.
  
Oh yeah, and the crab rangoon... they were all over done/burnt :(

It was both of our first visits so we order plenty of food and kept the drinks to a minimum. The smokehouse burger was our go-to, had the pretzel bones and buffalo dip for a starter. Both excellent choices recommended by our server Desi! She, by the way, was amazing! Extremely fast service as both my client and I didn&#39;t have too much time to spend waiting to order. She was on it and the food came out in a timely manner.

I would definitely recommend this local gem for lunch or dinner as it was definitely worth the money spent.

The service was great once again! I&#39;ve had other servers but Desi is by far my go to girl. I love that they have those at the table kiosk things. They have trivia and children stuff on there.

The management here is without question some of the worst I have ever seen. That doesn&#39;t mean I got into an argument with anyone but what I am saying is this place is extraordinarily disorganized. 
We live nearby and have placed take out orders where the promised time is typically a 20 minute wait once you arrive at the promised time. This has happened 3 separate times. 
My wife and I came on a Friday at 6:30 which I understand to be a popular/ busy time. The challenge I have is that we were told a 40 min wait. We did. As we we&#39;re waiting, however, we saw 4 vacant tables and had about 4 groups waiting for a table. So, we waited. And waited. The tables remained vacant. Then, after 30 minutes...we were sat. Where? At the vacant table we had been staring at for 30 minutes. This was alongside another vacant  table by the way. 
When I asked what happened, we were told this was a &#34;kitchen&#34; table. This table was in the front by of the house right inside the front door. very confusing. 
All in all, this place really lacks management and organization. The food is pretty good but not good enough to to outweigh both the terrible management and really poor service. Too bad because we would be back and cannot even order takeout with management and service such as this. Wow...what a sad story."

Based on this one visit I wasn&#39;t impressed. Having said that I want to come back with a bigger appetite and try their BBQ pork shoulder, brisket and chicken. 
We came in and sat at the bar so we could watch Saturday afternoon college football. There were around a dozen TV&#39;s and it was not busy at all. They have a huge beer menu with drafts and bottled choices. They also have a huge food menu. We settled on buffalo wings and garlic buffalo wings and then later on a mac &amp; cheese dish which we regretted ordering. The server said it was one of their favs...low mac&amp;cheese standards I guess. The picture on the menu made it look so good but what we got served was dry and flavorless and at $14 a horrible value. The wings were good. Crispy and hot but lacked sauce...we should have asked for more sauce. The food took way to long to come out of the kitchen and we did mention that. The reply was the cook (chef?) was simply slow. Wow...need to get that fixed. How long would we have to wait when they are busy??? Here&#39;s hoping the next visit is better."

Unfortunately, the food proved to be a massive disappointment.  

Service was good and it&#39;s the only thing preventing me from rating this place a flat zero. We were seated almost immediately and our server was highly attentive. I placed an order of the sliced smoked chicken breast with my choice of natural cut fries and fire roasted corn. 

The plate flavors lived up to their disappointing dish presentation upon arrival. The chicken was extremely dried out, lacked any moisture  and had absolutely NO FLAVOR.  The corn was nothing short of canned corn flavor and served in a portion size of a child. The natural cut fries were decent but geez is this what this world has come too ?! 

Overall, I ended up poking at my chicken and finishing my fries. Nail to the coffin was the $77 dollar bill at the end. Pictures speak louder than words and I hope my photos show you what a $17 dollar meal shouldn&#39;t look like. Save yourself the money and buy yourself a whole roasted chicken at your nearest Jewel Osco for $6.99. 

Service is there but food isn&#39;t. Will not be returning and definitely won&#39;t be recommending."

I built my own burger since I wasn&#39;t in a BBQ meaty mood.  Angus 1/2 lb patty + smoked gouda + sliced avocado + LTO = juicy, filling, flavorful meal!  I was a happy camper.  There are handfuls of sides to choose from.  I chose the baked potato, and it was a little overly salted.  Also, I guess the side of broccoli is 200 calories bc they steam it in butter? 

K and J enjoyed their combo meat platters, which included brisket, spicy sausage, and wings.  I like that they have wet wipes at the table too.

Food was okay, not terrible but not great. We ordered the buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer and it was not what I expected whatsoever. It literally had chunks of breaded chicken in it and was kind of cold? Very weird and not very good. Our entrees were decent though and the drinks were okay too.

The place itself was really cool looking, had a fun bar section with people handing out shots. 

The biggest issue is the service. It was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! I ran out of water so many times and the server completely ignored that. Food also took forever. Overall it was just a pretty terrible experience in regards to the service. I won&#39;t be back."

The bar however is all the way on the far right. We were greeted by a sweet, delightful bartender named Megan. She provided us with multiple different types of scotch (I felt like it was a scotch kind of day). This place has multiple TVs mounted above the bar and could be a potential hangout spot.

It&#39;s some of the best barbecue in the &#39;burbs, in my opinion. I love the four different BBQ sauces and all the menu options, like the create your own combi. 

* Fried pickles - awesome dipping sauce and didn&#39;t have too much or too little breading
* Sangria - comes in a mini-pitcher with a straw, very tasty at a very reasonable price ($6.50 for .5L)
* Pulled pork &amp; brisket - very flavorful and melts in your mouth

If you&#39;re looking for a place that pre-soaks your food in a bunch of BBQ sauce, this isn&#39;t the place. You add your own sauce, choosing from mustard BBQ, vinegar-based BBQ, spicy BBQ and original mesquite BBQ. All of them are amazing and can be mixed and matched. 

Our server was friendly and our food and drinks came pretty quickly even though we were sitting outside, where I feel like service usually drops off. My only confusion was that for a table inside, there was a significant wait... But when we walked through the restaurant, there were TONS of open tables. They need to hire more staff, or staff that can handle more tables so people aren&#39;t waiting around. 

Overall: delicious barbecue in a laid-back environment. A little on the pricey side, but a great addition to Randhurst Village."

The first time was within a week of its opening. The food was great, yet the service was very poor.
We went back six months later and the food was ok and the service had improved. 
This evening we ordered takeout since we were in the mood for beef brisket (which has always been good). We called in our order and they quoted us 25 minutes. We arrived at the restaurant 30 minutes later and our food was not ready. No big deal, we will just stand here. The restaurant was in shambles. Dirty tables throughout, no hostess or manager at the door, no servers on the floor. I went up to the bar and let the bartender know we were waiting to get our order and she went to the kitchen to retrieve it. Manager came out, letting us know that they were &#34;just wrapping it up&#34; and it should be out in a minute. 25 minutes later before we actually get our to go order. And this was not a complicated order. Three beef brisket entrées, a child&#39;s hamburger and a child&#39;s pizza. 
The manager did offer us several coupons to come back and &#34;give us another chance&#34;. When we got home 10 minutes later and opened up all the food - it just became more comical. Child&#39;s pizza was cold, so were the entrées and the mac &amp; cheese side order was inedible.  Overall such a disappointment. You can only give a place so many chances..."

She did an excellent job of demonstrating the kiosk, providing alert and attentive service (don&#39;t think my drink ever got low before a replacement refill), bringing out the food when it was still very hot, clearing plates at the appropriate time, and packing leftovers (with gloves and dating the box).

Of course, the best service and the best decor in the world doesn&#39;t earn a 5-star review unless the food is also excellent. Fortunately Smokey Bones delivers in that regard with consistently well-prepared food. Here were my thoughts on the dishes I tried:

Smoked wings: Pretty good -- mostly moist and slightly marinated chicken that was meaty and had a slightly crispy skin. Slightly inconsistent as the smaller pieces were sometimes overcooked a slightly dry but overall done fairly well.

BBQ sauces: 4 to choose from: Mustard, Carolina, Kansas City, and Chipotle. A little on the light side, but the flavors match well with the food.

Brunswick stew: Delicious soup with a nice hearty flavor of smoked barbeque meat, a bright and tasty tomato broth, and a touch of sweetness from the corn. Good spicy kick to the dish to tie it all together.

Loaded BBQ burger: Packaged neatly in a nice paper wrap, geometrically like a rectangular prism -- there&#39;s a lot going in this burger with the onion rings, pulled pork, cheddar, spices, fresh lettuce/tomato, and toasted ciabatta bun. Really easy to distinguish the individual components and experience a myriad of textures per bite. But I wish the patty could&#39;ve been thicker and more flavorful as it should be the theme ingredient of the dish.

Cinnamon apple: Very addictive, slightly squishy but mostly meaty and perfect if used in a pie.

The Cuban: Fluffy bread with a combination of pulled pork, swiss cheese, and pickles. Even with the mayo and BBQ sauce, the flavor was a bit light but the texture of the bread and meat was definitely on point.

BBQ Chicharrón: Fried pork rind with a mix of BBQ spices served with several dishes. Very nice almost fluffy texture with a tasty combination of flavorings.

Natural fresh cut fries: Hearty texture with a great potato flavor -- Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside which was balanced very well.

Loaded mashed potatoes: Soft texture with a good flavor of garlic butter. The bacon was soft but overall the dish was enjoyable.

Pork tenderloin: Extremely tender and juicy, perfectly cooked. Not too salty with a slight char skin -- probably the best dish I had of the meal. They probably didn&#39;t use berkshire pork to make this dish, but I could&#39;ve easily been fooled because of the excellent flavor and texture.

Nutty chicken salad: Fresh salad mixed with perfectly grilled chicken and red onions, fresh strawberries, dried cranberries, and candied pecans which is tied together well by the honey mustard sauce. Done as well as any of the local cafes which specialize in salads and sandwiches.

Hot Bag O&#39; Donuts: Fluffy and hot donuts that are slightly crisp. Delicious way to end the meal, specially with the raspberry sauce. Highly recommended.

Overall, the food is probably closer to a 4 but the great service, unique decor, good variety of bulk ordering options, and overall pleasant experience add an additional star to the rating. I&#39;ll definitely be back soon."

We came on a weekday night, and the crowd was predictably small; it was just us two and another table of 3 in the dining room. But our server was slow with greeting, getting our drink and meal orders, and refills.   We ordered medium steaks, and when we got them, they were practically rare. The manager replaced them with smiles and apologies, but the steaks still didn&#39;t taste all that great.

Then, his beer was brought out by a surly young man who gave us a snotty smirk whaen we asked for a mug for his beer.  Also, when he brought out our food, when I asked him about BBQ sauce, he abruptly plopped the tray of sauces that was hidden by other items on the table.  BF&#39;s ribs were lukewarm.  Luckily the waitress made an appearance and personally fixed that for us.  Unfortunately, the &#34;thug&#34; who brought out food and drinks would walk by every so often, and give us a dirty look.

Our street looked like we were on the shores of Gitche Gumee:  a water main had burst up the street and cascades of water were streaming down the pavement, taking livestock, bridges, cars, and Trump Tower in its wake (or so I wished).  I was about to call the local emergency number, but I saw that one of our neighbors had already done the deed; so I carried on to eat breakfast and go to my health club for morning exercises.

When I returned, my wife responded to hysterical barks and shrieks from her pet, Emma the Stinky Dog.  Somebody from the Public Works department had posted a note on the front door announcing that we would have no water service for the next 4-6 hours while they repair the water main.  So we could not wash, use the flush toilet, or prepare lunch.

I remembered that yesterday&#39;s Chicago Tribune included a $10 lunch discount coupon for Smokey Bones, which is not terribly far from us; so we decided to go there for lunch.  I had never been there, and the Mt Prospect site was the only one in the Chicago area:  the next closest one is in Grand Rapids, which somehow has something to do with the water still streaming down our street.

So we drove over to Randhurst Village to try out Smoky Bones.  Smoky Bones is a pretty large bar/restaurant that features BBQ foods.  When you enter the restaurant, you can smell the smoky odor of the BBQ, and this increased my anticipation of eating something that tasted smoky.  Being a Monday noon, the restaurant was not very busy; and our waitress presented us with both lunch and dinner menus.  Me, the great consumer advocate, noticed that the dinner prices for some items were higher than the same items on the lunch menu.

I requested a smoky hamburger, and my wife had a Chicken BBQ plate with a few side orders.  Being sophisticated, we quaffed Diet Coke.  I noticed that each table had a tray of different types of BBQ sauces, ranging from vinegary to spicy.  I tried each, and I liked each one for different reasons.  As I have often mentioned, I do not like greasy food; and their offerings satisfied my preferences: the items were prepared in a lightly and properly seasoned manner.

In all, we were satisfied with the presentation, food quality, and atmosphere.  One issue that needs improvement is that there was nobody attending the reception desk: both we and other diners had to wait until the receptionist showed up.

This restaurant, like many others, has several TV screens showing sporting events.  Mrs. B saw a baseball player get beaned, and then I noticed that the basketball players on a game were very tall:  they were really long fellows.

When we got home, Public Works was finishing up the repairs, and life returned to normal.

Hiya, Watha!"

And unfortunately, it falls under the stereotype in terms of the quality of its food. The service is good but I&#39;ve been here twice and have left unimpressed.

The Smokehouse chicken was almost inedible... and I would hate to know what that chicken tastes like without the cheese and bacon loaded on top. The St. Louis ribs were much better but mediocre as far as ribs go. I would opt to go across the street to Black Finn for ribs which is disappointing for a place that &#34;specializes&#34; in BBQ. Sides are probably the best thing I&#39;ve had here.

The drinks were fine but comparable to that of a &#34;TGI Fridays.&#34; I also signed up for their email list and there are no compelling reasons/incentives to come back. I don&#39;t know that I will especially with all the other choices within walking distance of this place."

We had great service from Michelle who was attentive, knew the menu, offered recommendations, and we didn&#39;t feel neglected.  

The food,  I had the ribs and brisket combo, my son, the salmon, husband wings and ribs.  

We have gone to numerous rib fests, had ribs at many other establishment and the food at Smokey Bones is mediocre at best. The food was cooked perfectly, but the taste was not mouthwatering good. Nothing wowed me, nothing lured me into wanting to come back for more.  My college aged son even said that his plate was like something he would get at his college cafeteria. 

Will i come back... Only if I had to, otherwise I will find another place for a savory plate of ribs.

3 stars earned for service, and ambiance."

I heard about their late night menu and after a late night job, stopped in here for drinks and some food. I stuck with appetizers and ordered the buffalo chicken dip and the loaded fries (both off the late night menu). The buffalo chicken dip was fantastic. The loaded fries were ok, they were ironically a little plain. They might be better off if served with a ranch dipping sauce.

  The service was great and the bartender always made sure my pint glass was never empty.

  Before I left I ordered their skillet cornbread. It was a little dry, but the butter they serve with it basically makes it taste like a cookie.

  I&#39;ll be back to smokey bones to try their actual BBQ, but I know I will always be able to count on their service and late night menu!"

First, service was great.  No issues, and that&#39;s a big part of why I&#39;ve given them 2 stars.  Smiling, eager staff that didn&#39;t hover or annoy... 

Food: barbequed chicken, a bit flavorless where the meat was concerned and the skin was too sweet.

Brisket: lacked flavor, was a little dry. 

Pulled pork:  lots of flavor but a little dry.

Corn:  sweet and surprisingly good.

Broccoli :  so incredubly overcooked I could have turned it into babyfood with my fork!

Burgers:  no complaints on flavor.

Most imoortanly, seriously overpriced!   Won&#39;t be wastingtume or money there again."

This place was a really enjoyable place to get barbeque.  Going through the menu, I&#39;d say these guys don&#39;t know what their identity is.  Are they a great burger place or are they a pork / brisket / ribs place?  From what I see on the menu and people&#39;s plates, they are both!  I ordered the hand pulled pork sandwich with baked beans and cole slaw.  (I had a choice of many other sides, but these two sounded good.)  My meat didn&#39;t come with any barbeque sauce because there are 4 or 5 you have available to add at your table - from spicy to mild.

Also, as he was going for the menus he &amp; my friend knocked over a beer. Spilled all over, no apology or offer for a new beer. It made us uncomfortable how unfriendly he was.

Then we come back for drink after the movie to watch the Hawks, we sit in bar this time. Bar was pretty empty but took forever to get orders in, no joke 25 minutes for 4 bottled beers to get to our table.

I understand that it&#39;s a busy saturday night, but ordering before I showed up was supposed to be my way of avoiding the fray. As I&#39;m standing here, I&#39;m listening to party after party complain that they were told they&#39;d be next and getting passed over. I&#39;m now 20 minutes past the deadline and still waiting. I hope it&#39;s worth it, but seeing the disorganization, I don&#39;t really have high hopes. Plus, everything I ordered has been cooking for hours. I&#39;m pretty sure everything going in my belly just needs to be packed up neatly in a box.

FYI signing up for their rewards program online didn&#39;t pull up anything when I got there. Consider signing up there or doing it more than a few hours before going in. 

***25 minutes later and I&#39;m on my way***

My order has a full slab of St. Louis ribs and a combo of pulled pork and brisket. The four sides are corn, mashed potatoes, baked beans, and coleslaw. The portion of brisket is, well, small (picture attached). It was tender and surprising juicy considering it needed to make a 10 minute trek home. It&#39;s a chunk, not sliced as noted by others. Same goes for the pulled pork. Flavor, though, was lacking in both. The bbq sauce helps, but they&#39;re otherwise devoid of smoke. The ribs were almost fall off the bone (which for me is perfect). Same issue as the other meats in terms of flavor.

The sides didn&#39;t particularly wow me either save for the corn. It was the only item to have any char flavor to it and it was seasoned well. The coleslaw has too much mayo in my opinion. The baked beans were pretty standard and a bit over seasoned, and the mashed potatoes were fine. You can customize your potatoes a bit which is nice. There&#39;s also a piece of toast, but someone else got her paws on it first so no review on that.

Overall, the meal was fine but certainly not worth the wait times that were being quoted to people. If I&#39;m ever craving bbq on a weeknight or non-game day, I&#39;d still consider this place as an option."

Saturday night of course it&#39;s busy. Everyone is getting their name on a list and getting a vibrating pager. That way when your turn is up you can have a table. Mind you this happened for a second time. A couple comes in and walks right up to a table and sits down. Went around the entire 45 min line. We walked over nicely and explained there is a wait and maybe they didn&#39;t know. As rude as possible they refuse to leave.

We talked to the server, he says he will talk to them. No luck their not leaving. Next we talk to the manager. He says there&#39;s not much he can do. I explained that it&#39;s not right and if he serves them a lot of people will be upset. He says he doesn&#39;t know what he can do. 

So I decide to start talking to people in line. Well at least that worked. Multiple parties expressed their displeasure and walked out. 

So there you go Smokey Bones. The best part about it is you made my hangry wife really mad and she talks to everyone. 

Can I say again this is the second time this has happened at the Mount Prospect Smokey Bones!

1. Pitcher of beer was flat. When told, server didn&#39;t seem concerned and still charged us for a different beer we didn&#39;t really want. 

2. Wings were covered in feathers. I have had thousands of wings at hundreds of places over the years. I may be considered an expert. I have never had so many feathers attached to my wings. When told, server stated that is normal here and it won&#39;t hurt us and to keep eating. What????? How do I even comment on the mistakes made with this situation. 

3. When I spoke with the manager, I was told shipments come that way once a month as though it just is what it is. She then told us that, based on his comments to us, the server is lucky he is attractive. So not only is the food low quality, but the manager admits the staff is low quality, and based on her inappropriate statement, the management is poor. 

4. We didn&#39;t finish the wings because of nausea due to the feathers and the manager only offered us new wings, which would undoubtedly also have feathers. She then discounted our food, but not even enough to cover the cost of the wings. 

Wow! Poor management, low quality food, and &#34;pretty servers&#34; without brains.

Both my fiancé and I notice how undercooked the meat was - a medium rare steak somehow became a rare. The manager did come out to apologize to her credit. She mentioned that we were not the only ones this happened to, which was not a good sign.

When it came time to pay I used a credit card. Then I noticed the server dealing with another table while our tender is already being handled. This made us both uncomfortable.

I&#39;m just a person who loves barbecue and has had the blessing of trying the &#34;best&#34; barbeque around the chicagoland area.

My 1st introduction to Smokey Bones was a failed experience since the wait for a table for 2 was almost 1 hour long. Usually a wait like that symbolizes a high quality product, so we resigned to trying Smokey Bones at a later date.

Our next attempt came on a sweltering Sunday morning close to opening (11am). We were imprssed by the decore and the warm greetings we received by the young people at the front. We were seated right away.

Not too soon after we settled in our seats, our waitress took our drink orders. She was very attentative and informative, but we got an overwhelming sense that her niceity and politeness was being &#34;phoned in&#34;. Not a knock on her since her service proided no complaints from us, but it didn&#39;t really inspire us to want to come back for the service either. Hopefully the flavor of the food would pick up the slack in that departmenr.

We split and order of Smoked Wings, Pulled Pork, and Smoked Sausage sidded with Roasted Corn, Steamed Broccoli, and Garlic Bread.

Pulled Pork: Usually my benchmark for a barbecue place. Here at Smokey Bones we were left disappointed. The flavor profile was sadly generic and dry as if what we were served was left overs from last nights batch. We had to drown the meat in sauce to make the protien palatable. We typically look for a nice smoke flavor and tender juciyness in our pulled pork with sauce only used to enhance the deliciousness. All of the above were sadly lacking.

Smoked Sausage: Once again a let down. The one saving grace with this was the great &#34;snap&#34; of the casing. The flavor of the meat was once again &#34;generic&#34; and dry as if it were from yesterday. It did pair well with a 50/50 mix of the Spicy (Red Top) sauce and KC (Green Top) sauce.

Smoked Wings: We need to give credit to our server for this selection because it was by far the best meat selection on the plate. The only protien that tasted fresh. Great crunch and rub on the skin with just the right amount of spice. A light drizzle of sauce on top made these wings fly off the plate and into our mouths.

Steamed Broccoli: Served warm, borderline room temperature. Light buttery and garlicy note, a bit soggy.

Roasted Corn: Visually appetizing, but felt like it would pair better with fresh tortilla chips rather than served as a side dish for barbecue.

Garlic Bread: Reminicent of the garlic bread you would get at Chili&#39;s but not as crunchy. Sadly more chewy than a garlic bread should be.

Overall: Nice decore and friendly staff. Wish there was a little bit more enthusiasm, but you usually get this from a younger staff team. Food was ok compaired to other place we have been but was severly lacking in smoke flavor and tenderness. Maybe if we came at the right time when the food was fresh, we could have given Smokey Bones a higher review. We will give this place another shot down thw line to see if the quality has improved."

The Mediocre:   the burger (for about $11.50) was so-so; the Suiza Margarita meh; and my husband&#39;s combo platter (hot sausage, brisket; bourbon chicken) was just &#34;okay&#34;

The bad:  service - although she was sweet, waitress forgot our water (had to ask twice) and our doggie bag; burger was served with onions &amp; tomato, although I specified not to include those; Liquid Lei margarita (although yummy) was served without the sugar rim specified in the menu; ketchup almost empty; four different servers dropped off parts of our meal; and service was exceedingly slow, although the place was empty.

Another complaint - table video display for menu, billing and games was cute -- but there was a charge for the silly games - not prominently displayed.  Just skip the games or make complimentary!

All in all - okay, but not worth the price.  For $70+ dollars for two, you can do much better!  Don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back."

I work in the area and noticed they had a good looking lunch special. I went in and sat at the bar which was very nice; clean, great tvs, and the bar tender took my drink order right away. I chose and ice tea and for some reason she gave me my receipt right away which was fine until I read the price! $2.85 + tax aprox $4.03 for an ICE TEA! I did not even get any booze with that. WOW

I then placed my order for the food which took aprox 35 minutes so this is not a quick lunch type of place. You need at least 45 minutes to make it work. The food was good and so were the portions. I went with the pulled pork and you were able to choose from 4 sauces at the bar. Going into it i figured my lunch would be $9.99 or whatever the lunch special was listed but that was not the case. By the time you are done with the tip you will be lucky to eat for under $16 a plate.

Their wings are good. Nice size and meaty however the buff-a-que sounded really interesting it was a little under sauced. I&#39;m a fan of sweet BBQ sauce and the heat but I definitely had to use the sauces on the table - that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for. 

The promotional apple cider sangria was too sugary at first but mix it in and it grows on you.

Onion rings are good too and can&#39;t go wrong with their fries. Plus you can order more drinks straight from your table on their little tablet thing and swipe your card when ready to pay!

She proceeded to talk with the customer that appeared to be a regular and never said hello nor what would you like to drink. I guess she thought that I wanted something for free and maybe it was my skin color. Either way I was walking out to leave and I told the hostess who was VERY nice what happened and she said she was sorry and that she would seat me with Daniel. 
Daniel was a wonderful server. I didn&#39;t even talk to him about what happened I just decided to take my chances. He was suggestive and informative.

Started with the loaded nachos and they were anything but loaded. My husband had the combo with baby back ribs and chicken wings with spicy garlic buffalo and garlic Parmesan. There was barely any sauce on anything and the sauces at the table left little to be desired. I had a combo with brisket, smoked wings and mac &amp; cheese. The brisket was on the drier side but the sauce was really good. The smoked wings and mac &amp; cheese were the shining stars of the night! The mac was creamy with a smokey flavor, definitely would order this again. Decided on the bag o donuts to go and they were amazing, especially with the dipping sauces. Might give them another shot since we did visit during their opening few weeks."

I was a bit hesitant considering some previous negative reviews but everything turned out fine.  The food and drink menu had a good selection of things and considering our party-size the food came out at a reasonable amount of time and tasted pretty good along with the selection of various sauces. Granted I&#39;ve had amazing BBQ in the south (Georgia, Tennessee), so the bar is set high on my taste buds but for being so close to where I live and having good service I would definitely come back."

I want to think it was an off night, but when your coleslaw is overly salty (is there even salt in coleslaw?!), something&#39;s wrong.  The food is not executed properly.  The ribs were incredibly dry and had a one note flavor:  salt.  No smokiness detected.  No depth of flavor.  The side dishes were extremely salty.  

Torn.  Want to come back because there are other items on the menu that look worthwhile, but the salty coleslaw just slaps me back into reality.  Jewish diners have better &#34;ribs.&#34;  You know those boiled ribs you get at a 24 hour place because it&#39;s the only place open and you feel like ribs so what the heck you order it?  Those are better than the ribs we had here.  No 2nd chance.  Money out the window."

Wife and I were super excited when this place opened.  Food and service both excellent in the beginning.  We dined here at least 3-4 times a month.  Last month we decided to bring some friends and their kids for dinner.  It was a busy evening for sure. Waited 30 minutes to be seated, no problem with that at all. Staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Our waiter seemed like he was new, younger guy - super nice by the way.  We order our food, and kept ourselves and kids entertained.  Looking at the time almost an hour went by before we questioned our food ETA.  Waiter had puzzled look on his face. Came back and apologized but looks like he forgot to put our order in! OOPS!  So he finally did and put a rush on it, waited another half hour, Still nothing.  Asked again about food ETA, said it should be up shortly.  Finally came, almost 2 hours after being seated.  Half the order was wrong.  At this point everyone in our party was furious.  Waiter did his best to keep us happy, brought us our check.  Did not even bother to discount meal at all or offer anything for our inconvenience.  I requested a manager, and some 20 year old kid came by saying he was the manager.  Offered us 10% off.  I said this is ridiculous, you guys screwed up not once, but twice, spent almost 3 hours dining and ended up not even getting what we wanted.  After a heated conversation and explaining to him how this is supposed to play out, felt like I almost had to beg to get our meal taken care of.  Completely bogus.  He finally comped our meal, and we still gave a generous tip to our waiter.  Moral of this story? Management seems to be lacking.  Need to ramp up service or there will surely be a &#34;FOR LEASE&#34; sign on the door soon!"

I let my young and clearly inexperienced bartender know this and yet she spent more time filling plastic containers with limes, oranges and other stuff rather than pay attention to me. A few things to point out: 

- The service is not sharp and management appears to be nonexistent  
- The drinks are weak, I watched the bartender pour less than a shot in to my drink and didn&#39;t argue b/c I was in a time crunch 
- I had to ask for a napkin and then ask for silverware seperately
- The burger was bland 

When the bartender asked how my meal was, I said not very good and she asked why. I told her the burger was bland and she didn&#39;t give me salt/pepper. 

Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else and I will never go back to this place. It&#39;s too bad Billy Goat is no longer there."

We were greeted and seated timely, although we asked if the four of us could sit at the vacant booth rather than the table by the entrance, but were told no.  We waited for a server...and waited....and waited.....until a server finally showed up to take our drink order.  During that time, another group was seated at the booth we couldn&#39;t have.  We were ready to place our order and when one of us ordered the brisket, we were told they were out.  First, would have been nice to be told that at the beginning, secondly, this is only 2 hours after it was supposed to be available (brisket available after 4PM).  The place wasn&#39;t overcrowded on a Wednesday evening.  Perhaps our server had been in the back eating it all.  Regardless, that was an extreme disappointment.  After a very long time, our food arrived.  I ordered the baby back ribs and grilled bourbon BBQ chicken breast along with &#34;natural cut fries&#34; and cole slaw.  My first impression was that the chicken breast was from frozen, along with the fries.  The chicken tasted like a frozen breast that was thawed out, placed on a grill and then smathered with sauce.  The ribs were fall of the bone, but the flavor came primarily from the generous amount of sauce put on them and there wasn&#39;t any &#34;smoke&#34; flavor.   There was a good selection of sauces available at the table.  Especially after the ribs, it would have been nice to have some wipes, but I don&#39;t really think BBQ is their thing and they think that way.   I think it more of a burger and beer place that says they do BBQ, but isn&#39;t a BBQ place.  Walking in, there is no BBQ aroma, every picture in the place was of burgers or talking about beer.  We wanted to check out, but it took forever to find our server to get our bill.  Once it arrived, my wife took out her credit card and the server was nowhere to be found.  After almost 20 minutes, we flagged down another server who instructed us to use the tabletop system to pay our bill.   I&#39;ve given this place 2 stars.  From a service standpoint, it gets nothing.  From a BBQ standpoint, it gets nothing.  One of us had the burger and she said it was great, and that&#39;s what rose this review to 2 stars.  Overall, I think this is less of a BBQ place and more of a Chilis with bad service.  Had such high hopes for a birthday dinner and what a letdown."

To start with, our hostess didn&#39;t really seem to have a table picked out before she started walking in the direction of the bar, because she just sorta stood there until we suggested squeezing into a booth. After we were seated we got a long speech about those little touch screen computers that you use to order. You know, the ones that you see often in other chain restaurants and are super easy to use. We didn&#39;t really need a full blown run-down the first time, and the second identical walk-through by our server was definitely unnecessary. 

Some of us ordered a drink, some of us didn&#39;t. The sarcasm or awkward jokes directed towards those ordering water was pretty ridiculous. Peer pressuring customers to order a drink so our bill and your tip could go up is one thing I find incredibly tacky. He even made comments when those of us ordering drinks wanted water as well. Why is this a weird thing?! Isn&#39;t it fairly common to have water with your meal? 

The awkwardness continued for most of our meal. My friend who ordered donuts used her quick reflexes to avoid the waiter dumping the chocolate sauce all over her from his total lack of attention. Another awkward comment along the lines of &#34;that would&#39;ve been my bad&#34;....was there any question? 

The food was...ok. Donuts were good but the the chocolate sauce was the definition of artificial. Onion rings were also good but not a lot of dipping sauce and he didn&#39;t come back around so I could ask for more. 

I guess it was a good thing we got the run down of those tablets...we paid on that so we could avoid one more awkward interaction. If I do ever come back here, it&#39;ll be after enough time for the staff to get a little more experience in social interaction.

Also, please don&#39;t play Nickelback."

At dinner I always get the full slab of baby back ribs. They have been perfect every time and are one of my favorites in the Chicago area if not my favorite. 

The bag of donuts for dessert is a must. Best donuts ever. They are fresh and hot and the dipping sauces are excellent. The sampler appetizer platter was also excellent. 

If you do visit, make sure you ask for Desi as your waitress. We&#39;ve had her as our waitress twice now at lunch. Every restaurant needs a waitress like her. Alway smiling, sweet and very attentive. Couldn&#39;t ask for anyone better!!"

Phil, our waiter, came by and got drink orders and the to go order that one person in our party wanted to get.  He gave the rest of us time to look over the menu and provided some guidance of things he felt were the best.  I did the two item combo with brisket and the smokey wings (get these!  They are the best!!!).  Also had broccoli and some great mac &amp; cheese ($1.99 extra charge but worth it!).  My dining partner had the baby back ribs, smokey wings, cole slaw and mac &amp; cheese.  

We both loved our dinner!  The smokey wings are so good, with a nice light sweet/smokey sauce.  The brisket was so tender and the ribs were fall of the bone delicious!  We both had water so can&#39;t rate the drink menu but service throughout our dinner was fabulous.  Becky (manager) came by a few times to check in and Phil was attentive, personable, just down right a gentleman.

We shared the Bag O&#39; Donuts for dessert...something to leave room for.  Warm, covered in cinnamon sugar along with two dipping sauces.  The chocolate sauce was ok and the raspberry sauce was so awesome!

Not only was she truly accommodating, but all around joy to be around. Made the experience extremely enjoyable and we would go back and ask for her specifically if possible. As far as food, I got the BBQ pork platter with loaded mashed potatoes and Macaroni and cheese, comes with two pieces of garlic bread. Absolutely delicious!! Everything was cooked nicely and the pork was amazing. My boyfriend got the brisket platter with baked beans and loaded French fries, equally delicious! We also got the fried pickles as an app, super crispy and delicious. Overall, an amazing experience and great dinner! If it were doable I think we&#39;d come here at least once or twice a week! I suggest everyone try this place.

As a matter of fact I would just totally avoid this place if possible. It is run by kids. My wife and I went there on a Saturday night about 7:30  in September  and I don&#39;t think there was an employee in the entire restaurant over the age of 25.  And none of them knew what they were doing.  Including the cooks . There were so many problems with my experience there I don&#39;t even know if I can list them all in this one review. But I will admit that I made a mistake in not following my cardinal rule when going to restaurants. That is you should always order what they specialize in. In this case they specialize in Meats and I ordered a salad with chicken on it. Bad idea. It was disgusting. From the moment we walked into this place to the moment we left everything they did was wrong. The service was terrible the food was bad and the service got worse throughout the evening. My wife got the baby back ribs with baked beans and coleslaw. Their ribs we&#39;re good. I will admit that. The beans were good as well. The coleslaw was disgusting. Almost as disgusting as my nutty salad with Crispy Chicken. Which was served on a plate that was greasy and filthy and disgusting. I couldn&#39;t believe it. The salad was swimming in dressing. This was a small portion size that they gave me and they must have put like a full cup of dressing on this stuff and then tossed it before they put it on the plate and in so doing they smeared dressing all over the edge of the plate and then served it to me like that. It was something that a child would do. I won&#39;t be going back there again that&#39;s for sure.  Oh and by the way I ordered my salad with no onions and it came with onions. The server never offered to refill our glasses. The hostess sat us in the bar area which we clearly did not want to be there but we were starving so we accepted it. The server came to our table and left dirty napkins on the table which or from another table that he just cleaned. There was no silverware on our table so when they brought us the food we had to ask for silverware. Then they brought us one napkin. We had to ask for more napkins because my wife was eating ribs. Duh...They should know that.  So in summary if you&#39;re with a bunch of young guys and you want to get drunk and watch TV and have a burger then I guess this place might be ok.

The brisket came out with no red ring along any of the outer pieces...over cooked, I think, I&#39;m no chef so I&#39;m not for sure but I&#39;ve seen some shows and had bbq in Austin and there was a huge difference.

He was personable and made a good drink. That&#39;s the only good thing I have to say but I don&#39;t follow the &#34;if you don&#39;t have something nice to say&#34; way of life. My boyfriend had a softball game nearby so a few of us went out after and I found this place on yelp! I ignored the bad reviews because I wanted so badly for this place to be good. To start they have like 50 people running around &#34;working&#34; and the ONLY one who seemed to know what he was doing was the guy bartender. Yet since he seemed to be the only bartender working besides the guy he was training the drinks we ordered from our server took no joke 20 minutes to get to our table in a pretty empty restaurant. So that was nothing compared to the rest of the time we spent there. I had the viniq sangria which was good and my boyfriend had some punch thing that was very good as well but for q group of five of us they had like 3 different people bring out drinks 5 minutes apart. I ordered the broccoli cheese soup, and a nutty chicken salad. We also ordered pretzel bones. The waiter honestly was a nice kid but must have been hitting a bong in the back because we had to ask for everything 3-4 times. We decided whilst we were waiting to just walk up to the bar to get shots, that&#39;s when we talked to the bartender who was literally swamped with drinks to make, they clearly needed more bartenders yet we watched one girl behind the bar just stand and talk to one customer for over an hour. My soup and the pretzels came at the same time and my soup was ice cold but I was starving after waiting so long but it was like cold cheese water with raw broccoli in it.... Disgusting. The pretzel bones were ok but the bottoms were like wet and soggy. At this point the guys switch to beer and I ask for a kiddie cocktail which they had to ask for their beers twice and my kiddie cocktail just flat out never came. The food finally gets there and I totally failed ordering the $12 salad because my friends got brisket that was not to bad yet my plate literally had wilted mushy lettuce (see pic) about a tablespoon of feta,literally one and a half strawberry cut up, and a half of a gross looking chicken breast. Also I asked for extra dressing which our flaky waiter mentioned when dropping off food that he was going to get and at that point I asked for my kiddie cocktail AGAIN. I took one bite of mushy lettuce that had no dressing on it because he never came back with it.... All our friends said to send it back that there was no way that they should have sent the salad out. So I tried to flag the waiter down for 10 minutes and finally came back and said oh yeah let me get that dressing and I was fuming at this point and said don&#39;t bother I don&#39;t want this salad it is disgusting. Then he complained to another of the 50 other people working there that were doing nothing that I was sending my salad back! I am in the service industry so we all still tipped 20% and he made $30 on our table even though at the end he had just given up completely. The boys ordered another round of beers and literally had to go to the bar to ask where they were after 15 minutes of trying to flag our waiter down. My friend jimmy asked the rude chick bartender if she could give him their beers and she acted like he was trying to scam them. I still never got that kiddie cocktail and we spent a shit ton of money. Also they NEVER EVER, not even once picked up one thing off our table every dirty glass and plate just piled up (see pic). This place needs to fire everyone and bring in a new staff especially the management or else this place is gonna fail miserably."

On my first trip we sat down and had a full dinner, and on the next intended to stay for a drink. The common theme for both trips was definitely very poor service. On our first trip everything seemed unnecessary slow, but eventually arrived. The food was in general ok, but not outstanding. I also thought that the portions were somewhat small. On the second trip we had sat down in the bar area for at least 15 minutes and never had a waiter or waitress come to our table. I finally walked up to the bartender, and after struggling but finally getting his attention (even though the bar was not that busy) asked him if anybody was serving the area. He said yes, and that we must have set ourselves. It&#39;s seemed the implication was that it was our fault that we hadn&#39;t been served.  I replied by telling him that there was nobody at the door. After waiting for another five minutes at our table with no service, we decided to get up and leave."

Then, we ordered our food and it came in about 20 minutes so the manager delivered it and said he would cover our check because it took so long, even though it wasn&#39;t too super long of a wait. 
We expressed he didn&#39;t need to do that, but when you offer something you also should follow through and we ended up paying for everything including drinks. 
Our food was good. I got a burger and my girlfriend the Mac n cheese. I found a black hair in my food and my girlfriend found a piece of what looked like meet patty separating paper. After that we were excited they had said they would pay for it because of the shit in the food, but didn&#39;t so we payed and walked out and will never go back.

First, the service was just OK since we had to ask for another beer and they didn&#39;t bring BBQ sauce when they served our meal. This is a BBQ joint right?

We split a combo plate with ribs and brisket and a few sides. For $18.50 I was disappointed with the portions. The rib portion was 3 bones and had very little meat on them. The brisket was small and very dry. We had to doused it in BBQ sauce (that we had to ask for) to make it palatable.

Don&#39;t want a combo don&#39;t worry they have tons of other tasty choices on the menu. My boyfriend had a pulled pork sandwich and loved it. His also came with a choice of 2 sides and Texas toast.

Being a customer I do t want to hear that I want you to take the plate and bring me back some good food. As for the pulled pork it was dry and flavorless.

First impressions, it&#39;s packed! On a Saturday night you&#39;ll definitely need a reservation to get a table. Speaking of tables, the majority are pretty small. The restaurant is in a fairly small place and they do make good use of everything... but if you have a party of four expect it to be tight and you have to get creative with where you put things on your table. A slightly larger table would have made the experience better but they are low on space. The do have a rooftop area but I didn&#39;t get to experience that.

The service was great, our server Greg was attentive. They were packed but food and drinks were served in the expected amount of time. I had sashimi and it was well prepared and fresh. Not too expensive - similar price point to other sushi restaurants. 

Now be careful on your drinks... ours ended up running up to $200! Full bill was $450 for 4 people. The sake is good but pricey ($21 a bottle). They have some good martinis, each drink about $12. I would recommend to keeping to a two drink max to keep costs down.

I would recommend this for 2-4 people groups, absolutely no larger. Great for date night. And definitely get a reservation! I couldn&#39;t give it a 5 due to the cramped feeling. For bigger groups or a less cramped environment I would recommend Libertyville. That place is a 5 out of 5... equally as pricey but the environment is a lot more open, because they have a lot more space to work with."

I really wanted to like this place - and when I ate there I did - it does have a very cool rooftop and ambience which is nice for the downtown Barrington area. However - after eating here three of the four of us got so violently ill from food poisoning that not only can I never return to this restaurant but I highly doubt I will ever be able to eat sushi again. Our fourth friend who did not get sick did not eat any of the raw fish - she only ate the short ribs. Two of us were so sick we landed in the ER with severe abdominal pain and dehydration. As of now, our sickness has spread to two of our children and one husband. Running a restaurant is risky enough - but when dealing with raw food it can be even riskier and I don&#39;t believe the owners of this place take that seriously. Beware of eating food here prepared by people who may not know what they are doing. Slick marketing - ill prepared food."

Between four of us we enjoyed the Mojito, Gingertinis and Blueberry Lemon drop for cocktails. All were delicious!

For appetizers we started with Asparagus Beef Roll and Orange Duck. It would be tough to chose a favorite because we devoured them both with equal zeal.

For our dinner we ordered rolls to share. Shakou Roll was way too salty and our least favorite. The Green Dragon was a repeat favorite. While I found the Flaming Hamachi too spicy for my taste, I admit to being a light weight. The rest of our party loved it! The Ocean Drive was good but not something we would probably repeat with so many other options.

For dessert, we split the Pyramid and it was perfect!!!!

As I walked in, I was struck by two things--the loud decor and even LOUDER MUSIC. Think clubbing, a la 2002. The hostess greeted me and proceeded to take me to my spot--a single stool wedged between a full bar of people. Hmm....no thanks. I made a reservation, I&#39;ll wait for a table. She then tells me to go upstairs, wait at the bar and they will give me a table. I go up the elevator and as the door opened, I nearly fell back from the noise. Not only was the music LOUD, the people were yelling like drunken college kids on Spring Break! I looked around and it seemed as though I had been transported to the Jersey Shore--Snooki and all. I nearly left, but I was tired and not in the mood to go elsewhere at this point. After about 10 more minutes, I was seated at a couch and table. 

Matthew greeted me and certainly put me a bit at ease. I order the seaweed salad and the 15 piece sashimi. The seaweed salad was good (and quite large), but the sashimi was terribly disappointing. The fish quality was just very mediocre. It was so bad, I actually left 5 pieces on the plate. I just couldn&#39;t stand to eat any more mushy, raw fish. Again, Matthew was great. I would give him 5 stars. The &#34;manager&#34; in jeans and the striped shirt was pretty blah. He just stood there and was not a great representation of a good host.

Overall, this place seems to be the &#34;happening&#34; spot for Cougars and others aiming to recapture their youth. The noise level was obnoxious and it wasn&#39;t worth the price for the mediocre food."

I like the interior decorations and the service was great but the food and price are factors hard to overlook. We started with the seven ahi special per our waitresses recommendation and it was pretty decent - fried/crunchy rice on bottom of ahi tartar with some tobiko and a jalapeño. 

Our main entrees were less spectacular. We got the sambal shrimp, japanese steak, and a black window roll. It came with a healthy portion of vegetables but the proteins were cooked mediocre. The steak came out too well done and didn&#39;t have the bite to it like a steak should have. The shrimp wasn&#39;t as fresh as I expected and the scallops on top of the black widow were overdone as well. I thought the flavors of each dish were pretty good though. All of this came to around $45 per person (including tax and tip) which I know could have been spent on a better meal..."

Simply put, I don&#39;t know of any place within 30 miles that rivals this place:  atmosphere, food, crowd, and service were all a notch above what you find in the burbs.    It doesn&#39;t completely achieve the personality of many of the places downtown but does a very commendable job of losing the sterile lifeless feel that is so epidemic in suburban restaurants; a condition that stems from the typical unoriginal formulaic cookie-cutter process usually used to create them all the way down to the menu items.

The Seven Spicy Ahi,(currently $11) a variation of the very popular spicy tuna over toasted rice dish which to my knowledge got its start many years ago in LA at the original Katsuya, was pretty much the best iteration of this well-know item I&#39;ve ever had beating Katsuya itself, killing E+O&#39;s, and being quite a bit better than Wildfish&#39;s; just to name a couple I&#39;ve recently tried.     I probably marginally prefer the modified version (mine) of the original Sushi Bombs at Kaminari but alas this is no longer available now that the ownership of Kaminari has changed hands.

I&#39;ve been to Skakou Barrington twice now and tried a large sample of the menu.   Not every dish was an absolute winner but I don&#39;t recall any I flat out didn&#39;t like or that wasn&#39;t at least on par with what I&#39;d get elsewhere around here.   Along with the Seven Spicy Ahi, I recall the Braised Short Rib (currently $24) also being outstanding.

Prices are EXACTLY what I would expect for a restaurant of the mid-to-high-end variety in this location with food averaging about $40-50 per person + drinks.   Since this is what I usually pay at any restaurant of this level in this area (Arlington Heights, Algonquin, Barrington, Schaumburg, etc..), I don&#39;t get all the comments on being over priced.   In any case, while you can dine here for less, expect to pay at least $40 per person + drink costs.

Bottom-line, I definitely recommend checking Shakou Barrington out.    

I have been to most of the places in the area, but if you do go to Shakou Barrington and feel there&#39;s another place within 30 miles that is better, please drop me a personal note.   I&#39;d love to try it!"

My $8 glass of wine was possibly the smallest glass of wine I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.  My fiance ordered a beer and the waitress didn&#39;t offer a small or large option, so naturally (we found out when we got the bill) brought him a large...for $12.  For dinner, my fiance and I each got entrees.  When ordering our entrees, the waitress offered us white, brown, or fried rice.  We both ordered fried rice.  When we got the bill, she had up-charged us $3 apiece for the fried rice and made no mention of it when we ordered-pretty tacky.

We had a 7:15pm reservation and decided to go a little early and have a drink at the bar. We got there at 6:45pm and the place was PACKED!! Always a good sign considering this is a newer place in the area. Unfortunately we weren&#39;t able to sit at the bar, but I was pleased to see the place busy. 

We ate like champs. I had their cucumberita, which was a little strong for my liking, but I drank it. I think their drink menu has some good variety when it comes to beer, wines, and cocktails, but it is a on the pricey side. 

Now, their dinner menu is awesome. Great selection. Almost too much to choose from. We were there with another couple and we all ordered 2 different rolls, and a sashimi platter. My stand out favorites were the flaming hamachi roll, spicy tataki, green dragon and the crunch melt. All were different and very fresh. 

I have to say, sushi is my favorite thing to indulge on, but Shakou is definitely pricey. Is it the best sushi I&#39;ve every had.....? Not really. It was great, like super fresh and very tasty, but for the price I guess I could go somewhere else and get the same quality for a fraction of the price. Just to put it into perspective, we were 4 people, we all had drinks, 2 rolls each and a sashimi platter and we walked out of there spending over $300.... 

I&#39;ll definitely go again for special occasion, but it won&#39;t be my go-to sushi place."

Everything was good, from the service to the food.  The reason for giving 3 stars is that I&#39;m comparing it to my other sushi options in the area.  Shakou emphasizes a club-like atmosphere.  When we were there, they were playing dance club music, and the lighting/decor was reminiscent of a club.  That&#39;s not really my thing.  To each his/her own.  I found the prices to be quite high for what you get.  I felt the food was not as good as many other sushi restaurants I&#39;ve been to, so I would opt to go somewhere cheaper that tastes better.  The service was excellent.  I found our server to be very nice/friendly and very on top of things.  If you&#39;re looking for a Hollywood kind of night out, this is a good place to go.  If you want something more mellow, you might want to go elsewhere."

We were seated right away at a booth and I personally really liked the interior. Our Waitress was nice but the food was just horrible. I ordered the salmon teriyaki and the &#34;steamed vegetables&#34; were soooo undercooked!!! The zucchini was hard and spongey I couldn&#39;t eat it all. My husband ordered sushi and rigimi. Both were disgusting. The fish on the rigimi was so warm and since it&#39;s raw fish you would think it should be cold, right? He only had half a bite of one of the pieces and left the rest. He also had one piece of the sushi and left both plates full and the waitress didn&#39;t bother asking us if she can get us something else or not. We paid $100 to leave hungry. Not returning."

Sure sure, I know it&#39;s Barrington but you can&#39;t charge double or triple the cost what other sushi places in the area charge. How can ONE roll be nearly $20? We prob won&#39;t go back.

This is the second sit-down sushi place in town, joining Sagano around the corner which has been around since the dawn of time. Shakou is a modern, trendy and buzzing atmosphere which is very popular. It is arguably the most trendy restaurant in town. Recently, they opened their rooftop dining facilities which are open air - I haven&#39;t been up there, but it looks awesome from the street and I have heard it is great.

I generally break sushi places down into three categories. You have &#34;stand sushi&#34; which would be like Sushi Station or even grocery store sushi...quick, convenient, sort of the hot dog stand of sushi, generally pretty affordable and pretty forgettable (assuming it is edible)....then you have what I would call &#34;mid-tier&#34; - these are generally family run places that have been around for a while - probably were super exotic in 1992, very traditional interior etc...and generally an OK experience, though again, often forgettable. Prices are a bit higher, but not too bad. Then you have &#34;Flagship.&#34;

Shakou falls into the Flagship category...the type of sushi place against all others are judged. I know of one other place within 15 miles that can match it&#39;s food....I would also put the food on par with just about any flagship sushi place in the Midwest. It is good! The variety is quite diverse - you can get your simple California role, or something super colorful that is probably on fire or something. The atmosphere is trendy chic and what I would call dressy casual....a pair of chinos and a colored shirt would be ok, you&#39;d not be feeling overdressed in a suit, a pair of nice shorts....your t-shirt and baseball cap, not so much.

The menu is pretty extensive and even if Grandpa Bill doesn&#39;t eat sushi, he can always order a steak or something. The downside if you are doing Maki here is the price. Generally they are 15 to 20 bucks a role here...and who orders one roll? You can easily run up a $40 or more per person tab without drinks....can you do it for less? Sure, but whole sections of the menu would be off limits. Let&#39;s just say I won&#39;t be ordering take-away from here any time soon....in my mind, this is really more of a special occasion, first date type of place. I am sure there are regulars who go there quite a bit, but I think it is cost-prohibitive for that - just me....for that special occasion though, or when you just want really well done sushi, Shakou fits the bill...one thing that does annoy me though - all their testimonial banners on their website from NBC and local media outlets...I am really hoping that this doesn&#39;t turn into a big chain - they already have 4 locations - in my experience, restaurants go way downhill when they try to have one in every town."

We had a party of 12 with 6 checks. The restaurant refused to split the checks and became frustrated when we asked. They also forgot several of the dishes in the party and they were brought out after we finished eating and included in the bill, plus the roll she accidentally out in. Terrible.

We have always had great meals and service at Shakou. 

The sushi rolls are creative and tasty . I like the seared rice for a departure from the normal preparation.

My entree tonight as every time I am here was the Sea Bass . A beautiful piece of buttery fish with fresh grilled vegetables . Tastes great almost feels like a healthy choice . 

The bartender Matt makes a wicked Manhattan. Tonight we followed that up with an excellent hand made Old Fashioned that our server Jean made for us.

I  think the price is reasonable and our food was phenomenal. The service was going kind of slow but it was a busy Saturday night and we couldn&#39;t decide what we want for our entree once Keely checked on us so it took forever for our food to come but that&#39;s not the restaurant&#39;s fault. The 20 pieces sashimi plate for $30 is a steal! Our drinks were awesome. Anyway I have to admit that the music was too loud and 8 of us had to yell talking to one another across the table.

The food was so-so, the wine was over priced compared to other restaurants in Barrington.  The service was adequate, nothing more. The loud techno music needs to be turned off and more conversational dinner music to be played.

I ordered brown rice instead of white rice and they charged me for it. I was very surprised to have to pay an additional three dollars just for a bowl of rice. 

If you need to be in a glitzy restaurant this place is for you. The outdoor upstairs patio was very nice but I don&#39;t think we ever go back there again."

But not the case in my experience. I was there this past Saturday with a bunch of my girlfriends and we were in the upstairs bar/lounge area. We each placed our drink order and requested the bartender to split our checks(needless to say I can&#39;t think of his name -the guy with a Mohawk) apparently he had a problem with this and he showed this to us by rolling his eyes and saying &#39;whatever!!!&#39;. Sorry, we only asked 4 separate checks,that&#39;s too much to ask! We were shocked! One of our friends&#39; was from out-of-state, visiting us and we wanted to take her to one of the coolest places in Barrington, well I&#39;m sure this place made a great impact on her! We did not place another drink order with this gentleman and proceeded to go downstairs as our table was ready. The hostess wasn&#39;t very happy and commented that we should&#39;ve come downstairs earlier as she texted us a while ago. Wow, really? 
When we were seated, we made it clear to our server that we wanted our checks split to which she said,&#34;haven&#39;t you been here before? We can&#39;t do that.&#34; ( don&#39;t know her name either as I believe she did not introduce herself) 
So we got poor service from not one or two, but 3 employees at this Barrington location and I&#39;m not sure I would go there again or recommend this to any of my friends. Oh! and  If you don&#39;t have cash, don&#39;t even bother, becuasue if you are going with a group, they will not do seperate checks!  I absolutely expect better service than what we received for their pricey drinks and would recommend McGonigle&#39;s pub across the street , where staff is always friendly, any day"

This review is about a month late, but my Valentine&#39;s date on the Saturday before was cut very short. And I mean 45 minutes short. I have never felt as rushed as we were that night. Food is great, and we had no intention of taking up the table for the entire night, but for the $100 we spent we were basically pushed out the door. Food coming 4 minutes after appetizers is a rookie mistake for a place like this. Then asked about dessert before half of our entrée was gone. My husband didn&#39;t even have a chance to finish 1 beer. He had to chug the last of it after the check was paid before our plates were cleared."

Shakou is a great new spot that brings a fresh hip atmosphere to barrington. This was opening weekend and they did a fabulous job of providing good service and excellent food. We had not eaten at any of the other shakou spots so we did not know what to expect - pleasantly surprised. They do need to work out a few minor kinks: we had to wait a long time between courses but we can forgive this on a packed opening Saturday.  The only true complaint is a very minimal wine list and no corkage - if you are only offering a dozen or so total wines and all inexpensive let your guests bring their favorite bottles and charge $25.00 per bottle. 

We will be back, but not often I they don&#39;t fix the wine issue."

However, if you&#39;re used to even halfway decent sushi or service, you will be disappointed if you go here. Overpriced for starters, but I understand good sushi can be pricey. Beyond that, the service had terrible attitude. I picked up sushi to go, asking for an extra side of eel sauce. They took that to mean don&#39;t even put ANY eel sauce on any of the sushi. Forcing me to drive an extra half hour back and forth for it, only to be met with a manager who tried to convince me the roll DID have eel sauce (it did not). 
Finally with my eel sauce, the sushi was still very sub par, beneath even the lowest tier sushi I have ever had. Great idea, terrible execution. Will not be returning. Learn a little something from the incredible service at the brunch restaurant next door.

When we got there, the hostess immediately lead us to seating, only problem was it was at the Sushi Bar, which we didn&#39;t want.  She then sent us upstairs where there were &#34;tables available&#34;.  Only problem was the tables were for seating of 8-10, which wasn&#39;t really what we had in mind either.  

We had no problem waiting at the bar, that had been the initial plan anyway.  She indicated it would be about an hour, so we ordered some calamari and some edamame to go with our drinks and wine.  Bartender was great, she helped us with a wine selection.  Less than 10 minutes later and before our appetizers arrived, we got a text message that our table was ready (???)  Ok...The bartender  transported the appetizers to the table for us, but we were a little skeptical based on the initial 15 minutes here.

From there forward it was outstanding.  Table by the window.  Good service.   I had the Sea Bass and my wife had the Short Ribs.  Both were as good as it gets.  I would highly recommend either and reasonable portions as well.  The atmosphere is great.  I don&#39;t recall the wine, but it was good and the wine selections by the glass were plentiful.

Just before we were leaving, we ran into some friends that were coming in for a late dinner.  They had been here before and had also been to the Shakou in Libertyville.  They indicated they loved it as well.

After thinking back through the night as I was writing this, I upgraded it to a 5star even with the hostess snafu, the rest just made up for the confusion.  Ww will be back."

I arrived a few minutes early and after I was seated I asked our waiter, Tim, if they had any specials:  His exact words: &#34;We have a bottle of wine on special, but it is $90 and I don&#39;t think you can afford that&#34;.  Seriously?  Then, not being familiar with all the nuances of sushi and feeling adventurous to order different then my standbys, I asked Tim for a brief explanation of some of the menu items.  He was curt, rude and could not be bothered.   The night went from bad to worse.  My girlfriend never received her water, I ran out of water half way through dinner, I had to get up and find our waiter to ask for another bottle of wine (when he saw me he assumed we wanted our check).   Tim walked quickly by our table a dozen times, never stopped to check on us, never asked how the food was and he rushed by so we could not even stop him and we tried.  Then when we wanted our check, the bus person had to track him down.  He stopped plenty of times at his other tables, but those patrons were little older and he assumed they would spend more than us I guess.  So, if you look like you are flowing with cash, this is a great place, if you are an average working girl/guy (who also happens to be a server at a different establishment), I suggest a different place.  Oh Yeah, I spoke to the manager (after waiting 10 minutes for him) and he just nodded and said:  Ok, well next time we will give you a free dessert.  There will not be a next time."

We though sure lets give it a try. We walked in and saw 2 people sitting down, others getting seated, and we saw some empty tables in the dining hall. We went to the front and asked if there was a wait and the little girl hostess said Yes its 1.5 hours. Im like for 2 people?!?!?!? SHe looked at me and said yes. My friend and I couldnt get out fast enough to find another restaurant. Are you kidding me 1.5 hours? Even the nicest busiest restaurants dont have a 1.5 hour wait how could a restaurant like this with no line out the door have such a long wait? I dont want to use my imagination on why they might have said it but we will not be returning Ill spend my money elsewhere. And reading the other 1-2 star reviews it sounds like some of the people who work here/own this place are not nice so Im glad I went elsewhere. I hate supporting selfish rude business owners."

The sushi was good but not as good as Tokio Sake or Bistro Wasabi. The service was absolutely horrid. We were told that it would be a 30 minute wait for a table on the patio. Ok so we went to the bar to get a drink. Before we got our drinks were even ready a hostess came over and said our table was ready.  We said give us a few minutes to get our drinks and settle up. We go to our table and no server. We see a server and ask her to find our server. The hostess walks by and doesn&#39;t check in. After 20 minutes of NOBODY coming to our table we flag another service and explained the situation.  She was great (Shannon I think?) and apologized and took our orders right away. My martini was terrible, what martini has huge chunks of ice in it?! At least they comped the drink. When we talked with the manager Zachary, he didn&#39;t apologize once, just told us why things had gone wrong. We said we&#39;d like to be back if the staff ups their game. He told us to show his card when we go in next time. He gave us a card with someone else&#39;s name on it! So weird."

We have ordered several things to share:  the Mushroom Salad was excellent, crisp with delicious dressing, a must try.  Fried Soft Shell Crab was fine but the crust/batter was a little too thick.  We also ordered two rolls, Black Widow was very unique, black rice topped with scallop, great presentation, special and delicious.  However the Fillo Wrapped Ahi Tuna was very disappointing, there was too much sauce over the roll and you couldn&#39;t tell there was any tuna inside, I did not like the texture and will not recommend that roll.  Lastly, the Chirashi with Seasoned Rice was good, sashimi were fresh however it would be better if the slices of fish were thicker.

The service was superb all the staff were extremely nice and helpful. The interior is amazing and the rooftop patio is gorgeous. I would go just for atmosphere alone let alone the food! Food was absolutely great. We had the pink cadillac, ocean drive, dragon fire, and black widow for rolls and I also had the seafood miso soup which was great and had a bit of a kick to it and lots of flavor! All the rolls were amazing probably some of the best sushi I&#39;ve had and I love that they give you the option of having black rice. I usually get brown but the black was a great alternative and get it extra flavor and density. My guy even said &#34;I don&#39;t care much for sushi but this I actually do enjoy&#34;. For dessert we were recommended exotic bamba which was very light yet sweet and hit the spot even though all the desserts looked absolutely amazing. We sat upstairs at the bar and the bartender Doug was super helpful and nice. I&#39;ll definitely be going back. 10/10 would recommend! Great for drinks and dates too!"

The menu is gi-normous; loved the huge and creative variety of maki rolls plus the large selection of fish to choose from for both nigiri and sashimi entrees. There was also a sizable part of the menu that had non-raw fish selections(like steak, duck, chicken, etc.), which I&#39;ll probably add to my order list when I come in the next bunch of times. Our server Liz was very attentive, knowledgeable and engaging to work with--she even made some good white wine recommendations to pair with our sushi and brought out this huge slice of amazing chocolate cake with a lit candle without anyone in our party having requested it.The ambience was really cool too:if you were to turn Versailles into a minimalist 21st combination of restaurant and cocktail lounge, this is the place: high ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, black velvety-looking walls with matching booths, chandeliers, sexy metallic-finished bar/dining area, chill-out techno playing overhead--it was like no other sushi restaurant I&#39;ve been to in the &#39;burbs. The clientele was a mostly a mix of families with kids who sat in the half of the place that had the booths and larger tables; in the bar area, there were mainly young women celebrating someone&#39;s birthday, and middle agey-looking couples. There were even these 2 cute little old ladies who shared a front booth, who appeared to be enjoying the food and the vibe of the place. Overall, I would definitely come back here; this place really livens up downtown Barrington, so having grown up in neighboring Barrington Hills, it was great to see such a hip, vibrant business move into town!"

The girls at the front desk were extremely rude and didn&#39;t even try to be helpful. While I was discussing an issue with my reservation that I had made with one of the rude host girls, the manager or owner walked up. I thought my issue would get resolved at that point, but instead the owner/manager was even more rude than the host girl. I couldn&#39;t believe it! The food is very expensive and pretty much just like any other sushi in the area. The owner/manager needs a reality check that just because they are new and busy right now doesn&#39;t mean they will stay that way if they don&#39;t keep the customers happy and wanting to come back.

The sushi all tasted like the fish had been stored in lemon juice, which unfortunately is common among restaurants that try to mask the flavor of old fish.   All of the sushi &#34;leaked&#34; on the plate, further suggesting something wasn&#39;t right with the fish.   The only thing worse than the food was the service.  The service was slow.  It took at least 20 minutes to get menus, then another 20 minutes to get our drinks, and then another 40 minutes to get the four selections of sushi we ordered.  When we finally got our food, two of the orders were wrong.  The server just rolled her eyes and took it away.  When she came back with the right order another 25 minutes later, never saying a word, just dropping the plates with a loud thump and a crappy attitude.  To top everything off,  I was sick for a day after eating something at this place.  All of this for came at a high price, too.

THRILLING... that sums up the feeling this foodie feels about Shakou coming to the village!
Not only was the food exquisitely presented but it tasted delicious too! We mostly had Sashimi and Nigiri. My litmus test for great sushi is, how well the fish stands on its own without sauces! I love the creative and out of the box rolls, however, they mask the true flavor and freshness of the fish. I am more than delighted to say the fish was fresh, flavorful, and at a perfect temperature. Also, the flavor of their rice was nothing less than perfection! Not only do they have typical Japanese restaurant cuisine but they have entrees with such meals as Chilean Sea Bass, Tilapia, and other delightful looking meals. I definitely plan on making this a regular dining experience. I held back on the desserts but they looked fabulous! My birthday dinner will be celebrated at Shakou and I will definitely be trying their desserts."

The interior has been updated giving the eating area a more contemporary look.  My husband and I noticed the downsized menu perhaps for the new owners to make the restaurant &#34;their own&#34; while trying to maintain some resemblance of the familiar food items from the previous owner. We also notice they are now serving one slice pizza with a soft drink (great idea!).  Being that we were hungry the pepperoni pizza hit the spot until our meal arrive.   the pizza  crust can be better perfected but the toppings and the melted cheese made up for any missed marks from the crust.    We ordered for the entree  meal  the chicken vesuvio and the eggplant Parmesan.  My husband filled up on the pizza, salad and soup so when his meal arrived he was already satified so his entree will end up being tomorrow&#39;s meal.  My eggplant parmesan was excellent what I noticed about this dish was the eggplant was perfectly cooked it was somewhat firm yet cook not the mushy fall apart eggplant that I have had in the past at other establishments.  And the best part was-  I was able to taste what an eggplant is suppose to taste like when cook properly - GREAT JOB! 
 I also enjoyed the conversation with our hostess great customer service.  
In the past I would normally order for pick up and my husband would pass on a meal at Zio but tonight we both felt that the quality of the food and service will bring us back to dine in or pick up.  Give the new owners an opportunity to showcase their specialites."

New ownership three weeks ago.  Surprise after reading the other reviews.  Front room being remodeled to more roomy. Rosa, the server was a treat. Very helpful and constantly checking my satisfaction.  Maybe because I was the only person eating in (it was a really crappy night).  They were doing pizza carryout business.
Anyhow, nice tasting two medium size meatballs with fresh homemade tomato sauce.  A rather pedestrian salad of chopped iceberg and some tomato, tho nicely chilled.  Spaghetti Bolognese was quite tasty, but a little light with sauce and served in a cool bowl.  I told Rosa and I think this will be fixed.  The chef came out also to check.  Nice touch.

The orders are always done by time to pick up.  I&#39;ve heard from fellow customers their salads are great too, however, I haven&#39;t tried them myself.  

They offer pick up and delivery, as well as a small seating area of probably 5 to 7 tables.  Inside looks kind of dated, but tables look nice.  Come for the food, not the decor.  Great place for a quick lunch or take out dinner!

Very welcoming. Explains everything. Checks on you to make sure you like what you eat.

Everything is made from scratch so sit back, relax and enjoy the experience. 

We went in for the groupon deal. Started with the bruschetta that had a balsamic on it that i just wanted to bottle up and eat with every meal. The presentation was almost to good to eat.  Almost!

The meals came with soup or salad. I had the salad with a homemade garlic dressing. Very light on the garlic, nothing overpowering. He had the made from scratch 2 mins ago brocolli soup. Not your typical soup but so fresh and great flavors. Highly recommend trying.

Entrees were chicken vesuvio which i thought was a little over seasoned with herbs but he was quite pleased. I had the chicken marsala over pasta. Quite tasty! Both had a beautiful presentation in large bowls.

Dessert was the tirmasu. Minimally coffee flavored until the last bite which made me happy as I&#39;m not a coffee fan.

Overall we left full, had leftovers and didn&#39;t feel like we had an unhealthy meal. A great alternative to cooking yourself and cleaning up afterward.

The only other thing that could push it over the top would be to serve alcohol or at least wine. BYOB? I&#39;d never cook again!

Our waitress who i believe is one of the owners will treat you like family and not turn away someone hungry just because its close to closing afterall that&#39;s what Italians do.

My true rating would be 4.5 stars. .5 deduction for the outside lamp post gleaming in my eyes at times facing the window. Forced me to look closer into his eyes to avoid it. I would suggest a 2nd pizza sign on the window to block some of the light. Next time I&#39;ll sit on the other side of the table or farther from the door.

Try for yourself!  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed."

The waitres/manager is definitely not a multitasking person. It took her forever to take our order. The menues are pampleths that usually people take for home. The food was ok. Absolutely nothing special. We had fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms, personal cheese pizza, bruschetta, chicken parmesan, and the salad that usually comes with the entree.

The restaurant lacked charm and the food was very basic. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza and it was just O.K. The crust was way too buttery. Not what I would call Chicago pizza at all. The veal parmigiana was elementary. Very thin and tasteless. Seemed like it was frozen veal and smothered in thick sliced cheese and in a pool of tomato sauce.

Upon arrival, the strip mall restaurant was tiny...I believe 4 tables total on the inside (maybe more, a few were pushed together for a large, arguing family...ugh, keep that at home next time, will ya?).

I always worry about small places like this, but those fears went away upon ordering. The gentleman whom I believe was the owner came out and explained the Living Social deal we had (which we knew already, but he was kind &amp; helpful). We ordered the Calabrese salad as the appetizer. It was made on a plate big enough for the two of us, it was delicious. The balsamic vinegar was sweet, but not too sweet. Tomatoes needed  little salt, but local fruit isn&#39;t in season yet. Terrific dish.

I ordered the veal marsala with mushrooms; it was outstanding. The marsala wine was sweet, the mushrooms soft, and the veal itself terrific. My wife ordered Chicken Vesuvio, and it was excellent as well with rosemary &amp; seasonings that I&#39;m used to having (coming from a half-Italian family, I &#34;know&#34; what Italian food should taste like). There was a nice loaf of nearly-toasted bread on the table as well, with oil and Parmesan cheese available. The entire dining process, though in a small space, was terrific. 

As part of the Living Social deal, dessert was included. My wife ordered a cannoli, and she at it since I&#39;m not a fan of that kind of pastry. She said it was really, really good. It looked good to me, I&#39;m just not a fan of that particular flavor. 

There&#39;s a real &#34;family feel&#34; to the restaurant. Everyone was friendly, hard working, and they were driven to make their customers happy. I was just thrilled that even with a Living Social deal we weren&#39;t relegated to a &#34;harrumph&#34; and being ignored, which is the case most of the time at other restaurants...which is a shame, as we personally tend to tip MORE when we use such a deal. If only those servers at other restaurants knew that. Oh well, their loss.

OVERALL: we wil visit again if we&#39;re in the area. Terrific food. Great service. Small location, but it wasn&#39;t busy when we went and the food was outstanding."

We carried out and though they do have a small dine-in area (4 tables seating 4 each).  They have a good variety of house entrees, but you can also pick your sauce and pasta.  We ordered the spaghetti putanesca and the linguine pesto.  Both entrees came with bread and we chose salad (option for soup as well).  We loved every bite.  Both dishes were delicious and hearty, and authentic.  The putanesca had just the right amount of olives (black and green) and capers.  And the pesto sauce was perfect, with pine nuts chopped up and mixed in.  Even the bread was delicious...served warm and stayed warm on the drive home.

Which I tried and could NOt do so I call her again and inform her that their website does have that function. And all she can say is well there is nothing we can do on our end you have to contact them yourself. So I inform her again that the only phone no. On THEIR website is THEIR no. And she doesn&#39;t know what else to do just keeps repeating that its not their problem because all they do is cook but they don&#39;t get any of the money till much later!  And that was it! She stopped talking as if that&#39;s all she had to say. So I had to ASK her for the number of their WEB COMPANY so I could talk to them. She calls me back with the number and has the gall to say that they&#39;ve done everything they need to do on their end now I have to talk to the web company myself and she can&#39;t guarantee that they will give me a refund!! Unbelievable! I call the WEB Company and OFCOURSE they say they don&#39;t deal with individual customers and all refunds have to be processed through the business owner. DUH?!?!  So I HAD TO ASK THEM TO CALL ZIO GIOVANNI AND TELL THEM THAT.  Then I was able to get my refund. 

I don&#39;t mind occasional incompetence. Them not knowing how to handle this situation,  not being knowledgeable about their own website, miss informing me, etc.  that&#39;s fine. Things happen and no ones perfect. 

BUT their careless attitude about their customers added to that incompetence is unacceptable. She kept saying over and over again that there is nothing they can do because they haven&#39;t gotten any of my money and theyre only getting a check at the end of the month. Which okay I understand.  I&#39;m not asking you to refund me back from your own pocket. But that doesn&#39;t mean your responsibility ends here.

Pasta = Excellent! I loved the pasta here and will definitely be back to have more.

Pizza = Just ok. I&#39;d eat it again, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for it or make it a regular thing.

Service = Excellent! There was just one guy handling everything (carryouts and dine-ins) up front. He was very nice and did a good job. It&#39;s what i&#39;d expect from a little Italian place like this.

Restaurant/decor - It&#39;s just a little place. There are 3 or 4 tables and that&#39;s it. This is nice aside from the fact that when it&#39;s cold out, you get blasted with cold air every time someone comes in or out. Aside from that, I liked the coziness of the place.

How did we not find this place sooner? The coupon we had- was for pizza. We ordered the Southwest, 14in, which was plenty for us. The pizza was great! Great amount of toppings, sauce and cheese, on top of that? It was nice and hot! We also ordered the Alfredo with rigatoni noodles. After reading all of the reviews, and seeing that everyone loved pasta, how could we go there, and not order pasta? It was amazing! It&#39;s so hard to find a good pasta place- more so, a place that has good prices.My boyfriend and I live for great pasta dishes! Pasta was  pipping hot, and truly some of the best &#34;dining out&#34; pasta, we&#39;ve ever had. 
The only downfall- some noodles were covered in sauce, others had no sauce on it. All pasta dishes come with, salad, and warm, very soft bread- I tend to be a bread snob, and LOVED this bread. The salad was very good, no brown on the lettuce, and topped with fresh veggies. (Onions, tomatoes and cucumbers) The dressing, was Italian vinaigrette- which is always a hit or miss. It was more less all oil- but still good.   
The gentlemen that helped us, was super nice, and very charming (We believe he was the owner) Gave us a few different coupons, for our next visit. Every table was filled- so that is a good sign! 
If you are in the mood for pasta, this is the place to go to!  

We had no problem finding it- but again, we knew right where it was- since we use to purchase pizza, from the place that use to be there, a few years ago."

They said had to dine in, though the Groupon did not list that restriction. No big deal, though annoying.  We then went again last week. Groupon was for an appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 dessert.  We ordered fried calamari, but was told only 2 kinds of apps from the menu could be ordered with the Groupon, and calamari was not one of them.  Again, no restrictions were listed on our Groupon. Told him that was wrong, but no argument, we got 2 house salads instead (another option) and they were very good.  We ordered a veal parmigiana and another veal dish, both mediocre, though the side pasta/sauce was pretty good. The cannoli we got for dessert was OK.  My Italian wife was not impressed with any of it. This restaurant is best suited for carryout, had only 5 small tables overlooking a pop machine, and no music/sounds except from the pop machine/cooler. Maybe other dishes are better, pizza may be good, but we will never know. Not a bad value for just fair food with a Groupon I guess, but even the current Groupon  (2/28/13) does not list any restrictions that the guy (owner I believe) gave us."

We had a living social deal so got the bruschetta, veal Parmesan, cheese ravioli with cream sauce, and cannoli for dessert. 
The bruschetta was delicious and is the only reason I&#39;m giving it two stars. The veal was awful and the pasta it came it with was very hard, not even close to al dente, and the sauce was bland. The ravioli was decent, but we&#39;ve had better. The cannoli was also just ok. 
We walked in at 8:45 on a Friday night and the first thing we were told was &#34;we&#39;re closing in half an hour&#34; even though they&#39;re supposed to close at 10.  And since we had a living social deal, we couldn&#39;t get the food to go. We felt rushed from the beginning. The family who owns the restaurant was sitting in the corner eating and made a lot of noise that I could barely hear my husband at times. 
I appreciate small family owned restaurants, but this one is awful. With the deal, tax, and tip, we spent $30 on our meal. Not worth it at all and we won&#39;t be back."

But after today&#39;s experience i have no more patience as the way they conduct their business is extremely unprofessional and lacks any regard for the customer&#39;s time. 

I ordered chicken wings and was told to pick them up in 20 minutes. I arrived in 20-25 minutes and waited in front of the counter along with others eagerly waiting for someone to help us. 10 minutes passed without any greeting, i thought it&#39;s okay they must be busy so i will continue to wait....waited another 10 minutes and still no service. At one point one of the workers came out from the back but did not acknowledge the line of customers at all. Now i had waited an additional 30 minutes on top of the initial 20 for a single order of chicken wings! Are u kidding me? If u cant serve me then come out like a man and tell me sorry we are short staffed and cannot help you. Better yet, tell me when i order so i don&#39;t waste my time driving to your restaurant. After 1 hour of wasting my time without getting any service or food i left hungry and dissatisfied.

Just because you are one of the few halal pizza places in town doesn&#39;t mean you can disrespect and waste customers&#39; time as you please. Learn to manage traffic and communicate with customers when they are waiting. 

Finally, the food is nothing special....very mediocre and sub-par...that is, when they actually have their menu items in stock (if you don&#39;t believe me try ordering the behari kabab roll, I guarantee you they won&#39;t have it!)"

I chose to get the meat as I was already going to be out and about. I ordered Chicken Tikka and some mozzarella sticks. The sticks were a little bland but good hot cuz the cheese really pulls without breaking which I like. The chicken tikka was really good.

We waited about 40 minutes and our food was ready except the cashier did not ring us up for 2 pizzas, even though that was what the coupon was for, 2 pizzas.  Waited another 15 minutes and the second pizza was done.  

The pizza to me was plain, not enough sauce but honestly the sauce on the pizza was not very flavorful.  It is kind of like Little Caesars but not as much flavor.

The chicken wings were good, we had garlic parmesan and they were very tasty and had a nice kick.  I would order the wings again.  

My son had a gyro and he liked it a lot, he said there was a lot of meat on it and that he would definitely get it again.

Overall the pizza is not the best but I would probably go back for some of the other menu items.  The cashier was nice but I think he needs to be retrained, we witnessed him make so many mistakes over the time that we waited."

There is not much different about this location from the others in the Chicago area that I have visited. Quick and friendly service seems to be very consistent at all of the Jets Pizza locations.

I noticed that the people that waited on me were smiling and seemed like they were having a lot of fun at their jobs. Perhaps this is the secret to their great products- a fun working atmosphere?

As with all of the other locations that I have visited, it is take out only here. Orders can be placed by phone or on-line and will be ready and piping hot when you arrive.

I am a fan of the 8-corner the same as other reviewers- I prefer the butter crust but their regular crust is very good too.

Something to think about during the holidays is that if you ask, they will cut the pizza in smaller pieces- perfect to take to a party as a &#34;to share&#34; item!

I told him he could stop talking and just explained that I was trying to let him know how he came across so he could learn from it.  As I was leaving I noticed the Parmesan cheese packets were wet and soaked through, with what substance, who knows. I definitely wasn&#39;t going to be using them, so I tossed them on the ground (my bad). As I left my parking spot, two DIFFERENT guys came out of the store and one picked up the packets and threw them at me hitting my car and ran toward my car like he was going to try to hurt me.

If you are used to quality pizza from ma-and-pa places, like Dondi&#39;s up the street and the like -which are plentiful in the NW burbs -  you will be in for a huge letdown.  If you are in the Domino&#39;s/Little Caesars/Papa John&#39;s audience then perhaps you will like it or at least accept it if you are forced to eat it because a tween in your home insists on it.  After all, like the other chains, the product is geared toward kids with undeveloped taste buds.  They don&#39;t expect parents to like it, they expect the kids to like it - and drive the buying decision with their nags.

I call it heartburn in a box.  They brush so much oil on top of the pizza, presumably to enrich the flavor, that 15 mins after eating we all had terrible heartburn.  I am not prone to heartburn, and I&#39;ve NEVER had it from a pizza before.

We ate some, and tossed the rest in the trash.  Can&#39;t remember when I threw away pizza last.  Oh wait, yeah I can - the one and only  time we had Papa John&#39;s.

People like the crust because it is soaked with grease and fat.  However I am not a dog so my dietary requirement for saturated fat is not that high.

I will stick to the good stuff.  I could have had Lou Malnati&#39;s or Mug&#39;s for thin crust.  Oh well live and learn.  NEVER AGAIN.

I give them an extra star because the people were nice.  It is 1 STAR PIZZA at best."

I ordered the steak burrito (stop judging!), and we got a side of guacamole ($5). Since we dined in, we also received complimentary chips and salsa.

The salsa was spicy (nice!) but watery (not nice!). The guac was seasoned alright, but was too purèed for my liking. Too bad it had chunks of tomato instead of onion. And the burrito? Okay, but a bit too much gristle and kind of bland as another reviewer mentioned.

I braved the bathrooms, which were surprisingly clean.

//Edit

I ate the leftovers later in the day. I think what I most didn&#39;t particularly like was that the chicken wasn&#39;t really well-flavored and the beans did not add much to the taste. The lettuce and tomato reduced any flavor there may have been. I did use the salsa to add more heat but it didn&#39;t quite help. Maybe the other meats are better?

It is even harder to find a good burrito place that is open late in the suburbs but this place is really good.  

Located on Lake St. in Addison, IL it is in a convenient location.  The place has a decent amount of parking but the lot can fill up very quickly especially late at night when the place us slammed.  

When I came here I ordered a large steak burrito.  They gave you chips &amp; salsa to eat while you wait for your food.  The chips &amp; salsa was very good.  They had a red &amp; green sauce &amp; they both tasted great.  

The steak burrito came out fairly quickly about ten minutes later.  This was pretty quick considering that the place was busy.  The burrito portion size was very big.  The burrito itself was awesome.  It didn&#39;t taste like a big salty grease mess.  It had lots of flavor &amp; was delicious.

It&#39;s open late and pretty early in the am. They have several dishes but my favorites are the basic tacos, sopes, tortas. I also am a huge fan of their chips and salsa. They are affordable and the taste is better than most taco places. Also, there is a HUGE sign that says order here, so if you want to dine in, you may need to order your food and let them know you are eating there. Even though the place is not too big, they take an insane amount of phone orders. I love the convenience calling my order in and that in 10 mins you can pick it up with out a hitch. I also like the servers who have been working there a long time. The girls are kind, respectful and know if your a long time customer.

I would give them five stars but we have little pesky problems that I have told them about. Once, the owner&#39;s son decided to give us only two salsas for an order of 4 people. They&#39;ve NEVER done that in 15 years of going there. EVER! So I made him give me more. He did so reluctantly. So for trying to save himself a lil bit of money, he sacrificed the great service they always provide. So for that they lose a star!

I got my sure fire staple the steak burrito dinner with the chips and salsa. While the food was not bad it just tasted like it was missing something. The steak needed some more seasoning and was a bit dried out. There was a good amount of it but I have definitely seen more. As for the chips and salsa the chips were great but the salsa was pretty much tomato water. It was in need of some serious help.

I got a burrito suizo that was just fantastic.  A giant burrito in a nice fluffy tortilla with perfectly grilled chicken inside, completely covered in what was some really flavorful Chihuahua cheese.  It was definitely a delight.  I also ended up with lemonade.  I have no idea how, I didn&#39;t order it.

Actually, I do know how.  There is a serious language barrier there to be sure.  I must have said something while ordering that sounded like lemonade.  I can&#39;t imagine what, but I&#39;m sure that was it.  

The place is lacking in ambiance to be sure, but if you ask me that&#39;s part of the ambiance.  Little holes in the wall are the best places to get Mexican food and it just adds to the experience.  Plus they had a TV on the wall showing old Mexican movies.

Overall a great little find, although if you&#39;re not comfortable being the only English speaker in a restaurant, I&#39;d recommend getting it to go."

I have lived in Addison my whole life and have been coming here since I was a kid but lately I have noticed that the staff at night are scamming customers. Me and my friend went here and got the same exact order but paid for them separately I was charged a dollar more than her and when I asked the waitress why she said it was tax. They don&#39;t give out receipts so you can&#39;t trace what you spent and the other night I was told my total was a certain amount only to look at my bank statement days later to see that they charged me way over what my actual total was. Of course because they don&#39;t give out receipts you can&#39;t get a refund. I am so disgusted that they would allow their staff to scam people and rip them off and do nothing about it especially since this is not the first time it has happened to me but I was willing to say the first time was an accident and gave them another chance. Boy do I regret that decision now because they took it upon themselves to rip me off even more than they did the first time. I will never go back and advise others to either pay cash and keep track of how much your total should be otherwise they will overcharge you.

Definitely don&#39;t expect fine dining. Don&#39;t expect presentation or balance. Expect hearty, unpretentious meals and friendly service. 

My first experience with Maccs was the mashed potato bowl. It definitely has the vibe like something you make at home out of convenience, but it&#39;s really good.  For under $10 I left full and happy. Not a mind blowing dining experience but a good meal.

Today I tried a burger and was very pleasantly surprised.  The burgers are a solid half pound, the buns are nicely toasted. I&#39;d call it the best burger in the area compared to other Americana fry counters like Dr Dogs or Sammy&#39;s (both of which I like). The surprise was how good the bacon was on the burger. Most burgers get some sad, wilted, tiny bacon sliced so thin it hardly exists.... this burger got a solid few pieces of good bacon, cooked crispy (but not grilled to dust). Lots of melty cheese and a huge pile of waffle fries firmly established Maccs as my new go-to for lunch in the area.  I&#39;d even say that this burger holds its own and possibly beats out fancier places in the area like Bulldogs.  It&#39;s definitely worth a try."

I ordered a regular burger with cheese and my mom ordered a san diego burger. Our burgers were extremely generous and they came with a side, we picked fries. Ive never seen fries like these before, they were a cross between steak fries and curly fries and sooo good, yum!!! I wasnt able to finish my meal, i was stuffed and took my leftovers home.

The service was also great, the staff working were attentive and super friendly, i love small businesses and will definitely be back. Next time i will try a sandwich, update coming soon!"

The order was ready 12 minutes after I ordered it, and the staff were very nice on the phone and in person. I had the volcano wrap, and it could have  been good if it had a sauce that added some acidity, brightness, and moisture to the fish - not sure if it had the Cajun ranch on it as described in menu. However, I was happy with the freshness of the ingredients and crunch of cabbage, fresh jalapeños, and onions. My boyfriend had the Grecian chicken kabobs. The rice pilaf they came with had fresh lemon juice on it, which made it so good, but the chicken itself was pretty dry and could have used a yogurt/cucumber sauce or something else to add moisture. The included vegetables (onions, peppers, and tomatoes) were nice though, and overall it was a good portion with 2 kabobs worth of meat and vegetables. The brownie we shared was big and pretty great - super moist and very chocolatey."

Even Dunkin Donuts will give you a large plastic cup for $.50. Come on Panera Bread, treat people a little better.

Ordered a turkey sandwich with everything, including mayo and mustard ( at the last visit which was a few months ago I ordered the same and got a sandwich with only turkey and bread). Ok, well this time they gave me two tablespoons of mustard and I had to scrape it off with a knife, still all I tasted was mustard, essentially inedible.  Ordered it to go and didn&#39;t realize all that mustard was on there until opened it at home.  Then, no chips were in the bag.  Husband ordered half soup (French onion) which stank so bad he had to go to another room to eat it and half sandwich, no bread for his side either.  So, paid full price, didn&#39;t get either of our sides.  Since it was -5° outside, he didn&#39;t go back and return it. We gave up complaining, as the last three visits our order was wrong. Oh!! Once, they were out of country bread!!! I&#39;m looks the cashier like seriously, you&#39;re branded as a BAKERY! MAKE SOME BREAD. Ugh, just remembered how every time we go there there&#39;s a problem, which is usually corrected when we eat in, but don&#39;t bother taking food to go.

What I don&#39;t get are the patrons who stand and stare at the menu as if were written in Heiroglyphics while standing at the cashier. I wanted to elbow them aside and place my 10 second order. That&#39;s the way I felt since I was famished and needed sustanence.

Ordered a pizza to pick up. Half pepperoni, half sausage. I get this combo quite often when trying out a new place because I like to find out about the quality of their sausage + pepperoni.

Went in to pick up the pizza and had a short chat with the owner. Very friendly guy.

Onto the pizza.......it was alright. Not special in my book. The sauce was a little on the sweet side. Not crazy sweet but I still picked up on it. I prefer a more acidic sauce as my choice but I&#39;m open to try them all. Crust, Cheese + toppings were alright, a little heavy on the cheese.

A big factor in having a great pizza is balance in the ingredients. A little hard to explain but when it&#39;s there, you know it. Neapolitan style is my favorite, but I like all types of pizza.

This pizza was only OK to me but I&#39;m sure others will like it more who prefer a sweeter type sauce.

My quest continues for the perfect &#39;Za and I have a few new leads.

Bottom line is this: Always support your independent pizzeria owner. Always!!"

Can&#39;t comment on the crust or cheese or anything as all that could be tasted was sauce. Sauce, sauce, and more sauce. And not a particularly good-tasting sauce, at that. 

I started the experience by wondering what took me so long to try them, being how they are located in the same plaza as Dino&#39;s (my favorite burger). Now I&#39;m left wishing I never bothered.

So my brother and I were in the mood for a slice the other day and I usually hit this place up for their panzarotti (deep fried calzone) but wasn&#39;t quite that hungry - so we just got the jumbo slices instead. On a side note if you like calzones try the panzarotti - it is further proof that if you can deep fry something it will make it better! So that being said the slice of pepperoni was good and somewhere in between a thin and a double dough. Its was covered in pepperoni so I couldn&#39;t complain and they had a side station to load up on chili flakes and the usual green can parm cheese.

Overall for around $4 the lunch special for the slice and a pop is a good deal and definitely enough to fill you up without making you feel like you need a nap. In all honesty I still go here basically for the panzarottis. If you have never tried one before give it a chance and you wont forget it."

Also, the best slice special I have ever seen.
Quality product!!!"

There was a sign on the door ... 2 slices and a drink for like.. $6-something. 

The place is pretty small, I guess it&#39;s more of a carry out place than eating in. But, I&#39;m an eater-inner and they had 3 tables so I occupied one. =)

Their slices are wide and thick. Very tasty but not the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had. They had a handful of other food options too (hotdogs, beef, etc) so maybe I&#39;ll stop by another time.

It actually seemed really popular too. There were a lot of people coming in and out while I was there so it must be a community favorite."

I&#39;ve been here twice. Once when they just opened and once now. I didn&#39;t like it the first time I tried it, but decided to give this place a second chance. I just don&#39;t get why people like it so much.

Everything is sooooooo salty. 

I guess the best thing about this place is the waffle fries... just that nobody else has them in that shape. They still taste like a french fry. I was grateful that they didn&#39;t put much salt on the fries... I guess to balance out the sodium content in the chicken?? 

So today I got the chicken nugget meal. I paid over $8 for some tiny pieces of very, very salty chicken and room temperature waffle fries. Not worth it at all.

The first time I went here, I got a chicken sandwich and I was not impressed with that either. It was salty back then, salty now.

Most likely will never come back."

Within 1 minute, she had given me a warm damp towel to clean my boots with! 

Very polite staff, and the food is great. Only thing was I wish my sandwich was pipping hot, as it was actually pretty lukewarm - something I was confused about b/c it was so busy!

There are plenty of other breakfast items but these are the only two I choose to order. My boyfriend is more health conscious than me so he enjoys any one of their chicken breast breakfast sandwich a la carte.

I have been hearing from everyone how Chick-Fil-A has the best waffle fries and the best chicken sandwiches. We wanted to grab a quick dinner the other night and we chose to check out Chick-Fil-A. We went in the restaurant because we wanted to see what they had. The drive thru is not the best way to experience a place, if you ask me. 

I&#39;m glad we went in to get our food. The staff is VERY friendly. The place is CLEEEEEAN!! There was probably 50-75 people in this joint and the place was hoppin&#39;; there were people cleaning tables and keeping the condiment station in order. Well trained staff, good job!!

We took a look over their menu and the nuggets stood out to me. My fiance went for the sandwich. We shared a large waffle fry and there was more than enough for the two of us. The nuggets were perfectly breaded. Here&#39;s my favorite part: they had a Chick-fil-a sauce that I tried. Seriously!! Best damn sauce they offer. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sweet and sour, but their chick-fil-a sauce was like a smokey honey mustard, and it was excellent. I&#39;m not even really a fan of mustard but it was surprisingly good.

My fiance inhaled his sandwich, so I&#39;m guessing it was pretty good. I can&#39;t wait to go back and next time, we&#39;ll eat in because the fries were a little cooled off by the time we got home to eat.

Their chicken tenders are delicious and taste homemade (non-processed tasting if ya know what I mean). I also have a soft side for waffle fries and theirs were made just so - the right amount of soft center and crispy edges.

Finally, the cookies n cream shake took me over the edge. It was soooo good. By the time I got to it the thing was so melty and delicious that I just sat and slurped it down with no breaks in between. Can you say &#39;fat butt&#39;?

This place is no exception. As far as service goes, you will not find a better restaurant in the quick-service industry. EVERYONE is happy to serve you like you are the most important person in the world. (Well, second-most based on CFA&#39;s religious views.) They have employees in the dining area to tend to their guests to do things like offer refills (known as &#34;refreshing their beverage&#34;), take plates and even pour pepper on salads. This is above and beyond what most QSRs do.

However, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a big fan of their chicken product. I don&#39;t know if it is because they use pressure cooking, but their chicken sandwiches themselves taste soggy and mealy. I like good service, but I like good food as well. And the food here does not resonate well with me. In addition, you only get 2 pickles on a sandwich and the rest of the toppings you add yourself. Also, no onions, and I&#39;m a big fan of the raw onion.

Also, expect long lines especially in the drive-thru. Even in this very liberal part of Illinois, Chick Fil A has LOTS of fans in the area who have no problem waiting 15-20 for their meal.

I might give these guys a try again in the future, though."

Good ol&#39; southern fried chicken is hard to find in Chicago and that&#39;s a fact. It should be marinated overnight in buttermilk, fried in a pressure cooker or a cast iron pot, and cooked in lard perhaps instead of oil. It&#39;s why I&#39;m so disappointed with Yankee fried chicken. 

At Chick-Fil-A, the spicy chicken sandwich was the closest thing that I have found in Chicago to true southern fried chicken. It was well seasoned where the flavor is not just in the batter but in the chicken itself. You can really see and taste the cayenne, paprika, and pepper. Even the flesh of the meat had a different color from being marinated overnight. 

Get the real thing and get a samich - no cheese needed here on this bun. It&#39;s only $3.50 for the samich alone and about $7 for a meal. It&#39;s no wonder that this place is packed.

Spicy chicken and waffle fries, what else do I need to say.  Not greasy, crispy, tasty and tender.  This was my first time here.  I tried yesterday and I am pleased to say, so did everyone else.

The controversy continues, but I ask you--what does chicken have to do with the First Amendment??  I was glad to see I was not alone.  Never thought The Constitution would bring me to a chicken sandwich, but I am sure glad it did.  Can&#39;t wait to go back.  P.S. sweet tea is awesome too!!"

The spicy chicken sammich is my personal fave and if you feel like tacking on a few inches to your waistline, try any of their shakes. Totally legit. Waffle fries are solid as is the simple egg and cheese biscuit during the morning hours. So, friendly service, fair prices, double drive through and efficient acquisition of bird sandwiches.

I&#39;m not shy about doling out 5 stars for truly excellent meals, but when it comes to fast food - Chik-Fil-A is the French Laundry of its arena.  In-and-out burger is a very very close second, due mainly to its disadvantage in the french fry department.  Back to Chik, the spicy chicken deluxe (add bacon!!!) is the best fried chicken sandwich I&#39;ve ever had.  

And those waffle fries?  Come on now -  amazing.  Top it off with a cookies and cream milkshake and you&#39;ve just enjoyed a nice slice of heaven.

When I am not up for it- I get a Wendy&#39;s spicy chicken sandwich and call it a day.

There shakes are ok- a bit too sweet for me.   I have been given a shake cup with a hole poked in the bottom from there stirring thing.  It was in the drive through and I didn&#39;t feel like getting out and I sure wasn&#39;t going to loop around to get a new one.

Ah how you have grown on me oh chick-fil-a burger! I can&#39;t say that I am on the addicted bandwagon, but the chicken burgers here are a nice change from the meat burgers of McD. Instead of finding a grinded up patty of chicken meat, you get whole chicken meat with crispy batter topped with a fresh bun with lettuce and cheese. You can customize it by adding on the different sauces they have (chick fil-a sauce, bbq, polynesian, sweet and sour, etc) The waffle fries are a huge plus, something about gigantic fries that you can dunk in the sauce. Great prices and quick service (I got my food even before paying)

Pro: fresh chicken burger, multiple sauces to customize your meal, waffle fries, quick service

Cons: close on Sundays, food is sometime too quick (i.e. it may have been sitting prepped already)

I love their ketchup dipper containers and they had all their dipping sauces out for my pillaging.  Yes, I now have a stash of sauces for my dunking pleasure.

This location, like the one in Wheaton, has a kids&#39; play area, and make sure to pick up a free breakfast coupon in the entry vestibule while they&#39;re still good.

-The food is delicious!

I had one snafu recently where I ordered my meal (in the drive through) with no pickles- and when I got back to my office I realized they misheard and put on extra pickles.  (I really, really, really dislike pickles.)  The owner was really great about correcting the mistake, and I felt like he really cared.  That&#39;s why I continue to return.  Too often major fast food corps. don&#39;t care and that leaves me very likely not to return after a mistake.  Here I felt the exact opposite.

I ate here when they were two weeks old so I expected there to still be a few kinks in their service and indeed there were. When you first walk into the store, it has the same look and feel as most Chick-Fil-A&#39;s with the same menu format and the same table set up as most other Chick-Fil-A&#39;s. However, since it is a rather busy place and more chaotic due to the heavy traffic it incurs, it&#39;s a bit crazy trying to figure out where the line for the registers form and how to navigate your way. Fortunately, the service people in front are holding up their hand when they&#39;re ready to take your order, but it&#39;s still difficult to figure out where to line up. Also, it&#39;s difficult to find a place to park the first time you&#39;re there, since the most natural place to park is next to the restaurant but the most intuitive place to park ends up being the place to the drive through.

The food quality and service are all decent. I was, however, a bit surprised that they didn&#39;t get my food order right the first time. I ordered a sandwich without pickles and my sandwich came with pickles. I also ordered ahead of three people and I got my food after them. Ordinarily, if my food was customized, I wouldn&#39;t mind for my food to come a bit later, but I ordered a generic meal so I was a bit surprised it took so long to come out.

All the chicken food here is awesome from their Chicken Sandwich Deluxes to their Salads to the Nuggets. I just enjoy eating a healthier meal (vs. something like a McDonald&#39;s) so I like coming here. I&#39;m sure this place will have the kinks worked out in a few weeks. I recommend it."

If that doesn&#39;t tell you how busy this place is, go see for yourself! I was there for lunch during the week and was lucky enough to find a decent parking spot and a place to sit in the restaurant. The drive-thru was jammed. Here&#39;s my thoughts:

Food: The waffle fries are excellent - great flavor and no signs of oil or grease. The chicken sandwiches are good and the portion is a decent size. My only thing with Chick-Fil-A is that my first experience with them was in suburban Atlanta, and I have yet to enjoy one of their chicken sandwiches as much as I enjoyed that first one. That one seemed to be spiced just a little differently - haven&#39;t found it to be the same since.

Service: Amazingly prompt for as busy as they were. One unusual thing that happened - an employee stopped by my table and asked if I&#39;d like a refill. Before I could reply, a manager (whose last name was the same as the store operator&#39;s name on the receipt - may have been his wife) pulled the employee away to talk to her about something that didn&#39;t sound too urgent.  Th employee returned a few minutes later and retrieved another drink for me.

I&#39;ll be back - though it may not be like my 1st experience, their chicken sandwiches are still pretty good and filling. Good to see this chain in the Chicago area - the more food offerings the better!"

I get it now. I really do. Never has a cherry popping been so delicious. THAT chicken! So tender, so juicy. They only sell chicken things, and they do it right. The Spicy Chicken Deluxe meal that I ordered made me very happy. It was spicy, there was pepperjack cheese, there were WAFFLE FRIES (the superior of all fries, it goes, in this order of awesomeness: waffle, curly, crinkle, thick-cut, then shoe-string. tots not included, obvi), and so many sauces! And an IceDream cone to round out the meal? (Banana pudding shake would have been overkil). I was in fat kid heaven.

It was pretty busy at an off-peak hour on a holiday, but the staff were really enthusiastic and efficient. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever encountered such friendly fast-food staff. The guy who took our order gave us SO MANY SAUCES! There were other employees around the store keeping it clean. Love the mayo and ketchup (squeeze or dip!) options at their condiments counter too. Breakfast menu seems totally awesome. Chicken biscuit, get in my mouth please.

Sure, this is not destination or fine dining. But, if you&#39;re looking for a flavorful chicken sandwich in the area, Chick-Fil-A will not disappoint - get the spicy chicken! Plus, a meal for 2 only set us back $13. Winner winner, chicken (sandwich) dinner!"

After three visits, I can honestly say my past KFC sandwiches have been more crispy (the chicken), the bread less soggy (than Chick-Fil-A&#39;s) and a better overall value.

Additionally, my cottage-cut fries were crispy on my first visit (the week they opened to much undeserved fanfare), but the fries have been too salty and floppy the last two times.

So that&#39;s it, they don&#39;t deserve 5 stars. If you really think they&#39;re better than KFC or Popeye&#39;s, please do yourself a favor and try the latter again to make sure your perception of the Chick-Fil-A brand isn&#39;t overpowering your taste buds.

Better yet, stick with Wendy&#39;s Spicy Chicken Sandwich, which is simply an A+ compared to the sandwich lauded at Chick-Fil-A.

Side Note: Some Chicagoland radio show asked folks what would be their ideal &#34;Fast Food Dream Mix&#34; and 90% of the callers named that Wendy&#39;s chicken sandwich for that category. It seems they do know something."

And if it&#39;s high end fast food a la Smashburger, it&#39;s a solid 3 stars.  Let&#39;s go with that.

There&#39;s not really much point to reviewing fast food - it&#39;s cheap, it&#39;s bad for you and it&#39;s the same across the country.  But there are few Chick-Fil-A&#39;s in the Chicago area so I might as well.  The best part about the chicken here is the southern-fried coating, which has a better flavor than anything KFC has to offer and seems to lock in the moisture pretty well.  I would recommend the chicken fingers to get the full experience unaffected by anything else, as my spicy chicken sandwich had too much bun and toppings to really enjoy the chicken.

Chick-Fil-A is fast food. There&#39;s nothing special or fancy or 5-star worthy about it. It&#39;s cheap, fast, and anything but good for you. At least if it tasted really good, I could justify the calories and fat content once in a while. 

I was dragged against to CFA against my own will - my dinner date just HAD to have one of those coveted chicken sandwiches. I was starving, my blood sugar was dropping, and I was getting cranky so I didn&#39;t put up a fight. At that point, I was about to chew off my own arm and wasn&#39;t in the mood for a wait at a sit down restaurant.

As much as I try to eat healthy, I wasn&#39;t about to come to the infamous Chick-Fil-A for the first time and order a salad or a wrap. So I opted for some chicken nuggets, a diet coke and a handful of my dinner companion&#39;s waffle fries. Were they good? They weren&#39;t bad. But they certainly weren&#39;t the best nuggs I&#39;ve ever eaten. Not to mention I couldn&#39;t help but think I was eating pieces of chicken pumped with hormones and no beak. (I think watching certain food documentaries has warped my mind).

I was overwhelmed with the sauce choices so I went with BBQ, Polynesian, and the Chick-Fil-A sauce. The BBQ sauce was fine - very standard. The Polynesian was your typical sweet &amp; sour. The CFA sauce - gross. It tasted of fats and egg yolks.The fries were okay - they weren&#39;t overly greasy (which is nice) but I would have preferred them a little crispier. I watched my sidekick inhale a deluxe chicken sandwich, so I&#39;m guessing he thought it was pretty good.

Let&#39;s be honest here. Chick-Fil-A is FAST FOOD. So, it&#39;s hard for me to push past the 2-star zone. If I did, I&#39;d be putting Chick-Fil-A in the same category as some renown Chi-town restaurants.

 I love Chick-Fil-A and just wish it was closer so I could enjoy my waffle fries and yummy spicy chicken sandwich every day. I love how this establishment thinks of everything possible to make it not just a fast food restaurant, but more of a quick bite with quality food and customer thoughtfulness. 

Come on now..who else has complimentary cheerios and placemats for the kids, International Delight creamers for your morning coffee, and my fav (haha) Purrell wipes for your hands after eating the greasy goodness of your fries??? They even have the new ketchup packages! I&#39;m usually not this easily sold, but I just think the small touches are nice. The service there makes you know that customers matter and it&#39;s always spotless clean in the restaurant.

It was some kind of kids day there and they had the Chick-Fil-A cow walking around greeting the kids, a coloring station for the kids, and a station for the kids to put toppings on their ice cream. The staff were genuinely friendly with the children. They have disposable table covers that stick to the table for young children to eat over.

The chicken is so juicy and filling. The waffle fries are beyond awesome! The food is not greasy and does not taste like they&#39;ve been deep frying the fries in 1 year old oil like other food chains I&#39;ve been to. The staff are very polite and display very good customer service.

I even noticed and LOVE the way they clean their tables. It&#39;s not a yucky dish towel that has been dipped under water and wiped on every table each time w/o being cleaned after each use. They use wipes from a wipes container. How frigging awesome is that! I don&#39;t have to worry about a yucky towel smudge of water on the table when I sit down. They even have purell wet wipes for after you are done eating.

For all you Chick-Fil-A haters, you guys are just wasting your breathe. How do you know that the McDonald&#39;s, or Burger Kings, or Wendy&#39;s, or Checkers, or Sonics don&#39;t have the same so called &#34;beliefs&#34; that you ignorant people are parading about. Shove it and eat else where and stop wasting your time trying to make people not eat here. This place has alot of better qualities than all the other food chains we have eaten at for decades. They even SPEAK FLUENT ENGLISH!!!

Food, service, staff, customer service, and quality of everything is just awesome. Need I say more!?"

The food was surprisingly great. They also had great customer service- people came around and actually checked to see I was enjoying my meal and to see if they could get me anything. It was sort of impressive. The store its self was clean and organized and sort of crazy with a double drive-thru that looked a bit like the tollway. Only at the end of paying your toll, you get chicken. Also, given the state of our tollways, the food may have actually been cheaper.

I also like that they are closed on Sunday. It&#39;s rare to see that sort of nicety in the fast food industry on behalf of faith or the employees or both. Any way you look at it, good for them.

So yah... really impressive, even with all the hype I was still impressed. If you haven&#39;t gone, join me in saying &#34;eff you,&#34; to your diet. Once in a while."

When I first tried it I didn&#39;t see what the big deal was but that&#39;s because I had the chicken nuggets. The gold is in the chicken sandwich. Add a little of their Polynesian sauce and yum! The chicken biscuit with cheese for breakfast is awesome too. 

The service here is fantastic. Even during the busy lunch hour the wait for the food was minimal and there is plenty of seating. 

Now that this location is open, which is close to where I work, I can see myself coming here quite often. As it stands I&#39;ve been here three times in less than a month!

My only gripe is the amount of waffle fries in the small leaves a lot to be desired."

So I was excited to hear that chick-fil-a was coming to Schaumburg.  I&#39;ve always enjoyed their chicken here.  Some people find the batter to be a bit bland, but I&#39;ve never really experienced that.  For a fast food place, chick-fil-a is semi healthy.  most sandwiches are under 500 calories.  None of their sandwiches come with sauce, so that allows you to put whatever and how ever much sauce you want on your sandwich.  I&#39;m very happy to say that they have Texas Pete hot sauce here which I have been deprived of for so long.  

My favorite by far is the Chicken Biscuit w/ Texas Pete applied liberally.  The biscuit is tender, not dry, and of course the chicken is delish.  The spicy chicken is also very good.  

As for the fries and extras, I can&#39;t really speak much about them.  The fries are ordinary waffle fries.

The Schaumburg store is clean and the staff is friendly.  It&#39;s extremely crowded now, but that&#39;s only because it is the newest place to eat.  There really isn&#39;t a whole lot to do in Schaumburg except eat or go shopping.

Empty tables were immediately cleaned, and there was a small army of people REFILLING BEVERAGES for people at tables as well as clearing trays. Amazing!

And, yes, there were a lot of kids there.

This was my first visit, so I went for the basic Chick-Fil-A sandwich meal with medium drink and waffle fries.

After wading through the dining area looking for a CLEAN table (c&#39;mon, Chick-Fil-A!) I finally found a spot right in front of the enclosed kids&#39; playground. 

I would say the chicken sandwich was good...moist and tasty. But it only came with a couple of pickles. Definitely could&#39;ve used some lettuce, maybe a tomato and some mayonnaise. 

The waffle fries were just average.

This location has two drive throughs and has been busy since the moment they opened.  Service was fast even though it was packed inside and in both drive through lanes.

As a child in the 70&#39;s , down in Springfield Illinois, we used to pick up Chick-Fil-A sandwiches at the mall carryout. They didn&#39;t have sit down restaurants back then, and their menu was very basic. Southern style, chicken sandwiches with pickles on them. Delicious.

The Original sandwich is exactly the same. Delicious. But oddly, I found my meal today not filling, even with the waffle fry side. I could have easily eaten a couple of them, but refrained. Now, maybe way back when I was  a teen I was consuming several at a sitting, but still, you don&#39;t want to leave a restaurant still hungry after ordering a combo.

Last time I went, I had a shake as well, and was satisfied, but that&#39;s not something you want to do every time, unless your mission is obesity. Maybe adding another healthy side would do the trick.

The service and sandwich are still a 10.
The waffle fries are a meh.
The side salad is an 8

Our standard deluxe chicken sandwiches were not huge, but they each had a nice hunk of tasty, tender, real chicken, not reconstituted patties of who-knows-what chicken parts. Even without mayo, the sandwiches were so good, we still didn&#39;t need to add any of the sauce packets we sampled, all of which were good as well. We instead used the sauces as dips for our real potato waffle fries. I say real, because the strings at McD&#39;s for example, taste more like salted cardboard. The cole slaw we had on the side was also enjoyable.

Our very friendly and professional cashier handed us our food almost instantly on the busy evening we visited. Elsewhere, other employees made deliveries to some tables and kept the place clean, while the cow mascot was hard at work entertaining children, stopping by various tables, and dancing with one of the patrons.

It&#39;s a busy, family oriented place with lots of kids around, but it has a friendly, not chaotic, atmosphere.  Frankly, we&#39;re sick of the big chains whose employees and corporate offices could care less about what or how they serve their patrons.

It&#39;s still fast food.  Is their chicken sandwich better than Mc D&#39;s, Wendy&#39;s or other joints?  Perhaps.  I don&#39;t really go out of my way for chicken, unless it&#39;s Harolds or Wings.

I&#39;ve had a lot of Italian beef sandwiches and I really like several different ones (Portillo&#39;s, Mr. Submarine and Buona Beef),  but none are like Garibaldi&#39;s.

Tonight I decided to order their pizza for delivery. Being hungry, I paid with a credit card and tipped $10 in advance hoping that would expedite things. WRONG!  The pizza arrives 25 minutes after the promised time. Not surprisingly, it was a ice cold mess. The cheese and sausage shifted during it&#39;s travels and congealed off the pie and onto the box. I had to set the box on top of old newspapers because grease had soaked through the box.

The slice of pizza is my far on of the worst I have ever tasted ,not just for this area which has notoriously bad pizza in my and my family&#39;s opinions, terrible doughy crust off tasting burning sauce and cheese that reminds me of the stuff you can purchase at jewel that easily melts tastes like candle wax at best. The garlic bread, first was burned, got a new piece, it&#39;s at best ok not worth the hype. It tastes just like the one I make at home. Consists of Texas toast log. The Italian lemonade is as well ok, but I doubt they make it, it reminds me of what you can purchase in a grocery store. All in all I&#39;m not going back, there is nothing to bring me back.

We both ordered slices of pizza and sodas to go. Two LARGE pieces of pizza (sausage for me, pepperoni for my boss), a free soda, and an additional soda were only $10.95. I really enjoyed my slice of sausage pizza. It was thin, greasy but not too greasy, with a crust with the perfect amount of crunch, and a good amount of sausage, which tasted great. 
 
The atmosphere was also cool: kid-friendly 50&#39;s retro. There is an Elvis statue, marquee signage, colors all over, and even a fish tank! I love fish tanks. It&#39;s the only thing I like about my dentist&#39;s office. This is the perfect place to bring your kids on a fun weekend night for dinner. It has a similar vibe to my fond childhood memories of Friday nights at Fuddruckers with my family, but way less dank. The interior is open and spacious. I definitely recommend this place for some indulgent food on a fun Friday night. Kids of all ages will love this place.

Back when I was a wee lad growing up in the Western suburbs I have vivid memories of seeing the Garibaldi&#39;s signage outside of North Park Mall in Villa Park. I also recall stopping in there on a few occasions for Ice Cream cones. Years later when North Park Mall was almost completely empty with just a few operating stores remaining (before transforming into a flea market) I visited again and tried the Pizza and other items before they were closed. There was also another Garibaldi&#39;s that opened and closed in Bloomingdale off of Army Trail road that I visited on a few occasions. While going through Arlington Heights I was aware for some time that there was still a Garabaldi&#39;s in operation and decided to stop in.

The first thing to note about Garabaldi&#39;s is that this place has some definitely kitsch style to it. From statues of Elvis, murals of celebrities from the 50s eating there, the whole ambiance of the place is very bright and welcoming.After looking over the options I noticed that they did in fact have a foot long hot dog and decided to order that being the hot dog critic. My friend ordered a slice of pizza. Not too long later our food was ready and it was time to dig in.

The foot long hot dog came on a toasted bun. The sausage itself was grilled and came with onions, mustard, relish and tomato on it. There was also a large pickle spear towards the center. While quite a bit different than a traditional Chicago hot dog. The Garabaldi&#39;s footlong was both a good deal and an excellent hot dog. I also cut off a piece of the dog for my friend to try and tried a cut off piece of their pizza. I liked the pizza as well, not too greasy, good sauce and cheese.

Overall I liked this visit to Garabaldi&#39;s and it easily exceeded my expectations for food quality and general atmosphere. I am going to give it four stars and a recommendation. Til the day I die I will always remember the mustached mascot of this chain."

This time I ordered the pizza (since it seemed like such a hot commodity the first time).

The first time back - I ordered a couple of slices of pizza. Very soft crust and a lot of cheese. The Mrs. had a chopped salad she said was pretty good.

The second time back - ordered a burger, my 2-year-old had a kids meal (which came in a paper-folded 1950s car...really cool. He HAD to take it home with him) and my wife tried the gluten free pizza. 

Sadly, the third time was the most blah time of them all. 
The gluten-free crust wasn&#39;t cooked through all the way and was soft doughy in taste. I would definitely not recommend the burger to anyone. It tasted like the frozen 30-pack kind you buy for a big holiday bbq to hold over a big crowd. 

The good news is this: pizza by the slice is a good deal and you get a lot of it. 
The kids meal comes in a cool paper car (and a pencil case). 
And the sandwiches are pretty good. 

So, if you avoid the gluten-free crust and burgers...you&#39;ll be a-ok. :)"

Don&#39;t give me wrong it&#39;s better than Pizza Hut or dominoes, I mean who wants to eat that garbage but it isn&#39;t much more magnificent. Being that I&#39;ve only had the pizza I cannot speak to the other menu items which there are many. The pizza would most likely be considered New York style pizza.

The people were friendly and efficient. They went out of their way to make sure that not only our group but everyone else in the restaurant was happy and taken care of. Food was delicious... everything from the Philly steak sandwich to the waffle fries right to the Greek salad. They helped us clean our table and wished us a good evening. 100% turnaround from the first time we came. We will definitely be going back to this establishment again.

I&#39;ve been eating Garibaldi&#39;s (at the Villa Park location) since I was a small child, so I was BEYOND ecstatic to find out that there was a Garibaldi&#39;s near where I bought my car from. It was completely worth the 45 minute drive from Aurora. I am, however, completely bummed that the Villa Park and Carpentersville locations mysteriously closed.

Anyway, the pizza was hot and fresh and came out quickly. The garlic bread was ah-mazing! And I love the fact that there&#39;s a soda fountain, so instead of going up to the counter to get my refills I can just do it myself! I loved the vintage decor (and the fish tank, which I think was a nod to the Bloomingdale location).

Some of the outlying menu items that are both delicious and difficult to get elsewhere - namely their &#34;steak supreme&#34; which is a bit like a Philly cheesesteak.  I&#39;d recommend you order a steak supreme on garlic bread with extra cheese and seasoned cheese fries (Merkt&#39;s)."

Now, about 10 years later they are back, with essentially the same menu, only bigger, and they even have one of the same people working there!  As before, the hot subs are truly wonderful.  The hot Oven Grinder, Steak Supreme, and Beef Grinder are fantastic, and about the same price as similar sized &#34;double meat&#34; subs at Subway. Cold subs are pretty good too, but the hot ones are where they shine.  The Steak Italiano platter is really a slightly larger sub without the bread, served on a plate with half a sub roll made up as garlic bread.  A great option.  The pizza can be fantastic, both the International and the Hot Italian especially, but beware, a 16&#34; is really a large pizza."

Walking into the facility, it is a very fun atmosphere, lots of cool stuff on the walls to look at. The cashiers are friendly and I LOVE their selection. My favorite is the Wisconsin burger with the cheese fries. Their cheese is a cheddar sauce and has a better, richer flavor than most. (I am a cheese-freak) :-)
The only negative thing about this place is the costs... It can really add up and be pretty pricey when I get food for the whole family. It&#39;s quality takeout, but not something we could/should be eating everyday.

It wasnt so much that what I got was horrible or even below avg...it just wasnt a Philly cheese steak... 

Anyway here is a quick checklist of everything else:

Cleanliness: A
Staff: B+
seating options: A
Ambiance: A(didnt know it was a 50s theme)
Food overall: B-

Its an ok place to eat....I think the prices are....ehhh...acceptable but not low at all.

I paid 10 dollars for a small/medium Philly style sandwich, a medium amount of seasoned fries and a drink with free refills....I dont call that cheap any way you cut it.

OTOH, the sandwich had a lot of meat/onions/, adequate amount of cheese...and the fries were quite good.

The fact that there is a good staff there and a wide menu with lots of options for kids and adults alike is what tipped the scales to a 3 star rating.

I didnt have the pizza though...maybe its phenomenal, who knows?"

I didn&#39;t expect the best tasting Chinese but I did expect something semi tasty. I love Chinese food but this place made me sick. 

I ordered the Orange chicken and fried rice, the chicken was dry, the glaze was flavorless and the fried rice tasted like metal. 

My coworker got the Kung pao beef and she threw the entire thing away after a few bites also saying her fried rice tasted like a burnt pan. 

We don&#39;t usually complain but we felt the rice crossed the line it no longer was a question of tasteless it was a question of rice not being suitable to eat! 

We called and explained to the lady our problem with our meal (which costs $10 a person!!!) 

Her response was &#34;that&#39;s the way our rice is supposed to taste&#34;

Mu Shu Pork was very good with a lot of meat, fungus, onions and cabbage. The best part was the wrap which was homemade! I could eat this all night long. 

Next was the Beijing Tofu which was their version of Ma Pao Tofu. The tofu was too firm and should use soft or medium tofu.

I have yet to find an AWESOME chinese take out place. None have come close to what I grew up with in Rockford.

We ordered the veggie lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, pork egg foo young, and hot and sour soup. The best of these were the lo mein, which I would order again. Everything else was average, not great but not bad."

Their Pad Thai is awesome, the best in the area by far. Their are awesome off the menu items, like the fried baby corn and hunan dishes. 

Service is always jovial, though sometimes tact may not be their strongest suit, but it is all in effort to be fun.

Come with a few others and take advantage of trying out a few different items. Appetizers (the crab rangoon, egg rolls, and beef sticks are all great), a few entrees, and they usually throw in some ice cream for a dessert. There is no reason to come home hungry or unsatisfied."

For starters, none of my order came with steamed rice. How do I eat my beef with vegetable or beef with snow peas with no rice?

On top of that, I order a large soup and got charged for a large soup but only recorded a small.

I realized all of this when I got home. I wasn&#39;t really upset as in sure it was honest mistake, I hope, so I decided to call them and let then know, this is the part that really got me upset.

When I called I went through 3 people, no one knew what to do. So finally, the manager offered me a small rice if I came and picked it up? Small rice? I had 2 large order don&#39;t you think you should have the decency to give me at least 1 large order of rice? Anyways, I tried to explain to them that my soup was also a small. She assured me that smit was a large container.... YEAH RIGHT!!! Smallest large container I&#39;ve ever seen. Finally, the lady wouldn&#39;t even let me speak,  she was rude and disrespectful. She told me if I want something she will credit a large rice to my account...... YES, let me drive out there for a large steamed rice. 

Pretty sad business. Went in there 6pm on a Sunday, no customers sitting at the tables. The employees were sitting in a circle and stating at me when I walked in as if I interrupted their free time. I&#39;ll be surprised if these guys stay open much longer. Small portions, high prices, and super shitty service is a recipe for disaster. Good luck, but there are plenty of genuine Chinese pleases that really care that their customers return."

Not just is the good always good, but the servers are friendly without being slow and they make an effort to be sure you&#39;re enjoying your dining experience. 

I may be a bit biased as a regular, but honestly places like Hunan Beijing are super rare these days. While I&#39;ve had the benefit of so many years to get to know the staff, I&#39;ve felt like their most valued customer since the first time I ate there before going to see the Lion King at Woodfield.

I base my Chinese restaurants on their fried rice and egg rolls. First of all the fried rice was one of the best I ever had it was not soggy like some of the others in other restaurants their was an abundant amount of chicken which was cooked just right not dry but tender and juicy the bean sprouts were crisp and the soy sauce content was enough to enhance the fried rice. Egg rolls were light and crisp and delicious.

Normally, I check a place out before hitting submit.  This time I gambled and ordered before reading the reviews.  Not going to lie...I was nervous after reading so many negative reviews.  

Well.  I can just say my experience was wonderful.  They were super speedy!  It was under 30 minutes from the time I ordered to when I was eating.  And the food.  WOW.  First off - it&#39;s not jarred sauce.  Or, if it is, they jazz it up enough that you can&#39;t tell.  I had orange chicken (medium spiciness) and it had a delightful spicy tingle.  Plus you could tell it was actual pieces of chicken and not the frozen, prebreaded nuggets you get so often.  My friend got the cashew chicken and kept going on about how good it was.  And it did look quite tasty!

The only reason they got dinged is because the fried rice was a little bland.  Not a huge crisis - we just ended up adding soy sauce.

All in all - a place I will definitely order from again!"

It was our first time trying Hunan Beijing and the lady on the phone was very thorough in making sure she got all of our information &amp; our order correct.

Food arrived 8:40 which was good timing. The delivery man was nice. Now, on to the food! The chicken pieces in their dishes are long &amp; skinny as opposed to nugget shaped smaller sizes from other places. 

The sweet and sour chicken was great...the sauce was separate from the chicken and what I loved is that all the vegetables were not in the sauce. I hate tomatoes and peppers and often places will put the veggies in the sauce making the whole sauce taste like them. I loved that they put the veggies in with the meat as it didn&#39;t taint the sauce flavoring! 

The walnut chicken had a honey type of sauce to it. The chicken pieces in this were moist but the sauce was very thin. It was tasty, I just wish there was a bit more of it and it had some thickness to it. It came with a healthy amount of walnuts and broccoli which was good.

The last dish we got was Honey Thai Chicken. It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting at all. I didn&#39;t get the honey flavor much - it was pretty bland. Tons of veggies. Not worth the $12 at all when the much better small sizes S&amp;S chicken and walnut chicken were about $7 each and the same size.

This place didn&#39;t blow me away. I will give it another try with different dishes but  my search for the best Chinese food in the northwest burbs continues. I miss my north burb Chinese places! =P"

My experience at Hunan has been hit-or-miss.  My wife and I get the same variation of foods off-and-on at Hunan; sometimes dining-in and sometimes ordering-out.  Normally (say 80% of the time), the food is out-of-this-world good and the service is excellent, but on occasion the food is out-right inedible.  

Today was a day where the food was absolutely tasteless, bland and just plain wrong.  It was so tasteless and bland that I added homemade sauces to spice things up.  On top of that, midway through, my wife and i noticed we were eating Lo-Mein Noodles when we had ordered Pad-Thai.  I called the restaurant to point out the error (and I NEVER send food back or complain), and the response was outright dismissive and unapologetic.  Come to find out, the normal &#34;noodle chef&#34; is out on Thursdays, so if I were you and today is a Thursday, and you were thinking of getting any noodle dish....I would reconsider and think about getting something else. 

Otherwise, the food is really good.  Just not sure I can go back again due to this experience.  Simple customer service would have kept me going back.  Now, they have lost a good customer."

The waiter was also nice enough to give my son some goodies.  However, when we were about to finish our food, the owner told us the other diners MAY be irritated with our toddler.

When we responded  &#34;don&#39;t worry, WE WILL NEVER COME BACK IN THEIR RESTAURANT&#34;, the other diners gave us a surprised look why the owner said that.  We got sympathy from the other diners.

We order; small shrimp fried rice,  Beef Pad Thai,  Pork Egg foo young and egg rolls.   All of the above was terrible no flavor, shrimp fried rice was under cook rice was hard and grease, Pork egg foo young pork was old and gravy was old, the Beef Pad Thai , beef was old, tuff and there was a taste of sweetness not usually found in PAD THAI.  The eggs rolls were absolutely terrible my dog would not even eat them and he like everything.   I attempt to call today June 26, and complain and the man that answered wanted to argue with me about why I didn&#39;t call last night if the food was bad.

I came here the other night with my mom for dinner and it was confirmed. I&#39;m an Asian food snob. I just don&#39;t consider other &#34;Chinese&#34; restaurants any good. They think grease equals flavor. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m sure Hunan B. uses oil to cook their food as well, but they make things taste good -with spices! Can you believe that newfangled technology they call...SPICES? Yeah, it&#39;s really good here. I just like how they buck tradition and have some unique things on the menu for veggie friendly people that I haven&#39;t seen on other menus. At other places, my &#34;stand by&#34; is egg foo young and after about 20 years, that gets boring. I&#39;m so happy I can order my fave tofu or eggplant dish here. Also ask for a special, non-menu item called scallion cake. Not sure how to describe it -it is like a big flat piece of dough fried with scallions. It is really, really good. I just wish there was a location closer so when the mood strikes, I can order delivery. But, it&#39;s OK. I guess that makes this place more special since I have to wait to go there!"

Tonight we joined several old friends, and made a few new ones along the way, here for  dinner. We were greeted warmly by several of the employees and given a great table from where we could watch everything going on in the restaurant. Our waitress, Betty was a rock star! she was efficient, yet reminded me of a mom always asking if we were ok. When the little one spilled his drink, it was no problem. We wiped it up and presto, we had another drink, this time with a lid on it. Appetizers were delish, the shrimp toast one of the best ever! Crab rangoons, filled perfectly and fried just right. Even the munchkin liked them, (these folks are truly kid friendly...not just an act, but then our little one is really a good kid..lol) . When it came time to order dinner, I wanted something different and told Betty to leave it up to the kitchen, as long as it wasn&#39;t too spicy. They brought out a pork dish that was incredible! Tender slices of pork, a savory sweet sauce, onions, cellophane noodles....yum, yum!  The rest of the dishes were equally tasty, even the sweet and sour chicken had a nice little twist to it! For dessert the fried bananas and vanilla ice cream was a perfect ending. From what every one else told me the mai-tais were damn tasty ( I was the DD), and I had their house tea, amazing...it needed no sugar, which is a lot for me! Definitely will be heading back  here soon, so watch out Betty as Arnie would say  &#34;We;ll be back!&#34;"

Tonight it was Frontier Chicken, Chicken Makhni and warm, delicious, fresh naan.  They prepare your dishes according to taste (I happen to love spicy) and can accommodate any palate.  The perfectly spiced, warm, chicken dishes were exactly what I needed.  Dishes are served with rice and plenty of sauce to dip the naan.

We even got to decide the spice level of our entrees. 

Started with veggie samosas which were fantastic. They had a kick to them which went great with the yogurt sauce we were given. We ordered a paneer dish and chicken tikka masala. Both were fabulous and had the perfect amount of spice. We also had a plain naan and some sort of combination naan which were great with the sauces. The basmati rice was also very tasty.

The waiter/ chef/ everything was super friendly and gave great suggestions. I will definitely order from here in the future, but I think I will stick to carry out."

When we arrived for our most recent visit, the area in front of the easy-to-miss storefront was VERY icy, a week after the most recent snowfall and with plenty of time to put down some sand or salt. It&#39;s a broken wrist waiting to happen, so be careful if you go during winter.

We walked into the restaurant a little after 5PM, and it was silent. No staff to greet you, no one to bring you a menu or some water, nothing. We were the only ones there, so we sat and waited. After 5-7 minutes, one person came out to say hello. He brought us menus and left to go turn on some music - which I wouldn&#39;t usually mention, but the music was louder than it should have been for an empty (save for us) restaurant and the style of sitar-playing was... aggressive, for lack of a better word. It was perplexing and more than a little awkward.

We placed our orders and waited over half an hour to get glasses of water. Our sodas came even later. We didn&#39;t receive all our food until an hour after we&#39;d arrived. By that time, we were one of two tables eating in the restaurant, with one more person waiting (over 40 minutes) for takeout. We didn&#39;t head out the door until 6:30. 

Granted, the guy who served/cooked our meals was very nice and incredibly apologetic about the delay. He made all of our food, even the naan, fresh, and you could tell. The chicken makhni was addictively good. The aloo gobhi, while oily, was smoky and flavorful. I also remember really enjoying the tikka masala-seek kebab combo from our lunch a few months back. But this guy was clearly in over his head to try to serve three tables in a 90-minute period, one of which was a takeout order. And given that our prior experience was very similar, it seems to be a chronic problem.

If I lived closer to Palatine, I&#39;d think about getting takeout, because the food really is quite good and the lunch special is a good deal. I might consider it if I&#39;m in the area and I have at least an hour to wait. For me, it&#39;s not worth the trip."

First of all, the food was delicious. I ordered the chicken tikka and chicken makhani , tried both of them and thought they were great. Do be aware that if you&#39;re not a fan of spicy, you&#39;ll need to specify the level of spice you want, but either way, the flavor is good. It&#39;s not just spicy for the sake of being spicy.

I received my delivery a few minutes later than originally estimated and got a very polite apology from the delivery driver. She was very nice and sorry that she wasn&#39;t able to find my house. Which is admittedly difficult on my dimly lit street. What prompted me to write this review immediately however, is the fact that they followed up with a phone call making sure that I receive my order and then it wasn&#39;t too late.

The wait time even when you order ahead is seriously a problem upwards of 45 minutes and with the quality of everything but the grilled meats being so horrible it is not worth it at all.

The chat was very tasty, lots of liquid to soak up with naan. No pieces of samosa or other fried snacks, just pure channa, onions, chili and cilantro. Very delicious, and very spicy.

The veg biryani was huge! It almost overflowed the polystyrene container :o) Nice chunks of tomato and other veggies like carrots. However, they didn&#39;t include any raita :o(

They called to let us know they accidentally forgot the lassi and would either deliver it or give us a credit for next time. We said we&#39;ll take the credit next time but then realized that the lamb biryani was missing so we called back and asked that both the lassi and lamb biryani be brought out ASAP. They agreed. We only got the appetizer (channa chat) and one of the entrees (veg biryani) - they forgot a drink and another entree (lamb biryani). 

They came 20 mins later and delivered the missing items. Phew! That was nice of them to make up for the omission. His lamb briyani was just ok, no raita. The lassi has some nice gulab in it (rose essence).

I think next time we&#39;ll just call them directly instead of using a third party, and/or pick it up ourselves and check that everything in the order in our bag prior to leaving. It must have been a busy Saturday night."

Our order was exactly as follows: 3 Veggie Samosa&#39;s, Butter Chicken, Paneer Makhni, 3 Garlic Naan&#39;s, 1 Veggie Biryani, and 1 Raita. When we went to go pick it up, the guy who run&#39;s this place (Ali), even repeated my order to me before I paid. We get home to find 2 chicken dishes, no raita, and no garlic naan. Just plain naan. Unfortunately some of the guests I had were vegetarian so they couldn&#39;t eat anything except the Biryani. Ok..so it gets better. I call them the same night to tell them about their mistake. They tell me to come back tomorrow at 11am. I get there at 11:30am....They aren&#39;t even OPEN! DUDE, like WTF? I called and left a message saying I was at their front door and this is really starting to waste my time. 

So now it&#39;s Tuesday. I get a phone call from Ali. He says to come pickup my order, BUT WAIT, &#34;we&#39;re out of paneer, can you pickup any other vegetarian dish?&#34; --- OK...so I placed an order for Chana Masala and Palak Aloo. I pick it up and Ali apologizes to me about the issues we had. I get home and open up the food containers...surprise surprise, there was no Chana Masala. What a joke.

We love Indian food so we were on the hunt for a good Indian restaurant in the area. We came across Shan&#39;s Grill and saw how many good reviews it received and decided to give it a try. Let me just say I&#39;m so happy we decided to try it out because it was honestly one of the best places I&#39;ve ever been to. The food was amazing and the service and was just as great. The chicken dish I ordered (I forgot what it was called) was so delicious. I recommend to anyone looking to try good Indian cuisine.

A+ for order accuracy, + service, + white chicken breast meat, + for pakoras, +lots of rice and good nan bread.
I&#39;d rate the dishes maybe a solid B, Definetly edible, just not my favorite, and again see my portion size comments below. We ordered chicken tikka masala and matter paneer. Lots of peas and very tiny pieces cheese, and lots of sauce and very tiny chicken pieces. 

Also, ask about their carryout specials. Advertises 100% Zabiha Halal.

This is an observation only, without judgement, as the pricing and portion size seem to be relevant, but the take out containers are one size smaller than some other places. For example, this was maybe a $30 order, where at another place where you might have a leftover meal would be $50. The chutney is in a one ounce container instead of a 2 ounce, so you may want to ask for 2 for your pakoras ;) (they gave us 2 without asking). We had only rice leftover.

I&#39;d recommend take out. The area just isn&#39;t a &#34;dine in area&#34;, rather a commuter area. While the shop has about 8 tables, and they do make a best effort to make it nice, it is 80&#39;s decor (plastic table clothes and fake flowers).

I&#39;d be willing to try another round with them and I&#39;m sure they appreciate you doing the same!"

IT WAS AMAZING! We made the mistake of only getting one order of Samosas. They were delicious! I fought with my husband to turn around and get more to take home. Unfortunately, I lost and have been craving them ever since. The man behind the counter says he makes the Naan fresh daily and you could taste it! The Tikka Masala was yummy. I was worried about the colouring, a deep red, I usually like mine a bit more creamy orange, but the taste was spot on. The lamb curry was exceptionally tasty with just the right amount of spice. Absolutely NO complaints! There are many reviews here complaining about having to wait - we waited over 40 minutes. Quit your bitching! This food is made with care and is not only worth the wait, but worth every penny! So head to your nearest fast food place and get your garbage in a paper sack handed to you through a window. I wish I lived closer. I would definitely be a regular. Good job Shan&#39;s Grill! Looking forward to our next visit!"

It is the closest Indian restaurant in my neighborhood, so I loved the convenience... however, the service is TERRIBLE. Every time I have come in I have been the only customer in there, and it takes FOREVER to get the small amount of food I purchase... on the phone... ahead of time. 

Clearly, I think they need to hire more staff... as the one guy that is there can&#39;t do everything on his own. I will now be taking my business elsewhere and making the drive to Schaumburg. Sad.. as it was literally a few minutes from my home.

Another thing... I also used Grubhub and tried to order it for delivery. An HOUR after I made the order, I get an e-mail from Grubhub saying that they stopped delivering to my area and never updated it on Grubhub. I live 2 miles away. WHAT?!?!? It was as if he decided an hour after making the food... he couldn&#39;t leave the restaurant to deliver it so he cancelled the order. Ridiculous. Not going back."

The delivery was 30min. late and I called them thinking that they forgot. But they called back saying that the driver got lost.

I finally got the food and dug straight in. And it blew me away. I ordered the chicken makhni, two orders of garlic naan, and a mango lassi. I ate to the point where I got full but because it was so good, I pushed beyond my stomach&#39;s limit and ate more. It was just the perfect balance of spiciness, creaminess, and a bit of that Indian zest. 

When I had the leftovers the next day, the chicken makhni did not lose its flavor even after microwaving it. The naan got a bit hard but probably my mistake after putting it in the refrigerator. Still good though. After I ate the naan, I took out a few slices of white bread to scrape up the rest of the chicken makhni. It was that good.

I am definitely, definitely going to get food from here again. 

I just wish that delivery was more prompt but definitely worth the wait."

Shan&#39;s Grill is one of those places. The space is small, in an old, commercial strip mall, and the sign&#39;s old school. It&#39;d probably be more home in Chicago than little Palatine. 

But the beef kabob&#39;s fabulous, carefully cooked and spicy and stimulating compared to the bland kabob I&#39;ve been served elsewhere. I would recommend that and the naan bread, which is super cheap for such doughy, fluffy goodness. The kabob&#39;s cheap too, for that matter, four long pieces in each order. Two orders fed five strapping adults with overly healthy appetites, lol. It was cheaper than McD&#39;s, except it&#39;s much higher quality, freshly-cooked, healthy food. We regularly order take-out from them, as there&#39;s no decor to speak of and the seating&#39;s cafeteria-ish. It&#39;s one guy and his mom running the place. Cut him some slack.

I&#39;ve had the makhni/butter chicken and samosas as well, but the makhni sauce was a little too sweet, heavy, and one-note compared to Pepper and Salt or LalQila&#39;s.The veggie samosa also used a bit too much oil, perhaps. At some point, I may try the other sauces, but for newbies, I would stick to the kabob, where they outshine everyone else. I also liked the gulab jamun dessert, but it&#39;s not available all the time. Love this place though!"

I want to give this place five stars, because the food is fantastic. But I&#39;ve gotta go with four because dining in is kind of depressing. Also, the service was super slow. So, takeout it is. We order out from here all the time since it&#39;s so close to where we live, and we&#39;ve never been let down. Really delicious, authentic food with large portions. The husband and I usually get two entrees to share (our favorites are saag paneer, alo gobi, and dal mahkni) and after we eat, there is enough leftovers for us to each get 1-2 more meals out of it. Here&#39;s a tip, each entree comes with a salad. We started requesting no salads, because a) they come in styrofoam which we try to avoid, and b) the salad is sort of sad. Just some iceberg lettuce and some stray vegetables. No thanks. But other than that, I would definitely recommend ordering some takeout. So delicious."

So, we stopped by Shan&#39;s Grill. It was an Indian/Pakistani restaurant. I usually judge a place by their biryani and tandoori chicken. They asked if we liked it mild, medium or spicy. I always order medium spicy so the taste isn&#39;t overcome by hot peppers. To my surprise, the tandoori chicken was ridiculously good.It was probably the most flavorful, seasoned and juicy tandoori chicken I had in my life. The chicken biryani was also seasoned well and had nice chunks of chicken breasts. The only problem that I had was we had to wait 35 minutes for our food but it was well worth the wait!

All the naan is good although I prefer the garlic. I&#39;ve had meat and vegetable samosas but I prefer the vegetable (get the sweet tamarind sauce!).

My normal order is lamb vindaloo although the chicken tikka masala, boti, and tandoori chicken are great. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the seek kebabs, good flavor but a bit too dry.

As everyone has said the orders do take longer than advertised although the overall wait time isn&#39;t long, they just need to tell the customer a more accurate time.

Inside the restaurant is clean although not somewhere to go for date night.

The eggroll was wrapped in a very thick wonton wrapper, and the fried rice was clumped up nicely and seasoned nicely as well. My only possible complaint is that it was a tad greasy.

I was in and out of there in roughly 20 minutes. Soup came, then the appetizer, then the entree, then the check - all within 10 minutes time. Put my debit card down and zing was out of there as soon a moment after I finished. So I was happy with that - picked the place over the burger place next door speculating the burger place might take longer - I was probably right about that.

As for the food though, honestly it was so/so. Chicken noodle soup was like a miso with thin rice noodles and some chicken - ok. Eggroll was good, but the hot mustard had a heavier than usual vinegar taste to it - I had to scrape some off. Mongolian beef was ok - I&#39;ve had better and worse. Came with fried rice which seemed a little dry - would have preferred steamed rice but wasn&#39;t asked, and didn&#39;t think to ask myself.

Value was decent - soda is in cans and are not bottomless - $1.25 each. My tab was $10.50 plus a $2 tip - easy to digest. Looks like they do have some authentic dishes available - don&#39;t see too many places with a variety of congee - but they&#39;ve got it. Would try again if in area looking for fast Chinese food. Though Chef Ping&#39;s and Yu&#39;s would get the nod if looking for more flavor."

The food is really authentic and very well priced. Everything I have had there has been really great - salt and spicy pork, mongolian beef, chow fun noodles with beef/broccoli (I do ask for gravy, the one without gravy is a bit bland), wonton noodle soup, beef fried rice, and their egg rolls are awesome (they are an add on to their lunch specials). 

My husband loves their fried rice (he would call himself a friend rice connoisseur so that&#39;s a high rating for him). He also enjoys their chow fun, you can&#39;t get it the way they make anywhere else in the suburbs. 

Their wonton noodle soup definitely hits the spot when it&#39;s cold and snowy out. I did get the beef noodle soup once and felt that there was too much fatty beef parts that I didn&#39;t enjoy as much. 

Their lunch specials are a great deal and can feed you with some leftovers for dinner. Also if you want to go during lunch, they get quite busy and it may be hard to find a spot. Definitely worth taking out if you really want good Chinese food."

It is not  a fine dining place and it is not exclusively a take out place.  Hong Kong is in between the two and a little bit of both.  Of course they do have take out as an option but during the lunch hour many people come to eat in.  The set up is simple with basic chairs and tables that seat four to six people per group.  

Upon arrival you are offered green tea and hot and sour soup.  Both are excellent and slightly unexpected given the simplicity the restaurants atmosphere conveys.  Again, the interior decor and set up of this place you would expect your food to come in Chinese take out box but Hong Kong Cafe is far from that.  The menu is extensive and the dishes are exceptional.  You can gather this from the authenticity of the menu items as well from the majority Chinese patrons that frequent this location.  

I had the Chinese Curry Supreme which comes with chicken, beef, and shrimp. It was excellent and filling.  Hong Kong Cafe is popular among the coworkers so I hope to come back again so I can try some other things on the menu."

We&#39;ve only done take-out so far - really need to eat there to get the full experience.

We ordered and were told it would be about 20 minutes. So, we waited a few, then went to go pick it up. It was not ready when we arrived, and they were very apologetic. They had several large parties, and it is a fairly small place, so we understood. They seated us at a table to wait. While waiting, we watched people around us, and saw lots of different foods we want to try.

In particular, there was a fabulous looking dish I had to ask about. They explained it was a full fried chicken which you have to order a day in advance - next time. There was also a bitter melon omelet that looked fantastic.

What we ordered turned out to be great too. The Sweet and Sour soup was among the best I&#39;ve had. Together, we ordered the soup, chicken and Chinese broccoli, Hot and Spicy Chicken and Vegetables and Bitter Melon and Pork Ribs in Casserole. Because we had to wait a short time, they gave us a Pork Fried Rice for our trouble. So nie of them. Because, the fried rice was outstanding.

So, next time, we order the whole fried chicken a day before we go, and we will dine in rather than carry out."

their egg rolls are great, everything&#39;s honestly really good. but they aren&#39;t exactly the deep-fried junky Americanized Chinese food specialists--definitely eat here if you&#39;re looking to try something new and painstakingly prepared. the prices are a huge bargain, especially for all the labor that goes into what they&#39;re serving (seriously, get on that congee)."

The food is pretty cheap (especially the lunch specials). All of the lunch specials are under $7 and come with rice, a fortune cookie, and soup of the day. I was sad that they didn&#39;t have egg drop soup, so I ordered the hot and sour soup instead. It was hot...and sour. Not my favorite, but that&#39;s a personal preference. Our meals were pretty good. Their fried rice is not my favorite (no veggies and a ton of soy sauce). The noodles were great, and the kung pao beef was good. Everything came out piping hot. Their menu is HUGE (most items are just listed without descriptions), so you are bound to find something.

Inside is very colorful, and they have Chinese television shows on (I think the one we were watching was like a soap opera). The service was SO fast at first.

So for the haters, this is authentic asian cafe food. If you go to hong kong this is very similar to the food you get from the diners for lunch. There are many americanized items, but this is very similar to HK fast food scene. The beef chow fun was well cooked with plenty of flavors. Not too salty and there appeared to be no MSG. The rest of the menu is a mixture of rice, noodle, etc dishes. Prices are good and servers are friendly and fast. The only detracting value is the dingy bathrooms which is typical of Hong Kong diner type restaurants so I guess it adds to a the authentic value. Another thing missing would be combo meals that would come with hot milk tea which would be very authentic. Oh well

Pro: inexpensive, great canto diner food

Cons: dirty/dingy bathrooms

Although the cafe is small, it isn&#39;t tightly packed. There is definitely enough room between neighboring tables so that you do not feel like you are constantly bumping elbows with strangers.

If you are looking for a place to get in and out quickly with a belly full of authentic Chinese food, this is the place for you! 

Our table ordered the cha siu pork, the sautéed chinese broccoli, and a fried turnip cake (a weekend special) to share. I also ordered a bowl of shrimp dumpling noodle soup to split with my mom. I loveeedd the cha siu as well as the fried turnip cake. I only had a little bit of both because they are both cheat foods for me, but they were delicious!! If I had a little less restraint, I&#39;m sure I could have downed both orders and then some.

 The turnip cake is lightly battered and deep fried, leaving the center moist. I also appreciated that the each piece of cha siu was heavily glazed with cha siu marinade. I hate it when I get that piece of cha siu that is super dry, tough to chew, and flavorless, but the cha siu here is none of the above! I really enjoyed the shrimp dumpling noodle soup as well. The flavors reminded me of home and the shrimp wontons that my nanny used to make when we were growing up. You really wouldn&#39;t believe how quickly I slurped up the noodles and the soup!!

Now I would suggest any regular rice dishes, chow mien items (so-so), well their chef specials are great as well there are pictures on the menu so it makes it so easy if you are non Chinese and don&#39;t know what those dishes are.

I am Cantonese grew up in HK so I would say I know how Cantonese food should be cooked. It wouldn&#39;t be the same food you have in HK cause the ingredients here VS there are sort of different. 

Bottom line you can give this place a try if you want some Chinese food in the suburbs . This is more of Cantonese style, so go to some where else if you want Lao Sze Chuan spicy dishes.

I know!). So, we decided to hop on our recently tuned-up bikes and bike over to somewhere nearby that we haven&#39;t been to yet. Hong Kong Cafe was our destination.

You know how you can tell an ethnic restaurant must be good if many people of that certain ethnicity are dining there? This was one of those places. Nearly every table was full of Chinese families and friends. We kind of stuck out like sore thumbs (especially because every was watching us park our bikes outside), but the staff immediately approached us with warm smiles and cool glasses of water. I also got a pina colada bubble tea that tasted amazing and had a generous amount of tapioca balls (writing this review right now is tempting me to finish so I can go back and one now!).

The food we ordered arrived rather quickly. My husband loved his chicken fried rice. My mixed vegetables with tofu was kind of a disappointment. The veggies were good but they were few in a large plate of abundant, soft, tasteless tofu. The overwhelm of icky tofu caused me to dislike my meal. I let my server know and she suggested that next time I ask for the tofu to be flavored and fried -- it&#39;s much better. Apparently I wasn&#39;t the only one who had that opinion about it. I believe her and I&#39;m glad she gave me that tip (but why couldn&#39;t they have just done it that way the first time around?). 

This was a great hole-in-the-wall that left us pleasantly surprised. Minus a star for the icky tofu but I&#39;m sure it will be bumped up the next time I&#39;m here."

My dad and I, who have both traversed China on separate occasions, agreed on this.


We ordered:
1. Deep-fried shrimp appetizer with some apricot sauce (dad loved it)
2. Ma Po Tofu (HEAVENLY)
3. Hot &amp; spicy vegetables (good, but the veggies were rock-hard)
4. Beef chow fun (dad loved it; said it was even better the next day, haha)


Cool:
1. Chocolate fortune cookies!
2. Picture menu
3. Decor rocks


What held this back from being a 5-star review:
1. Hot and Sour soup was $5.75! Unless I get the whole pot, I&#39;m not paying that much. I&#39;ve never seen that soup for more than $3.
2. Tea is not complimentary.
3. I don&#39;t think our server said a word to us the entire time.
4. My water wasn&#39;t refilled even after I asked. I had two spicy dishes that I still put more chili oil on, so my mouth was on fire by the end of my meal... and my cup was empty. :(


I would go back in a nano-second. One bite, and I was instantly transported back to some of my favorite hole-in-the-walls in Beijing and Tibet. Super cool. :))

The first time we had the Black Pepper Beef Short Ribs and it was great. The deep fried bread was ok. That visit merits three stars but the second visit doesn&#39;t. 

Roast pork (Char Siu) and roast duck are Cantonese staples and they can make or break a Cantonese place for me. I am afraid Hong Kong Cafe did not deliver. The color of the roast pork was off (too red) and meat was a bit dry. The roast duck didn&#39;t have the crispy skin and meat was bland. They sat on top of a plate of rice haphazardly splashed with pure soy sauce--what happened to my meat juice? You know, the french ain&#39;t the only people who does the au jus thing. And I do miss a few stems of Chinese broccoli adorning my rice plate. 

Had a bite of the vegetable egg roll and found the skin too thick, cabbage filling boring and inside slightly doughy. The fish fillet congee (available on weekends only) was just a faint reminder of one of my favorite comfort foods. The texture of the congee (rice porridge) was not bad, but the wrong kind of fish ruined it. Perhaps I should have tried the preserved egg (not sure who started calling it thousand-year old egg but it was pretty ignorant IMHO) and pork congee, which is in fact the most popular congee among Cantonese folks.  

By now I should probably mention Cantonese food is very dear to me so I tend to give somewhat harsh criticism when it&#39;s not done right. I am sure there are things they do right but I will need to find an excuse to come back and find out, maybe for the tapioca freeze treats...

In the meantime the search for good Cantonese food is on."

There are a lot of Asian restaurants in the area but many of them are not worth my time, so I am excited to finally have a new one to add to my list. We tried to come on a Monday and found it was closed on Mondays, so we returned a couple days later to give it a shot. Walking in, I was greatly encouraged by the fact that nearly all the patrons were Asian -- a good sign.

There are just 10 or so tables in this small restaurant but the environment is very nice, clean, and relatively up-to-date, much better than the average strip mall restaurant. The service was quick and friendly. 

I ordered the General Tso&#39;s Chicken (not real Chinese food, I know) and my wife ordered Mongolian Beef. Her beef was absolutely succulent and not covered in sauce like it tends to be in other places. My General Tso&#39;s had what I always look for first -- crispy breading. This is rare, particularly in suburban restaurants, so this is a big win for Hong Kong Cafe. On the downside, the flavor was not quite what I expect from this dish. As such, I would not order this particular item again, but would happily order plenty of other things from the menu.

The lunch specials were perfectly sized: plenty of food but not a mountain of it. The hot and sour soup I got with it was delicious and perfect. At only $6 a piece, the price is great.

I brought my 2 year old son along, who had a chicken/egg/corn soup that was pretty tasty. I liked that they gave him a proper kids sippy cup with a straw that didn&#39;t spill, a rarity from any restaurant.

This is tied with House of Pho as my new favorite Asian restaurant in the Schaumburg area!"

This update is about their pricing, more specifically, the discrepancies in the prices listed and what is actually charged. 

They do not input their orders into a computer so the tab is susceptible to error. Lately we&#39;ve noticed that our bills have been a tad bit more expensive than what we expected based on what&#39;s listed on the menu. Had this happened only once, I would have chalked it up to mere human error. Hey, anyone can make a simple mathematical error. But when it&#39;s happened the last four times, I start to suspect maybe something is up. Each time, I&#39;ve had to literally go over our order and reference the menu price with the person who took my order (it&#39;s been the same lady each time). Each time, she&#39;s found that&#39;s she&#39;s made an error. She doesn&#39;t offer an apology but merely scratches off the old price and scrawls in the new price.

The &#34;errors&#34; have been generally between ~ 80 cents to ~ $1.25. That may not seem like much, but that adds up if you order from here frequently. Look, there&#39;s no concrete evidence that the restaurant is doing anything illicit. It could just be that the person who took my order is simply bad at entering the correct prices into a calculator. But again, it&#39;s starting to smell a little fishy when it&#39;s happened the last four times, and when the price discrepancy is just small enough to be negligible -- maybe they think that nobody will check since the price is in the ballpark and the bill is tabulated by hand, often in handwriting that&#39;s difficult to read. All I&#39;m saying right now is double check your bill. It doesn&#39;t take very long, and it could very well save you some money."

I visited here with the boyfriend and his family who are Chinese and knows quite a big about Canton and Hong Kong dishes and they have been fond of this place. Luckily, when I&#39;m with them, his family always order a plethora of dishes and being that it was my first time at the restaurant, it really gave me a good idea of the many dishes that they offered.  

We had a fantastic luncheon that felt more like a feast with beef and seafood congee, beef chow fun, 2 kinds of rice rolls in soy sauce and XO sauce, hot and sour soup, turnip cake, wonton thick rice noodle soup. 

The chow fun and rice rolls were really flavorful and it didn&#39;t look like any other chow fun you would get from other cook-cutter Chinese restaurants.  It was not too soft nor hard and had the right about amount of a bit crunchy-ness to it.  Though with fried noodles, you will get a bit of oil and this restaurant will use oil.  But I guess that comes with the food.  

The congee soup was very good and it was made Canon style so the rice was more fluffy than other congees.  Just have a taste of it if you&#39;re looking for something warm to start with and you&#39;ll see what I mean.  The hot and sour soup was good but I must say it tasted a bit more sweet than it was sour.  Every place makes it different and they just need to adjust the balance.  

Turnip cakes was yummy and wonton soup was delish...  Overall, I was pretty satisify with this place and I would visit again.  The food is good though the service can bit a little abrupt but they&#39;ll get your order out quick (which is pretty accurate of most local small-business restaurants). Pictures to follow..."

It reminded me of Chinatown and I think it&#39;s the closest to Chinatown food I have ever found in the burbs!

My meal started with the hot &amp; sour soup which is VERY spicy! I was proud of myself &amp; my sensitive taste buds for having as much as I did. It has some tofu in it and something we couldn&#39;t quite identify but thought maybe it was eggplant? I found that to be an interesting selection.

Then we ordered the fried bread thanks to the yummy looking picture a fellow Yelper posted. It was a good addition at $3.30. It was steaming hot, lightly deep fried and just tasted so moist and appetizing. I loved it! 

I added the egg roll to my lunch special...not necessary at all with the HUGE amount of food we got but I really wanted to give it a try. I consider myself to be an eggroll connoisseur and can never seem to find the perfect one. I would venture to say that this might just be the best eggroll I&#39;ve ever had! No joke! It wasn&#39;t overly deep fried, came out of the deep fryer nice &amp; hot. I loved the crispiness of the outside. It was a very thick eggroll filled with a lot of tasty ingredients on the inside. It cost an extra $1.25 to add to my meal but it was well worth it!

For my main entree, I ordered the sweet &amp; sour lunch special with white rice (it comes standard with fried rice). It was just a bit over $6 and was a huge portion. The chicken pieces were very large and moist compared to other places. The sauce was the Chinatown standard...orange and saucy! It wasn&#39;t overly amazing but still good. My friend got the beef chow fun which I tasted. Now that was amazing!

We were one of just a few tables in there for lunch. The service was very friendly, much better then the standard Chinatown which I keep comparing this lunch to. Food came out very fast which was perfect for our lunch. We have an hour for lunch...it took us 10 minutes to get here, 10 minutes to get back to work, and in that 40 minutes we had soup, appetizer, side dish, main dish &amp; chocolate fortune cookies...didn&#39;t go over on our time at all!

Very well lit, bright accent colors and solid industrial aluminum chairs.
This is a lunch review only. 

$6.50 for spicy veggie, tip &amp; tax included; SO fast my veggies were undercooked even by MY standards and that is how I liked them I thought. I think they just threatened them with some hot soy sauce. Tea included, they may have to like you for a 3rd cup. 
Hot &amp; sour a little vinegary, no leftovers except for way too many raw green peppers. I&#39;m working through their lunch specials and will update. The chocolate fortune cookie is growing on me and kind of fun.
If you have a large party you may want to take a little extra time to decipher that cryptic bill, they round UP.

Inside was a cozy looking little place with a real family vibe- tables shoved in every nook and cranny, and a Lcd TV hung on the wall which was blasting Chinese news. I must have wandered in just before they opened for dinner as I saw the staff; or perhaps their family; or perhaps both, chowing down in front of the TV. I was seated politely and given a menu. Having been a fan of wonton gourmet for a while, I was excited to see noodles and dumplings with Chinese broccoli on the menu. Promptly ordered. They were fantastic!! The dumplings were quite a bit better than wonton gourmet&#39;s, and the Chinese broccoli was cooked just right. Try the scrambled egg with bitter melon- it also has crunchy, salty, tubers inside. The Hong Kong style iced tea was also amazing. If you&#39;re looking for a high end place, this ain&#39;t it, but for quality grub with a home cooked taste this is your spot.

I was still finishing my soup and working on the pot stickers when the chow mein appeared but the noodles was steaming hot so it was good that I was still working on soup and appetizers to give it time to cool down. The noodles were excellent except I would have liked it a bit crisper as the noodles are the bottom layer so the chicken, vegetables and sauce will soften up the noodles. All in all, hasn&#39;t changed my opinion of 4 stars for the food. The service is definitely not four stars as they are literally order takers and food servers but maybe they&#39;re more pleasant with the Chinese speaking crowd (of which I am not a member). Yu&#39;s is definitely better if you&#39;re looking for atmosphere and better service."

These are it. Big fat fried pork dumplings with a thin (but not wimpy) skin, and a fluffy pork filling. Amazing. Soy and vinegar on the table. I love.

I ordered string beans with garlic, which was not on the menu, but which they graciously (and perfectly) cooked for me. We also got the orange chicken - not my idea. It was head and shoulders above what you normally get when you order this dish, gingery and delicious. 

Based on yelp, I got the beef chow fun in black bean sauce. It was delicious, but the noodle were thick rice noodles, where I was expected wide, flat noodles (like Pad See Eiu noodles). A little disappointing, but still delicious.

Topped off with a mango ice smoothie, and this meal was perfection. I will be back, despite the long drive from the city. Next time I think I will stay away from the Americanized dish and really dive in to the good stuff."

In a 10 star system, I&#39;d give them 6 stars (or slightly above average). In a 5 star system, I want to give them 3.5. At the end of the day, I will give them 3 stars because they don&#39;t quite reach the &#34;price/value&#34; relationship because of my perceived higher prices from them.

PROs
- The quality of their food is really good. I&#39;ve had their spicy fried fish. They keep the outside of the fish crunchy and the inside tender. They also use green onion, pepper flakes, and salt on the outside to make it super tasty.
- Their fish fillet in white sauce is really tasty. If you&#39;re looking for something to balance out beef, chicken, or vegetable dish, I&#39;d recommend this dish.
- Their Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce tastes great. There is a great mix of flavor between the broccoli and the garlic.

CONs
- Their dishes are rather pricy for Chinese food in the area. Most of their dishes range from $9-13. I know that&#39;s in the medium range. For my taste, I always have second thoughts when I&#39;m debating which dish to get because it just barely pushes me into that range where I wonder if it&#39;s worth it.
- They got my order wrong so I ended up with fried fish instead of the fish in white sauce, but it still tasted good.
- The ambiance is nice. It has a TV screen showing some Chinese TV in the back. The service is pretty good.

My only big hesitation about this place is it&#39;s priced a bit higher than some other Chinese places in the area. Other than that, it&#39;s definitely worth going in a big group where you can try lots of dishes."

It&#39;s a tiny dive place in a plaza, so my hopes weren&#39;t high. Upon walking in, there were two TV&#39;s showing Chinese gameshows, and there were no white people in the entire restaurant. There were Chinese businessmen, a Chinese family of three generations...this bodes well for authenticity.

We ordered lunch and they all came with soup, which was quite good. I had the hot and sour soup, and it had lots of mushrooms, bamboo, and tofu, and a really nice spicy kick. We also had scallion pancakes, steamed potstickers, and I had the best bubble tea I&#39;ve ever ordered. They make it with ice and fruit in a blender - none of the powdered milk tea mix. It was so good, that my sister-in-law and her boyfriend didn&#39;t want to give it back after they tried mine.

The portions were very large, and sauces were light. Even the &#34;Americanized&#34; dishes (General&#39;s chicken and beef with broccoli) were made with more of an authentic flair.

Parking was fine, and prices weren&#39;t exactly dirt cheap ($70 for 3 apps, 6 entrees, and two drinks), but for the authenticity, portion size, and quality of food, I&#39;d pay it again in a second."

The portions are great here too, which is a must for me, because I&#39;m all about value and I love having leftovers to take home with me.  

The only thing I didn&#39;t care for, is that they use plastic cups.  I think that&#39;s pretty nasty and tacky for a restaurant.  I&#39;ve never eaten at a sit-down place that uses plastic cups, but since the food is so tasty, I can overlook that.

I prefer this place over Yu&#39;s simply because I prefer Cantonese style food, but that&#39;s just my preference.  Ping&#39;s is good too, just also a different style all together.

Fried fish, congee, noodles are spot on.  It&#39;s pricier than Asian Noodle House, but at ASN you get what you pay for.  If you want larger portions and more importantly a dish with generous meats and veggies, this is your place.

Get the fried dough to go with your congee.  Their fried dough isn&#39;t the typical one&#39;s I&#39;ve had, but it&#39;s better."

The negatives...the food was OK....not anything to really complain about, but then again, nothing to really rave about.  Portion size was pretty small compared to other Chinese places.  I would say that I could get twice as much for the same price.

Hong Kong Cafe is intimate and unpretentious and does not act like the typical Chinese restaurant, preferring instead to place its focus on the food. The wonderful wonderful food.

First of all, the crab rangoons are top notch - lightly crisped on the outside &amp; fresh, flavorful cream cheese on the inside really elevated this particular (nontraditional) appetizer.  My girlfriend and I then split an order of curry chicken and an order of Cantonese BBQ Beef over chow mein, both of which were extremely well done. The curry flowed thick over the chicken while the BBQ Beef sauce, if not as sweet as I would have hoped, moistened the crispy noodles just enough and settled the dish into a harmonious equilibrium.

This meal was more like an audition, to be added to my work lunch list.  Started things off right with some hot &amp; sour soup, which had a nice kick to it, and some tasty fried bread.  I&#39;ve always seen chinese fried bread on various menus, but never thought to try it.  Piping hot balls of perfectly fried dough, crispy outside and soft inside.  They weren&#39;t oily at all and had a slight sweetness.  Next were some egg rolls, fresh out of the kitchen.  They had a thin crispy shell, which I really enjoyed.  The main event was some beef chow fun w/ black bean sauce &amp; chinese broccoli.  Now I love me some beef chow fun from chinatown... mmm greasy beefy goodness.  HKC&#39;s version was a nice alternative with a generous portion of fresh ingredients and perfectly pan fried rice noodles.  Plus you get a complimentary chocolate dessert in the form of a fortune cookie.  Ha nothing crazy, just a chocolate fortune cookie.

I am a big fan of the Singapore noodles!!! The potstickers are fine, the egg rolls are egg rolls (how can one screw up an egg roll?)...

Here is what I like about this place...any time I have ever been there, the only customers eating there are of asian descent....they are usually speaking in their native tongue and using chopsticks instead of a fork. I usually see either couples, or more regularly large, multi-generational asian families eating there.

This is a GREAT sign in my opinion, because it means the food is likely more authentic. Being a gringo, I do realize that a lot of the Chinese food on the menu (and in most take aways in the states) have been dumbed down for the western palate...I doubt you&#39;ll find generals chicken or sweet and sour pork in Beijing or Canton...

Hong Kong café has those dishes of course, but they also have things like jellyfish, stuffed bean curd...not that I have ever had those (I&#39;m just not brave enough I guess), but the fact that those are offered reinforces my opinion that they do authentic cooking first, and cater to the Midwestern corn eaters second.

I have had only one bad experience there and it was my own fault. I had never had chow mein before - ever in my life, and decided I would order that. I&#39;m sure (hopefully) it was prepared well, I think it is likely just the nature of chow mein...it was a disgusting, opaque, slurry of noodles and pork. Flavoreless and tasteless and a texture that made it wholly inedible.

This one experience however, did not influence my rating for this place. I ordered gringo food, I got gringo food - my fault! Not theirs! Try the Singapore noodles and you will come to understand why, in my opinion, this is hands down the best Chinese take away place in the area (with the exception of Yu&#39;s which really isn&#39;t a takeaway joint)..."

There are team plaques everywhere on the walls, along side the usual hot dog joint sports photos, a couple of TV&#39;s, and old-fashioned video game machines. They have Ms. Pac Man!

My family started frequenting here a few months ago, after my youngest son joined a park district baseball team Chiggy&#39;s sponsors. Since then, I&#39;ve actually looked forward to eating here after the games and practices, as much as my son &amp; his teammates!

This is not a fancy joint offering an extraordinary menu, but the food is actually good. My favorites are the gyro served extra large with fries &amp; drink, bbq chicken sandwich made with a little kick in the sauce, and the juicy cheeseburger deluxe. The gyro is so good, I have a hard time ordering anything else on most visits. My son&#39;s favorite, of course, is the kid&#39;s hot dog special with fries and a drink for $4.99 with free ice cream after the meal.

Their prices are reasonable, portions large, offer daily specials, plenty of parking outside, and plenty tables inside. Their kitchen is in open view, so you can see how &#34;clean&#34; they cook the food. Speaking of clean, there&#39;s a guy who constantly float throughout the restaurant cleaning, wiping down the tables after each guest. The best part, Chiggy&#39;s have beer!

If you&#39;re ever in Palatine on Northwest Highway east of Smith Street, stop in for a Chiggy&#39;s gyro. Besides, the food &amp; service is so much better than Photo&#39;s down the road.

I gave 4 stars only, because I&#39;ve had better fries, and fries are very important to a hot dog or gyro. :)"

We had 2 types of gyros, regular and chicken or chicken shwarma. Tzatziki sauce was plain, runny and no flavor and so were the fires. Bonus, you can refill your drink as much as you want. They do have other Greek influenced fare, but we skipped it."

The lettuce on the chicken gyro was wilted and the tomatoes were soggy.

There was a woman standing outside with her three nicely dressed children, begging me to feed them.  I am by no means an ignorant or snobbish adult. Growing up, &#34;back to school outfits&#34; were from the salvation army and a good dinner was tuna casserole  when we scored good bags from the food pantry.  As an adult now, I still struggle, in fact, my rent is late. I had no business taking my ladies out to eat but when I  have to get up and bust my hump at 5 am so that I  can provided for them, why shouldn&#39;t  I treat them to an &#34;I&#39;m too sleepy to make dinner hot dog&#34;. 

So, we enter the restaurant. I explain a little about the woman to the cashier before I head to the restroom with my ladies. We take care of business, we&#39;re  ready to chow. We walk to the front to order and the woman is now inside buying french fries. She turns to me as if to say &#34;hello&#34; but instead gives me a horrible look like &#34;some nerve you have not feeding my children&#34; then she  points to them and asks me again almost like &#34;come on already&#34;. I  was so frustrated,  I hadn&#39;t even looked at a menu yet and I have been here  for 20 minutes. I said &#34;look, can I please just feed MY kids?&#34; 

The cashier asked her to let me be and asked her to leave. She then became feisty and attempted to hit the cashier with her &#34;help me&#34; sign. The cashier called the police after a good 2 minute exchange with this woman and she walked out, leaving her children inside of course. The oldest child gathers the younger two and shuffles them outside to their &#34;mother?&#34;

Meanwhile, the cashier is on the phone with the police.

I order our meal and we pay.

The police arrive, the cashier gives details, I step in as a witness, they explain they&#39;ve had calls about her before.

All of a sudden,  some loud mouth woman , turns around and claims to officers &#34;she was being very decent, she just wanted to feed her children&#34;

I was eager to respond to her but declined as I  like to keep mature composure and maintain my wits when children are present no matter how void the filter is on my mouth piece. (Especially when people have no common sense). 

However, I see that said being has posted a review of this event and I  wanted to clarify things. 

I would just like to add that if you choose to use your opinion to get involved in something that doesn&#39;t concern you, do it with purpose. Make a difference. I would have liked to see Mrs Righteous take the woman to the grocery store across the street or offered to take her job hunting. Not hide behind social media and give a great restaurant a bad review for doing the right thing.

I will be back Chiggy&#39;s, I can&#39;t wait to try more of your delicious menu!"

However, please pay attention to some of the reviews that have been getting posted since 2014. There is an extremely rude cashier that has been working there and I have had problems with her on at least two occasions in person and over the phone. She told me her name was Alexis. She is an older woman with a deeper voice. She manages to be condescending, inpatient, and disrespectful to you in the short time you need to interact with her. I don&#39;t feel like I deserve to be made to feel such anger whenever I leave Chiggy&#39;s. 

Everyone else at Chiggy&#39;s has always been extremely nice. Their food is good and reasonably priced.

I have seen her embarrass people and just make absolutely unacceptable comments to customers. She may be the owners daughter but either way she should not be working at a job where she has to interact with people.

I am a huge fan of gyros and this place has the best fast food gyros I have ever had. Of course I can go to a 5 star place and order a gourmet gyro and wait 30 min for it, but this place has everything from kind employees, to fast service and very good tasting food. I am always on the lookout for a new restaurant and I try and make it a mission to post about it on Yelp.

I ordered a gyro deluxe dinner, a spinach pie and a pizza puff. The gyro came openfaced with onions, tomato and the cucumber sauce on the side. I added the sides as I wished, which I liked that plus for the price too its worth it. The gyro dinner deluxe comes with fries and a side salad for about $9.79. The salad side salad was very fresh and everything tasted crisp. It came with a side cup of vinagrette. The fries were decent, lightly salted and fairly long which I too find very great. Nothing else I can say. Finally the gyro was moist and fresh too. I have had dry and overdone gryos but this place does them very well. Nothing else to mention aside from that they offer a single gyros and regular gyros combo meal. The combo comes with fries as well but no salad. DONT FORGET to ORDER a DRINK with that, because the combo does not come with a drink. 

If you forget to order a drink, make sure you have cash on you, because this place has a $5 minimum purchse for credit/debit cards. If its under that, then obv cash is the only other method of payment. That happened to me, luckily I had a $5 on me. Next, the spinach pie is not exactly a pie. Its a rectangular phyllo (crust), that is stuffed with feta cheese and spinach. Its almost like a spinkopita pie. That was tasty and filling. I believe that was $5.79. Finally, the pizza puff, it was average, it looks like a small burrito with pizza tasting filling in it. That was alright. I probably would not order it again. That was around $4 I believe.

The place itself is VERY clean, and brightly lit especially at night. They are fast with cleaning and do a great job. The food cooks pretty fast, depending on what you get, oh and one major final plus, they have coupons with great deals on them. 10% off your purchase of $10 or more, an entire rotisserie chicken with fries and coleslaw for only $7.99! One free gyros with the purchase of a gyro, fres and 2 medium drinks, $3 off a $15 purchase/$5 off $25/$7 off $40. One coupon per person. The parking lot is really large, PLENTY of parking and the brightly lit restaurant sign are very easy to spot in its red lettering.

Overall I have been here twice now and I will most definitely continue on coming here. I don&#39;t know of any other gyros place in the near area so this place definitely wins my business. The friendly service, fast orders and cleanliness all are great!"

I ordered a gyros with no onion. The gyros was still made with onions, which is totally understandable; however, after informing them politely of the mistake, the cook took the gyros behind the counter, thinking that I wasn&#39;t looking, and opened it up with his bare hands and began to pick apart the gyros, searching for all the onions and throwing them out. The cook then began to hide his &#34;work&#34; by putting new sauce on the gyros and wrapping it back up in a new wrapper. Simply.... disgusting. I hope Chiggys  turns things around quickly because we have always enjoyed going."

I can&#39;t say it was one of THOSE hot dogs which made me go gaga but it hit the spot and served the purpose for the afternoon.

When I go back I plan to experience a gyro (I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re good)....when it&#39;s in their name how could I not try it? I&#39;ve been searching for good gyros for the last year or so and I hope to add this to my list. I can&#39;t wait to try one.....for science.

Tonight,my brother in law took our two oldest (12 and 15) out for dinner, and chiggys is the place they always go. Picky eaters, they both wanted the kids grilled cheese. The girl taking the order snapped back &#34;they aren&#39;t kids!!!&#34; My brother in law was shocked at her reaction. &#34;What is the definition of a kid in this place?&#34; He asked. &#34;Up to 12!&#34; She said. My daughter chimed in &#34;I am 12&#34;  which my brother in law confirmed. &#34;Shes a little tall for 12!&#34; She said.
At this point, wtf? First off,who cares? If my grandmother orders happy meal at McDonald&#39;s she&#39;s getting one. Apparently you need proof of age for a grilled cheese at chiggys? Or else you get attitude?
But the most insane part of all this was her comment after he said she was 12...
&#34;Better be, karma is a bitch!&#34; She said... In front of my kids. 

Had I been there,to hear that in front of my kids, I would have thrown a fit.
My easy going brother in law,though, saw it as an opportunity to have a little fun. He simply replied &#34;you should know&#34;
When it came time to give his order,he thought for a moment and said...&#34;hmmm I&#39;ll have the Kids grilled cheese..wanna see my fake ID?&#34;
HA!
He came home with a funny story about the rude service,but it pissed us off so much we went to have a word with her in person. She was unrepentant,lied about my brother in law saying she was tall for her age,and generally dismissive. She also said they get in trouble from the owner when they sell kids meals to &#34;adults&#34;.
If that&#39;s true,shame on all of them. So now,instead of selling a cheap grilled cheese to our kids for a profit,they will sell our family and friends  nothing,ever again."

Ok but recently they seem to be having a problem staffing the front register and keeping their employees. First there is a scary loud mouthed women who would take your order that was extremely rude, so I try not to go there when she is working, so today I see the owner behind the counter and I ordered a cheesy beef for my husband. I happen to look down on my receipt afterwards and saw that I was charged for cheese twice .50 and then another .50 so I mentioned to him that I think he charged me twice for the cheese. He started yelling at me and yes yelling that is how it is. And I proceeded to try to show him the receipt because I didn&#39;t think he new what I was trying to explain, but he wouldn&#39;t let me get a word in. He said I was lucky he didn&#39;t charge me more, the beef was on special so instead of 5.99 it was 4.99 apparently? And beef sandwiches require three slices of mozzarella but he only charged me for two! So I was trying to clarify that so when you order cheese on a beef it is an extra $1.50!! I&#39;ve never been charged that before and was just trying clarify if that was correct because usually I&#39;ve only been charged one time charge for cheese, he was so unbelievably rude and nasty to me that the cooks in the back were coming up wondering why he was yelling and they were looking at me like they were sorry for his actions. I&#39;ve never been treated like this and as a paying customer should never be treated so rudely, why would you want to feel like a piece of crap walking out of there. I was shocked and unfortunately me and my family will never go back there again. Unbelievable how an owner would treat customers that way. There are plenty of places that will thank you for your business!! But to yell at ME because I questioned about the receipt that I thought was charged wrong.....I don&#39;t get it and can&#39;t understand how rude an owner could be to a customer!! Never again!

My wife and I walked into this Giordano&#39;s restaurant on a Friday night at 7:30pm, fully expecting to wait a while to be seated.  No wait, we were seated immediately.  The place was busy, too!
We ordered bruschetta for an appetizer and a small stuffed pizza with sausage, black olives, green pepper, and tomatoes.  The bruschetta came out almost immediately and was very tasty.  The pizza took a long time, but the menu warned of a 45 minute wait for the stuffed pizzas.  It was well worth the wait as the pizza was excellent!!  A small was more than enough for the two of us and we brought half of the pizza back to our hotel.
There is another Chicago pizza joint that I believe has better deep dish pizza.  Even so, Giordano&#39;s was an excellent choice and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone!!"

Our waiter, Julio, seems nice, but very inattentive. When we placed our orders, we asked for two orders of fries to be brought out at the same time as the pizza. He said &#34;you&#39;re gonna have to remind me about that because I&#39;ll forget&#34;. What!?! The waiter is supposed to remember this. During our two hour wait, our waiter Julio only came to our table once to update us on our order status, but only because we waved him down to ask. Two hours later when the pizza came out, he forgot our fries. We had to remind him about the fries. Once they came out, we asked for drink refills and ketchup. He pointed to our cups and said &#34;but your cups are full?&#34;  Yes, our cups were full,  because all the ice melted during the two hours we waited. He didn&#39;t even bring us the refills. We had to ask another waitress for our drinks! When we waved him down again,  we asked for the ketchup again. He brought it out a little while later, but all he brought was a tiny cup with about 3oz of ketchup for TWO ORDERS OF FRIES. We had to ask the other waitresses for stuff because Julio was nowhere to be found at times. Another waitress finally brought us a full sized bottle of ketchup. 

We spoke to the manager about the wait time and he said he would take care of the cost for us. When it was time to leave Julio said, &#34;So it&#39;s gonna be free, plus whatever you want to leave for tip&#34;. I don&#39;t think waiters should be asking for tips. I understand that the wait time for the pizza was not his fault. But the service could have been so much better. 

Overall, very unsatisfactory experience. Mike the manager seems polite. But our waiter need to be more attentive to his tables."

It&#39;s cheesy and decadent, unlike anything I&#39;d ever had back home in Texas. Anytime we have plans to visit Chicago, we always know pizza will be our first meal there.

There are many pizza chains in Chicagoland, but Giordano&#39;s is my favorite simply because the more cheese to sauce ratio is what I prefer. Lou&#39;s I find to be more saucy, Gino&#39;s bland, and Pequod&#39;s better for thin crust as opposed to the traditional Chicago deep dish. You can order Giordano&#39;s pizza online too which I plan to try someday. One of our friends told us that if you use a liberal coating of olive oil on the bottom of the pan you bake it in, the flavors come out almost identical.

This location in Schaumburg is fairly new and very spacious. Plenty of comfy booths and ample free parking in their private lot. 

The pizzas take 40 minutes or so to bake, so I recommend knowing what you want ahead of time. That way you can place your order with your server at the same time you get your drinks. 

A small deep dish for two people is usually more than enough food. We always end up with leftovers because I can&#39;t eat more than two slices in a sitting. (I even remove the crusts to save my appetite for the middle since that&#39;s where all the glorious melty cheese is). 

We also like to start with their bruschetta because it&#39;s really delicious. It has mounds of seasoned tomatoes and fresh mozzarella on top of crusty bread. They then drizzle it with a balsamic vinaigrette and finish with a sprinkle of basil. 

Our favorite topping combination is pepperoni, fresh garlic, and jalapeño. It&#39;s the perfect blend of savory, spicy, and salty in each bite. 

They have decently priced lunch specials also, but I&#39;m assuming for those you can&#39;t custom pick the toppings since they are probably baked ahead of time to get people out the door and back to the office in an hour. Same thing goes with their online pies which you can only get in their top selling flavors. 

We&#39;ve never had a bad experience at Giordano&#39;s and it&#39;s always the perfect place to have great food and catch up with friends. Just make sure to pack your stretchy pants."

I think the management should be happy with the staff, because openings do not always go this well. The building looks great! It is fairly large and there is a separate area for pickups. There is a full bar and the seating area is large, with a lot of booths. 

When I arrived there was a wait for a table. They said they would text me when the table was ready. Although I thought this was a great idea, for some reason, I had a feeling that it would not work. I told the hostess I was going to be at the bar and someone came and got me. Apparently, there is an issue with my cell phone provider. Since relying on my intuition is a mixed bag, maybe they should&#39;ve mentioned that, but, it turned out fine. The bartender was very friendly and the service at the bar was good. 

The table wasn&#39;t the best, but I can talk to my friend anywhere, and it was busy. The service was very good, and the food came out on time. I noticed the time they quoted for a deep dish pizza was 45 minutes, which is 15 longer than at the BG location, but at least they were upfront about it when we ordered. 

We had the  bruschetta, which was pretty decent, and a deep dish pizza. The pizza was just what I expected and It is my favourite pizza in Chicago, so that is a good thing. The manager stopped by our table to see if everything was OK, and to thank us for coming out. 

I was very happy I tried this place and I would definitely return. The only other Giordano&#39;s building I&#39;ve been in that was as nice as this location was downtown. (They just need to get that text problem worked out.). :)"

I ordered half sausage and half veggie. 1/2 of the veggie side had sausage on it mixed with the veggie. The worst part was the shallow pizza that they gave us.  This $30 pizza was as thick as a a dominos pizza. It was truly sad and disappointing. They cheaped out on ALL the ingredients. I guess Lou&#39;s is my new spot.

In comparison to another restaurant that serves, deep dish pizza, Giordano&#39;s was better. It just was not the best pizza as far as taste.

-Portion sizes are generous
-If you like cheese, there is plenty of cheese on this pizza
-There was use of fresh spinach
-Good atmosphere for family and friends

Well considering that Giordanos has always been my favorite, I always thought I&#39;d give nothing less than 5 stars! Tonight&#39;s experience changed things drastically! We placed our delivery order at 5:05 and we ordered a stuffed pizza with EXTRA cheese, pepperoni, sausage, EASY onion, &amp; a side of giardinera. We were told the pizza would arrive no later than 6:15, so when it still had not arrived at 6:40 I called in. I was put on hold &amp; then a girl came on &amp; told me that due to a system glitch, the order was never received &amp; it was just put in the oven. I asked when it would arrive and if they were comping the meal so she then had me hold again to get a manager. After a few minutes a manager Mike got on the line and explained the system glitch once again, he apologized, &amp; offered us a $15 gift card for our troubles. I then reiterated to him that our food was going to be at least 2 hours late, no one called to explain anything or even ask if we still wanted it, but he was offering us a big whopping $15. He then finally offered to comp our meal, said the pizza just came out of oven, &amp; that it would arrive within 15 mins.   So NOT true! He also felt the need to tell me that someone had called off that night, etc, etc....As if that mattered to me. The pizza FINALLY arrived 35 mins later NOT 15 &amp; although I confirmed my order when I called it in, it did NOT have sausage, did NOT have extra cheese, did NOT have our side of giardinera, &amp; it had TONS of onions on it too! Geez this makes me wonder what else might have happened to our food that we are not even aware of! Wow this location really needs to get it together!!"

Everyone was telling me to go to Lou Malnati&#39;s instead but I decided to give Giordano&#39;s a shot. Well, the server was extremely inattentive. He noticed he didn&#39;t bring me a straw and said he would bring one. The next time he decided to show up at the table, he didn&#39;t bring the straw so I reminded him to bring it. Then the appetizer showed up and still no straw. The server was nowhere to be found and no manager in sight. After eating my appetizer I was very thirsty so when the hostess finally showed up to her post, I left my table and walked up to her asking &#34;Can you please help me find a straw?&#34; Well, she found an unwrapped straw and gave it to me. Even though it was unwrapped, beggars can&#39;t be choosers (I guess) so I went ahead and drank with it. The pizza was undercooked and the chicken cobb salad had no distinctive trace of chicken in it. I forced myself to give the server some sort of gratuity. I was so tired of waiting for my check at the end of the meal that I went to the empty hostess desk once again in hopes that someone would notice me and I can finally leave this nightmare experience. The server finally shows up to tell me that I can pay at the table. When he noticed my facial expression in response to his statement, he said &#34;Yeah, I should&#39;ve brought you the check.&#34; Finally, a manager decided to appear and ask me if I have been helped and I said &#34;barely&#34;. He offered to hear my feedback but I didn&#39;t want to make a scene in front of my family. I doubt I will ever return. Totally not worth the money!!!"

Sausage taste was a tad bit better but the crust was hardly at all any thinner and the crust still tasted the same--like eating cardboard.

Still not fond of the doorman that won&#39;t let you fully step into the bar until he&#39;s done scrutinizing your ID (I swear, I&#39;m 22!). And still not fond of the &#34;biker&#34; bar scene. But usually service is good and food is yummy and decently priced. 

I really like that their outside patio, which features bags and is a convenient place for a smoke, turns into a covered area for billiards in the winter. I&#39;ve had their burgers, fries (bacon/sour cream/cheese, cheese, Greek), wings (really yummy! apparently they have 50¢ wings at a specific time on Mondays), and breaded mushrooms. I&#39;ve always been satisfied. 

Despite my recent visit last Friday, when our waitress was extremely inattentive and sometimes just plain ignored us and just stood at the bar, I will return to this place! Their service has been excellent otherwise. 

I also believe that their beer is ~$4. Mmm Blue Moon on tap. Watch out! They charge for water (it&#39;s bottled)"

Sure most of the places closed early etc but were happy to find one next to airport to wait temporarily and get a light snack till my friend landed at O Hare. 
Two of us just got into this place and we ushered into a corner table, I was on phone talking to someone before taking the seat and the lady asked us do you guys wanna drink something - which my friend responded &#34;water with no ice&#34;.. Now, since I was on phone, I didn&#39;t catch what the lady said but it looked like they had just BOTTLED water, she was really rude and she slammed the bottles on the table.. Next we thought we would get some mozerella sticks as appetizers - then she got 5 of them for $5, atleast I can understand when the place was packed and there was no food left in kitchen, but oh my god this she kept in our table and walked away.
We were just waiting for my friend, since we had plans for dinner and didn&#39;t wanna eat anything.. She came around and asked us if we wanted something, I said we are good and she stares at us and says - That&#39;s it..!!

To boot?  They had Goose Island 312 in bottles, hidden behind the Miller, Old Style, and Budweiser.  I guess you can sum up this place by a sign they have on the wall that says, &#34;Jaegermeister is our house wine.&#34;"

For complete transparency, we did go during the day and not at night. My wife and I found ourself in the area late at night and needed a place to stay. We found a cheap hotel right next door.  After we got up we decided to find a place to eat. We got on yelp and found the Korner House. We almost didn&#39;t go because of the reviews. That would have been a mistake. As soon as we walked in someone greeted us. Our waitress was at our table almost immediately. Both people were very friendly. I wife ordered a Greek salad and I got the steak sandwich. Both were great.  The waitress didn&#39;t even bat an eye when I asked for a substitution to my meal. The food was very good and the beer fresh. 

If this restaurant was in a hip section of Chicago would I have given it 5 stars? No, but it isn&#39;t located there. It&#39;s located in an industrial part of Chicago. For where it is, it deserves more than 5 stars.

Just see any of my reviews and updates.  No matter how many stars I rate it for different reasons, I always return to give them more business, it&#39;s kinda funny actually.  It&#39;s the same bar, same people, same ladies bartending it, same low prices on booze and sometimes a difference in side offerings.  Side shit like games.  BBHP is gone, or I should say it rears its head every once in awhile.  I really don&#39;t care anymore since I realized many people (not all) that play Big Buck Hunter Pro and Safari are cheaters that stand with their guns on the screen.  Reminds me of those losers that would play Nintendo&#39;s duck hunt with the gun against the screen.  I don&#39;t know how they allow people to do that at BBHP tournament&#39;s, but whatever.
Back to the Korner house, some many months back they made the change to Angus for their burgers and it&#39;s a tasty difference.  I&#39;ve had the sliders a couple of times now and every time they are more satisfying than the rinky dink beef they used before.  
If you ever enter and wonder why the place smells like toes? its not because the lady bartenders are wearing open toed shoes on sweaty days. Actually it&#39;s because someone ordered Saganaki.  For those of you without culture, it&#39;s not sushi.  It&#39;s Greek and it&#39;s a tasty sample of Mozzarella cheese with butter and brandy lit on fire as it&#39;s served.  OPA! That get&#39;s yelled as it&#39;s served by the eastern European bartender.  

Pull up to a seat at the bar, order some booze, throw a few tunes onto the Internet powered jukebox and enjoy the time.  Booze is cheap just like the bitches.  Heyoooooooooo!

Wait did someone say biker hangout?  No dude.  Bikers aren&#39;t in here that often.  More like local crowd, those traveling the byways, truckers, early shift strippers and seasoned drivers.

Few hints: 
Don&#39;t wait for service, ask for it.  If you wait, it&#39;ll be long and you&#39;ll resent it.
Sit anywhere you like, no one is paying very much attention.
If your a newbie in there, don&#39;t just sit, have one beer and then leave because you aren&#39;t sure about it.  Have a damn shot, because it&#39;s hella cheaper than any other bar around and for goodness sake play a song on the juke."

We were greeted right away by a very pleasant, friendly and beautiful server. Not that it matters if she was beautiful, but hell, it sure doesn&#39;t hurt. she took our drink orders right away and gave us a couple minutes to look over the menu. The atmosphere is a bit dark, but not in a bad way. Dark wood and somewhat dim lighting, but it was just right. It&#39;s not one of your fancy sports bars. It comes across as more of your local/regulars type of place. I&#39;ll admit that it seemed to take a little longer than expected for our food, Maxwell Street Polish and Chicken Gyro....but it was worth it. Delicious!

I responded cash to witch she told me I had to pay right away. This I thought was a very bad business practice. I don&#39;t totally blame her for the poor service though. The place had many customers and she was the only waitress on the floor. They seemed more focused on getting you drunk than feeding you. They had at least 2 maybe 3 behind the bar.

We were still waiting on the rest of them to arrive and the bartender was only concerned as to whether or not we wanted a drink.

Where&#39;s the service??!! We placed our first round of drinks and placed some orders of food.  We were given beer first, then each dish we ordered was brought out separately. Yes, we had the mozzarella sticks out, then the fries, then the fried chicken....all fried foods normally come together.

All in all, we were never &#34;checked&#34; up on until we stood up to leave and she was only concerned with who was paying for the bill.

Has lounge outside to smoke in; great for those chilly nights. Usually a band on fri or sat and always have a poker run or something going on. 
Great late late night fun when the Heavenly Bodies girls come drink after a long night of earning money dancing across the street. 
Pros: cheap wing specials on mon after 1900 and mini burgers on tues.   Large seating area so there is never any bumping or crowding. New arcade games and dart board. 
Cons: no pool table. the cheap wings sorta suck-but what do you expect for 25c wings on mon, service is about average for bar service"

The food is rediculously good for bar food. Try the Saganaki there, it&#39;s incredible! 

The bartender ladies are ADORABLE and fun and keep the party going every time I stop in there. 

The owners are nice people who care THERE AND CARE about their business. I can&#39;t say that enough. An owner int he building at all times goes a long way. 

They totally revamped the inside and outside of this place and it&#39;s AWESOME and welcoming. 

Truly a great little watering hole with ecclectic crowds. don&#39;t forget, heavely bodies is accross the street and the girls are always popping in for an early or late drink. Why not, they are treated with respect and TLC. I don&#39;t blame them. oh and if you tihnk you can just step up to all the hot girls here beware. The owners like happy ladies, so you had better have sick game or be buying their tab. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to upset the owners by scaring off the natives. 

More often it&#39;s industry people showing up after work for a quick rinse. 

This is a great place with a great location and since they updated the place, it&#39;s even more desireable for the late night crowd. 

Trust me on this one - it&#39;s safe and you will be cared for. I see it all the time."

When I first saw the sign I honestly thought it was a biker because of the wings and it&#39;s right across the street from heavenly bodies. As I walked in, it was a bit smaller then i thought but they have some pretty cool arcade games that you can play at the bar that can get pretty addicting. The outside is small also which u can play bags at and the food specials are really good. I think last night it was like 10 wings for like $1.50 or so. The only thing I could say that would improve my experience was if the place was bigger and the bathrooms were a little bit nicer. Other than that it was a pretty cool experience."

The service my first time was great. She was new and tried very hard to please us including letting me try the BBQ sauce before ordering it. She kept the beers and soda filled. The second time we did not get napkins much less a second beer. When we asked for our bill is when I got offerred a refill on my drink. To pay the bill we had to find the server because she didn&#39;t come to us.

Don&#39;t get me started on the cook&#39;s.. those guys stare at you like there killing you in there heads.

I would give a 1 and a half if I could but since I can&#39;t I&#39;ll give them a 2.

Finally a few minutes later she approached us asking what we were ordering (notice no menus) and we asked for water. I guess she caught on and brought us menus, we got wings and those took 30 minutes and of course all that time she vanished. we waited sipping on water and nothing else because no one was around to order. when she did come out from hiding she had the wings and walked away again, we had to stop her to order something else. never saw her again after that until we walked up to the bar to pay.

The Ambiance is very charming and traditional white tablecloth. The staff is very attentative, polite, and knowledgeable of the menu. 

The dishes are excecuted flawlesssly, using traditional methods you can taste. Flavors, robust and fresh, happily dance across the palette in a well paired routine. 

A phenomenal selection of Italian wine and  beers that accompany a menu of simplistic sophistication. Tradition means something here.

Came here to celebrate my sister&#39;s birthday dinner. Found out about this restaurant on yelp. The service was okay/good. Food not so good. Ambience - old 80&#39;s style. The wierdest of all is that if you want to share a plate of food you will be charged an extra $3.00. When confirmed with the waitress, she said this is a rule in many restaurants (not at least the ones I have been to)

We ordered fried mozzarella twists and stuffed artichoke for appetizers, the mozzarella twists were tasty but greasy. The tomato sauce served with the twists was delicious. Artichoke was okay-ish, the topping on the artichoke was like some oily wet bread paste - if that even makes sense - again tasted okay.

For main course, my husband and my brother-in-law ordered their tilapia which again was greasy and lacked flavor and seasoning. I ordered gnocchi in regular pesto sauce and some veggies. The waitress confirmed that I wanted regular pesto and got me something that looked and tasted very much like creamy pesto. The gnocchi were very big in size and hence felt like a ball of dough in my mouth. My sister and sister-in-law ordered the Giambotta - their&#39;s was okay-not so good according to them.

At the end our waitress got us a tiramisu with a candle on top for the birthday girl - and this was not the best and not the worst. The mascarpone felt a little less smoother than it should be, it wasn&#39;t grainy though. The taste was nothing special and the presentation too.

Not going back!!"

We didn&#39;t have a reservation, but we were seated right away. The restaurant seems a little bit bigger from the outside, but it&#39;s really cozy inside. Our waitress was really friendly and sweet, and the food was great! 

The waitress brought over some fresh bread, which was still warm (really tasty). We started off with the fried calamari appetizer, and I must say that is was perfect! Probably the best calamari I have ever had. The portion was really big, and it was so crispy! For the main course, I decided to go with the Vitello Scaloppini, which is veal topped with a lot of yummy mushrooms. I also got a side of angel hair pasta. The veal was pretty good, maybe just a little bit salty for my liking. For dessert, we split a slice of the turtle cookie dough ice cream pie. It was the perfect ending to a delicious dinner, and more than enough for two people to share. I will definitely be coming back!"

Its your basic Italian restaurant that also does banquettes and the room style reflects that. No knocking this place though..I will be back when I&#39;m in the area. I had the chicken limon. It was decent. I would come back for the mussels in marinara or the braciole.

We started with a half dozen baked clams.  They are a nice size with just the right amount of garlic induced breading.  A half dozen is just the right amount to split between to two people.  I chose a salad with their homemade garlic dressing.  Garlic lovers, this is for you.  It&#39;s too bad they don&#39;t bottle it for sale.  It&#39;s that good.

For entrees, I had the Fettuccini Verde and my wife had Linguini with clams in an garlic and olio sauce.  First, the Fettuccini Verde; I wanted a somewhat &#34;light&#34; pasta dish.  To some, that sounds like an oxymoron and I&#39;m inclined to agree.  But on a hot summer day I wasn&#39;t looking for a gut buster Bolognese sauce.  The Fettuccini Verde is prepared with spinach fettuccini and a sauce comprised of fresh chunk tomatoes, garlic, onion and basil.  I&#39;ll be honest, I have never had a tomato sauce like this.  Although the major ingredient was fresh tomatoes, this sauce was not acidic at all.  It was excellent.

My wife ordered the Linguini with clams.  You have the option of ordering it with a variety of sauces.  She chose the garlic and olio sauce.  I had the good fortune to enjoy this the next day for lunch.  It too was excellent.  The clams were in no way gritty and the sauce almost seemed &#34;silky&#34; without the garlic being too overbearing.  This is a staple at most Italian restaurants.  I rarely order it because, in most cases, the dish seems boring to me.  In Giacomo&#39;s case, the subtle seasoning and care with which the garlic and olio are prepared elevate the dish to a new level.  It&#39;s very well done.

We had not planned on having dessert. I was actually going to order a Limoncello until our server mentioned they had a special dessert not on the menu: Limoncello Ladyfingers Marscipone cake.  Wow,  I&#39;ll have that!  It&#39;s hard for me to put into words how delicate and delicious this was.  If it&#39;s on the specials menu when you drop in, be sure to save room for dessert.  You will not be disappointed.

The only part of the dining experience that was just so-so was the wine list.  Comprising mostly Italian wines, I tried the Chianti first followed by the Malbec.  I thought both were average.  We only ordered wine by the glass but you can order more upscale wines by the bottle that range from $60-$75.  

Our server Alexandra, was top-notch.  She was very attentive even though she was responsible for a number of tables inside and outside on Giacomo&#39;s small patio.  It was nice to see the hostess (perhaps one of the owners?) backing up the wait staff by schlepping drinks and helping with other things.  It was good to see servers, busboys AND management working as a team.  We dined late afternoon on a Sunday and the restaurant was 3/4 full.  It&#39;s a small room so I would recommend reservations anytime you go.  When we went, it was definitely an older crowd but we also had a high school aged couple on a date seated next to us.  No, this is not an avant guard, hipster place.  It&#39;s a comfortable room nonetheless.

In terms of value, we had 1/2 dozen baked clams, salad, two entrees, one dessert special, 3 glasses wine, 2 cocktails, one Limoncello.  The bill was $110.  Excellent value in my book.  

In summary, Giacomo&#39;s is an excellent Italian restaurant serving traditional dishes with a great deal of care.  Excellent preparations, great service in a comfortable setting make this restaurant worth the drive.  Based on our experience, I can&#39;t see how you could go wrong."

The problem is the wait for a table, even with reservations.  Sometimes it can be two hours!  So if you&#39;re like us, you might want to skip the wait at Maggiano&#39;s and go 15 minutes east to Giacomo&#39;s.  The food is equally as good (actually the sauce is much better here), they have the white table cloths, and great, friendly, attentive service.  What you won&#39;t find at Giacomo&#39;s is the 2 hour waits and the lemon cookies. Which is fine with us. We both had the lasagna and purposely stopped eating way before we wanted to so we could try their desserts.  It was worth it.  Not only did we get deliciously sweet desserts, we left with enough food for another meal.  This place is really a hidden gem and easy to miss.  It&#39;s set back a little off of Wolf Road, but there is a sign right on the street. So if you&#39;re looking for as good of a dinner as you&#39;re going to find at any Italian mother&#39;s kitchen, make a point to visit this place.

The best Italian food this side of the Mississippi! The husband and wife team do a wonderful job making you feel at home . The waitstaff is very friendly and knowledgeable regarding the menus and always have great insight . The decor is nothing to rave about but it does have that homey feeling. I have tried a number of items on the menu and can honestly say from the veal, chicken (any dish) to the soups and salads I have not had better anywhere else. Although it is not advertised as a kid friendly place there is no reason not to bring your children. Giacomo himself always finds time to chat with my 7 year old boy each time we eat there. Funny thing is, I actually think he remembers him from always seeing him . We do not leave without saying goodbye to Giacomo and that&#39;s simply because of my son. He always makes our entire family smile . ENJOY!"

Let me just say how nice and very friendly the staff was: from the valet(free) to the hostess, and to our waiter.  They had a nice cozy corner for us and it was perfect since there were many groups of families there from kids to older adults.  
 I had a pinot noir which was so good! We ordered calamari as an appetizer which was a huge portion in comparison to other places. It was cooked perfectly! Not to oily or too bready- very light and they  were not cheap with the calamari as other places its more bready and no calamari in it.
 My husband ordered the cream od spinach soup and I had a taste of it and was so delicious! I had the minestrone- my favorite. So far, we were impressed on how good everything was from this point. Our waiter was always tentative and always checked on us. Happy about that.
Dinner was fantastic: I ordered the linguine with mussels, clams, calamari, scallops, shrimp, and octopus. Everything was very generous proportioned and fresh! I was delighted to see how they weren&#39;t cheap with the quality of the seafood as other places. Everything was so fresh and homemade, using good quality ingredients. My husband ordered the pasta with broccoli and shrimp,  which again, they gave you a generous amount. He was happy with his order.
 Took most of our food to go since we were so full. But, we had to order dessert! I usually don&#39;t but seen on Check Please! how good the tiramisu was: Fantastic and was homemade, and was so fresh and delicious! My husband ordered the spumoni cheesecake which was also excellent and you vould taste that hint of  cinnamon on that last byte in your mouth. 
 I can&#39;t believe how close we lived to Giacomos(9 yrs in the area, not even 5 minutes away) and waited this long to go. I highly recommend this place if you live near or far. If you are looking for good quality, homemade Italian food and don&#39;t want to drive all the way to the city, then give this place a try! Will not regret it! Prices are very reasonable for the huge portions and great quality of ingredients they use!
 By the way, they do have a patio for the warmer months."

We dined here to celebrate my husband&#39;s 30th birthday; it was also our first time eating at the restaurant. We made reservations about a week ahead of time because there were 7 of us going. 

We were seated in a party room and the service was great. Our salads arrived quickly and the food was served hot and within a reasonable amount of time from when our salads were delivered. Portions are very large, so plan on taking some leftovers home (never a bad thing, right?) 

Restaurant is $ on the higher side for me, but like I said, you get a lot of food. I had the spinach ravioli with picky packy sauce and my husband ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. Both were extremely yummy. 

This would be a &#39;special&#39; occasion restaurant for us, not something we do on a monthly basis. We will definitely return as the food was absolutely delicious and the service was excellent. 

Decor and overall ambiance are dated for my taste, but Thai doesn&#39;t take-away from the tasty food.

White table clothes with casual dress. 
What amazes us most of the time is folks who think ripped jeans is casual dress.
FYI ripped clothing is not casual dress.

Anyhow, everyone is welcome.

Dip the warm Italian bread into the extra virgin olive oil topped with their cheese mix.
But, remember to save room in your tummy for your main meal. 

Superb Italian plates to mangia  mangia there or take home leftovers for next day.

Our waiter was attentive and well-mannered, and he came to check on us as needed; not so often as to be irritating, nor so scarcely as to ignore us. Just right.

I ordered the spinach ravioli with the &#34;Picky Packy&#34; sauce (tomato, garlic, onion, basil) and my date ordered the fettucine verde. Everything tasted so magnificent, and it was prepared beautifully.

I&#39;ve attended a graduation, bridal shower and baby shower here.  The graduation had the most amazing food in 2011.  It was family style and everything was delicious.  Then I attended a bridal shower in 2014 where the food was inedible, we ate it because we were hungry, and some of us had horrible stomach aches for days.  The vegetables looked like they came out of a package and the chicken was flavorless.  I recently attended a baby shower and the same thing happened.  The food was just so boring and it may be what the host ordered but many of us had stomach aches for days again.

It was only because if a bad experience elsewhere in which made me with I came to Giacomo&#39;s instead that I even thought of it.  (See my previous review if you would like to learn of a place to avoid)

Giacomo&#39;s has some of the best Italian food I have ever had, hands down.  To help forget about the bad experience elsewhere, we went to Giacomo&#39;s last night and hand a wonderful meal.  My wife had the always fantastic Lasagna.  I would describe it, but half the reviews here talk about it and it was part of Giacomo&#39;s feature on Check Please a while back.  Just try it, you will never want lasagna anywhere else ever again, it is that good.

My son had the cheese ravioli (his usual) and loved it.  And I had the veal florentine which was fantastic.  The spinach was fresh, the veal was tender and the dish had just the perfect taste of white wine.  Fantastic!

We also had the baked clams which are a usual for us regardless of what else we order.  A beautiful dozen of very large, very tasty and very hot baked clams is the perfect way to start every meal at Giacomo&#39;s.  

After all that, we were too full for desert, but I will say that their tiramisu, like the Lasagna is the best around.  

You can&#39;t go wrong with Giacomo&#39;s!"

We said yes and left for a bit (there is no seating by bar).  We came back 45 minutes later and the hostess said that there was not a table ready but 3 were close.  She then bought us both drinks for having returned.

The lady who took my order was super sweet, and when I told her that it was my first time there, she told me that my appetizer was on the house. Amazing!

The appetizer was an order of their mozzarella cheese sticks, which were a hit. The outside was some kind of crunchy/doughy thing and inside was the melty mozz, served with a vodka sauce on the side. We also got the minestrone soup, which was just okay. It was a bit too thick for my taste, as I&#39;m used to a lighter broth with minestrone. The soups came with a small piece of french bread. 

Entrees were the chicken parmesan and veal parmesan. I thought the veal was tastier, but both were delicious. We both were unable to finish our entrees, and I&#39;m really excited for leftovers for dinner tonight.

My only complaint is that they didn&#39;t provide any extra parmesan cheese, butter for the bread, silverware, or napkins. I am used to take out orders coming with this stuff... maybe I needed to ask?

Overall, a solid choice for classic Italian food. Will be back to dine in for sure!"

I had the Gnocchi with vodka sauce, and it was just to die for. The Tiramisu was probably the best desert I have ever had.  I am looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

The quantity of food they serve here is about 2 - 4 servings per person. Thus, while it is pretty expensive per dish, you are getting your money&#39;s worth. Sadly, we had no room for dessert.

2nd time around ordered carry out and were amazed at how the hosted treated us when knowing we drove over 1hour just to pick up our Valentine&#39;s dinner. Even after arriving home after a long drive, our food was fresh and taste was on point. The lasagna was really good, the spaghetti pesto was awesome too and also tried the cannoli and fell in love even more with this restaurant. 

I&#39;m glad we stepped out of the routine chain restaurant dinning! After dinning here, I will never ever step into a chain restaurant again!"

This restaurant was recommended to us by a co-worker, and what a GREAT recommendation!  From the minute we walked in, we were greeted friendly by what appeared to be a chef!!?? We were seated promptly, and also greeted by our waiter, who was very friendly, and offered suggestions when we could not make up our mind!
Very large portions, delicious entrees, and they even brought us a dessert, on the house, because it was out first visit there!
We will be returning and enjoying even more meals here!!!!!!

Unfortunately, these were not met. It wasn&#39;t terrible, and it was by no means great - standard red sauce, meat not very tender, boring specials, family owned, nice but not worth what they charge for entrées.  Too many other choices in Chicago for Italian food. The one highlight was the lentil soup, it was amazing!"

We have been to this restaurant several times over the years.  Still great service, friendly, attentive, and amazing food!  Lasagna this time was melt in your mouth good, and I ate leftovers for two days.  The minestrone soup was fine, salad was an average salad, iceberg with tomato.  Fresh bread with olive oil, pretty standard but hot.  Vodka sauce was light and paired well with spinach ravioli, penne pasta was perfect when ordered with home made picky packy sauce!  The chocolate lava cake is amazing, but the cannoli really was the best we had ever had outside of Rome, Italy."

When I told them it was our first time, they introduced us to their husband, who is the chef.  He came out to say hello.

I saw the infamous lasagna get served to numerous patrons and it was HUGE. My boyfriend had the chicken parm and he said it was very good...especially the breading. I had the Polo Florentine and it was spectacular. The chicken breast was super moist and the mozz cheese  was gooey heaven. I was undecided on which kind of wine to have with my dinner and the waitress let me sample a  Pinot  -and I ordered it with my meal and it was great .

We called for a table at 6pm and they were able to accommodate us at 6:30, but we had the very last table in the joint. So, obviously, this is a popular place. &#39;Check, Please&#39; effect, perhaps?

Very family atmosphere: friendly and experienced waitstaff, personal greeting from the hostess/owner when you arrive. We split a fried zucchini appetizer and each had a cup of minestrone soup. Kids got penne marinara, which had a nice, fresh sauce. I had the sausage-shrimp-asparagus-artichoke-tomato pasta special and my husband did the eggplant rotolo. The food was above average but I wouldn&#39;t say it was amazing. The atmosphere and overall feel skews more toward supper club than high-end restaurant (not that there is anything wrong with that). Definitely not supper club prices, though. Dinner for 4 ran us $95 with tip. For that amount, I was glad to have brought home a lunch&#39;s worth of leftovers."

I was not disappointed with this place.  We were greeted like family as soon as we walked in. We were seated quickly without a reservation. The food was awesome and was large portions.  I had the meat ravioli with picky-packy sauce. So fresh. Hubby had the braciole which was fantastic. Son had the veal &amp; Eggplant parmesan.  The portion was huge but he managed t eat the whole thing! Another thing I really liked was that the waitstaff was extremely attentive yet unobtrusive.

Service: Service was personal and attentive. Waitress made menu recommendations and they were spot on. Owner went around the dining room and checked in on each table personally. Food came out at a reasonable pace for us to enjoy a relaxing dinner experience. 

Food: Had the lasagna with meat sauce and it was very good. Portion sizes are large enough that you will have a second meal. We also started off with the calamari. Calamari was properly cooked and had a nice flavor. Wife created a pasta dish and the waitress was very accommodating with her request to add additional vegetables. 

Location: We had a short wait on a Friday night, so it might be a good idea to make a reservation. The waiting area contains 4 chairs that are outside the bathroom.

This place is just a few minutes from her house and yet she&#39;s been telling us to take her to Olive Garden because she thought it was an easier drive!  Oh, bother...

Giacomo&#39;s had been on my &#34;must try&#34; bookmark list for a while now not realizing how close to Busia&#39;s it is.  Then my father-in-law saw it on &#34;Check, please!&#34; and asked to go there for his birthday dinner.  Absolutely!

Their website highly recommends reservations and I would have to agree with them.  The restaurant is cozy-small.  We did not have a reservation and waited a half-hour for a table for five, which is better than the initial 45 minutes we were told the wait would be.  A number of people came in to pick up their take-out orders while we waited which would also be a great option. (Side note: they also have a seperate room for larger groups or parties.)

The menu is extensive for food, wine and dessert.  We were all drooling over the many choices in the menu while we waited.

We had the Pinot Grigio/Sauvignon Blanc blend of wine by Due Uve and everyone loved it.  There was a huge basket of warm bread on the table which we gobbled up dipped in olive oil and a parmesan cheese &amp; herb blend which was put on the table.  We also ordered the calamari and it was fresh and perfectly fried with plenty of marinara sauce for dipping.

For dinner the five of us had: Bracciole, Chicken Parmesan, Steak di Anna, Chicken di Anna and I had the Shrimp and Scallops with Portobello Risotto.  I sampled most of the others&#39; meals - all delicious.  My husband&#39;s steak was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  The only disappointment was the risotto with my meal; seemed a bit overcooked and had some clumps in it.  I understand risotto can be a bit tricky to cook so, oh well.  The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly and the portobello were plentiful.

The portions here are HUGE!  You will get anywhere from two to four servings from one meal unless you have a reeeeeaaaallly big appetite.  We had birthday desserts waiting at home so we didn&#39;t sample any of those but they certainly sounded delicious.

The staff was friendly and even the bus boys were quick and courteous.  We love to visit small family-owned places and this one is just perfect!"

Giacomo&#39;s is what I would describe as an old-school red sauce Italian restaurant, and we enjoyed it very much.  We shared a veal and eggplant special, as well as the canneloni.  Both were delicious.  If I had to make one complaint, it would be that I&#39;m not sure the flaming lava cake was baked on site, and I thought it was a little too boozy.

A month or two and a reservation later, I confess Giacomo&#39;s has delicious food.  I ordered the Chicken Cacciatore and it was darn near perfect (and I wasn&#39;t scoffed at for asking for olives in it!).  Chicken Marsala and Chicken Cacciatore are my &#34;foundation&#34; Italian dishes and usually what I order when first trying a new Italian restaurant.

It is pricey, however balanced by the large portions.  I live in Des Plaines, but this place is easy to miss.  I only knew of it from Check Please and my ever-loved Entertainment book.

The food is extremely tasty and plentiful for a very affordable price.  The Sausage &amp; Peppers are sweet and tasty with a little spice, while the grated cheese combination is delicious with a little olive oil &amp; bread or over any of their incredible pasta dishes.

Above and beyond the food, the staff and owners are welcoming and gracious.  My family went to Giacomo&#39;s for a place to gather after my Mother&#39;s funeral and from the first time we walked in to taste the food and figure out the menu to the time when we left after having 60 + family members and friends through everything was top notch and my mother would have been proud.

For instance, our tab was $157 and change, but the posted amount was conveniently rounded up to an even $158. I&#39;m certainly not that cheap and I really don&#39;t care about pennies- but this is a matter of proper business. I think that as a rule, restaurants should charge what their customers sign on the receipt. 

The sauces were good, but the pasta for all 4 of us was over-cooked. Service was friendly but kept on checking on us as it got closer to closing time. Overall, a nice business that lost my business over a few pennies. For me, it&#39;s the principle."

These are my only complaints

I didn&#39;t enjoy the direct sight line into the kitchen, which is a bit unappetizing when you&#39;re eating or being seated.  It&#39;s right next to the host station, and visible to certain tables.  I guess that&#39;s being nitpicky, but I really hate looking at kitchens when I&#39;m in a restaurant.

The food was good, but the tomato sauce, or as Italians call it, &#34;gravy,&#34;  was way too salty.  As an avid cook myself, I think it could have used far less salt.  They also used way too much Mozzarella cheese.  I ordered the eggplant parm, and I was shoveling off cheese.  I think the chef would do himself a favor, and save money, if he used half the amount, and I think people would still be pleased with the food. 

As for the eggplant itself, I enjoyed the thinly cut pieces, and they didn&#39;t taste greasy.  The sauce itself was a nice tomato texture, just way too salty.  

I will be back though, because we had an overall good experience.  My husband really enjoyed his meal, and the food tasted fresh.  He had chicken parm, and he said the portion was huge, and the chicken was tender and juicy. 

He also loved his cocktails."

It&#39;s inside Woodfield Mall, so yes, it&#39;s a busy place! And when we were there on a Saturday evening, the line was long but what do you expect???  For no one to be there? They could improve by having 2 cashiers versus just one. But the hot dog I had was great!  The corn dog bites were done really good too and great for kids! The fries were ok. Not the best, but not that bad, because I&#39;ve had worse at other places. The interior is decorated well and they have oldie songs playing in the background.  Their polar blasts are very delicious!

To be honest, the root beer used to come out of a giant barrel here and it was sweet and delish.  The burgers and fries were almost an afterthought because the root beer was so good.  Nowadays you still get a heavy frosted glass mug for your root beer, but now the root beer comes out of a typical pop dispenser machine.  The root beer is still good, but not great.  So is the food any better?  Meh - not really.  The burgers, the coney dog, the onion rings are all so so, but the cheese curds are not too bad.

Nothing against Red Robin since it has its place. And hey, sometimes you don&#39;t want to spend that much money for a meal, you know?

I also miss the tap they used to have inside here for the root beer, but maybe this place keeps their soda taps clean unlike some fast food places, since the root beer still tasted decent. Employees are your usual teens, but unlike a lot of fast food places where they might have a subtle and gruff attitude underneath the surface, they actually were genuinely friendly. Fries were also fine too, though part of me wished after skimming the yelp reviews with the app while I ate, that I kinda wish I&#39;d ordered the cheese curds. What can you do, though.

The employees on a Sunday at the A&amp;W in Woodfield mall!!! 
There is no such thing as multi tasking with these unmotivated employees. Really, have 2 of 3 visible employees stand there doing nothing other than wait for food to come from the back? One of these could at least bus the dining area. I do hope that Schaumburg&#39;s health department makes a visit soon. Not singling out one of them. This is all of them! Not one employee has smiled. I would leave names, however only one has a name tag and I cannot read her name. One cashier, line half way to the door at 2pm. Not a single smile. The cashier appears to have prison tattoos which is okay, but cover them up. I had thought this was a family establishment. I have now hit the 10 minute mark waiting for a single root beer float, after waiting almost 15 min in line. My child wanted lunch here with a float, but I had to say no, because I was afraid of how long I would have to wait for them to actually make food, as opposed to pouring root beer and ice cream in a cup. Also, I am not really keen on the lack of cleanliness here. If so bad for the customer view, I do not want to know what it looks like in the food prep area outside of customers view.
Almost forgot to mention how the actual root beer float was! The float was good and creamy. There are however other places I can go for a good float."

From what I understood, it was possible that they may have received a free burger. I&#39;m not upset about that, I&#39;m sure what he did was honest. ;) Anyway, our order was completely wrong. For 4 of us, one drink was ordered and it was the wrong drink! Also the frosted mugs were not frosted and it looks as if the mugs have seen better days, so I opted for a to go cup.
The restaurant was clean, but messy. Not dirt that I could see, but lots of garbage on the floor. As we were leaving though, someone started mopping so that helps, I guess.

Where else in the area can you get deep fried cheese curds and an amazing root beer float?

That&#39;s right, I said P.U.

I needed to take care of some business at the mall, and I needed something to eat.  I didn&#39;t want the same old McDonalds, and my pockets were too meager for Red Robin.  So I decided to go to A&amp;W for a snack.  I immediately noticed how empty the restaurant is.  Even for a Tuesday afternoon.  And the floors were sticky.  But I decided to stick with it because I was hungry, and a root beer didn&#39;t sound like a bad idea.  I ordered the 8 count corn dog nuggets (the pillar of health food) and a regular root beer.  The cashier was friendly enough.  I helped myself to the root beer and got myself a table.  When my order was called, I got up to get my food, only to turn around and see another employee take my root beer away as he was cleaning.  I say, &#34;Excuse me, I was still sitting there.&#34;  He gives me a sneer, simply says &#34;Oh,&#34; and puts my glass back.  I guess saying, &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; would have been too much strain.

The food is exactly as I expected: mediocre.  The root beer is delicious, which I why my ** rating is fair.  The condiment station was a mess: no ketchup, mustard with a crusty spout, spills of beverages everywhere.  I immediately thanked myself for not springing for a full meal.

Maybe I&#39;ll come back for a root beer float, but for the food?  No.

I would endure mediocre hot dogs and fries as long as I could wash it down with as much root beer as I could drink.

Unfortunately on my latest visit I was stunned to see that they had removed my beloved taps.  Instead the A&amp;W root beer had been moved to the soda fountain machine.  I tried it anyway.  At least they still had the mugs.  I hate drinking out of those disposable cups that fast food places usually use.

Service was friendly and they were pretty quick to prepare my order. The cashier did warn me that it would take a few minutes because they were waiting on the fries, which I was glad to see him be proactive to the situation. So while waiting for my order, I went and got my drink. Of course I had the Root Beer, you HAVE to. I did have a complaint though, the drink area was sticky as the root beer tappers aren&#39;t like typical soda fountains. Depending on how aggressive you are with the tapper, you could fill your cup (or mug) with foam from it spraying or have a limp stream of root beer completely miss the container. Needless to say I overcame this obstacle in time to be handed my tray of hot and fresh food. 

Found a decently cleaned table, and enjoyed my meal. Fries were hot and toasty, burger had fresh and crisp veggies on it, and I was satisfied.

Food: We got the butter chicken, chicken biriyani and garlic naan. They all had great flavor and the chicken was so tender. Surprisingly though, the garlic naan is what took it to the next level. The texture was soft and chewy, while the garlic kept my taste buds in check! It went really well with the butter chicken.

Service: Service was nice and friendly. We ordered at the front and waited to pick up our food at the table. During our meal, the host went to all the tables asking how the food tasted. For a place that has a order &amp; pick-up setting, I thought it was nice they paid attention to their service. 

Atmosphere: The reason one star was knocked off. The atmosphere was small and cramped. Not a big deal, but I&#39;d probably just order to-go next time."

Their food is delicious, And the guy at the counter is pretty friendly too. He offered us complimentary lassis a couple times. :)

We have had butter and garlic nans and onion kulcha, all tasting good, and gongura chicken, baingan bharta, andhra chicken, andhra vankaya, palak paneer, paneer tikka, tandoori chicken, chicken 65 - all of them are delicious - gongura chicken, palak paneer and Andhra vankaya, though we could actually get the latter only once out of the many times we ordered, are particularly good.

Baigan bharta that they make is not actual bharta and it is Eggplant in spicy gravy served in Andhra Pradesh with biryani... It tastes good for sure but the name is misleading??

Overall, very good food and service. Ambience.. Clean and all but little rough like someone else mentioned in their review.."

CA has a ton but IL it&#39;s hard to fine food like this.

This place makes all other Indian Restaurants in Schaumburg seem like garbage.  This place trumps all of those other Indian restaurants.

It&#39;s cheap, it&#39;s well worth it.  I&#39;ve attached some pics.  My wife and I went a few days ago.  I had the Butter Chicken and on first bite my eyes lit up.  Amazing.

Also at first I was thinking why did they serve the food in Styrofoam even though I was eating in that day.  Then you realize oh! excellent idea, because I can just take it to go, it&#39;s already ready to take home if I can&#39;t eat it all.

Best samosa&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had.  Typically when you go to Indian restaurants, the dough is either mushy or has no taste.  Theirs is crispy as hell and tastes just awesome.  Sauce is good.

Well I am matured enough to know that you cant expect mysore in mysore dosa.The whole dish had 50% Onions, 45% Capsicum &amp; 5% soggy Gobi. I was pretty disappointed as I had high expectations. Chicken Biryani - Portion size is good. I dont think Ive seen any place giving out that size for 9.99. As it is a take out place, I came home &amp; started eating it out of the box it was packed in. Rice was on the top &amp; the whole masala on the bottom or should I say lumps of masala in the bottom. It tasted bad.

Aloo paratha was made with the alo o subzi loaded with onions and mustard seeds.
Roti sorry but not even ok and that is basic thing which any restaurant has normal taste.
Dum biryani never tasted like biryani at all we just had a spoon and thrashed it.
Egg curry was so so badly done with 3 boiled eggs placed in left over alo o subzi.Never till date we have seen egg curry with aloo subzi gravy with some hairs as complimentary.
It&#39;s just waste of time and money.Just stay away..You might be wondering why some many good reviews.We saw that this is right opp to IV apartments filled with majority of desis..It&#39;s very reasonably priced for bachelor&#39;s and families just arrived from india who want to eat there or to go orders .

The only reason I gave 4 stars, is that this place is small, and is not very sit down friendly ( they have few tables).  It is truly a carry out place.

I chatted with the cashier and a young gentleman about what to get. They were extremely friendly, didn&#39;t make fun of my inability to pronounce the names of dishes, and made awesome recommendations. I ended up ordering the butter chicken, tandoor chicken, and the baby goat curry (which was on special).
I ordered to go, and was served a sample of another dish while waiting. They cook everything fresh, so I was more than happy to wait. The free bite was incredible- I wish I could recall what it was, spicy sausage in a green sauce that had heat and a &#39;zing&#39; too!
As I drove home, the aroma of India filled my car, and I might have been driving above the recommended speed, just so I can enjoy it sooner.
I almost ate everything. From the colors, the spices, the texture and taste, my dinner was an adventure. The meats were tender, and the naan was fluffy and fresh, and paired perfectly with the rich sauces.

I started eating Indian/Pak food a few years back and am a big fan of it. This is a great spot for freshly made to order Indian take-away...you could eat there, but it is small and not the most up-market of settings...it is a total winner though for take-away!!!
 
I have been there several times, but have only ordered a few things:
 
Biriyani - On the weekends they have goat - I have also had the lamb biriyani...this is consistently excellent and for between $8 and $12 depending on the variety, you get a TON...I am a man of some girth and generally it takes me two days to finish an order of their biriyani. It is some of the best I have had anywhere.
 
Chicken 65 - You know those popcorn buckets they have at movie theaters? Just fill one to the rim with this stuff and I would be happy for a long time...awesome!!!
 
Naan - freshly made to order in their tandoor oven - it rocks the Kasbah!
 
Tandoori Chicken - I recommend it...decent flavor. Be aware, it takes approx 30 min or so, so phone in your order.
 
Saag Paneer - Spinach with paneer...the flavor was quite nice, but I am used to a thicker consistency so on texture alone, not sure as I would order it again, but I think this is due to personal preference - it was well prepared
 
Mijji Binjji - or however you spell them...these are pretty spicy chili peppers coated in lentil flour and deep fried. The owner gave me a sample while I was standing there a few weeks back and it was awesome! I ordered them last night and - like most fried food - it doesn&#39;t travel well. While still warm, it had steamed in its Styrofoam container on the drive home and ruined the texture. If you are eating there, they are worth getting - do not advise these for carry out
 
Pakoras - deep fried lentil dough...not as exciting as the Mijji Binjji above but has the same issue when taken off-site - the deep fried dough steams on the ride home and looses texture.
 
This is a GREAT place for take-away. It is the same or cheaper than other Indian places in the area that I have seen/visited. I probably wouldn&#39;t eat on site, but I get take-away from there every other week or so and love it! They just opened a few months back and I really hope they are doing well (seem to do ok) because I want them to stay around for years to come"

We ordered the veg samosas and lassis first which I must say were great. We also got the fish fry which would have been good but was very spicy!!

I ordered the chicken biryani which was cold had little chicken and too pricy.

My parents had masala dosa and idli which were also very bad. Potatoes in the dosa were cold and dosa itself very dry. Idlis were also cold and dry. But the most disappointing was the sambar. It was sour like it had gone bad and I couldn&#39;t eat one bite. 

Sadly the only redeeming quality was the price and the lassi and samosa. However the staff were great and the owner covered us for the dosas and idli because of the quality. Hopefully they get better in the future."

Short Story:
They screwed up our order 3 times (We only ordered 2 dishes and bread). It wasn&#39;t busy. We asked for a refund for one of the dishes because the eggplant was not cooked and we couldn&#39;t eat it. They did not refund the tax. Insult on top of it all. Wish the owner would reach out to me.

We ordered two veggie curries and some bread. They brought out 1 veggie curry and rice. We reminded them that there is one more curry and not rice but bread. So after another 10 mins they brought bread, and we had to remind them of the 2nd curry.

Finally they brought the masala egpplant, and as an apology for the 2 screw ups they brought a small mango dal, it was at room temperature though so we didn&#39;t eat it.

The masala eggplant  consisted of 2 baby eggplants, whole and very much under cooked, not at all edible. They were in a very runny sauce that wasn&#39;t very tasty. 

We finished the 1st curry and bread, and when the employee came to ask if everything was okay we told him that the egg plant wasn&#39;t cooked. He offered to bring some tamarind rice, but we asked for a refund, he agreed and then we waited for another 5 minutes, finally I had to go to the cash register to get our money back, he told the woman behind the cash register only to refund us the price of the dish, $9, he didn&#39;t refund the tax we paid. Crazy right? I was tired of waiting so I let the 90 cents go.

Needless to say we won&#39;t go back here, which is too bad because the first veggie curry that we got was really good.

I would recommend other Yelpers stay away!"

- They forgot to put the 2 sauces in both mirchi and samosa (how do u even forget this, how could one eat without any sauce? It&#39;s common sense!)
- The mirchi was $4.99 but was the worst one I had ever tasted, so old, dry and blant.
- The Bhindi masala taste was horrible with all aged rubbery ones. Horrible one. (I liked their 
  eggplant one and thought they will make it like that). Also, there was NO salt in the curry 
  (not less salt, but NO salt at all. They just forgot).

If you are not focused on holidays, then shut it off and come back, don&#39;t waste our time and money. That&#39;s it for me, will never eat here again."

sampurna&#39;s chicken 65 is better than their chilli chicken.

if u like chilli chicken from ghareeb in chicago, the chicken 65 from sampurna is the closest i could find in schaumburg. 

ghareeb&#39;s chilli chicken is still better, but sampurna&#39;s is the best in the area!!!!!!

The other kid ordered chicken tenders the chicken looked a little over done..

I had a chili burger..  First off the chili was so dry, the burger was even worse.. I couldn&#39;t even eat it.

Everybody else at table had a burger as well they all looked dry..  They had to load with ketchup to eat them..

We had asked for a cup of cheese for the frys they brought us im not really sure how they did it.. Was melted cheese however was cold and hard..  Had to reask for another one..

Its pretty bad when your fries are the best part  of your meal.

It was perfect in a mom&#39;s world. I didn&#39;t have to try blowing on their food before every bite, nor did I have to make them wait a min before they could start chowing down.

Ambiance wise, come on its obvious- the food delivery via train is so adorable and fun! We made sure to get a scoop of ice cream for each kid as well so they could get train whistles.

We went last night and ordered four cheeseburgers. One came without cheese, no big deal I let the waitress know and my daughter ate it. She ate about a third and said it tasted funny. I took a bite and it was super hard like it had been sitting on the grill a while. The fries were also room temperature. I don&#39;t think they are cooking to order. We all have stomach aches today we won&#39;t be back."

I came here since Groupon had an offer for 15 dollars at an 8 dollar value. I guess it was a little expensive so that is the reason why I gave it 4 stars.

Servers were amazing. The train serving the food was very unique and creative. 

I love meat and I had the double stacker. It was OK. It&#39;s grass fed meat and I am assuming that is the reason why the it was not the best tasting burger in the wood, but it&#39;s suppose to be that way I guess. I read in the past reviews that the fries were greasy, but I disagree. They were not bad. Shakes were very good. 

I think I will come back here again in the future. The groupon was awesome. Great to bring your kids here.

My girlfriend had the tuna sandwich and she liked it. Not a wow factor, but it was good. 

Good job on creativity. Servers were super nice."

The food is way overpriced, $50 for a family of 4, two of them being kids 3 and 6.  And what am I getting for this price, not anything gourmet, that is for sure.  Open up a package of hotdogs and a Walmart style bruger, and some fries from the freezer section and you have your meal.

It&#39;s loud and caters to young kids and mom&#39;s. I&#39;ll continue to go for the healthier options for a grass fed cheeseburger.

Like others have said, it&#39;s more like a diner, just accented with trains. It&#39;s very family friendly and the staff was just lovely to work with.

I had booked our day about 6 weeks in advance. All of their party booking and FAQ&#39;s are on their website so I all really needed to do was check the place out, check out where our party would be seated and book it.  We did bring a cake instead of getting their house cupcakes. But their cupcakes did look cute. 

Their food is quite good. The menu is family and kid-centric but I appreciate that the beef is grass fed, prairie raised beef and that there are other options like salads and chicken on the menu. I love their burgers and it&#39;s interesting to know that the beef comes from Bill Curtis (of CBS) farm. 2Toots onion rings are pretty good too.  Probably some of the best onion rings I&#39;ve had. I&#39;d definitely order them instead of fries in the future. I also tried their dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets, and they were pretty good--tasted better than some restaurant chain&#39;s nugget offerings.  Their milk shakes are just ok. But I do appreciate the unlimited refills on our soda. 

They were able to accommodate our group of 24 really well. We had 2 servers and they worked so hard checking on us often and making sure we had everything we needed. Very lovely gals!  They made the day pretty perfect, and as a parent you bet I appreciated every effort they made. 

What is also a plus is that every seat in the house is along the train tracks, even the booths.  Because of that, everyone&#39;s food gets delivered by train. 

The restaurant is located next to the Metra station so if the child in your life is super excited about trains (like my guy), if you can, take the Metra, their excitement and laughter will sustain you for days."

My kids, in particular my Son, love it because he loves trains (as does his Father).  Would be nice if the place was a little closer to the actual MD West line for better visibility of what is primarily the Metra &#34;scoots&#34; passing through Bartlett, but regardless...  Would also be nice if they varied up the Lionel trains used to deliver the food.

The food isn&#39;t spectacular, the menu isn&#39;t expansive as it&#39;s a kids place, it&#39;s not meant to be, it&#39;s your pretty basic burger, grilled cheese, chicken tenders, type thing, but it can be a little bit more than just taking them to a pancake house/family restaurant for the same.

If you don&#39;t like loud noises, meaning whistles (as they&#39;re given to the kids), or the poor young waitresses having to endure their shift there pulling the train whistle, this place is probably best avoided.

YES, there are kids here.  Last I checked, Kids have the attention spans of a puppy or kitten.  They aren&#39;t going to sit in a chair, peacefully, for a half hour to an hour during lunch.  If you don&#39;t like someone else&#39;s little young-un&#39;s running around, potentially walking up to you (I&#39;m referencing the one woman&#39;s review about this is the best place to affirm the use of birth control), then again, this place ISN&#39;T for you."

Our server Kim (I think) was great with my students.  I teach special education and she was very patient and gave my kids a lot of wait time when placing their orders and she didn&#39;t even flinch when good got spilled and ketchup squirted.

We did however, get a dirty look by a young mail server when one of my students got excited and knocked over a train car.  There wasn&#39;t even food on it!

They also sell cupcakes which are pretty good. I cashed in a coupon from the library for a free one and was thoroughly impressed. 

It can get crowded at peak hours so it&#39;s best to go when it&#39;s calm. There is also a mechanical horse in the front which helps pass the table wait for the kids.

Kids can care about more than pizza and video games, if you give them the chance.

To be sure, this location is very kid-friendly. Each meal seems to come with plastic train whistles, and rest assured, these whistles were being deployed frequently, and to great effect. So I got take-out.

Still, I was there long enough to get a good feel for the place. Most of the seating is located along an O-guage railroad track, which is continuously running two trains (an old Pennsylvania 19th century-era steam engine, and a more modern one) with six or seven Milwaukee Road flatbed cars where the cooks place their baskets of food to go out. 

It is, I have to admit, a pretty cool setup. There&#39;s also pictures of trains all over the walls, neon lights everywhere, kid-friendly music playing over the speakers, and even that horse you ride for a quarter in the corner.

I ordered a cheese car, which is their basic cheeseburger, along with onion rings instead of fries. The portion was appropriate for the price, and service was extremely friendly. Once I got to having my burger, I was impressed. The meat was seasoned, and the patty was smashed, although the burger itself was still pretty moist. All the veggies were fresh, and they made a wise choice to use all grass-fed beef; I could definitely taste the difference.

Throw on a large slice of sharp cheddar, and by the end I was thinking this was the best burger in town.

The onion rings were very good as well. I couldn&#39;t really tell if they battered their own onion rings, but it certainly tasted homemade; the onion rings have a thin, very crispy shell, were nice and softened up on the inside. A little salt and I was set.

2 Toots has the benefit of a trackside location, so kids can check out the freight trains whenever they pass. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need to be 6 years old to fully enjoy this place."

My complaint is the service. It. Is. AWFUL. I have made several attempts here, and it&#39;s not unique to any one server, they just all suck magnificently. Nobody smiles. One time my son and I went and the whole time he kept asking me &#34;Why is she so angry? Why is she sad? Is she mad at us?&#34; The whole time she was three feet away and no doubt could hear him. 

Last Friday, my son and I went in for the first time in almost a year. When we arrived, we became the only people in the place. My son chose a booth to sit in. The server said &#34;It will be easier for us if we sit &#34;here&#34;&#34; instead. So we did. After a few minutes I had to actually ask if we could order our drinks. WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE PLACE AND WE WERE SITTING IN A BOOTH HAND PICKED BY THE SERVER SO IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR HER TO SERVE US. And she ignored us and was noticeably irritated when I asked for drinks. &#34;Are you ready to order then too?&#34; No. Just drinks first, please. No refills offered without asking, nothing out of her way to provide &#34;service.&#34;

As far as the experience goes, kids will love the TV playing Thomas the Tank Engine as well as the miniature railroad that travels through the restaurant to serve your food. The food, however, left a lot to be desired. I understand that the menu choices are limited to cater to children, but even the adult-sized portions had too little quantity for the price you pay. Also, some of the staff looked very indifferent and did not want to be there. I&#39;m hoping this was just a bad day on their parts.

They also have a location in Glen Ellyn. My kids love this place because they have a train that brings the food to your table and of course the mechanical horse! The food is pretty decent. I believe they use grass fed beef for their burgers. My boys always get the hotdogs and enjoy them. They put baby carrots in with the kids meals which is a nice healthy add on. My friend had a chicken salad and commented how good the chicken was. I highly recommend their malts too! When I went to this location yesterday the staff was not so friendly but all in all it is a great place for kids and the food is pretty good!

It&#39;s huge, the layout is fabulous. I love that they use Grass Fed beef. The burgers are like a hybrid of Steak N Shake and Culvers. Your food gets delivered by a train riding around the counter. 

Feels like a diner, accented with trains. Pretty cut and dry. A little pricey.

Here is why it&#39;s three stars instead of four for me: 

While we were sitting there, one of the managers came over to us looked at my kids&#39; shakes (they&#39;d split one so they each had a cup). He turns around and says to our server, &#34;Did you give them these shakes?&#34; she said yes. He then proceeded to berate her in front of us about the type of straws she gave us. The straws he made her give us to replace the originals actually were worse. But whatever. Later on, he berated her for seating a large party in a certain area of the restaurant when another large party walked in. Yes, because she should have looked into her crystal ball to know that another large party would be coming in.

You may ask why I think this is worth noting - or why I even care. I was a server for a good 5 years in high school and college. I&#39;ve had &#34;that manager&#34; that does that sort of thing. It&#39;s humiliating for the server, and it&#39;s uncomfortable for the customer as well.  I tipped the server 25% because despite the manager&#39;s actions - she was a great server. 

We will go back, and hopefully that manager was just having an off day. We will see."

The excitement was met with a ho hum kind of attitude and will not be going back.

I took my kids here on a Sunday evening around 5. The place has a few other dinner guests but was not packed. This is a bonus for me. I enjoy taking my kids out to dinner and actually being able to have a conversation with them, which can be difficult in a packed place.

Menu is simple, which is also fine by me. The waitress was less than attentive and was too busy making sure her boss was not glaring at her pay attention to her customers. We ordered and food came out. I was surprised that the grass fed burger was so greasy and really just a skinny lump of meat on a bun. The fries were also greasy. My kids had chicken nuggets and those were overcooked.

They each had a cupcake that they did not eat much of only played with the train whistle.

Needless to say I was disappointed."

We took our son for his 2nd birthday. He absolutely loved it. He was so interested in all that was going on, he barely ate anything, but he entertained himself so that the adults could eat, a total plus.

The only reason for the 4 stars vs. 5 is the food. The burgers are so thin, I mean super duper thin. I felt bad for my husband and father, they should have ordered the double stack. One patty isn&#39;t enough for a grown man. My dad did get the chili, he enjoyed it...said he would get it again. I actually opted for a BLT and loved it. The bacon was thick and the whole grain bread was really good. The fries were also good and each burger comes with lettuce, tomato and pickle on the side. I do appreciate that they use the Tall Grass Beef too.

My son is part of the birthday club, his meal was free! Sign up your kids!!! His meal included a cupcake. He&#39;s not much into sweets, but took a couple bites, again, he was distracted by the whistle they put on the cupcake. He got a kick out of that, and in this place, him blowing it couldn&#39;t annoy anyone. My one complaint about the whistle is that they gave my son a pink one, I mean, come on. If there were 20 whistles and he chose the pink one, then fine, but if anyone from the restaurant is reading this, maybe you should segregate the whistles by gender. It would have been a nice touch. Good for my son though, he blew his pink whistle the entire ride home.

One last tip, the Bartlett train station is right across the street, I wish we would have taken the Metra there and had the true train day. Next time...."
2-toots-train-whistle-grill-bartlett-2,George R.,nGdejkTKHuQryIOIFek02g,"Bartlett, IL",0,1,1,166,10,jl5aIlOC_uZvUrHSihR9Cg,3.0,2011-12-12,"2 Toots Train Whistle Grill is a diner style restaurant complete with diner counters and  booths. A real model train runs on tracks around the restaurant carrying food orders to each table or diner seat. It&#39;s quite a hit with the little kids (and even some of the big kids). Music overhead was 1950&#39;s and 1960&#39;s classics and a small flat panel TV in the corner of the restaurant was playing &#34;The Polar Express&#34; (since it was the Christmas season).

Food is okay. I had the grass-fed beef burger and onion rings. The meat on the burger was kind of amorphous (versus round) and thin, but tasted just fine. Onion rings were average with a smooth batter coating.

I also ordered a vanilla shake made with real ice cream. Though I have a sweet tooth, the shake was very sweet. Maybe more ice cream or milk and less of the shake flavoring mix would help here. Too sweet for me to order again. Maybe a root beer float will be in order next time.

When you enter the restaurant, you should wait to be seated (or ask). I walked in and seated myself, then found out that they will seat you or direct you to a table. Others that came in after me did the same. But they were nice and didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it.

Service was nice and friendly. When your food is ready, a train comes from the kitchen area, travels around the restaurant and stops at your table where a server will remove the food from the train cars. Your server will also bring your drinks directly to you. Aside from the old style milk shakes and malts, the beverages looked like typical fountain drinks including pink lemonade and orange soda.

Overall, this is a fun, novelty type restaurant experience across from the Bartlett Metra train station. Great for families. Single diner counter seats for individuals. If the front parking spaces are filled, there&#39;s additional parking at the back of the building. Again, the food is okay but nothing to write home about. You go for the novelty of the place."

For adults, they offer what you might expect at a diner: burgers, chili, salads, etc.  While we waited for our food, there were plenty of fun and interesting things to look at and talk about.  And of course, the most interesting thing to watch was the O-gauge train that delivers food to all the tables.

We were very excited when we saw our train coming towards us with our food.  The food was hot and delicious.  For dessert, both kids ordered an ice cream sundae, which comes with a train whistle.  There was enough dessert for leftovers for daddy.

My 9 year old loved this place so much she insisted that we give this place a top-notch review.  The rest of this review is from my 9 year old daughter:

The first thing I don&#39;t like about this location is the hours. They are only open until 7 or 8, which I was bothered by at first but since I have zero intention of going back here, oh well. Their loss I suppose. Second thing. The staff. Do any of them even want jobs? I saw more eye rolling here than at a celebrity rehab show. I&#39;m sorry that ordering is taking away from your snapchat time, but you know...you do have a job to do. Third. The menu is painfully short, painfully bland, and just painful. I understand that this place is geared towards kids and that&#39;s a wonderful concept. But at least throw the adults a bone by having a more extensive menu.  And speaking of menu.....grass Fed beef, insert obligatory cheer and ooohs and ahhhs because people seem to think this is a godly idea that only this place has. And I&#39;d love your grass Fed beef burger so much if it had even an ounce of flavor instead of just feeling like a misshapen meat ball soaked in old grease. Fries were okay I guess...But let&#39;s be honest here.  How much off of Two Toots menu seems like it came right out of the frozen section at costco? No thank you.

This is the newest location (just opened today) in the growing 2 Toot&#39;s restaurant family. It&#39;s located immediately across the street from the new Bartlett Train Station building and patrons get a great view of the passing Metra and freight trains. 

All the food is delivered to every table/bar seat via a train. My kids had an absolute blast and I think just about 90% of the people there were with kids. The menu is very limited (burgers, hotdogs, tuna salad sandwich, grilled cheese, etc.) Nothing fancy. I had the &#39;Cheese Car&#39; (cheeseburger) along with my wife and the kids had the chicken nuggets. The nuggets were typical quick fry fare, but were dino shaped, so the kids loved that. The fries were standard diner style fries, but were salted well and nicely crisp in on the outside, yet still soft/mushy on the inside. 

The beef is TallGrass beef, an organic grass-fed beef (no hormones, antibiotic) and the dogs are also the same, with no nitrites or nitrates, so people looking for a great diner with good, &#39;healthy&#39; organic beef, this is a good place to start. 

The deserts are rather limited (cupcakes, brownie or a rice crispy treat). My kids had the cupcakes and I had the brownie. The cupcakes were okay, but the brownie was good, with an amazing amount of chocolate frosting on top. All the deserts came with a toy train whistle for the kids. 

The place is nothing spectacular, typical diner, however, the train theme and location make it a treat to go to. Hopefully, it fares better than the prior two restaurants in this location that closed in a year or less."

 This place is pretty stellar. Standard diner food. The shakes are very good. 
The food is brought to the table by model trains on a track. However, every 5 minutes or so the train would derail so it would cause delays sometimes. 
 Also, to tame children from wanting the food train, they would give children their own locomotive to play with. Great idea in theory but they use Lionel trains and as a granddaughter of a model train enthusiast, I know how much those trains cost. That seems like a very expensive toy to give children who may want to ram it into the wall or ride it &#34;accidentally&#34; off the table.

Just annoying having to gripe to a manager when you&#39;re trying to have a fun time with your kid. We ended up sitting so long that the oldies music and cute trains lost their luster for us. 
     Also, there was some man who worked there (the manager? Owner?) who just stood around and glowered at everybody. I smiled at him and he looked away without returning or even acknowledging my polite gesture. I&#39;m thinking that if that&#39;s the manager, he&#39;s the reason why the staff was walking on eggshells and not properly trained.
Maybe we&#39;ll go again and have a better experience with a better server :) I still recommend this as a good burger joint."

The past 2 times we have gone  to 2 Toots, our experience has been less than satisfying.  Over the past year and a half, we have been to this restaurant countless times and always enjoyed it.  Recently, it seems to have changed quite a bit. I&#39;m not sure if there is new management, but things that we&#39;ve been able to do in the past are no longer allowed.  

For instance, we were there 2 weeks ago with friends, and asked to have separate checks.  It was no problem at all, and was very convenient.  We went back today with three different families, and it was no longer allowed, which made it a pain to separate. 

We were also told that it&#39;s against &#34;manager policy&#34; to tip the high chair upside down to support a baby carrier seat.  Again, we have done this countless times in the past 6 months with our infant at this very restaurant.  I have pictures of our baby in it.  

In addition, milk is no longer a free refill.  This is not a huge deal, but unfortunate for parents who prefer that their children drink milk over pop (which is a free refill).  

Our waitress was less than attentive and seemed clueless when it came to bringing out our order.  The last two times we&#39;ve been there, the order has been messed up, and it was due to the waitress putting it in wrong. This isn&#39;t rocket science.  It&#39;s a cheeseburger or grilled cheese.  

While these are not major disappointments, I would prefer to drive the 45 minutes to the Downer&#39;s Grove &#34;All Aboard Diner,&#34; if this is the service that we will continue to receive.  This is a children&#39;s restaurant and we are coming for the experience.  I hope that the staff will see these reviews and make the necessary changes."

It was well worth the trip.  My daughters had an excellent time.  The food was good, the staff was attentive and friendly and of course the trains were a lot of fun to watch.

My daughters had the dinosaur nuggets and ate them up.  I had the cheeseburger and it was very good.  Not sure what the other reviewers meant by the burger was super thin it was just right and very tasty.  

For dessert two of us had cupcakes and the other ice cream.  The desserts were excellent.  Of course I can&#39;t hear very well since my kids blew the whistles that came with the desserts the whole ride home.  lol.

We can&#39;t wait to be back and now this place is one of our favorite restaurants.  Hopefully someday they will open up another restaurant further west."

Red ropes that make you go in a certain way and cue are weird.  I&#39;m going to a diner, I should not have to be seated. The menu was sparse. They were touting Bill Curtis grass fed beef.  I like corn fed beef. I tried a hot dog and hamburger. The burger was fresh, but it was nondescript. The tomato, lettuce and pickle were on the side. Onions were provided in a plastic solo cup. The fries were not fresh cut, but rather a Sisco product. I get a hot dog, again with Bill Curtis being the Chicago guy and all.  The hot dog is a beef frank that comes on a bun.  You get it plain. If you want mustard, onions, relish, they give the onion solo cup again and food service packages of relish. I felt I could get the same hot dog from a vending machine, or a public museum. It was not a Chicago hot dog.

Our party consisted of 3 adults and 2 kids.  4 shakes (decent) 2 kids hot dogs, 3 burgers, 1 adult hot dog, 1 kids sundae, 5 soft drinks.  Bill was $65.00. 

The kids liked the train, the place is clean, staff was pleasant. Food was not great.
Make me a diner style burger, fry it up, have a little salt and pepper on it, have it dripping with juices. Offer up some grilled onions, or a fresh onion on it.  Make my hot dog with all the fixings.  Between the price and taste of the food, doubt if I&#39;ll be back soon. Only way I&#39;ll be back is if my little 5 and 8 year old ace their S.A.T&#39;s and demand to go there."

All food is delivered to the tables or counter seats by little trains.  We had grilled cheese which was good and a burger (made with Tallgrass Beef) which was excellent.

I feed my family only 100% grass fed beef because it contains no hormones or antibiotics and is humanely raised.  2Toots is only family friendly restaurant I&#39;ve found anywhere which uses it exclusively for their hot dogs hamburgers and chili.  They also offer gluten free buns from Udi&#39;s which I really appreciate.  Under duress Ive taken the grandkids to other imitation train restaurants but none have the healthy food options that this place offers not to mention the prices at 2Toots are extremely reasonable.

I had the veggie burger and the rest of the family had hotdogs, burgers and a salad. With two boys under 3 the hotdogs went down no issue. The veggie burger resembled a sawdust chicken patty. I honestly didn&#39;t expect much fom a place that touts the meat products so I will give it a pass on the veggie burger so I being a recent transfer over to the no meat lifestyle decided to try a small piece of the burger( not- so- good) it was actually greasy with no real flavour aside cooked ground beef.  The place was a bit dirty under the table was not swept out nor the booth seats cleaned and the service was less than mediochre. I actually think the train was more attentive. Seemed poorly managed and the staff was kind of in disarray. Idk for a place that touts all organic and fresh food it seemed a bit false the fries tasted pre-frozen and would benefit from fresh cut fries, a better staff and good food instead of a choo-choo train gimmick ...

The menu is very sparse includes hotdogs, hamburger, 1 salad and a grilled chicken sandwich. The chic sandwich was good but it was tough to find healthy choices. the sandwich came with fries and there&#39;s not a side salad option. My daughter wanted a kids meal AND a bowl of soup. the soup is only sold as a full meal but the waitress gave her a 1/2 bowl free. I thought that was really generous. My sandwich came with absolutely nothing on it but they corrected it quickly. Service was ok....about what you&#39;d expect for a place like this. Food is a bit pricey. My sandwich &amp; fries was over $6.

I dont actually know if they&#39;re highschoolers - but their cust, svc. skills could use brushing up.  Good shakes, decent fries and burgers.  portions are just enough, but if you&#39;re a big eater might not  be enough for you - the cost, well you are paying for the kitchiness of this place and the nostalgia so keep that in mind. good place to go once in a while - more because of the cost for the food you get rather than the taste of the food, which is just fine."

First time we came here and took my neice and nephew. The place atmosphere wise was good, diner feel, very cozy however the service left something to be desired..... The waitress took are order quick and turned away quickly as if it was a bother to her we were there... She then managed to screw up just about everything we ordered then my neice knocked over a small glass of water when she stood up to see the train which got us a eyeroll from the rude waitress.... Look when you fill out a application for a water park you better be prepared to get splashed ....when you fill out a application to work in a enviornment with a lot of children you should expect to see a spill here or there and deal with it with a little grace instead of copping a big time teenage attitude that most of us older people try to escape from when we go out for a meal..... I hate to make this entire review about 1 person but she really ruined the experience for us and when we asked our neice if she wanted to go back to the train place she responded &#34;the place with the mean girl?&#34;....

The place is geared towards kids, and if it&#39;s busy it will be noisy (they put train whistles for kids on their cupcakes - trust me, it will be noisy.) I&#39;ve been here quite a bit with my parents and my four year old, she can&#39;t get enough of watching the train come around and around. Though I&#39;m a vegetarian and won&#39;t eat it anyway, I am glad that they serve grass fed beef - if my daughter did on the off chance decide to get a burger I would feel better about her eating one here than from one of the many fast food chains. I&#39;ve pretty much settled into getting the egg salad sandwich every time I go, it&#39;s a good choice. My daughter gets the grilled cheese, sometimes she eats it sometimes she doesn&#39;t. The fries are crinkle cut and really good, almost always come out super hot and perfectly salted. We&#39;ve never had a problem with the service, everyone here is really nice.

This review is for the Deer Park Location that I tried when I saw it was in the area.

From the outside this location looks a little larger, has a nicer looking patio for outdoor dining, and a better parking.  I have been here a couple of times now, and it is much easier/faster to get a table at this location versus Addison.  The food seems to be very similar (as it should being the same chain), but honestly I&#39;d say the Addison one seems to taste a little bit better.  Service the times I have been here at this location is not that great.  Usually a lot of time spent waiting for your bill, refills, or for them to bring something that they forgot.  It looks like the servers at this location need to be better trained, or they need to get servers who actually care about their job.

That being said this is a good Mexican restaurant in the area, but there are better ones not to far away if you want to take a little road trip."

The tortilla chips were fresh and good and the salsa was nice and I found not particularly spicy as was noted by some past reviewers.  My dining buddy had a 28 ounce margarita and it also appeared quite popular amongst the customers.  Our party of four had:

- Enchiladas (three) Oaxaquenas dinner (mine).  This has a red sauce which was mildly tangy and ok.
- Combination plate (taco, tamale, and cheese enchilada)
- Chile relleno with ground beef
- Steak fajitas plate

Nicely so, each entree came with a delicious bowl of chicken noodle soup, an unusual adder compared to most Mexican places.  All of the dinners were fine. The entree prices were all reasonable but the portions for the enchiladas and combo plate were maybe on the smaller side."

We got seated right away and the place did not seem packed for a Tuesday night. I ordered the Margarita since its $3.99 on Tuesdays and it was okay. I wasn&#39;t impressed by it. I didn&#39;t taste much alcohol in it either. Probably why its $3.99. 

It&#39;s nice that they give soup with your entree and it was very delicious. I ordered the chicken tacos with rice/beans. I had better tacos elsewhere and was much cheaper as well. You can tell that La Hacienda is pretty Americanized. I had their carne asade awhile back and I probably should&#39;ve ordered that again. 

The server took awhile to get our check even though there was only 5 tables. We had a 15% coupon that paid for our drinks which was nice and I would say that La Hacienda is just okay. I don&#39;t know if I would go back though for tacos."

We always go to the one on Lake Street in Addison and never really needed a reason to look for more...

It is my favorite place to go and have Chicken Enchiladas with Verde sauce. I think it has a lot to do with having a side salad of lettuce and tomatoes on my plate. It adds color, crunch and texture to an otherwise mushy plate of food:

Chicken wrapped in soft tortilla shells, smothered with cheese and sauce with a side of refried beans, rice, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and a dollop of sour cream makes my mouth water! Don&#39;t come if you are in a hurry. They serve complimentary tortilla chips with salsa and a cup of soup while you wait.

But during this last visit I found out that they no longer offer the lunch buffet on Fridays. So disappointing because I came hungry and was ready to stuff my face with unlimited tacos, enchiladas, flautas and fajitas. 

In either case, the food on the regular menu was still pretty good too. When we sat down they gave us some free chips and salsa. The chips definitely were higher quality than just generic bagged tortilla chips. With our orders we also got a cup of some sort of chicken soup with shell noodles. 

I ordered the Gringo burrito, which was filled with chicken, rice, beans, and a really good cheese sauce. It also came with rice and beans on the side. It was definitely on the smaller side, but taste wise it was solid. The chicken was juicy and whatever cheese sauce was inside had a hint of spice to it. Price wise it wasn&#39;t that bad. The burrito was $7 so it wasn&#39;t too far off of prices at Chipotle or something similar.

Overall, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be coming here as often anymore because they got rid of the lunch buffet, but it&#39;s not a bad option if you&#39;re in the mood for Mexican food with more of a sit down experience rather than fast food."

For some reason it is really difficult to find great mexican food in chicago and La Hacienda De Los Fernandez has answered my Mexico related prayers. 

The tacos are the bomb dot com both in the soft and hard shell variety. I also felt like they had the perfect amount of spice. Some places can cook everything with hot hot spices which is hard for some people (aka me) to handle. But then they actually have a special hot salsa that you can ask for so if you wanted to kick it up a notch you can. 

The only thing i wasn&#39;t a fan of was the Taco Soup thing that you get before your entree comes out. The concept of Taco Soup in my mind sounded awesome but in reality is just soggy tortillas.

We came on a beautiful Saturday afternoon to enjoy some margaritas and an early dinner in the outside seating.  The prime outdoor area (in the shade) was closed, so we opted for a table that right next to the front door and also by the fountain.  It turned out to be a nice place to sit, and the traffic coming in and out didn&#39;t really bother us.  

The salsa was spicy and pretty much the same as the ex-Schaumburg restaurant.  The food was also the same   We had the beef Chili Rellenos and a daily special of pineapple grilled salmon.  My chili rellenos was very good and not nearly as greasy as the Schaumburg version used to be. It came with the rice, refried beans, and lettuce/tomato salad.  The salmon came with black beans, rice, and a pineapple-based chutney.  Everything was very good.

We had a pitcher of classic margaritas which were quite tasty on a sunny afternoon.  They are some of the best I&#39;ve had in the burbs.  We opted for the pitcher, but they come in other sizes too.  I didn&#39;t get to try the sangria swirl margarita this time, but am looking forward to our next visit to try it out.  
 
The waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu and specials.  Service was really good, but once they got busy we didn&#39;t see him for a while.  When he came by he spend the time to refill what was needed, take a few pictures for us and make sure we were taken care of.  No real complaints.

It is about a 30 minute drive to get here, but since we no longer have the local Schaumburg version of the restaurant we will make the extra effort to travel to this sister site.  It is worth the drive."

First of all, we walked ourselves in circles trying to find the front entrance, which was not a great sign. They need to trim the trees out front so the door is more visible. When we finally *did* get inside, there was no one at the host/hostess stand to seat us, so we grabbed our own table inside. The restaurant was hardly busy, there were three/four tables occupied outside and two occupied where we were inside. It still took about five minutes for someone to bring us menus, which was pretty annoying, again, since they were so empty. Finally, a server arrived and we both ordered margaritas; strawberry for my grandmother, pomegranate for me, as well as an order of guacamole. Both took forever to come back to our table. We were given chips and sals as well.

The guacamole was a very large portion, and I could have eaten the whole thing. Really good. The salsa was INCREDIBLY spicy, and I never complain about spice. I regularly douse my food in Sriracha and Tabasco, but this salsa was unbearable. Hot and peppery. I was not a fan. My margarita was just okay, kind of watered down. My grandma&#39;s looked like it came out of a 7-11 ICEE machine, so I predict it tasted about the same. 

Since my grandma is more of a Taco Bell mexican food fan, she ordered cheese quesadillas, while I opted for the tacos al pastor. The tacos were pretty good. The pork was seasoned pretty well and the pineapple and cilantro complemented the meat. The rice was bland and stale, not soft like it should be. The refried beans were unremarkable. It&#39;s near impossible to screw up a quesadilla, so there were no problems there. 

The food was average at best, but our server was pretty bad. I could tell he was just in it for the tip and did not actually care about doing a good job. He took our order and brought us chips and that was the last we saw of him until it was time to pay. We had a completely different server coming to our table to bring our meals and appetizer and drinks. Our water was not refilled once and we had to ask for some in the first place. Overall, a very mediocre experience. Nothing worth writing home about. Basically, everything they did right was a Mexican restaurant staple and they would have looked totally useless if they completely messed them up. Tacos El Norte in Lake Zurich is much better and just a little further away from here. Go there instead."

We were greeted with a friendly staff and were seated in an empty dining room.   We were pleasantly surprised how nice it was (my kids called it fancy-mancy).  We were served with chips and spicy and mild salsa right away.  There was a special on the Margarita so I said why not?  Our drinks came right away and the margarita was delicious (and yes I can tell there was alcohol in it!).  We enjoyed the chicken noodle soup (Mexican-style) because it was absolutely delicious!!

I usually order the burrito here, however everything is pretty good.  Not truly authentic Mexican good, but satisfying nonetheless.  I have tried most of the options here and have only been disappointed with the Mexican Chopped Salad which was kind of skimpy.  I guess I should have known better than to order a salad at a Mexican joint!

I have never been to La Hacienda on a weekend, but on weekdays it is usually pretty empty and the meals come out pretty quickly.

The location is not bad but out of the way and in the back of Deer Park Shopping Center. Located across the way from the theater. There is Plenty of parking but I think the building is facing the WRONG WAY. It is a large stand alone restaurant and it&#39;s very well decorated. It is facing out and away from the stores and out towards...???? 

The food here is always OK but not as good as it should be for the prices.  The happy hour seems good and the prices for drinks look very reasonable. 

The service is ok and friendly. My problem is I had to ask for water for the 4 of us and we got 2 glasses. Maybe he didn&#39;t hear me correctly. I came late and my soup was waiting for me and fortunately it was still hot. My dinner was ordered ahead of time and came in a timely manner but no flatware. I had to &#34;borrow&#34; a set from a nearby table. I had the 1/2 Chicken and it was overcooked. I couldn&#39;t eat the wing because it was DRY and hard to chew. The leg was a little tough also but the breast section was ok. Weird considering the breast usually dries up first. 

An hour after we left, 2 of us had the runs.  We didn&#39;t eat anything similar.  Maybe it was only a coincidence."

First off, the chips were not fresh, however the salsa was pretty good. We ordered the guac and it had zero flavor. We tried to put some of our salsa in there to liven it up. I guess my suggestion would be to add the pico de gallo - they ask you if you want it in there (However, I thought that was pretty standard in guac). 

I had the chicken tamales and they were dry and bland. My boyfriend had a chicken meal and it reminded me of something you get at a 24hr diner. I was far from impressed with the taste and the plating of everything. Also, they  offer &#34;mexican fries&#34;, which had me anxious to try and then come to find out they were just basic fries - and I make better ones at home :-/

I love Mexican food, and eat it very frequently, but I will not be choosing this restaurant as my Mexican place of choice. Which is sad because it looked like it had such potential. But I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back, there are SO many other much better options in the area."

I dragged my boyfriend to La Hacienda De Los Fernandez with very high hopes! And they were met... for the most part. 

I had never been to La Hacienda and I was very happy to see pretty courtyard area with a fountain and cute decorations.

We were seated right away and given chips and salsa. I am very picky with my salsas, but I absolutely loved the spicy salsa they had! 

Next, we ordered. Our waiter was friendly, but definitely not the most personable guy. I ordered a super burrito sans tomatoes and my boyfriend got chicken fajitas. We both had water to drink. I sipped that water up very quickly and had to wait quite a while for a refill :/

Our food was delicious! I absolutely loved it. The Mexican fries that my burrito came with were just... fries, but they tasted fresh. The refried beans were delicious (my burrito didn&#39;t come with any but my boyfriend&#39;s plate did!) and the dish really hit the spot.

My BIGGEST complaint is that, after we finished, and had been done for a solid 15 minutes, had drank full new glasses of water, and had a busboy take away our empty plates and bring us boxes for our leftovers, the waiter was NO WHERE IN SIGHT. I got impatient and asked a different waiter to fetch our waiter. About 5 minutes later, he showed up with the check and we booked out of there. 

If the food weren&#39;t so good, I would not return because of the customer service. Hopefully it was just an off night and my next visit will be better!"

My regular Thursday afternoon lunch-partner and I  decided on La Hacienda this past week.  When we arrived at around 2:00 pm there were only 2 other cars in the parking area.  When we were escorted to our table, unsurprisingly there were only 2 other tables occupied.

Our waiter seated us at a table of our choice and immediately brought a basket of tortilla chips, bowl of salsa and water, and then left us alone for a few minutes to check out the menu.  The lunch specials menu contained reasonably  priced [for this day and age] entrees.

I decided to try their crisp corn tortilla beef tacos, which came with sides of rice  and refried beans, and a diet coke.

The tacos were not the best I have eaten, but neither were they the worst.  I would call them satisfactory.  If the crisp corn tortilla shells were a little less crisp and just a little chewy, I would have said that they were pretty good.  It seems these days, the Mexican places are using pre-baked or pre-cooked shells.  This limited the rating to 4 stars.

When I make corn tortilla tacos at home, I make them after preparing all the fillings.  Then I fry &amp; bend the tacos, let them drain on paper towels and them bake the filled taco in a 300 deg oven for 10-12 min.

This said, the rice and refried beans were some of the best I have had in any of the Mexican restaurants around the NW suburbs.  

The lunch specials also come with a cup of chicken soup.  It was very good.

The salsa and chips will keep coming as long as you want them to. 

I thought that the service was exceptional, even though the place was practically empty.  

The check was just a bit over $18 along with a $4 tip made this a  pretty reasonably priced lunch, especially when compared to some of the 3 or less star rating places I&#39;ve reviewed.

I will definitely be back."

The guacamole is fresh and well-seasoned, the salsas (mild and hot) have great flavors, and the complimentary soup is a nice touch. The steak fajitas are a must-try: on a bad day, they&#39;re good; on a good day, they are amazing. The burritos are absolutely huge and the chocolate cake is quite good.

Mostly there are the expected burritos, enchiladas, fajitas et. al.  However, there are some gems in the menu.  The Lomo de Res, the Chipotle Salmon, Fish Tacos and even the Chiles Rellenos are all somewhat unique and well worth trying. All are $11-14.  Dinner comes with a decent Mexican soup and chips and salsa are free and plentiful - be sure to try the spicy salsa which you may need to ask for.  As others have noted, service depends on the server you get. Generally it is fine, though on summer nights the server may work tables outside as well as inside, keeping them rather harried.

He ate one slice than 3 more, it was so good, he couldn&#39;t stop eating!
   I know the deep dish is what Chicago is known for, but this square cut, toppings to the edge pizza was phenomenal!"

They estimated a 1.5 hour delivery time when placing the order online. We did not order any deep dish type pizzas just two thin crust pizzas and a cheese bread. I assume since cooking times vary based on the pizza you order, this would significantly affect your delivery time. I can&#39;t imagine how long of a wait you would be quoted if waiting for their famous deep dish pies. 
     Our pizza actually arrived sooner than their estimated delivery time. This pizza was okay. It came super hot! That was a huge plus! The cheese bread was horrible. No one in our party could eat it. I would recommend skipping it. The kids at the party said it tasted like &#34;the smell of a dirty foot&#34; ;) whatever that means. It was really garlicky -- and we weren&#39;t quite sure what cheese they used. It just didn&#39;t taste great. Skip it if you&#39;re considering ordering it!"

Pros- The pizza was a Meat and More Meat pizza deep dishwith pepperoni, sausage,salami, and bacon. This pizza was AWESOME!!! The flavors were spot-on and the had tons of meat!! This pizza wasn&#39;t skimpy on flavors, and was very satisfying. I have to say that this dinner was much better than the CRAP I ate at Xoco!!!!! I LOVE cheese, and it was nice to see a pizza that finally had the stringy cheese draping from the sides like shoelaces on a pair of untied shoes. I called to see if the driver had left because I wanted parmesean cheese and red pepper flakes. LOW and BEHOLD, there were several in the bag when the driver brought them to the hotel!!!!!! I am VERY pleased and pleasantly surprised!!! What a great way to settle I&#39;m for the evening!!

THE ONLY reason why I gave 4-stars was because of the prices. I wanted to add onions, but they said it was $2.25 for additional toppings!!! That was the only reason for 4. My mind said 5 but my heart said 4. Blame it on my heart!!! Lol.....

It&#39;s stuffed pizza.  Dough, cheese, toppings, more dough and sauce.  Really, it&#39;s just not my thing, but I would have given it three stars if not for the not so great service.  Although Giordano&#39;s started out as a small shop in Chicago, it&#39;s grown into a chain around the area. This particular location very much had a chain restaurant feel.  Tons of families crammed into the space - the restaurant trying to get in as many people as possible at once. I understand the need to use the space to get in more customers, but when your waiters are constantly bumping into the back of your chair, and you have to go through a maze to get to the bathroom, it becomes clear that the focus is no longer really on the customer.  After sitting at our table for ten minutes with no sign of a server, I had to go to the bar and ask if they could send someone our way.

As for the pizza, it&#39;s worth a try for something unique, but don&#39;t go if you&#39;re already hungry since this pizza takes 45 minutes to prepare.  If you are hungry, get a salad or an appetizer to share.  The garden salad is pretty good, not your average house salad since it contained purple tomatoes, leeks, and a sweet dressing.  As for the pizza, the crust is more like a buttery, heavy bread, which is necessary to contain the few inches of toppings, cheese and sauce.  But for me, it&#39;s just too heavy.

If you&#39;re not into the crowded, family-friendly chain atmosphere, you can also just get a pizza to go and try it in the comfort of your own home."

Be prepared for a 40 minute wait as that is how long it takes to cook the pizza.  The crust is nothing like I&#39;ve ever had, flaky, and delicious.  A deep dish pizza isn&#39;t for the health concious, I&#39;d say the majority of the pizza is made up of cheese if you&#39;re into that sort of thing. Still a tasty treat.  One slice is huge and is enough for a normal sized person, two slices if you&#39;re super hungry."

We had two deeps and a thin crust. There was seriously more cheese on the thin crust than the crust, toppings, and sauce combined. Waaaaaay too much cheese. Sauce was decent but the crust tasted like a saltine cracker. 

The deep dish I enjoyed but it was not as good as I was expecting. I can&#39;t really compare it to anything. 

Service was at a snail&#39;s pace. Took almost 5 minutes to get greeted, 5 minutes for drinks, 40 minutes for the food. Pizza shouldn&#39;t take over an hour and a half to enjoy. I don&#39;t care that it was a Friday night this was too slow. Only thing worse then the service was the deep dish.

I had the opportunity to grab a quick lunch at the main downtown location recently and had a great experience so I figured we would take the family for deep dish in Addison and see if the upgrades made it out to the suburban locations as well.  I was extremely impressed with everything!

Now, it goes without saying that the deep dish is awesome.  Crispy crust with a flaky soft inside, flavorful sauce and gooey cheese.  What&#39;s impressive are the upgrades they&#39;ve made to the rest of the menu.  The bruschetta was unbelievable with fresh tomatoes topping perfectly crisp Italian bread...it was enough for the whole family.  We also had a family style salad with fresh shaved Parmesan, heirloom tomatoes, crisp mixed greens and a savory dressing.  The salad also came with warm baked Italian rolls that were a great compleat to the salad.

The restaurant was clean and inviting and our server Debbie was attentive and patient as we took our time on a Friday night.

My husband and I both ordered the same thin crust pizza: the Special. We told the person taking the order that one was to be made gluten free and the other regular. After we placed the order, everything seemed fine.

Then we got to the restaurant to pick up out order. My husband picked up the pizzas and put them in my lap. As I was holding the hot pizzas, I looked for a label saying which was which: nothing! When we got home, we opened the boxes and the pizzas looked exactly the same. Which pizza was gluten- free? Who knows? My lovely called the restaurant to ask which pizza was gluten-free. Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t get a straight answer. The girl on the phone said that the gluten-free pizza is darker than the regular pizza. Problem is they&#39;re both dark, so I pretty much had to trust my husband&#39;s taste buds to figure out which was which. Quite risky don&#39;t you think? Luckily, I didn&#39;t get sick.

I came with a pizza eating group once and our dinner was quite good. I can&#39;t complain about that. However, I recently ordered delivery and I was a bit disappointed.

First, we had trouble verifying if they could deliver to me or not. They are exactly 2 miles away from me on the same street. For some reason, their system wouldn&#39;t recognize Bloomingdale and kept insisting that I was in Addison. The girl on the phone tried to fix the problem, but instead resorted to asking if I live by -insert place- or -insert place-. These were places I had never heard since I admittedly don&#39;t go that many places near where I live. I tried giving her crossroads and that only confused her more. She asked if I lived near Downers Grove, after I had already said I lived down the street and gave her an intersection and even directions.

Second, my instructions were not complicated. I simply wanted a knock at the door instead of the buzzer because it is loud as hell and my dog doesn&#39;t seem to become as agitated by knocking versus the doorbell. They told me no problem and that it would be about an hour for the pizza. The guy showed up and promptly rang the buzzer. My dog went into a barking frenzy.

We paid the man and prepared to devour our pizza pie. It was pretty good, but the crust was a bit soggy and it just didn&#39;t have that &#34;OH MY GOD, I LOVE THIS PIZZA&#34; punch that Giordano&#39;s normally delivers to my mouth.

I might just go pick it up myself next time or maybe order from Rosati&#39;s."

We were coming from opposite directions, neither of us had eaten yet and we figured this would be hot, filling and easy.  I was so sad that we were wrong on all fronts.

The waitress saved this review.  She was kind and tried to make things better.  She gets the two stars for her effort.

Salads were watery and the dressing was not flavorful.  They were quite large though, so if you like watery salad, you would have liked this one.

We did not order pizza.  It was late already, so we went with the chicken parm with pasta and the meat ravioli and added a side of meatballs.

The chicken parm was okay.  Pasta was a little watery (kinda like the salad) and the cheese overtook the plate, but most of it was edible.  My ravioli were sad.  The meat sauce was okay, but the ravioli themselves were cold.  And the meatballs were teeny, tiny sized.  Not worth the upcharge at all.  I sent the ravioli back for a quick reheat.  This was a quick process, but it must have been too quick because they were still lukewarm.  I find this gross.  The waitress took them back for a second me and by now they returned with a little steam coming off of them (thank you!), but I had nibbled on so much bread that I didn&#39;t even want to eat my meal.  $40ish dollars later with tip &amp; I wish we would have eaten at Culver&#39;s...or Stav&#39;s...or anywhere but here."

Worst service I have ever received in my life. I called a couple of times asking if there would be room for a party of 13 which yes, is a lot but doable considering the length of their tables. The hostess kept telling me they were packed and there was no room so we decided to place an order for carryout. We walk in and notice empty tables everywhere with many of the staff just hanging out. Fine, whatever we got over that pretty quickly. We get home and none of our deep dish pizza is cut and the third pizza we ordered did not even have the right toppings. We call the store and they try to tell us that they NEVER precut pizza which is a joke because we have ordered from this location in particular before and had gotten it precut. They offered to make a new pizza for us which would be a waste of time considering the fact it was already 930pm and the hassle of going there again was not worth it. They then attempt to give me a 25 dollar &#34;credit&#34; which also was useless considering the fact that I would never be ordering from them again. Never the less, worst experience.

One time we were able to substitute an item on the menu with something we would actually eat, another time the manager wouldn&#39;t substitute and had an attitude.  

We used to go every Sunday for lunch/dinner and a football game; before managers used to put the volume on so we can hear the game, lately they refused to put sound on.  What&#39;s the point of watching the game with no sound?

The pizza is a thin crust &#34;Special&#34; with Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Onions, and I subbed out Black Olives for the Green Peppers (to avoid heartburn).

The pizza arrived at my hotel door.  I did not have to go down to the lobby and get it and it arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated 1-Hour delivery time.

The box was heavy and well engineered.  You can tell they care about the product from the stout boxes they use - precious cargo inside!

I opened the box to find a magnificent 12&#34; thin crust pizza cut Chicago style (grid/squares). It was piping HOT!  I haven&#39;t had a pizza this hot since I was a kid.  I thought we had litigated ourselves out of ever enjoying a piping hot pizza ever again, but not so!  Giordano&#39;s delivers the heat!

All ingredients are served in generous portions.  The amount of Black Olives is almost scary, there are more mushrooms than a Grateful Dead Concert, more onions than you can shake a stick at and the pepperoni portions can only be referred to as &#34;burly&#34; and &#34;manly.&#34;  Cheese and sauce are in ample abundance as well.

Usually a manly pizza such as this would have no problem overcoming the typical thin crust.  Thin crust pizzas have inherent architectural shortcomings that can lead to a structural failure.  NOT THIS PIZZA!  The crust is thin but firm and crunchy, almost cracker like and impervious to the sauces and cheeses above it.

I don&#39;t know what the restaurant is like, but I&#39;m sure this pizza is well worth it.  I grant 5 stars for the food alone!  Best Pizza to Burn the Roof of My Mouth!"

Our server was careless, forgetful, and lazy. The name of our server stated on the receipt was Katherine. (Food at Giordano&#39;s is always amazing, which is why I rated it 2 stars instead of 1.) 

We dined at the Addison location on Tuesday night for dinner. There was only one other family there. You would think this would result in attentive service. NOPE. 

Poor Service:
Too many basic aspects of our meal were incorrect. Our group consisted of SEVEN people. We received 6 drinks, 3 straws, Appetizers served with 6 small plates, Pizza served with 6 large plates. Sigh. Each incident was separated by longgggg waiting periods before our server would finally return with the missing piece. No apologies or courtesy comments.

When the pizza was served we asked for parm cheese. By the time she came back, we were done eating! (She did say a curt &#34;Sorry&#34;.) By that point we just wanted to leave. 

The drink refill situation was also unsatisfactory. After our appetizers our server asked if we wanted refills like it was a chore. Since we still had our pizza coming, of course we wanted refills. The only other time she asked was at the end when we were ready for the check. 

A manager never checked on us and the whole evening our server Katherine did not acknowledge nor apologize for the multiple errors or long waits. We did not want to leave a tip, however it was auto-added on our bill due to our large group.  Overall, it was a very disappointing and frustrating experience."

I am out here for work this week from my natural habitat of southern California and I asked a local co-worker about a good place to eat. He mentioned that there were many spots to grub on Lake St, and after a little more digging, he recommended Giordano&#39;s Stuffed Pizza. 

So I decided to go there after work tonight and I ordered my pie. A small stuffed pizza with pepperoni, spinach and green peppers. I figured what the hell and opted for the spinach and artichoke dip too. I called it in and the young girl that took my order wasn&#39;t as friendly as I would have hoped for but she got the order right. It almost sounded like she was annoyed that she had to answer the phone. Hmmph. Well, I waited a few minutes, came in to the store and got my order to go. 

I got back to my hotel room and took the pizza out of the box. Jesus Christ. This is the small????? It was HUGE. I knew right away that ordering the appetizer was a mistake because it was not going to get really any attention. I got ready to dig in and.... well, the young lady behind the counter neglected to throw in any utensils. Ayy..... ok, I ran down to the hotel lobby and secured a knifey/forky combo and came back up. I dug in to the pizza and it was just awesome. This is my FIRST Chicago style pizza and despite hearing that it&#39;s &#34;basically like a lasagna&#34; I did not find that to be the fact at all. The pizza was incredibly hearty, tasty and the ingredients were all top notch. 

LOVED the food guys! The spinach/artichoke side was nice too, although I didn&#39;t even bother trying to eat too much of it. 

To be fair, I only ate half of the pizza. That is all I could manage. I am a big dude, being a 6&#39;0 250lbs Mexican and all and it was STILL too much for me to handle. 

You guys get 4 stars. ALMOST 5, but well, the whole &#34;teenager-answering-the-phone-is-too-good-to-be-working-there&#34;  first impression kind of knocked ya down a bit. Almost went to 3 star status, but the damn food just was too good to warrant that."

Finally, I got up and rather angrily asked the group of FOUR people who were just hanging out behind the counter to send someone over.

Once our server arrived, we were well taken care of.  The food was alright.  Even though we were eventually taken care of, the fact that I had to go find someone to take our drinks and food orders is pretty inexcusable.

They get one star because they did give us another pizza but besides being less burned it was still a big disappointment.

It&#39;s their thin crust that I didn&#39;t find that good. The cheese was plentiful but rubbery, and overpowered the other ingredients (I ordered sausage and mushroom). The crust was too tough.

Of the 30 sushi restaurants I have reviewed to date, this is one of the worst ones. I am just going to give you a list of my thoughts, to prevent rambling.

- They are always on Groupon, Restaurant.com, and other deal sites (probably because they have very little repeat business).
- They have disgusting fish. Tuna tasted bad, so did salmon. The tuna has clearly been treated with carbon monoxide. They do this to retain the red color on old fish that would be brown/grey.
- You will notice something very interesting about this place. They offer AYCE (all you can eat), Discounted food (offers/groupons/etc.), and regular menu. If you don&#39;t tell them about the groupon, and place an order for nigiri sushi, you will notice the sushi has TWO pieces of fish on it. When you order AYCE or they know you are using a promo deal, they only use ONE thin piece of fish on the sushi. VERY TRICKY, changing the food to suit the price. THAT&#39;S A SCAM IF I EVER SAW ONE! Don&#39;t do a Groupon if you are not able to offer the deal you are selling!
- The sushi was just plain bad.
- The crab rangoon is a JOKE! Wish I would have taken a picture. They basically give you a bunch of fried wonton chips with the tiniest amount of filling. Unreal.
- The only thing good about this place is the inside looks nice.

This place made me extra upset because I had to throw out more than half the sushi I ordered because it was simply inedible.

I give this place a 2/10 overall, and highly recommend you check my list of Suburban Sushi Restaurants for a better alternative. Looking for better AYCE, it&#39;s a little hike but try Sushi Grove in Buffalo Grove or Taste of Tokyo also in Buffalo Grove."

The reason I gave two stars is the service. All of the servers are rude and they don&#39;t seem to care about getting your food to you. We saw our order get completed by the sushi chef and a waiter picked it up, walked almost to our table, then turned around and put it on a table. They then proceeded to give sushi to every other table and take several take out orders before discovering our sushi and delivering it. It was about 15 minutes in between when our sushi was ready and when we got it.

There are plenty of other sushi places (not all you can eat) in the area that are way better. Check out Sushi AI about 5 miles NW in Palatine. They are delicious and have friendly prompt service."

She was really short with us and seemed like she&#39;d rather be anywhere else besides serving us. My niece has severe food allergies so every time we go out as a family, we spend a lot of time talking to the servers about the ingredients in their food. This particular experience was horrible and left me with no appetite because of the way our server treated us. 

In any case, we ordered an array of food including many different sushi rolls and chinese entrees. The sushi was decent and had a lot of rice just like the other reviews say. The entrees we got were decent but nothing worth going back there for. As for the restaurant itself, it&#39;s really spacious and clean.

The eggs rolls were cut into pieces and topped with a spicy sauce. They were decent. The sushi however lacked in flavor and were larger than other places I have been to.

They have best house fried rice and Chinese food around! And my family loves their Chinese! Their kids meal is great (so much food for price). Their sushi is good too! Love the angel wings roll! Not sure if they still do, but they would give you a free meal on your birthday with fried ice cream and play a fun song and turn on disco lights. This is definitely a great find in Rolling meadows.

They offer a very reasonable all you can eat Sushi special that gives you the option of every item on their Sushi menu - no exceptions. On this visit, that is what I decided to get - well, that and green tea.

I was a little disappointed in the tea, but the Sushi was plentiful and quite good. I was so impressed with it when it was delivered to our table that I forgot to take any pictures. Let&#39;s just say the Sushi Chefs are very artistic.

I don&#39;t recall all of the types I had - they have various levels of Sushi and Sashimi. I know I had tuna, salmon and shrimp Sashimi. As for the Maki Rolls, I know that I had yellow fin tuna, spider roll and spicy tuna. But, they have a variety of combination rolls, some I&#39;ve seen before and others I have not. I would caution you that some of their more exotic ones are fried. I don&#39;t do well with fried foods and they can be very filling.

All together, I think the service was good, the food was great, the Sushi Chefs were not only good, but they were also fast. Fast is something I&#39;m not used to when ordering Sushi."

But the fish is not that fresh. It seemed a bit chewy to me and the coloring was off. But...I still gobbled it up because I&#39;m a sushi beast. Pretty sure this led to food poisoning for me which led to an unpleasant 24 hours. 4 Rolls were $35.70, the prices aren&#39;t horrible, the rolls were tasty...but something was ever so slightly off masked by the layers of spicy mayo &amp; deep frying.

I wish I could say more positive things about Asian Tokyo because the location is a rotating door of different food places. My thought - Asian Tokyo will be one more that bites the dust in this location."

I was pleased with the appetizers we ordered and the salad had a wonderful ginger dressing. I ordered the 16 piece Sashimi plate and was happy with it for the most part except for 2 pieces of Mackerel which were extremely fishy. Will definitely come back here again.

Nobody has mentioned this, but you can bring your own wine for .99!
They DO have a full bar, but I would much rather bring the wine that I know I like from home.

There is, of course, the all you can eat for $21.95 at dinner, but no sharing, you are charged for leftover things that you don&#39;t eat, and you can&#39;t use any groupons, restaurant.coms, etc. I don&#39;t want to stress about over ordering and when WE go out for sushi we like to order a bunch of things and share them! So regular menu it was.

They have Chinese and Japanese entrees.  We stuck to the Japanese side.
It worked out MUCH better for us than the AYCE! There is a &#34;Tokyo Special&#34; 3 regular rolls, soup and salad for $15.
Um, YEAH!  

Between the 3 of us we ordered Potstickers (dumplings) which were good.  Not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but good.  DO NOT ORDER THE TEMPURA CALAMARI!!  We expected a light tempura and tender calamari as we have had in other restaurants.  It looked and tasted like a Burger King onion ring, but with really chewy calamari inside.

We ordered two of the &#34;Tokyo Specials&#34;: Tempura maki, Bagel roll, unagi roll. Kintana (yellowtail), Sanfrancisco, and a deep fried maki (we weren&#39;t fans of this one).

they brought a soup and salad for each of us even though we should have only technically gotten two, which was nice.  All of the food (except the tempura calamari) was very good.
Our server, even though he had only been on the floor 3 days, was very attentive and tried his best to be accommodating.

Bill came to $50.  Used a restaurant.com certificate and paid $25 for dinner for 3 of us. tipped $15.  Not a bad night!"

 My girlfriend and I are vegan and thus, veggie sushi is our go to when we want something quick and filling.  We came in after Sushi Train was closed for lunch (hours on Google said open)  and another place near by only offered 2 veggie options.  We are glad that was the case!

They were quick to make sure we got things without fish or eel sauce (one dish had it and they remade it instantly)  
the Miso soup was great (even the gf liked it and she usually hates Miso) 
AND the veggies were fresh! 

After we paid we start to walk out as the manager stops us and tells us &#34;you paid too much&#34;.  We said oh,  but wasn&#39;t the all you can eat 17 each?

They were basically empty, especially for a Friday night. Food was delicious... however, the waiter we had was beyond horrible. He would walk away mid sentence, generally gave the impression that he was annoyed to be a waiter, and at one point my friend said she was ready to order another sushi roll and he ignored her request and walked away. Came back a few minutes later to take it. Generally unconcerned with customer service, timeliness, or helping with any questions we have.. which is the main three jobs of being a waiter.

I used to be a waitress, so I am not just complaining about my expectations for eating out not being met.... the service was beyond bad due to this waiter.  Even though Food was good, service was horrible.... so I won&#39;t be interested in going back. When we expressed our concerns about the poor service to the owner / manager,  we were not compensated or given a discount or even an apology. The only apology we got was from the hostess.

I am usually very excited for sushi, as it&#39;s my all time favorite cuisine, but sadly, Asian Tokyo did not hit the spot. I understand why non-Authentic sushi lovers would like to go here because the sushi rolls are cheap and heavy on the fru fru sauces/cream cheese/fried tempura. They also have a very good all you can eat sushi deal and a large selection of Chinese dishes that aren&#39;t bad- we tried the orange chicken and Singapore mei fun noodles. However, when it comes to sushi, I like the real raw fresh stuff, and Asian Tokyo sushi is far from it. Service was also sub par- our waitress didn&#39;t seem like she knew much about the menu. So if you like the Americanized fru fru-not-really-sushi rolls, then come here for the all you can eat! Otherwise, go to a more authentic Japanese restaurant like Daruma."

Place was half occupied early Saturday evening. I decided to do the AYCE sushi. I had an assortment of maki rolls and a few sashimi pieces. As others noted, there is a limit of 18 pieces per order. I found that annoying, as they already apply the charges if you don&#39;t finish all your food, which is common in other AYCE sushi places.

Our group of 5 ordered various dishes, some AYCE, some not. All of our dishes came at very different times. My first round of sushi came at an appropriate time. However, subsequent rounds took much longer, in which I&#39;m sure is intentional, so that you&#39;ll get full and don&#39;t consume as much. We had a couple different servers waiting on us who were inconsistent and confusing. There were a number of times where we were glaring at any of the staff passing by, hoping they would stop by to see what we needed, but we had to flag em&#39; down ourselves.

To the sushi... at first they looked fine. There could have been slightly less rice but actually wasn&#39;t too much. What was disappointing was that most of the rolls had an imitation crab filler, whether it was stated or not in the menu, which I have never experienced, even in an AYCE establishment where quality isn&#39;t expected to be superb. However, this was beyond subpar. However, all tasted fine except for one. Can&#39;t remember which particular piece I had, but I remember it tasting fishy and off. Sure enough, I felt sick soon after, went to the bathroom, and puked everything.

Bf had ordered a side of fried rice but was given plain white rice instead. We didn&#39;t bother correcting them as we didn&#39;t want to be there any longer. 

Rest of the table seemed to enjoy their dishes and portions seem to be good, concerning the &#34;Chinese&#34; dishes. However, I would stay away as quality and service is very subpar, especially for their sushi."

If the past I had ordered a couple rolls and they were your normal everyday rolls, yesterday I decided to do the AYCE and they packed on so much rice it looked as if it had 2-3X the normal amount.

They are SO HARD TO FIND on this side of the country and when you do find them they are SO expensive.  I know there&#39;s Sushi Station in the same shopping center, but I&#39;m not a fan of their generic sushi.

Every time I have a sushi craving I end up coming here.  If you go at lunch, all you can eat sushi is $17.  That&#39;s a pretty good deal considering we&#39;re in Illinois where everything is 3x more expensive than everywhere else in the country.  The quality of the sushi isn&#39;t bad either.  It&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but it really isn&#39;t bad.  It&#39;s fresh for sure.  They don&#39;t have a huge selection of specialty rolls, but it&#39;s good enough to keep me coming back again and again. 

The only reason I give this 4 stars is because the service is somewhat slow and the waiters aren&#39;t always super friendly.  Most of the time they&#39;re fine, but there were a couple times we went in and they looked so annoyed that we were there.  But hey, good sushi, so I can forgive a little bit of &#34;I hate my job&#34; attitude."

The last time I went I did all you can eat and they forgot one roll so the waiter told me to put in a new order. It was fine but that happens often. Everything was very good though so I will continue to go. $22 for all you can eat for dinner is pretty good I think."

Came here for a casual AYCE sushi experience after eating here twice before... and I won&#39;t be back. This place has fallen into the travesty of having too much rice per piece. The hot tea is $1.50/ea, but it was more like hot water with green food coloring. We opted to kindly place them at the end of the table, but no one ever took them away.

The sushi came out relatively quickly, but the place also wasn&#39;t really busy at all. Our server never once came back to refill our water. With so many AYCE options in the area now, there is nothing that made me want to come back here again."

Even the manager here knows me because I come here a lot!! I do not like this place anymore for several reasons. One of the most factors that affects the most is the chief who works here. The sushi he made was terrible. He likes to put a lot of rice under each piece of fish. I mean, I totally understand that. It is all you can eat. Yet what he did was way too much. The fish cannot even cover the rice no more. In short, if you are looking for some good sushi, this is not the right place."

Placed our first order and waited twenty minutes before it came out. Disappointed with the selection for ayce and for such a high price I expected more variety. Nearly every roll had cream cheese. If you don&#39;t like cream cheese you will be just as upset as I was with the two plain rolls that don&#39;t come with it. When asked if they could make a roll without cream cheese, I was told no. Really? :/ second round again took twenty minutes. Restaurant still nearly empty.

DECLINE OF SUSHI QUALITY and SKIMPING ON INGREDIENTS

Became a fan of this place since Dec 2013 (all you can eat sushi and lunch specials are a good price).  I was raving about this restaurant to my friends and we have become regulars of this restaurant.  Lately, however, SUSHI QUALITY HAS GONE DOWNHILL.  I am not sure if they have a new sushi chef but sushi preparation gone downhill.  I don&#39;t think we will return soon.

I always order the Boston Roll.  Lately, I have noticed that they have skimped on the ingredients.  Twice, I found HALF of a shrimp in my Boston Roll when it used to be a whole shrimp.  What gives?  Are they getting too many people ordering &#34;all you can eat sushi&#34; and have decided they can save money if they skimp on ingredients?  Not cool.

Was also a big fan of the shrimp tempura.  The past 2 times we&#39;ve been here, the shrimp tempura was served cold like it was fried, left there for a few minutes, and then rolled.  The &#34;crunch&#34; put on the sushi was no longer crunchy, more like soggy.  Ick!

Since we are regulars, staff have always been super nice and friendly to us.  It is the quality of food and skimping on ingredients that is turning us off.

Asian Tokyo, if you don&#39;t change your ways, we may break up with you soon."

We were seated and told, &#34;your waitress will be with you shortly.&#34;  After waiting for a few minutes with not even a menu to look at- we went and got our own from the hostess stand because she was busy chit-chatting with other guests.

We know exactly what we want to order we are so thirsty and hungry. We decide to give them 5 minutes or we are out.... We decide to wait it out 5 more minutes... There isn&#39;t even anyone walking by that we can grab. Finally after over 10 minutes of waiting with NO service we decide to split.

We walked over to the sushi guy and told him why we were leaving and he said, &#34;ok- sounds good.&#34; ??!?!!? Does this place even care about making a good first impression!?!?

The waitress takes forever to just bring water as well. I asked for water since I didn&#39;t like my tea, and she said she would bring it, which was 10 minutes later. The chefs at the sushi bar counter just stares at you as well, which really annoyed me while I would try to eat. Creepy.

We had a table of six people seated in the middle of the restaurant. Seems great right? If you need something just grab a waitress? AS IF! We placed four All you can eat orders and waited...and waited...and then some parts came...but others didnt? I think I put in three orders for crab rangoon and gyoza. Guess how many I got?...guess! Uhh 1. What the hell? And the waitress I spoke of in my last review was still as rude as before. We asked for refills and they would just walk away to the next table. I think the guys wanted water refills and never got them, nor the plate of sushi they ordered. After waiting for an hour for refills and obviously they weren&#39;t going to make anything we ordered; we decided to leave. BUT NOT before I wanted one last sip of diet. I see the waitress walking by and I ask her for a refill, she PUTS her HAND in my FACE to cut me off and GRABS the glass from me. WHAT the HELL just happened?! I look at my bfs friends wife and she&#39;s like did that just happen?! The lady comes BACK and we ask to speak with a manger, and she just walks off? Okay yea I&#39;m done with this place. Some guy waiter walks by and we ask AGAIN for a manager and he tells us theres no manager on Fridays. Really the busiest day and no manager? We left pretty much hungry and each couple $60 dollars poorer. Lame. If you can&#39;t keep up the traffic of all you can eat on a friday, maybe hire more wait staff? Much less alone more cooks to make the food people WANT to enjoy. It&#39;s sad because when you DO actually GET food its delicious.

I would come here all the time to have sushi to go but last Friday night my boyfriend and I decided to go dine in. We get there and there was a small line of people waiting to be seated. The lady said it will be a 10min wait. So no biggy, we waited patiently and then waited more and then 20min past and then 30min past.  By then we were the only one&#39;s waiting. Ok this is where it bugs me. They had a booth open for 15min and I try to flag that lady down but she just pretends to not see us. I was so upset and finally she takes us to that booth. By then we were so hungry and thirsty. But here comes the best part. As we got seated I assumed she would ask for our drinks but nope she just vanishes and leaves us there for another 15min!!!! She goes right ahead and seats a small group of people that just came in, she gets there drinks and order. Are you effin kidding me!! I finally flagged this one waiter and told him that she was being rude to us. I don&#39;t know what her problem was. I don&#39;t know if she has something against us. We ordered our food and then it took another 35min for our sushi to be here. Sorry Asian Tokyo but you guys just lost a loyal customer.

This used to be our go-to restaurant, when it was called Red Lantern, for all of our treasured family events.

We tried Asian Tokyo to give it a fair shot and it has been transformed into a cheaper menu with none of our old favorites and really just a flimsy feel to the menu and it&#39;s various selections seem toned-down.

All of the traditional (authentic) Chinese dishes are gone. It&#39;s completely commercial American style.

Red Lantern was three steps above any Chinese restaurant without the stuffy attitude. This place was disorganized. The hostess seemed out of place. The food was off taste or bland.

Sorry. We won&#39;t be back."

Service was okay as was the environment. 
Starting off we got the miso and egg drop soup. Both were good, but I don&#39;t love corn in egg drop. 
Crab Rangoon very good, but onto the sushi
We got a few rolls. 
Please note they chop up the tuna for spicy tuna, Crazy Tuna roll etc. it&#39;s more like slurry and did not taste good at all.
Nigiri was decent pieces of fish, but didn&#39;t taste the freshest. 
Tokyo Rose roll average
Johns Holiday roll average

We were greeted and seated quickly. There weren&#39;t many tables but it was kinda early. The atmosphere inside was gorgeous, kinda romantic and chic, and I was excited. We were pretty hungry so we went for the huge Love Boat: 10 sushi, 10 sashimi, and two rolls. We received a miso soup and salad, which were both simple and good. When the Love Boat came the presentation was cute but everything tasted kinda bland. For 40 bucks it was kinda mediocre sushi and just didn&#39;t stand out like some of the other sushi places we like to frequent. For some reason, even the wasabi was weak and I had to put alot on to get that kick. 

I liked the place, our service was very polite, but maybe the sushi is not very fresh since business looks somewhat slow. Also, they didn&#39;t have a sushi bento box? I am curious about the hibachi grill, and those items may have been good, but I won&#39;t venture out there to try again."

Everything was fair portion sizes and I even had enough leftovers for next day lunch.  I arrived to the location solo and was still asked my table preference.  I was seated in a booth.  Staff was mindful of my time limits w/o even asking me.  In my 40 mins there, I got a refill on diet coke, watched an episode of Family Guy via my smartphone, used the restroom and ate delicious food.

We almost didn&#39;t find it because from the outside it looks more like a convenience store rather than a restaurant.  

The friendly waitress gave us excellent service all night long and happily brought dish after dish of delicious food.  Our friends just ordered a bunch of traditional things for all of us to share:  French Fries with Feta Cheese, Feta Cheese Sticks (just like mozzarella sticks but with feta), A platter that had some smoked meat, cheese olives, peppers and some salads, Fried smelt, a pork tenderloin that was stuffed with ham and surrounded by gravy and a chicken breast topped with cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc., a grilled sausage and traditional cake that had delicate layers filled with custard.  We also had a variety of drinks including a mojito with fresh strawberries and the &#34;Avenue BG&#34; which was a mixed cocktail.

All of the food was great, but if I came here again I&#39;d probably order a bunch of appetizers and go to town.  The appetizers were my favorite especially the fries with thinly shredded feta cheese.  I could eat those all day long.  I also loved the dessert.  The food is priced so that you can order a number of items to share and the atmosphere is great for kids.  They have a very large screen at the front of the restaurant where they play music videos on.  While we ate dinner there was a gaggle of kids (including ours) who were at the front of the restaurant dancing and singing along.  What a great way to distract your kids who don&#39;t want to sit still anymore."

It looked like a nicer restaurant and thought someone should seat us. We sat and no waiter came for 15 minutes. We were even seated right by the bar and were very visible. We had to flag down a very busy waiter and we then had to wait at least another 10 minutes to order. Plus we were told they were out off all soups. I&#39;m writing this as I wait for my food. We will see if the food is as bad as the service.

The foods was actually pretty good. The only complaint I have is the waiter finally brought the salad dressing when we were 3/4 done with it. 

After receiving our check and the waiter running our credit card through the machine, he said that it was out of paper so we b couldn&#39;t pay that way. We only had half as much as was needed in cash. The waiter said that was fine. The next day we checked our bank statement online. We were charged for the meal! 

I have never been so disappointed. We were ignored from the start and now we have to deal with filling a claim with the bank. Run as fast and far as you can from BG Avenue!!!!!!"

I was so looking forward to visiting Chicago so I can go to the number of Bulgarian restaurants in the area. Me and a friend (who is American) went to a couple of them (this one and the Mehanata) and I really couldn&#39;t be more ashamed and disappointed with the service at both places. I literally wanted to cry out of embarrassment. 

For starters, we were greeted in Bulgarian, which was not too surprising. The problem was that they never switched to English even after they realized we are not both Bulgarian - extremely unprofessional! We were also approached in a way that didn&#39;t make us feel welcome at all. I almost felt like I am breaking into somebody&#39;s house. 

When I tried to order in English, I was looked at as if I was an alien. The terrified look on this girl&#39;s face was out of this world. The fact that she was actually in the US must have been news to her.  My friend was almost ignored during the ordering process as the waitress realized I could speak Bulgarian (my mistake). So every time he tried to ask something in English, she was explaining the answers to ME in BULGARIAN. When we asked for water, they gave us bottled water, which is common in Bulgaria but they live and work in US for God&#39;s sakes! They should at least ask if you would like tap or bottled water or just assume you want tap water. I spent the entire night making excuses for their poor service to my friend as if I am responsible for their lack of professionalism.

Also, I felt like I was bothering them every time I needed something or had a question. The Bulgarians would know what I mean - typical waitress attitude. They may be away from home but they certainly make sure they treat you just the way they would in Bulgaria - as if you owe them something. Needless to say, this experience totally ruined my night.

The food really couldn&#39;t make big difference with this mediocre service. It was ok, not the best I have had."

However, i can&#39;t doubt that this place is authentic. We went through three waitresses before we finally got one that could speak English. We started with an appetizer of dried meats, i thought they were too salty/peppery. 

For food my party ordered a mixed grill of chicken, a pork meatball, fish, veggies, and bavarian chicken. Most of the food was over seasoned. The best was the bavarian chicken - it was very moist and covered in a sour cream sauce. A little more rice would&#39;ve been nice. 

The food and alcohol is very reasonably priced. It was fun to try new foods, but we won&#39;t be coming back"

I come here all the time with and without my Bulgarian husband or friends. Our friends throw all of their important gatherings here. The wait staff is very patient while I butcher the language, and very friendly. Everything I have eaten here over the years is tasty.

Their dishes are well seasoned, so there is no need to make up for it with salt. The menu is immense so I tend to stick with what I can order in Bulgarian: shopska salata, a small combo plate of Bulgarian meats (lykanka, filet elena and sudjuk), kufte (seasoned, grilled beef/pork patties) and a beer. Their clay pot meals (cheese, sausage, tomato or roasted peppers) are fantastic and act like comfort food. They have a great selection of Bulgarian wines, beer and rakia.

The place does have a little &#34;night-clubby&#34; feel to it (it&#39;s the decor) but it is a relaxed atmosphere. Big screens broadcast footie matches or Chalga videos. The patio is huge and perfect for spring and summer days. The one downside is that on Friday and Saturdays (sometimes during the week if there&#39;s a party) they turn up the music so loud (around 5pm) you can&#39;t even scream a conversation.  

Avenue BG doesn&#39;t have that deadpan, Eastern European/Balkan feel that these places can have when you&#39;re not from the country.

I was done by then, my husband however wanted to give another try and ordered the red snapper sautèed with veggies. The snapper was cooked but soggy by the time it arrived.the veggies were steamed not sautèed, and it was on a bed of tomato &#34;water&#34; to put it correctly.

Bad meal, not going back!!"

I stopped in for a late dinner and the place was fairly empty however service was still pretty slow.  The 3 stars is mostly for the mediocre food and I was expecting so much more.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a good sign when the complimentary chips and salsa were just meh.  The chips were tasteless and the salsa was pretty spicy but had no flavor which seemed to be the theme of the night.  I had the pork tamales and my friend had the flautas.  Both lacked seasoning and my tamales were super dry.  If I happened to be back in the Arlington Heights area and wanted Mexican, I would definitely go to Salsa 17 instead which is down the street from here."

To start off with my girlfriend and I ordered calamari. The calamari was a good crunch texture  and not too greasy. It came with a dipping sauce that was unique and flavorful, so that was good.

I ordered a combo entree which consisted of a taco, enchilada and burrito. They all tasted fine ...a little Americanized, but fine.

To drink I ordered margaritas, they were great, no complaints on those. 

Overall my experience was ok, although I did feel a little rushed by the server. I probably wont come back and will continue going to Salsa 17"

The food wasn&#39;t bad but it isn&#39;t anything special. It&#39;s good, American-style Mexican food and the flavors are good but again, it&#39;s nothing special.

My family and I have been coming to Javier&#39;s on-and-off since it was La Chicanita. And we&#39;ve always felt the same way toward it - meh. It&#39;s good in the sense that&#39;s it&#39;s good food at a decent price at a convienient location. But Javier&#39;s is not some place I ever crave.

The last trip we went here, service was good. We were seated immediately and our waiter was ready to take our order immediately. Which was fabulous. The menu wasn&#39;t as fabulous. It&#39;s as expansive as the Cheesecake Factory - too many options spread across too many pages. It could just be that I&#39;m a city-girl now and that I&#39;m used to one-page menus but their menu was too much. With so many options, it&#39;s hard to find something. 

We ended up with the Cheese Dip for an appetizer because we forgot what they called their queso dip. Turns out they have two. The cheese dip is more like a nacho cheese, but slightly fancier. It&#39;s missing the flavor and I solidifies a little to fast. It comes to you hot and goopy and by the time everyone has gotten a taste, it&#39;s a thicker paste. Not a fan. I forgot what the other one is called but it&#39;s the more authentic cheese dip, if there&#39;s such a thing. That one is better and you should get that.

For my entree, I split steak fajitas with my father. Fajitas came out well seasoned and the steak wasn&#39;t chewy or tough at all. Peppers, onions, tomatoes, and steak all seasoned well. To add onto the fajitas were quacamole and pico de gallo. I was surprised there wasn&#39;t any cheese and mildly disappointed by that. My mother had the Steak a la Mexicana. The steak was tougher than the fajita steak but it tasted good as well. The rice and beans were the spotlight on that plate though."

Based on this theory I knew we were in for some bad food when the tasteless salsa was served. 
If you are looking for any resemblance of Mexican food then this is not the place.
  The house margaritas tasted like household cleaner.
The appetizer we ordered... Rellenito ...some kind of stuffed and breaded pepper was greasy and tasteless, like some thing one would find at a carnival or country fare.
For our main course I ordered the chorizo burrito and my wife ordered the ground beef burrito. Mine was nothing but salty and greasy and my wife&#39;s was bland and greasy. One bite and we both asked for the check and left.

Later they apparently called an ambulance for her because the dining room was bathed in throbbing red lights coming in from the windows.

We were disappointed that there was a private party being held on the ENTIRE outdoor seating area, and as such we couldn&#39;t be seated there on what was a beautiful late summer evening.

Our next impression was that service was nearly non-existent. I felt that this was because the dining room was understaffed- not that the servers were inattentive. After finally being seated and waiting for what seemed like an eternity to have our drink orders taken, I considered for a moment just telling the hostess to forget it that we would go elsewhere.

But we stuck it out for better or worse, largely because we had a coupon.

While waiting we tried to chat among ourselves but the steady din in the background made it difficult. I&#39;d put this down to poor acoustic design if I had to guess.

The food was basically the very typical Gringoized tex-mex that we all have seen time and again, nothing that I could see that was really unique or special. It seemed almost as if they ran to a Tacos El Norte, ordered takeout and re-plated it in the kitchen.

Today I have a bit of stomach distress and I generally have a cast-iron stomach; making me question if the overall experience was worth the 20% off coupon that we used."

We had also got an appetizer that was called a chorizo queso type deal with tomatoes and poblano peppers and we thought it was going to be more of a queso dip but it actually turned out to be like mostly chorizo with just cheese on top, so not so much of a dip but like a taco filling.

Every time, the food is great.  If you enjoy a hearty Mexican meal, this is the place.  The only reason they lost 2 stars in my book is because of the service.  Every time I&#39;ve been there, the wait staff is friendly and nice but you can tell they try to cut corners and save money where ever they are able to. For example:

- The wait staff will not follow up until AFTER you finish your meal.
- The sweetner caddy is usually low on Splenda (likely because it&#39;s the most expensive of all the sweetners)
- They always fail to give refills
- One time we had an email coupon.  The waiter physically took the phone from us to show to his manager.  We did get the discount, but they had deleted the email without my knowledge or consent.  

My suggestion for this place would be to place a phone order for pick up and eat it at home so you don&#39;t  have to deal with the riff raff."

I got three different enchiladas with their spicy mole sauce. The mole sauce was void of any spice, tortillas were hard and stale, and the ground beef/chihuahua cheese/chicken enchiladas were all meh. Refried beans seemed they were scooped from a cold vat right onto the plate. 

Service/decor/ambiance was fine. It was just way too expensive for what you got. I&#39;ve gotten an equivalent/better meal for the quarter of the price. If the prices were cut in half I&#39;d consider 3 or 4 stars.  I won&#39;t be back."

Javier&#39;s is delicious.  I always go with the combination where you can pick from a few items.  Most recently I got two chicken enchiladas and a pork tamal.  The enchiladas had a yummy red sauce and the perfect amount of cheese oozing onto the plate.  The tamal wasn&#39;t the greatest I&#39;ve ever had, but I would order it again.  The combinations come with rice, beans (loveee), and a side salad.

I want to start off by saying that I love Arlington Heights. It&#39;s probably one of the cuter Chicago suburbs out there with it&#39;s little storefronts, easy-to-access public transportation (a rarity in these parts), highly walkable, the largest Japanese market in the Midwest, a world-class race track and more, but I feel like downtown Arlington Heights suffers at the hands of its own popularity at times. It could be so much more, with local businesses who are there because they offer something unique to the community, not just because being in the downtown area is enough to draw a large enough crowd of people to turn a profit while they serve mediocre, hackneyed, over-priced food that&#39;s not offensive enough to keep people away from the convenience of eating/drinking there next time they&#39;re walking through a downtown area again. 

Harsh. I know. And it&#39;s not as if this phenomenon of mediocrity is an anomaly for suburban downtown areas, lord knows Naperville, Glen Ellyn, Wheaton, etc have their fair share of sub-par cash cows, so I don&#39;t mean to take it out on AH, but there comes a time when it does become offensive enough to take a stand and merely request to be treated with a certain level of respect and not have our intelligence as consumers insulted. 

I have no problem waiting an hour or more for good food, but I do have a problem waiting that time to be sat in a section with a server who acted as if we were an inconvenience and imposing on him, serving us not only our dinners, but a heaping helping of condescension as well. I have a problem with a place that&#39;s all flash with it&#39;s cute decor and colorful vibe, but bland as hell when it comes to a menu that seems no different than any tiny strip mall serving Mexican fare of tacos, burritos, enchiladas and fajitas, only here a basic taco meal with no meat and no sides will run you at least $11 + attitude. 

The salsas were pretty spot on with flavorless. One might as well have been solely blended tomato and the other had heat but no taste. As far as beverages, I&#39;d never met an horchata I didn&#39;t love until Javier&#39;s. I felt like I was drinking a Splenda smoothie. I think I stomached 3 sips before I gave it away. A first for sure. 

The menu was so basic it was hard to ignore. I&#39;ve never looked at so many pages of items and felt like i was seeing no differentiation. I&#39;m no chef, but I felt like there wasn&#39;t anything on there I couldn&#39;t have made at home and after tasting it, I felt like I could have made it better myself- and that&#39;s saying something coming from me. 

It&#39;s with a heavy heart that I write such criticisms, and I actually mulled over this review for two weeks and tried to convince myself that Javier&#39;s was &#39;fine&#39;, but for the experience that I had and everything I took in, I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s fine and it wouldn&#39;t feel genuine to portray my experience any other way."

This family owned restaurant has been in business ever since I was a kid and the quality has stayed consistent after all these years.

Best drink: Jarritos Borachos. Grapefruit soda with lime juice and tequila. Way better than a margarita, it&#39;s a must try.

Best meal: Any enchilada or the chicken tacos. 

The food and atmosphere are top notch and I highly recommend this place to anyone."

Great location and especially great for dining outdoors in the warm months when the patio is open. 

I have had the enchiladas, as well as the tamales. I though the enchiladas were really great and the rice and beans, though very simply prepared, were very delicious in combination with the sauce and everything else. Service was also very good and attentive.

Only disappointment were the margaritas; I had heard good things about them. I had one and I did not like the taste at all. I thought it was unbearably sweet and the overall taste seemed off somehow."

Had a horible first impression from walking in the door. Walked in and a lady was  standing at the server desk doesn&#39;t even say a word and rolls her eyes. Later to find out she turns out to be our server :(
The food is priced high. The rice and beans are $3 extra charge don&#39;t even come with the entrees. I ordered a enchileda with mole sauce. The mole sauce had no flavor. My bf ordered 3 steak tacos $12.95 with rice and beans $3.00. We start eating and I realized the meat had no flavor like they used ABSOLUTELY no seasoning at all. My boyfriend is half way done with a taco and I look at him and he pulling out a piece of meat from his mouth. It was fat. All fat. About a minute later he pulls another piece out and puts it on the plate. Im like wow and I look for the server can&#39;t find her at all. He decides to keep eating discovers another 4 pieces of straight fat. I had enough I lost my appetiate and put my fork down. The server pops back up finally I tell her that his food was mostly all fat snd he is done eating and I want my food to go cause we just wanted to leave. She takes his plate to the back and leaves mine on the table. When she comes back she puts a box on the table and the check.  She then tells me they discounted the tacos. I look at check she gives me $4 discount on $16.95 entree that hardly have no skirt steak and was 70 % fat. I was disqusted and very aggravated. 
I wish I could give no stars. I love mexican food and thought I was gonna have high quality food for the prices they charge. If you want good quality tacos your better off going to a Mom and pop type place. Should have stuck with what I know, oh boy did I mess up by trying something new. I will let as many people know not to waste their money at this place. What a JOKE!!"

My wife ordered the &#34;Spicy Steak Taco&#39;s&#34; and when they came out we almost threw up.  It looked like slop on a plate, like lunchroom food. And it doesn&#39;t even come with rice or beans.  At Mago or Salsa 17 you get quality tacos(though smaller they taste WAY better).  I don&#39;t need pounds of low quality steak, I&#39;d rather take a normal portion of GOOD quality meat.

Jesus Bless my Soul and let Your infinite wisdom guide my keyboard as I talk about how much i fucking love this place yo.

I go here a lot, so I will just do a run-through of my collective experiences.

I am greeted by a nice mexican person who guides me to a table and plops me down with some chips and salsa RIGHT AWAY! Just so you know, the salsa is spicier on some days than on others.

The kind server comes and gets your order. The fun part are the margaritas! I get to excited and order the large one because they&#39;re excellent and get you a good healthy buzzed feeling. Then the fiesta truly begins after a few sips.

The waiters always kick ass, and they call me Senor (Which reminds me that Senor Ash sounds pretty bomb).  I order my usual order  &#34;Beef Lengua Tacos, with cheese and a side of sour cream&#34;.  Sometimes they tilt their head at me with a confused look and say &#34;You know what lengua is, senor?&#34;

So I say &#34;Yeah man!!&#34; And start to blush because I feel uncomfortable socially, but since I am black, nobody notices when I blush.  There is some freedom in that.    

Btw, Lengua is Cow Tongue. So good! Melts in your mouth like butter, and it&#39;s paired perfectly with their cilantro and onion.   I just order cheese and the side of sour cream because I like my dairy.

They always deliver it perfect every time. Before I know it, I am a king, sitting in a booth-throne with a big-ass margarita, and perfect tacos with a heaping side of sour cream.  I enjoy the ambiance, and music.  I sip my margarita and eat those amazing tacos and realize that life is never as depressing as it seems.  There is always something to enjoy- a moment of pure bliss and happiness, ya know the shit I&#39;m tryin to say.

Anyway. Javier&#39;s kicks ass yo. I recommend as a family time, or with co workers, or with homies kickin it. Get dem Margarita pitchers, enjoy the chips, and create your own world of Mexican Heaven. Let the worries of this bullshit world melt away when you come here."

Our group of 4 ordered burritos, tacos, and enchiladas.  Entrees we ordered came with rice and refried beans.  All food were mediocre at best, nothing to write home about.  Average entrée prices: $10 to $20.

I enjoy a nice margarita from time to time and the prices read: pricey, oh man, and holy cow.
I went with the &#34;oh man.&#34; It was pretty tasty but nothing to write home about (only on yelp). 

Our waitress was very sweet and friendly but seemed overwhelmed/slammed. She didn&#39;t offer much in the way of suggestions and was spotty with checking on how everything was going.

The mole sauce on my enchilada was the worst I&#39;ve ever had, and I felt like I was just eating a plate of oily, melted cheese with brown gravy. My husband&#39;s burrito was basically meat rolled in a tortilla. And the service was TERRIBLE!

Music is waaaay too loud after a long day at the office. All you can hear is tinty, raspy Mexican music. Just too loud. Needs to be turned down several notches. 

Chips are bland - greasy. Salsa is way better at Salsa 17, just around the corner. Javier&#39;s salsa is extremely hot. Service is almost always less than average to poor. Your server will visit the table and then disappears for 15 mins. Unexplainable. 

Food is also bland-no distinguishable flavor. 

Here&#39;s the best part-- get this!--if you order a soft drink, they charge you for refills unless you order a full meal. So $2.50 for a Coke? Their cost...maybe $.20 per Coke. And their policy is to charge you for refills!!? REALLY? Someone needs to let their management know that NO OTHER RESTAURANT around does that. Totally outrageous.

My wife has been there with her friends, and I want to say we went there a number of years ago when it had a different name.  Either way, this time was a good experience.

The ambiance is fun.  It&#39;s a bit dark, but I guess that sets the mood.  The decorations are authentically Mexican.  The colors are vibrant and there are lots of Mexican masks that adorn the walls.  The place is also deceivingly large.

We went for an early dinner on a Friday night.  Since it was early, it was not crowded and we were seated immediately.  They immediately serve chips and salsa.  Personal preference, I like chips thin, these were rather thick and crisp.  The salsa was moderately spicy and very fresh.

For an appetizer, we ordered guacamole.  The small size is very adequate for two.  And, it was very good.  It was fresh, with a good amount of garlic, lime and jalapenos.  Very tasty.

I had a chicken burrito dinner.  They serve two medium sized burritos on the plate with Mexican rice and re-fried beans.  My wife had cheese enchiladas.  I can&#39;t speak for her meal (which she said was very good), but the burrito was outstanding.  The rice was also excellent.  The beans - I like some texture to them.  Their version is smooth and I was not as thrilled with them.  But, overall, the food was great and WAY too much.  Both of us ended up taking home enough for dinner tomorrow night."

Service was impersonal but efficient.   I will never go back though due to their soda refill policy.  Seemingly if you don&#39;t order a full meal (in the $12-$20 range) you get charged $2.50 for every refill (didn&#39;t even think to look at the menu to confirm this point since its such a foreign policy).   

My GF ordered three tacos which equaled almost $10 and I ordered a medium burrito for $6 so whats the problem here?  Why is that too &#34;low&#34; to warrant free refills?      

 I have dined at hundreds of restaurants and have never been  charged for a refill.  My GF had 2.5 diet cokes and we were charged $7.50!

If you&#39;ve read many of my (Mexican) reviews, I lived in Texas for awhile so I expect a lot from Mexican restaurants.  

The margaritas are great but $14 for a large, is obnoxious.  The chips are super hard and lack salt.  The &#34;salsa&#34; is like watered down tomato juice with some jalapenos seeds and a shit-ton of hot sauce.  Yes it&#39;s hella spicy and not in a good way.  

The tacos were ok-good.  The chorizo...was horrible.  I didn&#39;t taste like or have the consistency/texture of any chorizo I&#39;ve ever had.  The rice and beans were good but how to you eff those up?

Whether it&#39;s something as simple as nachos or quesadillas I have a taste for, or basics like enchiladas or burritos,  or the absolute best dish on the menu - Steak A La Mexicana - the food is always excellent.  

The salsa varies from time to time, sometimes being a little on the mild side and other times being pretty spicy (that&#39;s how I like it!) but it is delicious.  

The waiters and bartenders have been there for years and really know the menu and will gladly work with you if you have special requests or restrictions.  After having a pineapple margarita on vacation a few years ago I had a taste for one, and although they don&#39;t have it on the menu, the bartender said he&#39;d give it a shot and he made a pretty awesome pineapple margarita. Kudos to him for going that extra step.  

They do have a small outdoor seating area which is nice, however, it is covered so if you are going there with the hopes of catching some rays while sipping a drink, it may not be the best place for that.

I ordered an appetizer because I was meeting friends for dinner.  The quesadillas were on the appetizer menu and they sounded great (cheese, onion, tomatoes and hot peppers). It was huge!  Probably could have split it with another guest.


Another guest had the fajitas and they looked equally wonderful.  They served fresh chopped Serrano peppers on the side (YUM).  The salsa was decent, not a fan of the chips, they were a bit too heavy for my taste and unsalted.

The birthday guests were treated to some really great flan with carmel sauce,  a candle and a few waiters singing.

One thing that I have always appreciated here is the service. Every person is friendly and attentive and very greatful to have you in their restaurant. Today seemed to be a very slow day for them but I can recall even on busy days that the service was great.

On a personal note, the carpenter that built the new bar also did our new kitchen and I have to mention that both look incredible. The man knows his stuff.

Pros: nice patio and yummy horchata. Cons: slow service, very average food. Maybe we&#39;re just spoiled by having a Tacos el Norte close to home. We were disappointed by the burritos here: just meat and beans, no other toppings or salsa with which to cut the thick, pasty bean texture. Had to ask for sour cream on the side. With so many other food choices in AH, and so many Mexican restaurants the area, I can&#39;t imagine we&#39;ll ever find ourselves back here."

Way too loud for a restaurant. It was uncomfortable to be there because it was so loud. We literary had to yell to hear each other across a normal size table!

Waiter was friendly.

Food was slow to come out. It was busy though. But what was inexcusable is when no one got their tortillas (an intricate part of the fajita dish) until about 5 minutes after the rest of the food came. REALLY? And without an apology."

This is definitely the place to come to for good Mexican food. I had the taco salad and yes many places get this very wrong. The chorizo burrito is what my husband had and he loved it. The chips were very fresh and the salsa was great! I highly recommend this restaurant.

Their steak fajita&#39;s are the best I&#39;ve ever had. I normally would stick with enchiladas but they are just decent. The fajitas are flavorful and there is plenty of food.

  I tried one of their beef taco&#39;s also, and boy was it bad. The beef was dry and overcooked and the whole thing lacked flavor. From now on I know what my go-to is on the menu."

After living thirty-five years in the west, it amazed me that every Mexican meal here has been at least pretty good.  Many were fantastic.  Javier&#39;s is not only the most expensive Mexican restaurant in the area, but  I have to say that even Chi Chi&#39;s or El Torito served better Mexican food in this.  

Suffice it to say that it was all horrible.  Salsa, chips, chicken, rice, beans, sauces.  And did I say it was expensive?  I did?  Okay, I will say it again, this place cost double what it should have, even if the food was good, which it wasn&#39;t.  

Leave it to downtown Arlington Heights.  Okay, TTowa.  Tuscan. And maybe Alt Thai?  I love living here, and there are some great Mexican restaurants on or around Dundee, but I see little reason to drive downtown for anything other than catching a train."

After being seated, it didn&#39;t take much for our group tp feel rushed by our waitress.  She claimed that she couldnt place orders a few at a time that only once.She was not very informative about the manu and at times was rude.  My mom, a senior mind you asked her about a dish.  For which she was quick to tell her to read about it in the menu.  Seriously?!?!?!  If a person has glasses and is elderly, they&#39;re  likely not to see well in a poorly lit restaurant.   I was so shocked at her response.  Had it not taken us a long time to get there in poor weather conditions. ..I would have asked my group to leave.  Throughout our dinner the waitress was almost non-existent.   She did the bare minimum to service our group.   This is when I wonder about &#34;included&#34; tips... hate to not tip at all but I was tempted.   Where are the managers when you need them?  Must one always have to seek out?  Most places have them checking up  on patrons regularly....

Now as far as the food and drinks.  Food was just average, nothing memorable.   Although I do have to make mentioned that I ordered the tampiqueña dish which inckided a well seasoned steak as well as enchilala w/sides of beans and rice.  The rice bad, it was dry and didn&#39;t taste fresh.  Not at all to my liking.

Now the drinks were good.  We had pitchers of rasberry and passion fruit margaritas."

My family checked out Javier&#39;s today.  The restaurant is pretty large, and since we arrived early on a Saturday afternoon, it was not crowded.

We started with Chips and Salsa, Guacamole, and Queso.  The chips and salsa were good; the chips are fried on the premises, and they were quite fresh. My wife liked the guacamole; again is was freshly made and served in a mini fried tortilla bowl.  The queso was also fine. It was more of the cheddar variety than queso blanco style.

My wife ordered a beef burrito. It was huge! She ate less than 1/4 of it, but not for lack of liking it. I tried a taste, and it was excellent in my opinion.

My daughter had the ground beef tacos; she was pleased. The ground beef style is not highly seasoned... just a nice touch of cumin and perhaps adobo style seasoning.

I ordered 2 enchiladas with mole poblano (1 beef, and 1 queso cheese) and 1 taco; (chorizo with cilantro, onions and queso blanco cheese.)

The enchiladas were excellent; the mole poblano sauce was also great. I&#39;d come back again for that.  The taco was OK, but they sent the first one with lettuce and tomato instead of cilantro and onion. I called that to the waiter&#39;s attention, and he promptly apologized, and quickly got that part of the order corrected.  When to new one arrived it was mostly correct, but for some reason they also had added sauteed jalapenos to the taco.  It was easy enough to knock them off, but the taco itself was OK, but not anything special.

We ended the meal with Mexican Fried Ice Cream.  Again, this was very good.

The whole meal was about $70 plus tip.  They charge for refills on soda and ice tea, which added to the tab since we all had 3 servings.  The other thing that was a bit odd; we had a gift card, and you cannot charge the tip to a gift card. Not sure why not, that&#39;s the first time I have encountered that. Not a big deal, but unusual.

All in all, we&#39;ll probably go back again. The atmosphere was nice, so while this place is pricier than many of the other local taqueria style restaurants we visit, I think it&#39;s a keeper."

Well, the chips were less than impressive and the salsa wasn&#39;t remarkable either.  Margaritas were decent... but that is where the mediocre stopped.  The veggie burrito was bad. The incredibly salty veggies were burnt in oil before landing in a flour wrapper that got drenched with bland sauce and cheese.  Enchiladas came out pretty much the same, the mole sauce tasted... not good.   I rarely don&#39;t finish everything on the table in a &#39;Mexican&#39; restaurant and I&#39;ve eaten at many over the last 35 years.... we both left after just a few bites.

I guess they had a renovation, but the atmosphere is a 10 out of 10. The place is dimly lit and the service was impressive.  My fiancee had the fish tacos with pico de gaillo (sp) and they were succulent. And the oputdor patio, though I have never dined on it, but it seems like everyone has a good time.

But the service... again was AWESOME!  My fiancee is such a critic when it comes to timliness of food and service and she was very pleased.  We literally did not go for 5 minutes without someone spying our water levels out of the corner of their eye.  At the end of the meal, we went out of our way to compliment the waiter.

The food is on par with Salsa 17 (Formally Fuego) (though the salsa and lack of soup are something Salsa 17 has over Javiers, but Javiers seemed about $5 a plate less than Salsa 17.  The atmosphere and service is much more romantic and prompt than Salsa too. So whatever Javier&#39;s is doing... we will be coming back."

Let&#39;s start with guacamole - that wonderful, glorious combination of avocado, salt, lime, cilantro, and whatever else one wants to add.  Here?  No cilantro, no salt, no lime.  I think I found an onion, but no hints of tomato or peppers.  I love avocado, and I wouldn&#39;t order the guacamole here again.  There&#39;s nothing *wrong* with it, there&#39;s just nothing right with it.

I had the burrito grande, and my wife had the chile relleno.  The chile was pretty good, and the cheese divine, but my burrito, while absolutely huge, was bland and I doubt there was more than 4oz of grilled chicken in it.  The blandness still gets to me - no flavors of cumin, or salt, or garlic or onion.  The sour cream was thick and delicious though.

Service was efficient and prompt, drinks kept refilled.  Tortilla chips were very hard and the salsa at the table was a bit spicy for my taste (admittedly, my spice threshold isn&#39;t high) and very thin.

Ultimately, in this day and age, you have to do Mexican better than Chipotle, and Javier&#39;s falls short of that mediocre standard.

Oh, and no fish tacos on the menu . . . come on folks!  With some spice palette changes to the dishes, this place could rock - all the elements are there, but it just doesn&#39;t come together.  Bland and boring, and there are just so many better Mexican places out there."

But you get what you pay for in this case... Look at the price of mcdonalds for christ sakes then try saying their expensive, you get twice as much food for the money at Javier&#39;s. They use very similar ingredients to the original place which had a long history at this location. The food is slightly Tex-Mex style so keep that in mind. They have some of the best enchiladas I&#39;ve ever had. If your impatient and picky with service it&#39;s a no brainier to NOT go here on the weekend. It will most likely take a couple hours to eat just like any other popular place during the weekends. When it&#39;s calm (before 6:00) you usually can&#39;t finish your water before they refill it.

The food is okay, the hot salsa tastes a bit like ketchup, the drinks are fine, and the service leaves something to be desired.

Javier&#39;s has a great deal of options most of which are a repeat of a basic Mexican dish with a slight variation.  There are quite a few veggie choices but nothing that stands out.  I have been to Javier&#39;s a few times and everything that I have tried on their menu is just okay...like I would rather eat my home cooked food okay.  The enchiladas are very standard, which is not too bad.  They do stuff the enchiladas full of what ever you have picked so there is no need for the over priced rice and beans on the side (which are not worth getting for the flavor or the price) but the enchiladas are just sorta bland.   The veggie fajitas are a ton of food but mostly peppers and onions and very overpriced.  The avocado tacos are filled to the max with what looks like guacamole but the dish is true to its name as it is just mashed up avocado.  Don&#39;t get me wrong there is nothing bad about mashed up avocado but you would think that getting that at a restaurant would have some sort of spice or kick to it...but there was nothing.

As drinks go the prices are not bad and the quality is fine.  Javier&#39;s does make a strong margarita, they are not the best in the world but they are a big step over the food.  I have also had the horchata which is never a bad choice, though Javier&#39;s makes theirs on the very sweet side.  It was almost too sweet for me, which is saying a lot.  

The restaurant is very large so their is not much trouble getting a seat but the service is fairly fast for being so big but the servers do not spend much time on the menu.  Javier&#39;s is one of those places that I will return to if my friends want to go but I would suggest at least a couple of places before I agreed.  There are many other great Mexican restaurants out there to pick from that are both cheaper and better."

We had a couple gift cards which we received, well, as gifts. We had them a while and finally decided to go out of our way just a little to make it in, and use our gifts.

We were welcomed immediately and seated promptly. The hosting staff was on top of things, and it seemed like the man who helped us was a manager, as he was making the rounds the entire time we were there.

Our server was pretty good. She knew the menu quite well, and was on top of things for the most part. She often stopped by to check on our meals and make sure our drinks were topped off. Though she started to be less attentive when the restaurant got crowded on a Sunday lunch rush, she overall gave us a solid 4-star experience.

At one time, one of our meals &#39;crashed&#39; on the way out of the kitchen. My wife joked, &#34;There goes your lunch, mom.&#34; A couple minutes later, the manager and our server both came over to apologize and tell us the replacement was on it&#39;s way. He even offered a cup us soup on them while we waited! Very professional and considerate! We ended up receiving another of this order which was being prepared, which only took a couple more minutes. I hope they did well to rush the other party&#39;s order through so they never knew what happened. ;-)

The lower rating than the above justified was partly based on the food. The menu was varied and looked pretty good! The items my wife an I ordered, however, were quite bland. I tried the &#34;Horseradish Beef Baguette&#34; which had a horseradish mayo, asking for extra after trying the sandwich. I could barely taste the horseradish, and the mayo tasted more like sour cream. Almost no flavor at all! The rest of the sandwich was well made, but needed some spunk to offset the otherwise decent beef, cheese and roll. Even the onions didn&#39;t add much, though they were the highlight of the sandwich. The salad was OK, though the dressing, which was supposed to be a light vinaigrette, was very basic. Even my mother-in-law&#39;s meal, the &#34;Fajita Pita&#34; with &#39;zesty salsa&#39; on the side, as she doesn&#39;t like spicy dishes. Even she said the salsa was not only not spicy, she shared &#34;...actually, it was quite bland.&#34;

One more point for the manager to work with is the conversations of the staff to one another. One person was busing some tables which were left very messy, while another server made a comment to that effect. The bus boy said something like &#39;this wasn&#39;t your table.&#39; and the server returned, a little louder &#39;No, MY tables would never be this messy. We all know whose tables are this messy.&#39; seemingly referring to another server. Not a big deal, just an indicator that there is some tension behind the scenes.

Overall, it was a fair meal. Nothing exciting, but a good way to catch up with my in-laws."

Nothing special but the waiters or waitresses do a good job with the customer service.  However, ordering a pie ahead of time at this location is really amusing which is why I&#39;m writing this review.  So here it goes:

I received a spam email from Bakers Square about their seasonal raspberry pies and how they will only be available for a short time.  Knowing that they do have good pies I took the bait and ordered a pie for pickup.  They told me I could pick it up on Friday (I ordered it on Thursday).  They also told me it would cost $14.99.

Friday at 8:15 AM I get a call from the manager of the restaurant telling me that my pie was given away because they did not set one aside for me.  He then offered to order another pie for me to pick up on Saturday and he would give it to me at no charge.  I didn&#39;t need the pie for a specific event so it was fine with me to pick it up on Saturday.  Also, I didn&#39;t tell the manager, but I would pay for it anyway because no harm done on my side.

Saturday comes around and I go to pick up the pie.  I tell the girl behind the counter that I&#39;m here to pick up a raspberry pie and she asks the manager if they have any slices of raspberry pie available.  I tell her that I&#39;m picking up a whole pie and then she looks a little confused.  Well, luckily there was a manager there to help her with this incredibly complicated transaction and they found a pie for me - the one that was set aside is probably still sitting in the restaurant waiting for me to pick it up.  When she rings up the sale she first doesn&#39;t mention anything about the no charge offered by the manager the day before and then she charges me $17.99 instead of $14.99!

At this point I figured if I hang around here too long my IQ may begin to drop so I figured my best bet was to just pay and leave.  I give her my credit card and she gives me the receipt to sign with the TIP line left open.  I just laughed and put a line through the tip line and signed the receipt.

In summary, this Bakers Square has good food and great pies. However, in my opinion the staff would have a hard time loosening a screw (even if they watched how to do it on YouTube multiple times)."

But anyway, BS went through a bad time when you&#39;d have to check your pie for freshness before accepting it but those days seem to be over.  Fewer stores and fresher pies now.  I&#39;ve purchased several take-out pies here and all have been delicious.  Last night was the first time I stayed there for pie and I do believe it&#39;ll be take-out from now on.  The price per slice seems kinda high but that&#39;s not the problem...

I cannot stand sticky tables and dirty things on them.  Our table was uniformly sticky and the salt and pepper shakers were visibly filthy.  Just gross.

I usually stick with the iconic French Silk Pie - and it is to die for. It&#39;s fight worthy. I&#39;ve actually hidden a pie in my fridge behind things so that my family doesn&#39;t see it and gobble it all up. LOL. 

Ive had other one, too, like the french apple, and the apple cream cheese - very good. But that french silk is amazing. Damn you, yelp, now i&#39;m craving french silk pie. 

I can highly suggest their pies. And they make it easy - you can walk right in to the bakery and order and go. Or you can call ahead and then pick it up. i think you may even be able to order online, but I could be wrong. They&#39;re always fast and have plenty of stock.

The couple times I&#39;ve eaten there I got a grilled cheese sandwich and soup and it was always good. Definitely consider this place."

First off, the waitress (forgot her name)..younger was more involved with who was texting her rather than taking our order. She was on her phone almost the entire time! When she FINALLY came over her phone went off...and she actually said excuse me please. OKAY, so I understand if their is some kind of emergency.....not the case.
We should have told the manager , however the only people there were younger punk looking kids.

Second of all, my friend tried ordering a pie and whoever was behind the counter pretty much talked him out of it just by how rude they were...... HOW is this place still around? Not only was the food bad... the service SUCKED.

We were sure the pie would rescue this travesty of a dining experience, but it was mediocre at best, and complemented by overpriced, watery coffee.

I never ate in the restaurant but I am so glad this place never closed down because it&#39;s very close to me. I have friends who specifically ask me to bring pies from Baker&#39;s Square during parties and holiday get-togethers. 

Their pies are 100% better than the pies and cakes at the big grocery chain across the street. My sweet-tooth gets me in so much trouble and have tasted almost all of their pies. My favorite? Let&#39;s make it favoriteS and we can talk... French Silk Pie (you can never go wrong with this staple), Banana Cream Pie (traditional and oh so heavenly), French Apple Cream Cheese (apple pie and cheese cake?? are you kidding me? Go for it!)  and the Pecan Pie (it&#39;s available year-round folks! no need to wait for winter)

Little tid-bit: It gets BUSY during the holidays. Score in time-saving. Call ahead and order your pie(s) few days in advance and let them know the date and time you are picking it up.

The recent renovation really improved the look of the place, but the food is the main reason to be here unless you are picking up a pie or a loaf of bread.  Since my last visit, the menu has become more sophisticated, prices are up about 10%, and service seems to be much improved.  The Chicken Pot Pie may be a cliche, but it is first rate.  The Chopped Steak is also serviceable.  Both are now about $10.  On a second visit, the breakfast items were fairly ordinary - an Omelet was adequate, but smallish.  The Ham and Eggs were good and each came with a muffin (as a choice) that was smaller than in year&#39;s past, but fairly good.  Unlike the image of the place, I didn&#39;t try the pie either time - it was just too bad a memory from January 2012 to venture into it again."

That being said, Baker&#39;s Square is my favorite pie of all time.  They closed the one right down the street from me, unfortunately.  So anytime I am in the Palatine area, I HAVE to stop here.  It&#39;s a necessity!  

I have been here many, many times and although one of the waitresses (an older lady) is quite grumpy, my very favorite waitress of all time is Gosia.  You DON&#39;T get better than her.  She is sweet, knowledgeable about the menu, and fast!  She is really friendly with her customers, too.  I almost hesitate to tell you all of this because I don&#39;t want you all to steal my amazing waitress.  But I suppose I can share once in a while!

I have tried MANY of their pies before, but my favorite by far is the French Silk.  It&#39;s a tradition in my family that I WILL continue for a long time :)  But Gosia&#39;s suggestion of the celebration pie is right up there with my french silk!  yes, it is mine.

I loved my lunch but hated the service. Our server seemed indifferent and careless the minute she greeted us. &#34;So, are you guys ready?&#34; Not so much the wording, but the tone behind it. Then, one of my friends ordered clam chowder and got chicken noodle. Another friend asked 3 times for some extra dressing.

The service we had here was quite good! We needed a high chair and were provided one in record time, and it had been sanitized! Very nice. The waiter we had was good at his job...there seemed to be delays in the kitchen because my food came out like 10 minutes after everybody else&#39;s, but I wasn&#39;t in a hurry or starving (and I was feeding my kid) so I could have cared less. The waiter was very conscious about the time-difference and repeatedly apologized and I even got a free piece of pie which I thought was very nice of him to do. So again, great service, good job, and I wish I knew names so I could give a shout-out to our waiter. 

Now, for the food. Best dish I had was the appetizer sliders, those were cooked very well. Everything else (including the pie, surprisingly!) was just one big meh. My crepes were kind of burnt and the strawberry sauce was way too sweet and tasted too fake-sugary. I wish they had more fruit selection on the fruit plate other than grapes, cantaloupe, and melon (although that might be a seasonal thing...but I do like seeing a variety). The cherry pie was kind of sub-par! There seemed to be a lack of kitchen staff that day...maybe that&#39;s what happened? Or the cooks were off their game? 

Because the service really was terrific I&#39;m not writing this place off completely and am willing to give it another chance. Hopefully the food improves! :)"

I was unhappy and no amount of birthday sex could ever make up for the disappointment.

So last week, we were celebrating for some reason, obviously not my birthday and we did finally make it here.
I was surprised...the place was packed (free slice Wednesday, I guess is the reason), our table was clean, bathroom spotless and didn&#39;t stink.
I had honey mustard chicken salad and it was freaking delicious.  It&#39;s really no more expensive than any of the local non-chain family restaurants...if I go to Buffalo&#39;s, I&#39;m still gonna pay $8+ for a salad, right?

And the pies are the best. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve tried pies in all the neighborhood restaurants and nothing can compare to BS. French Apple Cream Cheese is simply fucking awesome.

Our server was good too, very attentive. 

Ok, the only negative was the new decor...the paint is kind of a subdued greenish gold vomit. There was some nice faux painting at the front of the restaurant, in the waiting area but then that awful paint...it would be much more exciting to faux paint the walls over the vomit, a glaze or something, sponging, ragging...maybe a translucent gold glaze?

We got the potato soup instead which was really good. The service was very slow but they were extremely busy. We asked for refills and for some reason only 3 of the 4 of us got drinks. The food came, and we had to ask again for the 4th drink. We started eating, and my friend found a hair in her food. She didn&#39;t say anything, but I saw her brush it off her plate. It happens, it wasn&#39;t on the food so she let it go. Another friend ordered the bacon cheese quesadillas, and they were cold. You could tell by looking at them that the cheese had been melted and then sat until it got hard again. The menu also said it came with &#34;chips and salsa&#34;. It literally had 5 tortilla strips on it. Not chips, tiny little strips. I ate the green beans on my plate, and when I picked up a chicken tender there was a long black hair on it. At that point everyone checked their food and my friend with the hair on her plate found another one IN her sandwich. So we went and talked to the manager and his response was &#34;yeah, well there is hair in the kitchen&#34;. I realize he was trying to make light of the situation, but that wasn&#39;t an appropriate response. There was no apology, no offer to make it right.

Bad, overpriced food and worse service.  Waiters disappear after taking your order and delivering your food, yet make you feel like you&#39;re inconveniencing them anytime you need something, like utensils or the check.  And good luck getting refills.

My boyfriend ordered the turkey sandwich with baked beans, and I ordered the crawfish po&#39; boy with a baked potato. We also got an order of beignets. 

My sandwich was on French bread, and was well stuffed with crawfish. The bread was perfect; crispy on the outside with a soft inside. the crawfish was breaded, but not salty, and the pieces were decent sized. The baked potato came with butter and sour cream, and was cooked all the way through. 

My boyfriend said his turkey sandwich was good, and he was happy that it wasn&#39;t drowned in sauce (house). He did add the chipotle sauce to it, which gave it a pleasant kick. He said the baked beans were good, but nothing special. 

The beignets were hot and fresh. They were soft and airy, and a nice touch for dessert. 

We both agreed that we would be coming back here, as there is a lot on the menu we want to try! It is also reasonably priced (we spent about 28 dollars for all of our food), so you won&#39;t break the bank with this BBQ."

Brisket with burnt ends was very dry..  had no seasoning and no flavor..   drenched it in their very pain BBQ sauce and couldn&#39;t even eat it all, it was that dry.
Corn bread was overcooked and super dry...  Fell apart because there was no moisture holding it together.
Mac and cheese was watery, but bread crumb topping was good...

Will definitely not be back...  Even for Chicago&#39;s lack of knowledge in BBQ, this was very sub-par"

Not a lot of flavor in their pulled pork or sauce. Sides were okay, fries, baked beans, cole slaw but was a true embarrassment was their mac and cheese. Looked picture perfect with panko bread crumbs on top, but tastes like it came straight from a box -- tiny elbows with watery cheese sauce. 
Place looks nicer than the food inside."
jds-q-and-brew-arlington-heights,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,"Buffalo Grove, IL",1,1,1,389,288,GBA3mWYurbHQNjiJSCsm8Q,5.0,2016-04-17,"Not sure if there&#39;s a new chef or maybe the restaurant has been making minor improvements over time over the last couple years, but I was quite impressed with this restaurant after the last few visits. The menu has a wide variety of items to satisfy nearly any member of a large party, the food portions are large, the menu prices are quite low for a BBQ restaurant, the food comes out fresh and hot in a reasonable time (takes like nearly everything is home made as well), and the level of salt and seasoning has been tamed down from my earlier review. For food, this is probably a 4-star but the extra care put into presentation and excellent prices for the quality bump it up a star. Note that they do run out of items sometimes, throughout the day -- even fairly early in the day but fortunately there&#39;s enough items on the menu to switch preferences if needed.

Overall, I&#39;ve actually been more impressed with the side items than the BBQ. This isn&#39;t to say that the BBQ is bad, just that it&#39;s fairly generic and could use more smoke flavor and be a little more moist. Fortunately, there&#39;s a bunch of items that are well priced that I&#39;d make a trip to visit here for.

Pepsi with flavor shot machine: There&#39;s only 4 flavor shot options, but this is a nice change from the Coke machine if you&#39;d like to mix something different.

Mac &amp; Cheese: Large portion with slightly al dente noodles and a light cheesy, almost broth like liquid to go with the noodles. Topped with crispy bread crumbs.

Sweet potato fries: Very nice strong sweet potato flavor and slightly sweet.

Fresh cut fries: Done quite a bit better than a lot of other places I&#39;ve seen which are either too moist or start with poor quality potatoes so that the texture isn&#39;t meaty enough and there&#39;s not a strong flavor of potato with each bite.

Beef brisket: Nice and soft, not overcooked with just about the right amount of fattiness and slightly charred. It&#39;s not mind blowingly good like Real Urban BBQ, but the dinner option they have is fantastic for the price.

Potato skins: Definitely a must try if they have it in stock. For only $4 you get a giant plate of half-sliced potato boats filled with cheese, green onion, and bacon with sour cream on the side. The skins are slightly crispy when eaten fresh. Definitely the best deal as it&#39;s an entree-sized item at a side-item price.

Onion strings: Really crispy, not overseasoned, and the onion itself is a bit sweet.

Potato salad: Nice taste of pickle and mayo with potatoes that are nice and firm to the tooth.

Cole slaw: Fresh and sweet tasting, as usual -- very large portion with the meal and pairs very well with any of the BBQ dishes.

Beignets: Probably an unexpected choice on the dessert menu but this has a nice and fluffy dough and is fried nicely on the outside with a good helping of powdered sugar.

Wings: Giant portion, fried very well -- rivaling the quality of better known wing places like Gator&#39;s Wing Shack, Smoky Bones, and Hooters. The best part of this was that the meat seems to either be marinated or smoked before frying as it was very flavorful even without sauce.

Overall, for a place that offers big portions and fresh made food -- you really can&#39;t beat JD&#39;s for the prices they charge. Its offer of fast casual BBQ is definitely a great asset to the Arlington Heights area."

The smell as you approach the restaurant is wonderful.  We came at a slow time, 3:30pm on a Saturday.   We had hamburger on soft pretzel roll, fries, onion straws, baked beans and chopped brisket sandwich.  All of the food was exceptional except for the baked beans.  My husband said they were ok but I thought they didn&#39;t taste good at all.  I came down from 5 stars to 4 stars because my son&#39;s hamburger order (plain hamburger with bacon) was brought to us as a cheeseburger with bacon.  The server took it back but it took a really long time to get the correct order to us.  So long, in fact, my husband and I were done eating by the time the correct hamburger came out.   The server came over twice and said &#39;Your order will be out soon.&#39; Ok, but what does &#39;soon&#39; mean?  After 20 minutes, I went up to the pick up counter to ask about it.  I told the worker and manager that we were done eating already. The manager said rather bruskly, &#39;It will be out soon.  He wanted well done. That takes longer to cook.&#39;  Really?  His tone implied &#39;Now go sit back down, lady.&#39;  The hamburger came out about 3 minutes later. No compensation or apology from the manager himself.  My son said he is never coming back here but my husband and I liked the food so much we&#39;ll probably return."

My steaks are always filets, I&#39;ll order pulled chicken instead of pork because of the chance of fat and ribs that fall off the bone do not appeal to me because I know the fat hasn&#39;t been burned off of them. So keep that in mind for my review.

We have been going to this place since it was Teddy&#39;s, a burger joint.  And we were happy when the barbeque place opened because it was something different, it has it&#39;s own smoker, they have lots of beers and the guy running it was friendly and passionate about his barbeque.  When we wanted something different we would go there and I have to tell you the first time I tried their brisket, it was like sliced filet. We&#39;ve also had their ribs.  But that was a while ago and I think it&#39;s changed hands.  

After having that great brisket at JD&#39;s I tried brisket at other places and it was always fatty.  And most people&#39;s pulled pork is also, but still I would ask the question at restaurants, &#39;is the meat fatty&#39;?  My wife says, &#39;They aren&#39;t going to tell you!&#39;  And so I stopped asking and just order.  I&#39;m always disappointed.   So when we went to JD&#39;s the other day I thought I&#39;d try the brisket and some pulled pork because of my experience the first time.  As you can see from the pictures, it&#39;s just like every other place, tender, barbequed meat and fat.  It&#39;s sad. I wonder if they have a barbecued veggie burger..."

A great place to go during the workweek on a Friday Lunch. May take a smidge over an hour but worth it. I&#39;ve done racks, brisket, turkey leg, veggies, potatoes, and rice here. Moderately pried


Pro&#39;s: I&#39;m a sucker for BBQ, but of the multiple places I&#39;ve been to, this is probably the best . Multiple sauces, a large menu which I have yet to discover a bad choice. Adequate service. Great quick atmosphere with folks from the office

Con&#39;s: I love the smell of JD&#39;s  and BBQ. If you like the smell of BBQ you&#39;ll probably like the way the place smells too. Problem is, it will stick to you and everyone will know where you went to lunch.

This time called ahead and went to the drive thru and STILL had to wait way too long!! When opening the food it was disappointing to find the rib tips chopped into small pieces that resembled nothing like rib tips. Also, the Carolina sauce was not even close to Carolina style.

My friend sweetly offered to take me out to dinner and I directed us to JD&#39;s. We walked into a mostly empty restaurant which was nice, because I needed a quiet place to reflect on my day and relax. 

We ordered our meals at the counter, were given cups for our drinks, and made our way over to the fountain drinks... You guys... They have Gatorade fruit punch! Good stuff, good stuff.

Our food was brought our shortly after we parked it in our booth. I had the pulled pork with macaroni and cheese and onion strings and my boyfriend had the brisket with cornbread and baked potato. We were both happy with our choices, with the cornbread being a particular standout. The big thick slice had hints of maple syrup and brown sugar with kernels of corn mixed in. I liked the Mac and cheese; it was a gourmet version of the blue box I loved growing up; smokey and smaller elbow noodles with a nice crust on top. My friend raved about the baked potato and polished it off, saying the whole time &#34;they know how to make baked potatoes right!&#34; The only disappointment were the onion strings... They were kind of dry and just burnt tasting with no flavor other than a charred crunch. 

Oh and the BBQ.... Nom. I liked the pork and my friend loved the brisket. I wish they came with more sauce but that problem is easily remedied because they have squeeze bottles of their house and chipotle BBQ sauces on the table. 

Portions: manageable but I have a knack for turning anything into leftovers. 

Price: perfect. Just enough food for $11-$13 per platter.

We have gone to this restaurant twice when it was supposed to be open and both times it has been closed. Both times an hour before the door says they closed. So instead now I have called before we drove all the way to the restaurant. Last time they just flat out didn&#39;t answer so I assumed they were closed. This time I just called at 8:15 pm because we were a block away and finally was able to talk to someone. A girl answered and I asked what time they were open till tonight to which she responded &#34;uh hold on one second&#34; then she came back on the phone and said they were closing at 8:45. I explained to her that we had been trying to eat there and they were never open when they say they were going to be. She told me that when they aren&#39;t busy they close when they are finished cleaning. So they have actually been closing at 8 on week nights and 9 or earlier on the weekends. I wanted to explain to her that they would never busy at night if they always closed early at night because if you know a place closes randomly why would you bother trying to eat there! I think it&#39;s ridiculous that they just randomly decide when to close I would fire all of them if it were my restaurant. I&#39;m not going to bother trying to eat here again because the staff has left a bad taste in my mouth already!

The baked beans were nothing special. The corn bread was the best thing on my plate. It&#39;s a good thing there was a lot of corn bread, because the small portion of ribs left me hungry.

Coincidentally, my waist size also seems to grow each time I go here.

This seemingly-hidden gem is located in an odd part of town and I, sadly, forget it&#39;s there half the time. One night I had a hankering for some Q, yelped for options and JD&#39;s came up.

We were apprehensive. 
Then we realized there was a drive-thru (for real!). 
Sure, the drive-thru was slow, but it&#39;s not a fast-food chain.

The prices were reasonable and the BBQ was...is delicious. 
I want to go in to the location to try the micro beer selection and see the decor.

But in all honesty, JD&#39;s just didn&#39;t do it for me... it was fair, as it didn&#39;t destroy my love of low-and-slow meats and sides, but it definitely wasn&#39;t even close to the best barbecue I&#39;ve ever had.

The breakdown (with grades at the end):

RIBS: These actually reminded me of the ribs I barbecue at home, which is to say they&#39;re good but not &#34;HOLY-MOTHER-OF-GOD&#34; amazing. The meat was fairly tender and didn&#39;t fall off the bone (which it shouldn&#39;t, FYI -- that means the rib is overcooked and was probably boiled first), but didn&#39;t come off too easily either. With the perfect rib, you should have to bite and tug slightly,and the bone should be fairly clean. With these bad boys, there were still little chunks of meat attached to the bone. Additionally, although these ribs come sauced up, which traditional of Chicago barbecue, I found a portion of the rib that didn&#39;t have sauce, and I was definitely underwhelmed by the flavor. More rub would definitely be welcomed! Grade: B-

BRISKET: I read on here I think that someone thought this was the best brisket they have ever head. Well, to that person, you need to eat at more barbecue joints then. Once again, I felt the brisket was lacking in flavor, though it was tender. However, the sauce they put on the brisket is their house sauce, which is a sweet, apple-cidery sauce. Brisket should have a peppery, smokey sauce, so I was a bit disappointed with this. Grade: C

MAC N&#39; CHEESE: Easily the biggest disappointment. While on intial appearance, I was excited due to the gratin, I was met with disappointment upon discovering the taste and appearance of boxed macaroni and cheese. The macaroni noodles were the little noodles you typically find in the boxed variety, and the cheese sauce had little-to-no flavor. In fact, dare I say I&#39;ve had boxed mac n&#39; cheese with more flavor than this. Grade: D-

FRIES: Only fried once because of the lack of a crunchy exterior. Inside, some fries were cooked, others were a little underdone. Grade: C-

ROLL: It was just &#34;a roll,&#34; but it wasn&#39;t overly dry and did its job. Great job, Roll. Grade: A-

HOUSE SAUCE: Sweeter sauce with a prevelant but not overpowering apple cider vinegar taste. Other spices gave it a welcome tang as well. Grade: B+

CHIPOTLE SAUCE: Chipotle is a huge buzzword for me, as I love its smokiness -- &#34;OOH! CHI-POT-LE!&#34; However, this sauce was just spicy more than anything else. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but it definitely wasn&#39;t what I was expecting out of something labelled with the magic word. Grade: C+
-------------------------

Like I said, I&#39;ve had been lucky enough to have some pretty awesome barbecue, so maybe my expectations are too high. All in all, if I was in the area and absolutely NEEDED a barbecue fix, then I would come here. But otherwise, I would not specifically seek this place out."

Definitely not the best, but friendly with a good selection.  The ribs are baby back, I don&#39;t think St. Louis are available here which would be my preference, so I went with the pulled pork platter, and it comes with two sides, of which if you like baked beans,  you have to try them.. Pulled pork was taste moist but a bit bland for me till I added the Chipotle bbq sauce which added a nice zing.  Also special this night, cajun gumbo, was delicious.  Try the place if in the area,  it is worth it."

First the good:
Nice restaurant, large with outdoor seating.  You can smell the wood in the air but it&#39;s a good thing, not going to get you sick or anything.  The menu seems to have a good selection and prices are about where you would see most BBQ places.

Then I saw they had burnt-ends!  Hard to find around these parts.  My favorite BBQ place has these and I think this is only the third place I&#39;ve been to that has them and they were good!  Not as good as South Moon (in Hinkley) but still good.  My sides were good as well, potato salad and corn bread, nothing to get excited about but worth ordering.  Plus they put the BBQ sauces on the table.  I hate when places cheap out with the sauces (one reason I avoid T-Bobs in Des Plaines),

Bad:
Ribs are sub-par at best.  The ones I had were thin and yet they still had plenty of fat.  For me to frequently visit a BBQ joint the ribs better be good.  If they are smoked then they do a poor job at it.  I wish I can bring them a slab of South Moon&#39;s ribs and put them side by side and ask the owner which is better.  JD would be embarrassed if he/she saw the difference in quality and taste.

With that said I will return to try their brisket and pulled pork.  Their burnt ends were good so I will definitely go back for those.  I feel this area lacks a real good BBQ joint and was hoping this one was going to be &#34;the place&#34; to go.  Too bad the owners of South Moon don&#39;t open a second location up here."

I tried the takeout option and called ahead.  Full slab for myself. Pulled pork sliders for the wife. When I placed my order I requested to try 2 sauces for the ribs. &#34;No problem&#34;. Will pack the sauce on the side. 

Well as I return home and unpacking dinner no sauce to be found? Who sends a full slab out the door without any sauce. Huge disappointment, and another trip to recover. Manager threw in a slice of key lime pie for my trouble. Nice gesture. 

Sides were a mixed bag. Mac and cheese seems generic and bland. Cole slaw is decent. Baked potato was well a potato. Corn on the cob is out of season so I won&#39;t pass judgement. 

Wife said the pork sliders were good. I found the ribs to be just ok. As others have commented these aren&#39;t fall off bone ribs. Flavor and smoke is present, but didn&#39;t wow me. 

All and all average at best."

Last night we needed to carry out dinner for a sick friend&#39;s family. Being that we have never carried out from JD&#39;s before, we did not know what to expect let alone we needed to travel with the food another 45 minutes.  After talking with Bill, the manager, and explaining our situation he offered to use aluminum catering containers rather than styro-foam.  When we arrived to pick up the order we were pleasantly surprised how the food was packaged.  Bill went the extra mile and prepared each part of the meal individually in the marked aluminum containers. All we needed to do was lift the lids and serve the meal to our friends.
 
The bar-b-que chicken was warm, moist and delicious!  The mac n cheese was OUTSTANDING.  It was still warm from the oven and the bread crumb topping was still crispy, just like dining in the restaurant.  The garden salad was fresh and crisp and let&#39;s not forget about the sweet potato hush puppies-yum!

JD&#39;s on the other hand is pretty fantastic. My friends recommended me this place so I decided to check it out.
This place smells like smoked meats, which is a good sign for me. Someone helped me out when I walked in as I was confused by the new set up. The server was super friendly, gave me great recommendations, and I enjoyed every bite. Hush puppies were awesome, and they have a great beer selection. Music isn&#39;t too loud, not quite an intimate atmosphere but for bbq that isn&#39;t overpriced, this is certainly a find for me. 

If you&#39;re in the area, do yourself a favor and check this out. Not THE best bbq I&#39;ve ever had but for the price, friendliness of staff, and quality, can&#39;t ask for much more.

Edit: I talked with some the staff, apparently they changed management about 10 months ago, so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s gotten way better than it was when it first opened?"

The staff we encountered were friendly and attentive, although it was not crowded when we were there. The decor is dark and generic, but looks fresh and recently done. They have TVs tuned to sports, one was showing a Hawks replay. The cute blackboard menus (colored chalk!!) give you your options. There are daily lunch and dinner specials. Unlike many BBQ joints, they offer several salads, and some other meats like fish and gyros (helpful for groups when someone doesn&#39;t want BBQ). The pulled pork I had was like what my Midwestern mother serves as BBQ pork, very soft and tender and served drenched in a sweet and not spicy sauce.  Their chipotle sauce is more spicy and vinegary, but not hot by really any BBQ standard (but my mom wouldn&#39;t like it!). I would order meat without sauce if I came here again. The baked beans were smoky and had large chunks of beef, but also sweet. The coleslaw was fine, also sugary. I&#39;m guessing the palate of the head chef here leans heavily towards the sweet not spicy. The brisket my husband ordered was very moist and with a nice pink smoker ring. He also had sweet potato chips, which were very good. They have a large beer list, and a regular soda fountain (with diet Dr. Pepper). I like what they are trying to do, and had no problem with the quality. I just prefer my bbq a lot spicier."

The brisket was melt in your mouth, I liked using both sauces. Then the crispy green beans what is that heavenly ranch sauce??! Mac n cheese with tons of bread crumbs yummy. The gumbo was just the right amount of spice and no sketchy seafood like some gumbos. The ribs fell off the bone yummy. The cajun sausage was super tasty. We ordered so much we had a whole other meal. Also I&#39;m particular about coleslaw in nc coleslaw comes on bbq majority of the time it&#39;s delicious.

My husband ordered brisket and I had ordered 1/3 slab.  The smell as we entered the place, was mouthwatering.   The actual food was even better.  The ribs were perfectly cooked, and brisket was tender, not dry and chewy at all.  JD&#39;s seemed like a place where everyone knew each other.  
Would I go back?  Yes, if I am in the neighborhood."

JD&#39;s was yesterday&#39;s pick. We were getting in there pretty close to closing time, and some friends were still trailing in. The owner/manager said he would happily keep the kitchen open until we had all arrived and had ordered. Very kind! Then, one of our friends showed up after the register had been closed. The same man came up and personally asked my friend if he would like some food on the house, since the register was all counted. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of care and kindness shown there. JD, you have just won over about 8 new fans and you will be a restaurant that will be in our rotation more often. Thank you so much!

I&#39;ve been here twice in a span of 2 weeks and I tried a number of menu items. This is my favorite BBQ place right now. Since they are relatively new and still trying to build a reputation, I had no trouble finding parking near the entrance for both of my visits. I think it won&#39;t be long before they get a lot more crowded.

Once inside, you see a glass case of assorted beers to choose from. A chalkboard on the other side of the restaurant lists all of them in small, crowded print. You might like looking at the bottles more if beer is your thing. The food menu is on the wall but not easily visible until you are standing in front at the cash register. Since there are paper menus, I recommend giving them a good look or you&#39;ll be holding up the line trying to decide what you want - and that can be hard with all the great choices.

Now let me start by saying you won&#39;t go wrong with the beef brisket. I&#39;ve had it at other BBQ places like Smoque and JD&#39;s got them beat on a BBQ staple. And you get a heaping platter of sliced brisket that is enough for 2 meals. Brisket not your thing? Go for the ribs. They are cooked right - not overdone that they fall off the bone. Well, if you just want a burger, go for it! These are  1/2-pound monster sized burgers with bakery quality buns. I had the flagship JD&#39;s BBQ Bacon Burger, which was great. Even a -pound cheeseburger was still more than my 9 year old son could eat. 

Since every platter comes with a side dish and coleslaw, I have to recommend my #1 favorite side: baked beans. These aren&#39;t just your usual Bush&#39;s Beans, but a mix of baked beans and shreds of brisket meat mixed in. Makes for a rich, meaty mix of beans, brisket and a delectable sauce. Thanos, the manager, took my order and included the beans for free even though they were not among the items I requested but insistes that I try. He was so correct! The coleslaw was rather bland on my first visit, needing a hit of vinegar to taste just right, but was perfect on my second time, which tells me it might need more consistent preparation, but not bad. Fries - both the regular and the sweet potato kind are excellent here too. 

JD&#39;s has their BBQ sauce in  1/2-cup Styrofoam containers. I wish they had bottles of it at the table, since it would make it more convenient instead of going up to ask for more. There are mild and hot versions of the sauces, both were good. Though the hot was too much for my wife, I thought it had the right amount of zip and smoky flavor to be my fave.

Lastly, if you think you have some room, try their soft serve ice cream at the end. It comes included with a kids meal. Though my kids aren&#39;t overly carnivorous and prefer mac &amp; cheese at a restaurant most often, JD&#39;s made them into BBQ believers."

This was to closest to me so I decided to give it a go. We went there for lunch on a Saturday and there were a few people. They do not accepted our restaurant.com coupon for the daily specials. Not a big deal, I went for a BBQ plate of Pulled pork with a side of mac n cheese, and cornbread for which I used the restaurant.com certificate. My girlfriend got the special for the day which was 3 BBQ slammers.

The food was GREAT. I have had really good BBQ before but it has never been so good for this low price. The daily special my girlfriend got was huge! And my BBQ platter was even bigger. The meat was tender and had really good taste to it. I was not expecting much from this place but I was very surprised! They even have a drive through, which I will be using a lot from now on!

Also, some people here said that they ordered and they had to wait around 15 minutes for their food. It took a bit under 10 minutes for our food to get to our table, so during busier times you may wait a bit longer. But this is NOT fast food. I do not mind waiting knowing that what I am getting for 7 bucks is WAY better than anything else I can think of for that price.

I will be back. I am a fan for life."

Hot and fresh, not overcooked or oversauced. This way you really can taste the meat. I prefer my ribs on the chewy (but not tough) side like these. Those that go for the &#34;fall off the bone&#34; variety may be disappointed. The size was generous (approximately 13 ribs). My ribs were definitely baby back (which I prefer). You can easily tell by the shape of the bones. The barbecue flavor is understated.

Unfortunately their sides (fries, onion strings, corn bread) were only so so. Prices are reasonable considering the ample portions. Spacious dining area. Fast casual counter ordering set up where they bring your order to your table. Beer and wine available. Efficient service."

The last three times I have been here for lunch they have been out of Potato Salad.  Keep in mind I am talking about an 1130 lunch.
The first time I let it slide without saying anything.  The next time I made a comment to the owner which was basically ignored.  This time, I said &#34;hey this is three times in a row&#34;.  The owner replied, &#34;we make it fresh daily&#34; and was somewhat of a jerk about it.  So I snapped back.  Must not make very much of it, since it is not even Noon yet and you have been open for a couple of hours.  How does a place run out of a staple product like this before lunch crowd even comes in, let alone dinner.
This guys attitude is like he is gods gift to BBQ.  I suggest he take a trip down to Steamboat in Wheaton or Chicago Q in the city and see how it is really done.
Will give this place another shot, basically because of how close it is but if he does not get it together it will be on to someplace new"

At one point, no one was even on the dance floor and he walked away from booth and had still not played my song.

His excuse was that we were over-served which could not be further from the truth. Our behavior for the total minute and half we were there was nothing short of sober. Our efforts to enter another bar in the area  were futile as he had already called all bars in the area telling us we could not be served and that the authorities had been notified. Though the employees of the second bar saw and understood that we were basically sober, they regretted to say that they could not let us in because of that call, which still seems absurd."

The servers seemed very disorganized in that there were two different waitresses that tried to take our order, which goes to show that they didn&#39;t know what tables were theirs.

She is a small girl and was trying to hop up onto the bar stool. She slipped while trying to get on and took a pretty hard fall to the ground. The bouncer rushed in to tell us that we were drunk and had to leave. We had just walked in and were in no way acting drunk or loud and in fact were not drunk. He did not even ask if my friend was okay. He jumped to conclusions. He said we could go across the street to the fox and hound instead. We left and went there. Of course he had already called the fox and hound to let the manager know to expect us. We were greeted at the door by a bouncer who said unfortunately he could not let us in due to the call. We were bummed to hear this, but the bouncer explained the situation and said regardless of what he personally thought of us, because of the phone call he could not let us in. He was very polite about the situation which was appreciated. He agreed that the actions taken were harsh as we were not drunk/rowdy. I am happy to have found out that the snuggery was a terrible establishment before we spent any money there. Please save your time and go elsewhere.

I guess this is pretty standard behavior for all of their employees, as multiple people have written negative reviews about the employees here."

I had never been here before, so I was excited to try it out. Walked in and the music was going and people were dancing, which is great! It was pretty loud in there though, like, really loud. And it was empty on a Saturday night, not a great sign. 

We sat at the bar and pored over the drink menu. I saw they had shot-skis listed as a special and I figured since it was a birthday, I would order one for my friend. I asked the bartender for one and she said they don&#39;t have that.... Okay, so why is it on your menu? I hate when restaurants don&#39;t block things out or updated their menus when something is removed. Obviously, it is expensive to reprint, but take a Sharpie or something and cross it out or whatever. We ordered a round of Sweet Tart shots for our group and the bartender made them up pretty quickly. Those were great, tasted just like candy! We also had a round of shots that tasted like Jolly Ranchers, I don&#39;t remember what they were called, maybe they were Jolly Rancher shots! The shots were great, but the mixed drinks were just okay. I ordered the Snugg-A-Rita, and it was just okay. The birthday girl had a Long Island and it tasted terrible, like garbage water. She didn&#39;t want to return it, so she just drank a quarter of it and had a Coke. In a testament to how loud it was, one of my friends ordered a Corona from the bartender, and she made her a tequila shot. We were literally sitting at the bar, leaning over to talk to the bartender. If you can&#39;t hear the orders, the music is probably too loud. We tried to go dance, but the dance floor was very small, there were lots of tables in the way and people kept bumping into them. You could tell the patrons sitting at those tables were getting a little irritated. 

I think this bar has potential to be a suburban hotspot, but they are right next to Fox and Hound and just ten minutes from America&#39;s bar, both superior bar spots. Also, they are in a terrible location. If you didn&#39;t already know it was there, you would never find it. If they cleaned up a bit, it could be a great place! Also, the bartenders could be a little nicer. Like, I don&#39;t know if it was because we were all women, but they seemed almost bothered by our presence. We all bought alcoholic drinks and left a tip, so I don&#39;t understand the attitude. Not okay. I might go back, but not for a night out."

I don&#39;t know what in the world it was, but we left after just one drink. 

I noticed a few days later that they put a $50 charge on the card that I used to buy the one drink. I called to speak with a manager about it and after being hung up on and calling back, a woman explained to me that they always do that just in case someone walks out without paying. Shouldn&#39;t you warn people about this before you take their credit cards...? I mean, I only got one drink! It just seemed super sketchy, and the manager on the phone wasn&#39;t even the least bit apologetic.

Slow, inattentive, and downright lazy. I ordered two beers and a meal, pretty normal. I was there two hours before I could actually leave because of the sloth like pace of the bartenders. The &#34;bartenders&#34; were clearly too busy talking to each other to notice my hails so I could get my check and leave. When I spoke to the manager and mentioned the slow pace, he started interrogating me as to why I was unhappy. 

The real kicker came when I got my bill and there was a $50 place holder fee on my bill. It&#39;s like they assume you to be a thief, even though I gave them my credit card and opened a tab. Why tack on a $50 place holder when you already have a person&#39;s credit card? 

Avoid this place!"

I do not know how they do it but if you like peppers this is the place to go.  Everything looks extremely fresh and tastes great.  There is a great blackhawks fan base in this bar that makes watching a game fun.  Bears games are fun to watch here also.

The wait staff was very helpful keeping drinks filled and cleaing plates. 

I had the veggie burger and $1 tacos (Thursday special). The veggie burger was excellent and the tacos werent bad. The tacos could have used a little more meat and less coleslaw.

Owned by the same restaurant group that owns Finn McCool&#39;s and Moretti&#39;s, the menu is similar to Finn&#39;s, even with some of the same burgers, entrees, and appetizer items.  Some things that stood out as different on the menu were the fajitas, broasted chicken, and fresh cut fries.  I was debating with one of my table mates that the fries here are 100x better than the fries at Finn&#39;s, because the&#39;re fresh cut and not that crinkle-cut frozen ish.  Apparently, he prefers the taste of freezer burn.

Decor is standard to this restaurant group, it seems that all of their restaurants are basically the same on the inside.  Service was decent, they&#39;re not knocking it out of the park, but they&#39;re not lagging behind, either.

$5 &#34;Snug burger&#34; on Tuesdays, which is also trivia night.  How do you argue with that?  The burger was cooked as I ordered it and came hot and ready to be devoured."

Stopped in with a group to pregame before going to an event. Mostly because of the drink specials: $5 mixed drinks for the ladies and 5 coors lights for $15 buckets and $3.25 miller lite 20oz drinks.

I didn&#39;t expect much from the outside and their location next to the cleaners but the inside has a lot space and is very clean. They also have an outside area. It was fairly empty but I am shocked that people review that it is over crowded. Must be a late crowd?

Drink specials were good and the waitresses were very nice. Food smelled good from a nearby table and it was a great time chatting with friends and watching sports. There was even a wedding party outside playing bags and drinking."

But honestly I was pretty unimpressed. When we walked in we were greeted by bouncers...who didn&#39;t know whether or not to charge a cover. How about no. Luckily they didn&#39;t charge us one. The only time I like to pay a cover is if there is a live band - something actually worth paying the extra money for.

 I noticed that there was a younger crowd, which was good. They have a decent dance floor, but hardly anyone was dancing and it was like 1AM. We approached the bar and ordered 2 lemon drop shots (which were small compared to other places I have been). They were $6 each. Rip.Off. After that we waited for a long time for a bartender to get back to us about ordering another drink or closing out the tab. We ended up leaving just because we didn&#39;t feel like being the only people on the dance floor dancing. 

Like I said, I would try it again....but so far I&#39;m not impressed."

I&#39;ve been to bars that don&#39;t excel at being a dive or sports but at least there&#39;s some kind of saving grace. There&#39;s none here. 

The bartender Hannah was terrible, not helpful, didn&#39;t listen to me when I asked to keep my tab open, very sloppy pouring drinks (and very weak pour too), preferred to party behind the bar instead of work.  The beer was watered down, music way way too loud (Fox and Hound got better at this. Snuggery was much worse). My friends were pretty much turned off and just ruined our nights, definitely don&#39;t plan on coming back here. 

Stick to Fox and Hound next door (which isn&#39;t saying much since I get hit-or-miss service there, prefer the Arlington Heights location way more). At least the bartenders seem like they kind of care about their customers and the management far more responsive plus way better beer selection...I&#39;d rather pay more for better experience than what we got.  Granted, it still feels like an annoying let&#39;s-get-wasted bar which didn&#39;t help but what can you do?

If you want karaoke, go somewhere else, ANYWHERE else.  At the very least, until Snuggery gets better bartenders and pays better attention to their kegs."

We came here after losing our softball games to drown our sorrows a few times last summer.  We experienced some particularly bad (see: horrific) service twice in a row, and we stopped coming back.  We chose to take our business elsewhere.

Well, this summer, we decided to give this place one more chance, and I am really glad we did!  The manager (who desperately tried to help with our service issue from last summer) actually remembered us when we returned and went as far as to make it up to us TWICE now.

He didn&#39;t need to do that, but he went out of his way to make it right.  That&#39;s what I call good customer service, because we have since been back a few times!  

The food is good--typical bar food, but they have good specials.  I usually get the broasted chicken on Sunday nights.  It&#39;s four pieces of chicken, coleslaw, mashed potatoes and a salad.  It&#39;s pretty cheap and really good.

The service was quite solid. My friend and I came to watch the Rangers vs Capitals in Game 7. So we requested the tabletop speakers to get some volume. No less than six speakers died within a half hour. The bartender and manager kept working on it until early in the third we got a speaker that worked for the rest of the game. Major props for that. And I only got charged for one beer, despite drinking three. That was pretty outstanding by them.

As for the food...well, it was ok. Passable. The chicken fingers were fair. Juicy, but not crisp. I appreciate the fries being fresh-cut, that makes a big difference for me., but still not very crisp. I also had the Captain Morgan seared shrimp, which are grilled, doused with BBQ sauce, and served on onion straws.  Six pretty small shrimp and the BBQ sauce tasted more like a Buffalo sauce for me. I wouldn&#39;t order that one again.

All in all, it was fine, but this place is a 45 minute drive from me and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth that long a drive for me to go back. So you could do worse, you could do better too."

We stopped coming here when it closed, because were not interested in the weekend jersey shore vibe as were in our mid 30&#39;s and just liked to drink outside.

We came in on a random evening 1/17/2013 (which if you notice the other reviews from the same evening it seems we all have similar gripes) kind of celebrating a small work related victory...

Right from the start the service was brutal. There were THREE bartenders behind the bar and we waited 20 minutes to order our first round of drinks and food, there couldn&#39;t have been more than 15 people in the entire bar at this point, so not OK.

The night went downhill from there...the girls behind the bar were either texting, talking, going out for breaks etc, getting their attention was impossible, drinks were delivered wrong or never delivered at all, the barback was actually tending bar for a while (he&#39;s awesome by the way) and at the end of the night we had a complete billing nightmare that is STILL going on one week later.

I&#39;m not sure what happened between summer and now, but we won&#39;t be back. Ever.

Note to young, female bartenders...when a group of mid 30&#39;s professionals come in to drink and were all ordering top shelf liquor and are running up tab&#39;s of $300 or so, PAY ATTENTION TO US! We actually HAVE jobs and money to tip you with...the group of idiot 22 year old boys drinking $2 miller lites DOES NOT."

They have some drink specials which they post on the website.  The Friday special of a whipped martini was pretty bad... don&#39;t waste your money.  I love vodka and I dumped mine.

The service was pretty slow and even though we had a table, I found myself going to the bar quite a bit to get a drink.  I hope this is just because they are new and will improve.  

The DJ was cool and mixed a bunch of music by request... both new and old songs.  Towards the end of the night, the Snuggery invited girls to come and dance on the bar for free shots... always a plus in my book.  However, I felt that they could have dimmed the lights a bit... it seemed too bright for most of the night.

We had tried to go to the Fox and Hound which is right down the street, but it was SO packed that we couldn&#39;t find seats! So I found this place on Yelp and we wandered over. 

From the moment we walked in I knew we made the right choice! We were greeted at the door by someone who was taking bets for the game and asked if we wanted to participate. We were able to find a seat right away, and our server promptly came over to take our drink order. During the entire three hours that we were there our server did a great job of making sure we had drinks and food and anything else that we needed without being disruptive. This was impressive because this place was packed, but it&#39;s not the reason that the Snuggery gets four stars...

OMG The stuffed mushroom caps are TO DIE FOR! Ever since I came here on that rainy day last fall I have been craving them! They stuff their mushroom tops with cream cheese and herbs and then deep fry them. They are huge, and they are beyond amazing! The other food we had there was good to, but nothing compared to the amazingness of the stuffed mushrooms! 

The snuggery is a sports bar. It is not a healthy eating kind of place. It is not the kind of place where one goes to sip wine. It is loud. It is filled with sports fans watching the game. They have pub grub for food, and your standard beers for drinks. However, I do love me a sports bar ESPECIALLY when one of my favorite teams is on, and the Snuggery is exactly what I need!"

I decided, whatever that&#39;s fine I want to hang out w/ my friends.

I go to the bar next to order my second beer. SAME THING HAPPENS. I was immediatly ignored after I was handed my beer (same thing happened except this time I gave her a $5) OHK! Didn&#39;t know there was automatic gratuity! I asked for my change back and didn&#39;t give her a tip. I was really turned off. She could have turned on her acting skills and pretended like she forgot about my change. 

Anyway, the bathrrom has 2 stalls. Thank GOD there is no bathroom attendant. Oh God, those people are the worst. Do I really have to tip you?? And this place is pretty packed, which is a good thing but not really cause its basically like a square and the bar takes up like 75% of the place, leaving little space for customers. 

I had a bad experience getting a cab back to O&#39;Hare. The cab driver was pretending to hit on me. I asked him how much it would be and he&#39;s like ohhh I will give you a discount, blah blah you&#39;re so beautiful,blah blah PUKE!! He charged me $60 to get to O&#39;hare...Ohh a discount from $68. WOW! ANd he made me go to an ATM cause he said &#34;Oh if you use credit card I cant give u discount&#34;. 
I was in a mood and didn&#39;t feel like arguing over the fare. He was sketchy though. This will teach me a lesson to be extra careful if I have to take an expensive cab ride again. 

Place has no dance floor. People are young and lively. I dunno. Schaumberg bars don&#39;t really do it for me."
snuggery-schaumburg,Phil S.,asP08n8OwVhIg2hyff8DFQ,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,1,0,133,98,XvlrcQojX1IL0sujomeWTw,2.0,2012-03-09,"I tried to like this place since I can literally walk back home if I get drunk but alas, it was not meant to be.  I&#39;ve sat inside at a high top while watching a drunken office party get drunker with the shots the DJ was awarding for silly behavior, I&#39;ve sat at the bar and I&#39;ve sat outside on the patio. I&#39;d say trying to like this place 5 times is giving it way more than a fair chance.

Food: Crappy, frozen Sysco deep fried junk. Not that I expect much better from a bar but this place just looks nicer than that so I was disappointed. Everything from the fries, wonton wrapped mozzarella sticks (ew, do not try these), beer nuggets (even worse), burgers and their specialty.... broasted chicken. It all tastes mediocre to downright horrible. Even at bar food standards.

Drinks: They have specials but like a bloody mary with a sidecar of beer. I know, sounds weird but that&#39;s why I tried it. When I asked the waitress why I wasn&#39;t given my side of beer she told me that the bartenders always forget and if I really wanted it she would go back and force them to give her one. Really? *buzzer* NEXT! After that I just stuck to the cheapest draft beer they had. My wife said their margarita was way too sweet and just sucked in general.

Atmosphere: On weekend nights they have a DJ and he does a decent cheesy job of getting already drunk people to do more dumb drunk things so I guess that&#39;s entertaining. They have plenty of TV screens as well if you really need to watch the game. Personally, I&#39;m not one that really likes the douchebag crowd that comes in wearing a tank top, sagging jeans and a straight bill hat and you&#39;ll see plenty of this species come through here with their flava-flav chains hanging around their pasty white necks. If you don&#39;t like that either then definitely don&#39;t hang out here. 

One time while seated outside, the wait staff repeatedly ignored us for a good 15 mins. Thankfully I flagged down what looked like a manager (it was a busy night BTW) and he was very gracious and apologetic and bought our first round of drinks as compensation... or so we thought. When the check finally arrived, after we got sick of waiting eons for our next round of drinks, the waitress must&#39;ve counted the empty glasses on our table (they didn&#39;t even bother clearing those off, that&#39;s why the glasses were still there) to tally up our bill. I was so sick of waiting that I just paid the bill but didn&#39;t bother with a tip. In fact, I probably could&#39;ve just walked away and not even paid the bill and our waitress wouldn&#39;t have cared. That&#39;s how unconcerned they were with service.

Summary: Kinda like Fox and Hounds a couple blocks north except smaller. They have an outdoor area which is nice if the skeeters aren&#39;t out munching on your legs but other than that pretty much the same gimmick. Avoid unless you really must but between F&amp;H I&#39;d pick this place."

The &#34;dance floor&#34; is just moved over tables to create a space. Not a lot of room. They do allow women to dance on the bar though, get free shots (which they randomy give out for doing things - pretty cool). The DJ is some old guy ( at least every time I&#39;ve been there it&#39;s the same guy) who needs to just stop.

They do have a large outside area, which maybe a part of the hotel that sits behind the bar, but it&#39;s pretty much as big as the bar itself. I do like that area.

There is also a 7-11 like 50 feet away which rules when you run out of cigarettes. 

The service in the bar is okay. When it&#39;s crowded it gets laggy. I really only like this bar when I&#39;m drunk because otherwise there really isn&#39;t anything special. Like I said there is no actual dance floor and it&#39;s a small place."

I am a husky guy, and my best friend, her husband, and I decided to come out for just a beer or two. Living in Portage Park, it was a drive, but we knew someone there. Upon our first drink, we simply got two beers and a cocktail. The waitress said she needed to replenish a bottle to fill the drink, which was fine. I stood there for approximately ten minutes, being ignored by the bartender. Finally I walked back to the table, and gave up. The person who wanted the drink went up to the bar and eventually got her drink. We enjoyed a few cocktails, then drove the husband back home. 

When we arrived back to the bar (had to pick something up), we ordered a beer, two shots, and a cocktail. After ordering, we realized it was near closing. We drank our cocktails, and at 20 minutes until closing attempted to order one more. The same bartender advised us they were done serving, and walked away before we could say anything. Upon walking away, she went to pour 10+ shots for another party. When confronted she told us that they were only serving shots. We ordered 2 shots, and closed. The price was extremely high, and the service was, to say the least, degrading. The bartender was hanging out with her friends and closing, without even recognizing us. 

The bar closed, the manager made things right, without even knowing we had an issue.

What I might suggest to the management is, re-structure the weekly food and drink specials, have karaoke nights or something unique once a week, and seriously work on your customer service. 

Two stars. Did not order food, but I am sure I would have given 3 stars if that was the case."

When the check came the burger was listed as $7.99 and not $5.  She changed it after I asked her about it but it kind of seems in line with some of the shady billing practices that other people have talked about.  My Diet Coke was fine and was refilled at least.  I most likely would not go back."

Cliffs Notes: I wouldn&#39;t go here again. Ever.

The night I went, it happened to be raining(nearly pouring), so naturally I wore a jacket/zip-up hoodie type thing. I walked up to the door and the bouncers basically pushed me away and told me that nobody could have a hood on their clothing (mine was off my head since I was underneath an awning at this point). Uhm, okay...? I understand dress codes like having to wear shoes, shirts, pants, and hats that can&#39;t be on a certain way. That I understand. I could also understand not wearing the hood inside, after all, I have no reason to wear it, its not raining inside! Anyways, I walked back to my car, which happened to be in the far back lot past the 7-11 (the parking lot was packed). I finally got in, near soaked from walking in the rain without a jacket and hood, and I met up with some friends. They had a waitress that was serving them, but it took me over 45 minutes to get a drink. She was non-existent the majority of the night. So I finished my beer and was waiting to flag her down for another. Never saw her again the entire night. So I fought my way up to the bar and finally ordered another round. This place blows!"

The parking lot is tiny and also next to a hotel so parking it hard to come by. If you insist on coming here I recommend getting dropped off or just parking across the street. Inside the bar it was packed to say the least and the &#34;dance floor&#34; was pathetic. Since there is no room to move they let hot girls get up on the bar for free shots...WOOO how degrading and annoying.
I was determined not to return but after being bribed with free drinks I agreed to meet some friends there..only to confirm my dislike towards this bar. There was a loud siren that I don&#39;t remember from last time that seemed to go off every 5 minutes. When I asked someone why it went off they had no idea. Ugh. 
The only saving grace of this bar was the outdoor area which I didn&#39;t go to on my first visit. There are lots of tables and a few intimate areas with low couches which was nice. Bad part about the outdoor area was that there weren&#39;t any speakers so we only heard the dull bass of the music playing inside. Also there was NO service outside. The few waitresses that were out there just hung around their friends, picked up empties, brought their friends new drinks and continued this cycle the entire time I was outside."

Came here on a Saturday night and sat at a table. Make sure you don&#39;t wear a hat because the bouncer was a dick to my friend about his. he said he should have left it in the car when we took a cab. Anyways, the inside is a decent size. They have a lot of TVs - some were playing sports, some playing music videos for the songs the DJ was playing, and some randomly playing America&#39;s funniest home videos. They had waitresses serving the tables all night which was nice so you didn&#39;t have to fight the crowd at the bar. 

They have a nice outside area but it was a little chilly so I only got to see it from inside. 

The DJ played good music, a lot of dance and rap and hip hop, and eventually some over-served girls took it upon themselves to dance on the bar which was pretty entertaining. 

All in all a good time. Cool crowd and good drinks and prices. I would go back but would probably like to try somewhere else first."

I was here this past Friday night, I was the DD so I wasn&#39;t drinking. To get a bartender to refill a coke was next to impossible, and came with an eye roll and snotty attitude. I was tipping with each drink and bartend as well. A sober driver should be encourage by establishments not feel uncomfortable. They did last call at 2:30 am, served several drinks to several people and than immediately at 2:35 began blowing this loud, obnoxious horn continually. Didn&#39;t give anyone a chance to finish. Pushed people out. I get what it&#39;s like to want to get out early, but if you want people out of your establishment you change the hours of operation. Don&#39;t advertise you are open until 3am when if reality you want everyone out at 2:30 am. In this case they should have done last call at 2 to have everyone out at 2:35. I politely attempted to speak with 2 different men that were working the door along with several other annoyed guests. I was told to go to corporate about it, that it is policy to do that, and nothing can be done. That&#39;s great,  because I will. When I go out, drinking or not, I at least expect to be respected. I will not be going back here, and it&#39;s ashame because we all work close and this use to be out place to go.

The wings that were actually cooked close to crispy were wimpy and had hardly any meat.  Most of them were underdone and honestly turned my stomach, I left half of them with 1 bite taken out.

She put me on hold for a couple of minutes.  A different girl picked up the phone and I said I wanted place an order and she put me back on hold for a few more minutes.  When she picked up the phone again I told her that I wanted to order a dozen buffalo wings with bleu cheese.  She asked me what sauce and I said medium--but I asked if it had a kick to it.  She suggested the Captain Morgan Rum Sauce would probably be good if I like a little spice.  I said okay-to which she replied it would be about 30-45 minutes because they had a huge party they were cooking for.  After hesitating I agreed. When I got there I expected the place to be full but really there was one larger group at two tables and basically the whole place was maybe at 25% of their capacity and most of them were just drinking.    The host table was abandoned and most of the waitresses were engaged in conversation. After standing there like an idiot for a few minutes,  I went to the bar area and the bartender had someone bring the food out and she said the total was $10.  Apparently the food and bev tax is 20% because the wings were only $7.99 on the menu.  I don&#39;t care too much as I would have tipped them but I think they were just adding tips all along the way which just furthered added to my disgust.  It was an even $10 too-what are the chances!  To add fuel to the fire, I checked to make sure they put the sauce in the bag when I got to my car--and they put in a cup of ranch--which I hate.  Not to mention it was like the consistency of milk......the menu says it comes with bleu cheese....doesn&#39;t even mention ranch and I specifically requested bleu cheese.  I also did not like the sauce on the wings.  The chicken itself looked good--was meaty but the smell of the sauce and the taste was awful.  Some people probably like it--but it was not for me.  I maybe ate 3 of them.  My husband also complained that the smell was terrible.  I am sure I would have enjoyed them more with a more traditional sauce.  All in all--was not impressed.  The actual place looks nice--lots of TVs and good outdoor seating area but all in all a bad experience for a diner.  Maybe is a lot more enjoyable after a few beers."

The layout is way better than the last place (Kitchen Bar), it&#39;s way more open &amp; has a cozy feeling.  We were greeted by a team of girls, some were waitresses &amp; 1 was a hostess.  Considering it was opening week, the place was empty, which wasn&#39;t a bad thing but it was surprising.  Lots of tvs everywhere, including a small one at each booth, so it was perfect to watch the games that were on.  I had the snug burger, which was really good, a lot bigger than I expected but the price was reasonable &amp; it came with fresh cut fries which were tasty.  My buddy asked how the chicken fingers were &amp; the waitress was honest &amp; said shes had better, which I can appreciate, can&#39;t stand those that say something is fantastic &amp; it ends up being nasty.  Service was good enough, a little slow but I understand they&#39;re still getting used to things.  Our server was hoarse from working the later shift, but recommended to visit later at night when it&#39;s more crowded.  If she was hoarse just trying to take orders, I can imagine that trying to converse with your friends have a similar after effect.  Great place for lunch or dinner, but I&#39;ll wait til the hype dies down before coming in for a late night out."

Peking Express certainly delivered on the egg roll front.  These have got to be the biggest and best egg rolls I have ever had.  I honestly would come here just to eat egg rolls for a snack.  They were THAT delicious.

The rest though?  Eh.  The portions were GIGANTIC, I will give them that.  But the actual food was just okay.  It was kind of bland and the meat wasn&#39;t very good. The Mongolian Beef actually had some spice, which was a nice change since most Chinese places don&#39;t really spice it up and then it ends up tasting like every other beef dish on the menu, but it was also covered in tiny little crunchy noodles (?) which turned me off. The lo mein noodles didn&#39;t really taste like much of anything either and just seemed really plain. 

If you want HUGE portions at a decent price (and quick delivery!), this is your Chinese joint. &#39;Slong as your not picky about your food.  If you have discerning taste, stick with the appetizers and call it a day."

1. Portion size. We ordered two dinner specials, could have easily shared one. Also, our 13 month old loves chicken lo mein. We ordered a large. Even with my help we&#39;ll be eating that one for at least a week.
2. The egg rolls. They were delicious and HUGE. I probably could have just eaten that for dinner on its own.

Aside from that, the food was OK albeit slightly on the bland side. Delivery was quick which was a plus."

They have your normal Chinese menu, nothing extravagant or really different. But, it does the job.

I really liked their crab rangoons - just the right size, enough filling, and not too greasy. Same thing with the egg rolls - only they put peanut butter in them. Not a ton, it&#39;s not creamy or anything, but you can taste it, which I liked. That was a little different. My least favorite was the sesame chicken. It wasn&#39;t too sweet or drowning in sauce, which was good, but it smelled a little more like vinegar than others I have tried. It wasn&#39;t bad, just not my favorite. 

The service was fast and polite. The prices aren&#39;t bad either. I would order from them again."

Unsurprisingly, this was not it. Instead,  this can be summed up as americanized chinese food with very few vegetarian options. It&#39;s not like they have zero, but truly they do not have very many.

I ordered the mapo tofu lunch special and it was a pretty good amount of tofu but it was that nasty silken tofu which I personally do not prefer. I suppose this is standard for mapo tofu but usually it&#39;s at least a little thicker than that or at least doesn&#39;t have a quarter gallon of brown sauce.

 If you&#39;re not a vegetarian and just want standard Chinese food, this is probably simultaneously a cheap and decent option. Personally I will pass when I compare it to places like what I have experienced downtown and in Chinatown."

On a very cold day, I decided to grab something and bring it back to the office. Opened up my Yelp app to see what was right in the area of my office - Peking Express got good reviews and was about a mile away so I called and ordered Pork Egg Foo Yong.

The restaurant is small, as might be expected from a restaurant with &#34;express&#34; in the name. It was a little hard to find - it is in a strip mall, but the mall wraps around to the east, and it does not face the main street. In fact, there were a few small restaurants right next to each other on the side of the strip mall. (Others to try later on...)

The owners run the show. An older Chinese couple man the front. The counter is walk-up and there is a large menu, with pictures, above the counter. There were a half a dozen tables or so in a small area. They had my order ready when I arrived, but I saw someone having soup, so I opted to add a small Hot and Sour to my order. It took a few more minutes and I had a nice chat with the owners while I waited. When I paid, before I left, I said thank you in Mandarin (I don&#39;t speak Mandarin, just know how to say thank you), and they seemed genuinely delighted.

Now, the food. The Hot and Sour soup was just okay. It was hot when I got back to my office, but not spicy. There was very little pork and a lot of tofu. Lunch orders come with fried rice and an egg roll. The egg roll looked really good. Perhaps you need to eat it right out of the deep fryer, but mine was a little soggy. It did taste good though. The Egg Foo Yong was chock full of fresh vegetables. It was doused in the tradition thick brown sauce, but not overly so. The fried rice was good.

Like other reviewers, I was struck by the amount of food. There were two large pieces of Egg Foo Yong, and mounds of fried rice. Clearly, it is more than one meal and is a great value.

So, excluding my comments about the egg roll and hot and sour soup, this would rate four stars for the quality and quantify of food for the price. But, I&#39;m knocking one off for the previously mentioned two food items. As said above, I will be back to give it another go. I have to say, their lunch menu was fine, but the dinner menu looked much better. Looking forward to trying something off the dinner menu next time around."

Back then I had given this place 5 stars but the new owners need to learn a lot about customer service. The food taste a bit &#34;watered down&#34; and I did give this place a fair try over a couple of visits. The last time I was in there, I ordered a dish I knew full well was going to be packed into one giant container (way too much for lunch). I asked if they could split out the food over 2 containers to simplify my lunch and then later dinner portion as the food was a sloppy mess anyway. Was told that the cook was too busy (which was questionable at the time, a handful of people eating/waiting) and to do it myself and that they would include a second, to-go container for free (yay! for free!). When I had asked this favor from the previous owners, they  had no issue. I mean truly, how hard/time consuming is it to pour out the food into 2 containers versus one? yeah... not going back anytime soon.

These folks offer lunch specials with white or fried rice for about 6 bucks. There is a WIDE variety of dishes to choose from.  You can really eat on the cheap. My favorite part: due to the large portions, you can make a second lunch the next day out of one meal. Score.

I was surprised to find the fried rice on the lunch special was actually chicken fried rice. You don&#39;t find that anywhere. Good job, PE!!

Really upset that I went there based on yelp reviews alone. Yelp let me down and I&#39;m hoping I save someone else from the same fate.  Portion sizes were big, but tasteless.  Lobster chicken was shrimp and chicken.  Ridiculously over rated on yelp."

The BBQ pork appetizer is sweet, like we like it and while the combination fried rice is a tad bland, a squirt of soy sauce fixes it up perfectly.  They are happy to leave out anything  you don&#39;t want in a dish, too.  The Pot Stickers are filling and the sauce is to die for.  The Beef Sticks are really tender and meaty.

They owned two restaraunts in Chicago, and now have their customers coming from Chicago to their Elk Grove location.  That should tell you something, because a lot of people in the city refuse to travel to the burbs for anything, let alone Chinese food when there are so many other good places in Chicago. 

The quality of their food is exceptional.  Their meat is top quality (especially compared to a lot of other, more expensive places in the area), your meal arrives fast and fresh, and their lunch specials are one heck of a deal.  I have tried the sesame and orange chicken lunch specials so far, and let me tell you, the portions are HUGE.  If you want Chinese in this area, this is definitely the place to go."

Finally I had to say something, they had forgotten my soup and egg roll. Than on two occasions I ordered food for a vegetarian coworker,  who is a little picky.  I asked what is in the food and told them what to leave out, but than it would come with extra stuff the guy didn&#39;t say was in it. I decided I wasn&#39;t going to eat there any more till today.  I was gonna give them one more chance. I ordered our food. The guy on the phone told me what was in the vegetable low main. I told him leave out the onion. When I picked it up and brought my coworker his food there was onion and all kinds of other stuff he didn&#39;t like. So I called them back. They called me a lier, than finally agreed to replace it.

I ordered the Appetizer combo for 2, Mongolian Beef, Cantonese style Chicken Chow Mein, and Beef with Broccoli, and got a large order of combo Fried Rice for free.   Everything was excellent!  I tend to be very sensitive to spice, so my son who loves spicy food, ate most of the Mongolian beef, saying it was delicious. It was too spicy for me, but the flavor was superb.

The place is family run and they care about their customers. They know their regulars and the son always remembers my order along with it&#39;s special requests.
The nice thing about Chinese restaurants in the area are their cheap lunch specials. Peking Express expands that by offering dinner specials. A great value with a crap ton of food.
I only order one thing here and that is because they do it right. Don&#39;t believe me? Come sit during their lunch rush and see what people are ordering. Over half the orders are for their Mongolian Beef.
Their other food I can&#39;t speak for. I imagine it&#39;s good but I only get the Mongolian Beef because it is perfect.
5 Star review because they get everything right (for me). Awesome customer service (They&#39;ll talk your ear off while you wait for your order). Awesome Mongolian Beef which is my favorite Chinese dish. Awesome value."

As an entree I had the langostinos and at first was a little skeptical since for my opinion where a bit smaller than what I have tried before, but my skepticism disappeared when I tasted it, the flavor was amazing, perfect seasoning.

I had a carne Asada taco, chicken taco and al pastor, all Mexican style (they also make them gringo style with cheese lettuce and sour cream, but I&#39;m Mexican and we don&#39;t do all that) 

I ordered and the tacos were ready in less than 3 minutes (I thought was a bad sign at first) 

When I got home I found 3 smaller than i expected BUT tastier than I expected tacos! They were nice and hot too! Also included was a decent green salsa. 

The carne asada was juicy and tender (I was surprised usually it&#39;s tougher, this might have been a fresh batch of meat, the chicken taco comes in second place, and again the chicken was nice and hot and juicy! The least favorite was the al pastor but in all honestly I&#39;ve never really been a fan, but sometimes al pastor tacos can be surprisingly good.

I was super excited having had $1 tacos at their other location in Geneva. 

BUT WAIT!!!! They no longer do $1 tacos OR 1/2 priced margaritas. I almost stood up and left the moment the waitress informed us of this. We decided since we already had our free chips and salsa we would continue with the experience. We asked what specials were so good that they now took a front seat......$3 bottles of modelo and a $5 quesadilla dinner. 

Ordered a diet coke and the quesadilla dinner with carne asada. The &#34;quesadillas&#34; were flour tortillas with a bunch of cheese and steak that resembled a really cheesy taco. The flavor was ok, too much cheese, the best part of the dinner was the salsa that comes with the chips. 

All sorts of disappointed, this was the first and will be the last visit to El Tesoro unless they bring back specials that entice me (see pic below of new specials)."

I&#39;ve been coming here for lunch a few times already and I&#39;m always so full after I come out the restaurant. They start you off with chips and salsa. And the salsa is pretty darn spicy (for me at least). They give generous portions of chips. You&#39;re almost full before you reach your actual meal! Then, you see that your order always comes out in a huge platter and you realize you have to take most of it back to go.

I really like the combination meals with a bit of everything. This time I got the combination platter with tostada, tamale, and taco and it was decent. I didn&#39;t like the tostada as much because it seemed to similar to a regular tortilla chip with a little bit of beans, lettuce, and tomatos on top. However, the taco came with a huge lump of meat and tamales are always good. Those 3 on top of my favorite rice and beans. My friend ordered the steak fajitas and she couldn&#39;t finish her meal at all. Loads of delicious steak and tortilla.

Deco here is really cool. Aquatic, 70s, Latin. Don&#39;t know how to describe it. They have a neat tank with Nemo and Dory swimming along!

She had mentioned &#34;El Tesoro&#34; so that&#39;s where we went. We walked in and had gotten a seat. The time was around 5pm or so, on a Saturday. It was too busy, from what I recall there may have been about 4 other tables and 2 waitresses. 

Our waitress was Lizette. We had ordered a menudo, 2 steak tacos, and a milanesa torta. Now if you like Mexican food like me, you&#39;ll know some places serve smaller tacos than others due to them making their own tortillas. Before ordering my count of tacos, I had asked Lizette if the tacos were on a normal size tortilla or if they were the smaller ones. Lizette said that they were normal sized tacos. And that was the reason I ordered 2 tacos. I remember getting a text at the time she took our order, 5:21pm it read. By the time 5:50pm comes around I had asked how long it would be before the food came. She had told me that the food should be coming out next but said it with a facial expression that seemed agitated. Another 5-10 minutes go by and food is here, first thing I notice.... The tacos were tiny. I didn&#39;t bother saying anything just because my girlfriend and I were so hungry. We started eating and my steak tacos didn&#39;t have much flavor, little bland and their steak didn&#39;t taste too appetizing. The next thing I noticed was how huge/thick the bread was on my gf&#39;s torta. Tortas should have nice thin bread. My girlfriend took a bite and mentioned that the bread was old. 

I called Lizette over and explained to her that I wanted to order 2 steak tacos for my girlfriend because the bread was old on the torta and she didn&#39;t want to eat it. I was very shocked by what she said, which is why I remember it word for word. Lizette says, &#34;okay, I can get you those two tacos, but I cannot take this torta off your check because there is nothing with it.&#34; At this point I was very offended by what she had told me. I had told her that all I asked for were an order of 2 tacos and I never mentioned anything about a refund. If she took it that way, maybe she knew there was something wrong with our food? I had asked if she could get her manager. 

I explained to the manager what happened and that. He apologized for what had happened and said that I didn&#39;t have to pay for anything since I was planning on leaving due to my agitation with our waitress, Lizette. I asked what our waitresses name was, since there were no name tags. He replied, &#34;Lizette&#34; but had a smirk on his face. Confused by his facial expression, I called our waitress by her name, &#34;Lizette&#34; but she didn&#39;t reply. I went up to her and asked if I may have her name and she said that I didn&#39;t need her name and she wasn&#39;t going to give it to me. I turned around, told the manager about her denying to provide her name and he said he would handle it.

 I had kept walking out to never return to this place. Vey disappointed in this establishment and the waitresses attitude and rudeness to talk back to a customer like she did. Other customers were around and she wasn&#39;t presenting herself professionally in front of them. My girlfriend and I really love Mexican food, but this will be one place I will recommend to all my friends, especially the ones in the area to avoid. El Famous off Bloomingdale is much tastier and normal service. 

There is no reason 2 tacos, 1 menudo and a torta should take 30-40 minutes when there was only one table ordering in front of us. 

**I would suggest you AVOID this place and Yelp something else"

We almost left just because of that.  But we thought the place looked authentic and smelled good, but we were so very very wrong.  The food was inedible.  I chose a burrito and my husband got steak tacos.  Neither of us finished our dinners.  Mine tasted horrible and I stopped eating immediately because I was afraid I was going to get food poisoning.  My husband thought the same thing.  I would steer clear of this place."

We dug that the chips came out nice and hot. The salsa had a kick. We would have ordered a refill were it not the $1.50 for charge (stated in fine print at the bottom of the menu).

He got the Tuesday special: $5 taco plate with steak. I got the garlic shrimp dish w/ rice and guac ($12). 

He enjoyed his, whereas mine was super disappointing - frozen little shrimp swimming in a thin red sauce (oily at the edges, and it covered the whole plate). It was exceptionally bland and I couldn&#39;t detect any spices nor garlic. 

Meh. Not worth it. The $5 special would have been a much better option. 

Service was also lacking - we waited for a while for the check, and then our server to come back and check us out. We ended having to flag down a different guy to get our bill paid.

So let&#39;s begin....I have been busy all day... My mother was famished and she had a taste for tacos. So unfortunately I decided to go to this place since we were passing by it on our way to another Mexican joint, which we should have gone to. The only reason I stopped was because I saw a sign that read &#34;$1.50 tacos.&#34; We went in, got seated. Waited 8 minutes for someone to come and get our drink order. Another 10 minutes to actually receive them. Didn&#39;t even bring any water, which my 4 year old, which was practically begging for, because she was so thirsty! The guy was about to walk away without even asking if we were ready to order, I stopped him and let him know that wanted to order. He said, &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll be right back.&#34; So he didn&#39;t come back for another few minutes. Took our orders, my mother started asking him questions about the tacos, and he had an attitude about it! REALLY?! So she ends up ordering the crispy shell tacos with 3 different meats in each one. Oh yeah BTW...she wanted a combo with the rice and the beans, but they were only able to give her the combo with one type of meat! I have never heard of that in my life! I ordered tacos as well and got a combo kids meal for my daughter that included a quesadilla and a taco with beans and rice....or so I thought! When they brought out our food, My daughter&#39;s quesadilla looked like a disgusting version of an enchilada! It was basically, soggy from the tomato sauce and greasy from all the cheese the put on it. SO GROSS! My order was probably the only one that was edible. My mother&#39;s order on the other hand was just terrible! Her &#34;crispy&#34; shells were chewy and stale. She called over the waitress at that point, and let her know what was wrong with the food. All she could respond was, &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; So I let it go and told my mother to order something else, that it was nothing big and that I would take the tacos home and make them edible. I can make better food than this at home, I&#39;m Hispanic, and I still don&#39;t understand why I just didn&#39;t go home and make them myself! So she did, by the time that the food got to the table she had already filled up on chips and salsa! The waitress then comes by to drop off the check, I figured it was going to be about $30 to $35. Nope it ends up being $45! I check out what they charged us for and those $1.50 tacos turned out to be $2.50 instead, oh but that was only for the hard shell. I thought they had made a simple mistake but I asked the waitress and she said that, &#34;$1.50 only applied to the tortilla tacos.&#34; I was very confused! So we went up to the &#34;Manager&#34; and asked him why he was charging that price for my mother&#39;s taco&#39;s when the signs all over the place say $1.50 tacos! There were no exclusions on any of the signs, so he then proceeded to say, &#34;what signs?&#34; I said the all the ones that say $1.50 tacos! he said, &#34;that is just the way it is.&#34; I go ahead and let him know that I wasn&#39;t going to pay for his soggy disgusting tacos and he says,&#34; you pay for what you order, I can&#39;t do anything about it. That&#39;s just the way they are with the hot meat that is inside of them.&#34; I said,&#34; your joking right? so it took from the kitchen to the table for them to get that way? The ones at taco bell are better than these.&#34; He didn&#39;t know what to answer, so I paid and here I am now! Never will I ever go back there in my life! Most disgusting place I have been to so far. It only makes me cringe to think how their kitchen and products are! Unbelievable.... please, if you love your body and want amazing food, you better off going to Taco Bell!"

First off, Yelpers, don&#39;t be afraid to stop in despite what some may describe as the restaurant&#39;s sketchy surroundings.  The only scary thing about this place is the 1980s interior, decorated in a somewhat confusing &#34;under the sea&#34; motif.  

All kidding aside, El Tesoro has plenty of specials throughout the week, and we&#39;ve been coming here lately for the Monday $5 taco meal deal.  For $5, you get three tacos with rice and beans.  The tacos are delicious.  Though the tortillas are a tad on the small side, El Tesoro packs in lots of meat!  I like to keep it simple: carne asada served Mexican style with onions, cilantro, and cheese.  They also bring out a generous helping of chips and salsa, though on one occasion the salsa was extremely hot.  No worries, you can simply ask them to bring out a milder version. 

It&#39;s typically not busy so there&#39;s no need to worry about a wait.  The staff is also friendly.  We plan on stopping in on a Wednesday soon so we can check out the margarita special."

I&#39;ve passed it before and always wanted to stop, and I finally had a golden opportunity.  I parked right next to a sign that advertised a big burrito and pop and headed in. Somewhat to my surprise I found that this was a sit down and be waited on restaurant rather than an order at a counter and wait for your food place. I decided to thoroughly investigate the menu before ordering and I&#39;m glad I did. 

After perusing the menu from front to back I discovered that they have a hot dog here at El Tesoro. Being the hot dog critic I naturally couldn&#39;t pass up this opportunity to try the hot dog here and immediately made this my selection for dinner. Before the hot dog was brought out to me I was given chips and salsa to try out. I immediately dug in to the chips and salsa and found the chips to be a little harder than what I&#39;m used to. The strength of these chips combined with the fact that when I visited this location I was only a week or so past having had a tooth removed led me to only try a few clips as quite frankly I didn&#39;t want to exert the bite force necessary to consume these with a still healing mouth. 

After a few minutes my hot dog was brought out to me with frys. The hot dog here was interesting, at first glance it appeared to simply be a jumbo frank on a regular bun that has a thicker amount of bread than most. However, as I looked closer I discovered that this hot dog wasn&#39;t plain at all. No sir, this hot dog had mayonnaise on it. I&#39;ve never seen mayonnaise on a hot dog from a restaurant before. Maybe this is some sort of regional variation found in Mexico. I took a bite and to my dismay this hot dog wasn&#39;t that great. The sausage used here was a thick skinless jumbo sausage that wasn&#39;t particularly flavorful. I&#39;d compare it to a grocery store ballpark frank. The bun was on the thick side and the mayonnaise didn&#39;t compliment it well. That&#39;s what I get for trying a hot dog at a Mexican restaurant.

I also tried some of the fries, these were crinkle cut fries that were like the sausage, the bun and even the chips thicker than what I&#39;m used to seeing. On the downside these were a bit bland. Soft insides, but not particularly salty or flavorful. 

Perhaps I&#39;m loco in the cabeza for ordering with the hot dog at a Mexican restaurant. But I guess it begs the question of &#34;Why are they serving it&#34;? And if the hot dog critic doesn&#39;t order it, who will?

 Service here was friendly, the place has a very dark 1980s vibe on the inside. I plan to stop again in the future and try some actual Mexican food here, but for now I&#39;m going to give it two stars based on my hot dog and fries experience."

It IS a total hole-in-the-wall! The owners obviously try to make it very colorful and bright. The walls are bright turquoise and sponged with a darker color. There are pinatas and plastic fish hanging from the wall and ceilings and this odd garish neon light bar that lines the edge of the ceilings. The tables/booths are old and worn as are the plates and silverware. Nothing matches. But that&#39;s OK in my book--as I was taught by mums, Looks can be deceiving! 

Each table gets a basket of crunchy tortilla chips and a tasty spicy salsa verde. It&#39;s spicy--no question--but has a good flavor. The menu lists the usual tacos, enchiladas and fajitas combination platters, but also lists different seafood and steak options. A nice change from some of the other Mexican restaurants in the area. I saw another patron&#39;s seafood ceviche and it looked wonderful! 

Everything was delicious. The hubs and I shared our entrees--the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and the Platillo Azteca (grilled strips of steak with onions and green pepper) Both entrees came with rice and refried beans. The steak was very tender and juicy but a little on the bland side by itself. But adding grilled onions and peppers gave it some great flavor and it was hard for me to make sure the hubs got an equal share as I wanted it all for myself. The enchiladas were tasty as well--great flavors of salsa verde, shredded chicken and topped with queso blanco. 

My mango margarita was delicious and refreshing--I needed it after munching on the chips and spicy salsa. It also came with a sugar coated rim which was a nice touch. Friendly attentive service, a little on the slow side but it was nice not to be rushed. There are margarita specials on Wednesday and half-price enchilada dinners on Friday."

The chips are warm, you have to control yourself not to fill up on them.  The guacamole is excellent.
I got the special which was steak a la mexicana, for 6.99!  The morsels of meat were very tender, but not overcooked.  Man it was spicy.  They have Jamaica, horchata, and some mango drink.  Wife got the flautas.

The evening started out ok, the service was mediocre at best; taking approximately 15 minutes for anyone to come by the table to drop off chips and salsa and to see if we wanted drinks.  Additionally, each subsequent order took forever because our waitress was less than attentive.

Between 8 pm and 9:30 pm we ordered 3 pitchers of Margaritas, an order of guacamole and pico de gallo.  

At approximately 9:40 pm our waitress dropped off our check.  We spent a few minutes splitting the bill when the owner came over (approximately 9:45) to our table and told us they were closing and we needed to pay the bill and leave.  We were paying the bill with my credit card, which was out and ready to be swiped.  I excused myself to use the restroom.  

Upon returning to our table, approximately 9:50 pm, I saw the owner again standing at our table having words with my friends; stating that we needed to leave.  My friends were explaining that they were waiting for me to return from the restroom since it was my credit card.  He said that he told us several times we needed to go.  Words were exchanged and he told someone to call the police on us.

My friends proceeded to go outside while I paid the bill.  
When I got outside, after paying the bill, it wasn&#39;t even 10 pm; that&#39;t when the restaurant closes.

I ask you...is that any way to treat your paying customers???  It wasn&#39;t as if we were loud and obnoxious.  We were having a nice time with good company and conversation.

The selection is vast, the food delicious, the staff friendly, and the prices--incomparable.  The ambiance is kitschy--one feels as though one is submerged in an underwater playground, but so what--it&#39;s not elegant, but fun dining.  There is a juke box that plays mainly Mexican songs, so have a margarita or three and relax.  

Many Mexicans dine here, as there is at least three tables of friends or families on hand whenever I have eaten there. When the natives eat at an establishment that serves their food, that is a is not only an indicator that what the place serves is authentic, but good and the best kind of unobtrusive advertising.  

My favorites:  the steak tacos, chicken fajitas, and huevos rancheros.  Tasty!  Why didn&#39;t I give the place 4 stars?  The bathroom stalls barely let you get a leg in.  Otherwise, try them if you want the best Mex in town!"

I never used to really eat them but I had friends who went weekly for Wednesdays Dollar Tacos.  I tried steak, chicken, and chorizo tacos, all american style (cheese tomato lettuce) and got french fries on the side, assuming I&#39;d only think the tacos were okay as I usually had in the past.  Boy was I wrong.  Over a hundred Wednesdays later and more tacos than I care to think about, this is my number one taco place by far.  The steak tacos (american AND mexican style, together, which means lettuce cheese tomato onion and cilantro) are great, the fries (which I stopped getting after a while to get more tacos, and to maybe be teased a little less about getting fries at a taco place) are great too.  Had a margarita once or twice (half off on Wednesdays) and if margaritas are up your alley, you&#39;ll have to check those out.  Mexican bottled coke is served here, which is always a treat.  Homemade chips and salsa are free with your meal.  I consider myself somewhat of a salsa connoisseur, trying new ones all the time.  Nothing will beat the hot salsa here (and don&#39;t bother with the mild, it&#39;s like cold tomato soup).  FYI drinks are not free refills, so watch how much of your drink you&#39;re chugging if the salsa is too hot for you.  FYI occasionally these tacos can be hit or miss, I&#39;ve had a few that weren&#39;t that great, but if that happens give them another shot.  Also if you&#39;re in a rush the staff can be slow at times, so maybe just get your order to go then.  Just don&#39;t forget to get salsa to go!  I&#39;m constantly on the lookout for new taco places to try, and they get put somewhere in my rankings, but they never take over my #1 spot.  Is it a matter of having a soft spot for my first love, or is that the steak tacos are that good?  You&#39;ll have to be the judge."

I was meeting my sister and niece out in burbs and they wanted mexican so I yelped local joints and saw favorable reviews. Ordered a few sopes as bonitas before we ordered entrees to see quality of product before we settled on entrees. Horrrible! I was about to order Tampeiqueno when my asada sope came as a varied tempature greasy fatty chewy mess. We ruled out the rest of meal as not too costly but failing to deliver value for price. Margaritas and drinks little pricey for glenghetto heights. 8pm on a Saturday a joint should be hopping. Not here. Two other tables. The server as sweet and nice as she was didn&#39;t speak english very well. I&#39;m fluent in spanish and that made it easy but when other members of party were asking simple questions it turned into a UN sesssion of translation. Fine for me but aggravating to rest of party.

Low quailty, not too expensive but not value for dollar. Maybe I hit it on a wrong day and other reviewers are right but as a life long professional chef I think it kinda sucked"

This could be the best Mexican restaurant since Fernando&#39;s. he service is quick and attentive as well. I ordered American style hard shell tacos, a steak burrito, and a chimichanga that was split amongst several co-workers. It was all great...including the chips and salsa.

Good chips and salsa, great $1 tacos and really good (half price) Margaritas. Those mango Margaritas are too good, and they don&#39;t short you on the tequila.  

We&#39;ve been there when the place is fairly empty and when it&#39;s packed.  Haven&#39;t had any problems with their service.  Food is fast and fresh.

Just a quick point, they&#39;re not too keen on serving you a pitcher of Margaritas unless they know someone else is going to help you drink.  =)"

Unfortunately, the best thing i had was the diet coke. First, they charged us extra for an additional order of nacho chips. The guacamole dip was unsalted and bland. I ordered a combination platter which included skirt steak and chicken breast. Both were unspectacular and unseasoned. Being of mexican descent i&#39;ve had more than my fair share of latin food. This is your unequivocal hole in the wall restaurant in the middle of a cheesy strip mall  The best part of the decor was the life size tecate girl poster. The owner must think he is living in the age of Aquarius.  You will understand once you walk in and bump into the fish tank.  The kicker was that our waitress decided to eat a bowl of menudo in the booth across from ours. I guess she had to work through lunch. First and last x going here."

I love the authentic feel I get when I walk in. Servers are always friendly and make us feel welcome even when we are the only white people in the place. We love the chips and the tacos best. My favorite is the carna asada american style tacos. They make my belly sing love songs. I&#39;m giving a 4 star instead of 5 is because of the margaritas. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re great. I heart the food and the experience. I&#39;ll definitely indulge in a margarita but lets say mediocre at best.

They made my shrimp insanely disguistingly hot this time and refused to re-cook them. I said they were not edible and I eat habanero all the time so obviously something was terribly wrong with the camarones a la diabla. I reasoned with the staff (he said he was the owner&#39;s nephew) but no go. I told him I was a repeat customer and I always ate the same dish but this time it wasn&#39;t cooked right. My friend ordered the same thing and could not eat it either. The rude ignorant man said that he didn&#39;t care, the food was supposed to be that way, and he was going to charge me because when you order something you have to pay for it. Despite his ignorance I tried to keep reasoning because I am not a mean person.
I told him that I refused to pay for the shrimp and I would never come back.
The waitress avoided us she was extremely rude even ignored me when I was trying to order, she never brought us our drinks and was standing around talking the whole time with her back turned to us. I was dying from eating this food and she never brought me water.  She took our shrimp to the back and scraped the sauce off of it then said that it wasn&#39;t her problem anymore.
I&#39;d give this place NEGATIVE STARS if I could!!!!!!!!!!!
As another yelper put it, is this any way to treat your paying customers!? 
screw you"

AND because most places within this price range tend to serve greasy, fatty meats. Blech! I am a fan of El Tesoro&#39;s cooking and menu. I usually get the same few things and mostly always a torta de milanesa-delicioso! I will say that I&#39;m disappointed in their chile rellenos because the last two times I ordered one, the cheese was literally a block, barely melted. I learned my lesson and stick to what has always satisfied me-tortas, tacos, gorditas."

awesome tacos...and one of the best strawberry frozen margaritas I&#39;ve ever had. You cannot taste the alcohol. Super inexpensive (especially on the deal days!) for quality food.
The only annoying thing is, the service can be kind of slow...and there is a t.v. that plays sports (loud) which I&#39;m not really a fan of.

The booth was dirty with food particles falling out of the menu, the light fixtures needed bulbs and had so much dust on them that I was worried the dust would fall on the food, the walls needed washing and there were spitballs on the dolphin painting above us. Yuck. Food is high priced for the quality. Ordered queso fondito, which (for $5.95) was a sparce plate of melted cheese with some chorizo sprinkled on top. I know that queso cheese is expensive, but don&#39;t insult me with that price. Also had the chicken tacos and hope I&#39;m not seeing the dr. tomorrow because of them. The worst, soggiest tacos (and possibly undercooked)! Tried the steak tacos and found them to be lacking in seasoning and most of the meat was burnt. Service was sooooo ss-ll-ooooo-www!!! Napkins were non-existant, extra nachos took 45 mins. to arrive, just a horrible dinner experience. Reporting them to DuPage Co. Health Department in the morning.

We got a combo with a bit of everything (except snow crab and lobster) so we ended up having a lot of shrimp. Our server suggested both butter and Cajun for sauce. 

We put on our bibs, washed our hands and let the feastin&#39; begin! 

The food was served in a bag where you could toss it around in to douse it in all the flavor. We went for mild and asked for extra chili on the side. The crustaceans were fresh and the taste was spot on. The suggested sauce mixture complemented the protein perfectly. 

I got lost in the delectable experience and didn&#39;t utter many words at the table until my last piece of shrimp made its departure from the bag. 

The food was fresh, tasty, perfectly cooked, and eating with your hands was exceptionally fun despite the pile of napkins and the mess we made. 

A+ for food and the experience!"

We had great potato wedges to start along with some less than thrilling calamari. She likes to mix all three flavors in the bag of shrimp. I&#39;ve learned this is a great way to enjoy this meal. We completely
Over ordered and had way too many leftovers. 

Since then, I&#39;ve convinced the non-seafood loving husband that the Crazy Crab should be one of his favorite places. And now it is!  Funny how that happened...lol!  We&#39;ve tried the garlic noodles - spaghetti with garlic and oil. Oh and I convinced him to order the beignets one night too. We have stuck with mixing all three sauces and we are just starting to scale back on the spice. It can get a little crazy in your mouth if you&#39;re not careful!  We always add a potato or two to the bag to help change up the feeling that you&#39;re eating too many shrimp in one sitting. And he likes to add a bit of sausage too. It&#39;s all very tasty. My only real wish would be for something to grab the shrimp from the bag with besides a short plastic fork. I always seem to end up with sauce halfway up my arm!"

I&#39;m done with these businesses who feel like they are doing the consumer a favor when in reality we pay their bills!

Went in after reading reviews on here. Get in everything was great until I came back from my car and saw a sign on the door that said &#34;Deals&#34; Monday&#39;s- Buy two pounds get 1 pound free!!!! Well today must be my lucky day because I bought two pounds, but why didn&#39;t she say anything? When I asked oh that&#39;s dine in only, I said ok. But the sign on the door doesn&#39;t say that so I called back. The owner gets angry and tells me there&#39;s no sign on the door and he&#39;s not gonna argue. Instead of getting my money back which is what I do now when I get rude service. I&#39;ll just come on here and tell you guys about it. Haven&#39;t tried the food yet. Really doesn&#39;t matter cause I make this stuff at home all the time and it&#39;s taste just as good. Today I was just being lazy. Not going back."
crazy-crab-streamwood,Nancy L.,yzWz3gHekKx_SLcrvR_VfA,"Addison, IL",1,1,1,153,27,iC-CEZM3in0GCpMPyL0v0w,4.0,2016-08-06,"Crazy crab was finger licking good.  Literally.  The combo of 3 sauces, the fresh and perfectly steamed shell fish...you can&#39;t help but want to lick your fingers and since this is the best (&amp; most likely only) way to eat this delectable seafood...you&#39;ll be licking yours too.

First things first.  Whatever seafood you choose, go the 3 way on sauce.  Don&#39;t settle for one, makes a huge difference and packs way more flavor.

Ordered 1lb each: Deveined headless shrimp, mussels and clams drenched in 3 way sauce: (highly recommend) Crazy Cajun, Lemon pepper &amp; Garlic butter.  Its a symphony of flavors. I chose med heat and probably could&#39;ve  went &#39;crazier&#39;...spicy but not overbearing.

Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. Nothing was over cooked or dry.  Shrimp was delicious. Mussels were meaty - my two favorites and I&#39;d totally order this again. Clams were little neck and not as impressive as mussels but still good. Fried oysters were too heavily floured for me.  I like to taste more oyster and less breading, otherwise oysters were fresh and also meaty. Cajun onion rings had a nice spice and mild kick.  I could taste paprika, cayenne and cumin.  

Garlic noodles were no biggie and a pass next time.  Not flavorful.  Just noodles with oil/butter and some garlic. It needed more sauce, spice.  I don&#39;t know if they use their garlic butter sauce on this, but these noodles would be SO much better if they used all three sauces...huge difference in taste going the 3 way...have I mentioned 3 way?

We took our order to go and they did a phenomenal job wrapping up our seafood. Double bagged in plastic, tied and placed in container.  I purposely let this sit for a bit before diving in so our seafood could soak up more of the yummy juices. Interior is newer, clean and casual.  Server was super friendly.  

I&#39;m telling you, I could dip bread in this stuff, or add pasta to it .  I&#39;ll admit it is a little oily, but what do you expect? The oil didn&#39;t overpower all the other great flavors.  If you&#39;re sharing, 1 lb is enough for two or 3 to sample while trying other seafood.  They don&#39;t do 1/2 lbs fyi.

Our order was around $65.  No it isn&#39;t cheap, but the quality is present and they get their fish locally as well as from New Orleans.  Personally, I think its worth it and they have a great seafood selection - some of which is not listed on their website / menu.
Crazy pots filled with shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams, Alaskan snow crabs, corn, potatoes, and sausage.

They have new offerings and specials, check out their Facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/search/980522441982912/local_search?surface=tyah

If you like them on Facebook currently they are offering a free lb of crawfish. They also had  fresh oysters for a limited time &amp; dammit I missed it!"

We ordered Crawfish and the headless deveined shrimp by the pound, with all three seasonings mixed together, (Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Butter) at the &#34;Calm&#34; spice level. The crawfish bag was a little saltier than the shrimp bag, but equally as tasty. It was all cooked perfectly and We can&#39;t wait to go again!!!

We also ordered the Cajun Fries, which are big enough to share between two people with big appetites, but they ended up actually being steak fries with some Cajun seasoning sprinkled on. (I don&#39;t want to compare, but we had previously eaten at the Angry Crab in the city and they have thinner Cajun fries, so we weren&#39;t expecting steak fries, but they were still yummy!) They were $4.50 I believe, which is in line with other similar places.

My husband ordered the beignets and they come as a 4 piece covered with powdered sugar. He said they weren&#39;t exactly authentic tasting, but they sure were delicious. He said he&#39;d order them again next time.

They have other add-ons like corn, sausage, potatoes, and rice, which are inexpensive.

One unique side item we noticed was Garlic noodles, which seem to be very popular, but I&#39;m allergic to wheat, so I of course wasn&#39;t able to try them. (Maybe I can suggest a Gluten-Free version for those of us who suffer with Celiac Disease and Wheat allergies.)

They also have calamari, which is popular. Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, regular fries, fried seafood baskets, other food items, bottled beer, and soft drinks.

Overall, this place was quite the surprise because the food was excellent, not to mention, the service was actually the BEST SERVICE we&#39;ve EVER had after 2.5 years of living in the Chicago area. We brought our 6 month old baby and we had a great time. Mike was our server, and he anticipated our every move &amp; brought the things we needed without even having to ask us. It was like he read our minds and knew what we needed before we even realized it ourselves! Impeccable service! Mike gave us great recommendations, taught us how to eat crawfish successfully, and gave excellent follow up service. Thank you Mike!!! We will be back and we hope you&#39;ll be our server again next time!"

Crazy crab did not disappoint.  I split the crazy pot for $40 with a friend.  I also checked in on yelp to get 1 pound of crawfish for free.

Do the mix of all three flavors.  If you like spicy then get the insane level.  The insane level was spicy but not too spicy where you can&#39;t enjoy it.

Also tried the fried oysters which were okay but I probably wouldn&#39;t order them next time.  Cajun fries were also good."

My friend and I came here for dinner and ordered the special (it&#39;s not on the menu). It&#39;s not a fancy place - don&#39;t wear nice clothes, fine jewelry, slap a bib on and dig in. They even have a hand washing station, because you are gonna get dirty! That&#39;s what I like.

They sell the seafood by the half pound - everything from whole lobster, crab legs, head on shrimp, head off shrimp, mussels, clams, and crayfish. You can customize your dish the way you like it with the spices, sauces, and hotness (as in spicy). The food comes out relatively quickly, and it&#39;s to die for! So good. The spice is just right. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Crayfish is now my new favorite thing thanks to this place!

They don&#39;t have an amazing drink menu, some bottled beers, but that&#39;s about all you need. or the quality and amount of food, the prices aren&#39;t bad. I loved it!"

I ordered one each of the corn, potato and sausage. The sausage didn&#39;t arrive in my bag, I had to remind our server I ordered it (but he brought me 2 for the wait). The potato was so well done, it  just fell apart in pieces. Loved the lemon butter and the Cajun we ordered medium, but was more like mild. The price for Devine shrimp was the same as headless so why not make it easier on yourself. 

Really like the 4 handwashing stations with plenty of soap and towels since the bathrooms are single person rooms. Makes it nice that you don&#39;t have to wait to wash your hands. We will definitely be back but early in the evening. Went around 5:30 on a Wednesday and no wait for a table. Don&#39;t wear anything you wouldn&#39;t want to risk getting food stains on!

In the Midwest, it was difficult to find something comparable to Hot &amp; Juicy and every one place we tried, we always compared the flavors to it. My husband and I have gone to Angry Crab, Boiling Crab, Low Country&#39;s, and Asian Cajun. Out of all the places, I&#39;d say this was in my bottom 2. 

Service was great and it was nice to get a free lb of crawfish when checking into Yelp, but I will not be returning here as flavors were not in my best interest. It was very oily and the insane spice level wasn&#39;t even spicy, at least to us. 

I will give it to them regarding the fried oysters as they even hooked it up with more than usual. It&#39;s just unfortunate everything else we looked for comparing flavors to hot &amp; Juicy was lacked."

I could have eaten another whole pound but that was plenty of food for a family with 2 adults and 2 little kids.

The service is as good as it gets. Probably the best that I&#39;ve experienced from Angry Crab, Low Country,  Asian Cajun, and The Boiler. Everyone checks on you regularly and they even put your bib on which caught me by surprise because I was not expecting that haha. 

We ordered 1 lb of whole shrimp with All 3 sauces and getting crazy (spice level). The spice level was perfect and not too buttery compared to the other seafood boil places. I was surprised that they&#39;ve an option of headless deveined shrimp. That was something new that I&#39;ve never seen offered. We also got a deal which is 2-3 lbs worth of seafood for $40. It included whole shrimp, crawfish, mussels, calms, snow crab legs, 2 potatoes, 2 corns, and 2 sausage. GREAT DEAL! We couldn&#39;t finish it! 

I&#39;m upset that I haven&#39;t tried any of the sides when I came in. The garlic noodles are a crowd favorite that I&#39;ve heard from the server. I hear that they&#39;re also coming up with different sides which is awesome. I&#39;m pretty big with seafood boil places so I&#39;m still trying to find one with great  service, great spice/seasoning level, and great sides. Right now, Crazy crab owns the service and spice/seasoning level. 

I would def come back here again and it&#39;s SOO close! Awesome place with a great staff! The only thing that I would suggest is having paper towels already at the table. At Crazy Crab, you have to ask for the paper towels."

We normally go to Angry Crab (Chicago) or Hot N Juicy (Las Vegas) for this type of food but once we heard about this place we wanted to try it out. 

I honestly can say I like this place better than Angry Crab. I tried the headless and devained shrimp with the cajun and garlic butter flavoring at the &#34;I luv crazy&#34; spice level. I normally don&#39;t eat too spicy but this was great! 

Service was alright. There was not really much of an explanation of how the menu worked so we didn&#39;t know we could mix all three flavors together when we first ordered. Took a bit to get all things settled and make sure we had everything because we constantly had to keep asking for more after our waiter walked away. At one point, we didn&#39;t want to bother anymore because we wanted to enjoy our food more than being clean. (Asking for a bib or gloves)

Music selection was phenomenal. I must say the overall environment was great."

For those of you familiar, this place is like Boiling Crab from the LA area.

You order food by the pound and they boil it in stock of sorts that adds great flavor then they put it in a bag and give it to you.  You leave the shells on the table and make a mess of your hands as you eat. If you like seafood and don&#39;t mind getting messy, go for it.

Sauce choices: Cajun, Lemon, Garlic (non are spicy by default you choose that in the second step of ordering).

Spiciness: Choose from the equivalents of Mild, Medium, Spicy, Extra Spicy. We went with the medium and you got some spiciness without overwhelming the flavor. If you like spicy food go spicy or extra.

Calamari - tender rings of calamari in a batter that is similar to onion rings.  They taste good but even better if you dip it into the sauce.

Clams - great explosions of flavor with tender clams.  The best part is you can scoop up the garlic pieces and cajun spices as you eat which makes it great tasting.

Crawfish - I hate working for my food but I had fun trying to figure this one out.  Here&#39;s what I figured out, hold the head in one hand and the body in the other, twist about 30 degrees away from you. Then pull down gently and the meat should pop out of the head.  Then hold the body and tail the same way you just had it and push down on both sides of the body to snap the shell across the &#34;spine&#34; if it had one.  Then pull up from the bottom of the body and the shell should come off and you get a piece of meat about an inch or so long.  Dip the meat into the juices since most of the flavor is in the juices.

Sausage - Polish sausage - it&#39;s fine, honestly you can get it anywhere so no real need to order it here

fyi they were still doing the grand opening special, check in on facebook and you get a free lb of craw fish.  Just ask if they are still running it when you go in.

There is a nice hand washing station outside the bathrooms with 4 sinks so you can get cleaned up without having to wait.  Very nice touch!"

Just driving by, you might have hesitation. Looks like a hole in the wall seafood place. Usually spells disaster. But you are surprised right when you walk inside. The decor is coastal and laid back. You can write on pretty much anything. Could get sloppy but nice for the kids to run around with a marker on the walls. But the place is clean. Very well kept. The wait staff was friendly. The service was fast. When you first see everything come out in a clear industrial garbage bag, you try to make sense of it at first. But then when you dive in, you understand it. All the flavors, all the goodness is at the bottom. I ordered the snow crab with garlic butter. It was messy, but delicious. U can unshell all your crab and let it soak in the butter garlic at the bottom. Sooooooo good. 

I would compare this place to a Joe&#39;s Crab Shack (though it is better than Joe&#39;s) or bubba bumps. Not like a bob Chins. The prices are reasonable for seafood. Definitely not over priced. But be prepared to spend at least 50 bucks between two people. 

I will be back."

My family and I were very pleased with our meal here from start to finish. If I had to make a minor complaint, it would be that I wish they had mallets for the crabs, and they were out of Blue crabs that day, but those are very minor!

All together we had:
2 pounds of snow crab
1 pound of mussels
1 pound of clams
1 pound of deveined, headless shrimp
1 pound of crawfish(free with your Yelp check in!)
1 order of beignets


................so basically everything! I found the sauces weren&#39;t as spicy as some of the other seafood streamer restaurants I&#39;d been to lately, so I would probably go up a level to the &#39;I luv crazy&#39; next time. We tried the mix of all 3 sauces on everything, and it was delicious! To top it all off, you&#39;ve got to try the beignets! Very traditional NOLA style doughnuts that are topped with the perfect amount of powdered sugar!

Overall our meal came to *just* under $100. Is that real life? We were shocked, less than $100 for 6 pounds of seafood AND dessert? DEFINITELY coming back!"

Reminds me of seafood places from the south coasts. There&#39;s writing all over the walls and they play &#34;hip&#34; music. Wasn&#39;t a fan of 3 drake songs in a row, though. They switched it up to some Marley and slightly stupid, ya mon! Cool crab bibs too, haha! Hand washing stations outside of the bathroom with bucket sinks to boot!

It&#39;s a smaller, newer place... the service was quick and friendly. Very casual, laid back and chill vibes here. Servers wearing t-shirts and board shorts/short shorts. Everything is served and eaten with disposable products.

The seafood is pretty fresh... Fried cod was good with the Cajun fries, just over priced, IMHO. Can&#39;t go wrong with three seasonings together: garlic butter, lemon pepper and Cajun! Bomb.com, fo-sho. If you&#39;re into spicy flavors, ask for the insane seasoning on the side. It&#39;s Cayenne pepper powder and dip as you please.

I&#39;ve been to Angry Crab, lowcountry, and the Rim Seafood in Chicago and the Boiling Crab in Las Vegas so I wanted to see if this place was comparable to the competitors in Chicago. Plus my friends on Facebook said it was &#34;good as Angry Crab&#34; so I wanted to see for myself if this was true.

Location- this place is in a small strip mall, there&#39;s plenty of parking available in the lot. The place is spacious on the inside and not cramped like it is at Angry Crab. The layout is pretty much the same, with a sink to wash your hands in the back of the restaurant and the walls filled with names of visitors that had checked out the restaurant  (we didn&#39;t get a marker by the way.)

Food- the food was plain to say the least. I ordered 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of clams, with Calm spice (not spicy) and garlic butter. My boyfriend got a 1 lb each of shrimp, clams, and crawfish with &#34;I Luv Crazy&#34; spice and the 3 flavors combined (cajun, lemon, and garlic butter). My order was inconsistent. My bag of clams was spicier than my bag of shrimp, when I requested not spicy for both my shrimp and clams. I hated the sauce, it was super runny, watery, and thin, leaving none of the sauce on the seafood. Usually, I like the sauce thick like how it is at Angry Crab and lowcountry so it clings on to the seafood. But here, it was super runny so none of the flavor stayed on and it tasted plain. Also, the garlic butter sauce was too garlicky and I couldn&#39;t taste the butter. It tasted like garlic water sauce, so disappointing. My boyfriend said his crawfish was overcooked, making it hard for him to peel and it looked mushy. He ordered the &#34;I Luv Crazy&#34; spice, which wasn&#39;t spicy at all for him. We also ordered the Fried Oysters with French Fries. This was not good and I don&#39;t recommend ordering it. It was just super greasy oysters that tasted fishy and the fries had no salt so it was just fried potatoes.

Service- our server was friendly at first and explained the menu nicely since it was our first time there. However, as time went on, he never once asked how we were doing and how our food was. Our food didn&#39;t take too long (15 to 20 minutes) but I didn&#39;t like how they brought out our seafood in a bag separately. Considering my boyfriend and I bought 5 lbs of food, they came to our table at 5 different times, which was inconvenient. I&#39;d rather have our food come out at the same time, rather than 5 times. I had also ordered the Fried Oysters with fries as an appetizer and I thought it was weird that our main course came out before our appetizer did. 30 to 40 minutes pass and our server still did not ask how we were doing nor did he refill our water. I thought he was the only server and there were about 5 or 6 other tables so I felt bad at first until I saw another woman who started to serve the other tables. It wasn&#39;t until he went to the table next to us and starting cleaning the table, that I grabbed his attention and asked about our appetizer. At this point, I already knew he forgot since we were 75% done eating and almost 40 minutes passed by. He kept apologizing and he felt bad, he gave us the appetizer for free for forgetting to place that order. I commend him for doing that for us but I wish the other staff (I saw like 4 busboys and he was the only waiter until we were almost done eating) would be more attentive and help him out, instead of standing in the back, waiting to do something.

Verdict- food was plain and the staff needs to work on professionalism and customer service. Sorry, Crazy Crab but I&#39;m not crazy about your food and service. I&#39;ll stick to the competitors in Chicago."

crazy-crab-streamwood,Elaine M.,2YKO5OxTfgW-qDKZaWwD1w,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,75,29,a-POMpgh6TsQOxj3ZUA9Ag,5.0,2016-05-31,"We finally got to try Crazy Crab in Streamwood. Having been to The Boiler in Skokie and Angry Crab in Chicago, my family knew how to order and what to expect.  A few members of our party had never experienced the shellfish-in-a-bag restaurant experience, so our server did a great job explaining the process.  

We ordered cajun chicken wings (very salty), the fried fish basket (fried cod with french fries), cajun shrimp, garlic butter shrimp (my favorite!), mussels, onion rings, fries, rice, and drinks.  The food came out quickly and almost too hot to touch with your fingers.  Fortunately (unlike their competition), Crazy Crab offers paper &#34;plates&#34; and plastic forks.  Also, 4 sinks outside the washroom for washing the spices and butter off your fingers.  (I believe The Boiler only has 1 and Angry Crab just 2 dining room sinks.)

Overall, the Crazy Crab sauces we ordered were excellent, all the seafood was very fresh and perfectly cooked, and the staff was friendly.  I love the fact that they offer shrimp 3 ways:  head on, headless, and headless/deveined.  The headless/deveined shrimp is so easy to peel!

We were a party of 8, but got 3 separate checks.  The server was very nice about this and got everything correct (sounds odd to mention, but often the drinks and appetizers get put on the wrong checks).  He did pre-add an 18% tip for each ticket (because the total party was over 6 people?), which we paid without complaint.  We were planning to tip 20%, so that&#39;s his loss.

There&#39;s plenty of free parking and this location is convenient for my extended family.  We are looking forward to our next visit to Crazy Crab!"

I&#39;m never going to a chain seafood place again. Great menu, unlike other places you can order A la carte and the market prices are clearly stated. The atmosphere is fun, you can draw on the walls and dump your seafood on the table. I had a beautiful Dungeness crab, it was this monster that meaty and yummy. We also go crawfish and sweat potato fries. We got a good tip on Yelp that you can mix the sauces that go on your boil.  I sang praises with every bite. I used to live on the cost and I miss the seafood so much. This place tasted like home.  The service was good too! Our drink was always full and even cups to go.

Sets the whole mood for me for the actual meal and this place has the WORST SERVICE I have ever seen. We walk in and there&#39;s a guy at the front counter (short buzzed haircut) doing something and doesn&#39;t greet us, or say &#34;We&#39;ll be right with you&#34; - doesn&#39;t even LOOK at us, and I swear a whole minute and a half passes and I&#39;m starting to get pissed. We just stood there. I was about to just seat myself but a lady finally comes up and seats us. 

We eat our food - not bad, but not the best boil we&#39;ve had. Price seems fair and the shrimp looked fresh.

After we were done, it took us another while to get our check. Someone brings us our check, and walks away. I was tired of WAITING so I told my husband, &#34;let&#39;s just pay up front.&#34; 

We go up to the counter and its the SAME GUY who pissed me off at the beginning - I hand him our check and ask if we can pay there at the front desk. He says, &#34;oh sure, I can do that for you.&#34; As he is ringing us up, he says, &#34;But next time, make sure you pay at the table, okay?&#34; 

That did it for me. I just looked at him and said as bluntly as I could, &#34;Yeah, well, we&#39;ve BEEN waiting at the table.&#34; Then his look softens and says, &#34;oh, really? Ok.&#34; No apologies, no nothing.

Yeah, it doesn&#39;t take a genius to be able to have some common sense when it comes to customer service. You don&#39;t greet the customer, make them stand awkwardly in front of you for too long without a word, and then tell them, &#34;Just make sure you pay at the table next time.&#34; No &#34;please.&#34; If that was my employee, I&#39;d fire him. 

Food aside - the service is what keeps a customer coming back. And we won&#39;t be. Angry Crab has better service and just as good food."

This is a fun place where you order a pound of shellfish and they bring it to you in a clear plastic bag with no plates or silverware. You dig in with your hands and let the cajun juices from the shellfish and sauce drip down your hands. You leave the shells right on the table. it was quite a fun experience. Don&#39;t wear anything nice!

I liked the set-up of this place with wooden tables and benches which were set up pretty close to each other. It was nice chatting with the table next to us or being able to see what other tables were ordering. There were a few long tables set up for large groups. I would definitely recommend coming with a group of 4 or more so that you can try all the different shellfish they have. The server suggested 1 pound for 2 people which is the minimum they serve.  If you go with one other person, you can definitely order 2 pounds but you&#39;ll definitely walk away really full.

We had the crawfish ($8/lb) and clams ($10/lb) in the cajun medium spicy. Definitely recommend the clams! There is a lot of garlic and bold spices in the sauce so if you have indigestion or heartburn, make sure you load up on your antacids before and after! The fried calamari ($8) was awesome. I would go back just for the calamari."

Why didn&#39;t this place get the  other stars? Because they lack decent sides and variety in their menu and the location is again, hideous!

I appreciate the combination of all 3 flavors (Cajun, garlic butter, and lemon pepper) making the perfect Cajun seasoning of the broiled crustaceans . I also appreciate their handwash station nearby the actual tables. Bonus! 

However, their appys are subpar and nothing complimentary to their entrees IMO. Definitely skip the beignets and seasoned fries. Waste of money and tummy space. Bleh!

They&#39;re priced comparably to other Cajun seafood joints and so far so clean! I hope it stays this way.

Crazy Crab is located in a small &amp; to me kind of a random strip mall. It&#39;s smaller than the other Cajun places. Nice, clean, and spacious. 

We arrived on a Saturday night &amp; we waited 20 minutes or so for a table. Not too bad. But, I&#39;m expecting it to be much busier once more people find out about it. 

Their Cajun sauce is really good. I can taste all the elements in their sauce in each bite. The spice, the garlic, the butter. I got the &#39;I luv crazy&#39; which is the third spice level. I didn&#39;t find it very spicy, but I like spicy food.

The crawfish is only $8!! The rest of the seafood prices are comparable to the other Cajun restaurants. 

Service is pretty much the same as all the other places. We didn&#39;t have trouble grabbing help if we needed them and they came by to check on us asked for refills on our waters/beers. They don&#39;t have the salt, pepper, &amp; lime concoction that others have, but you can ask them for the ingredients you just need to make it yourself. They also provided me with gloves which I liked.

I&#39;ll be back to try all the other items on the menu."

The restaurant was smaller than I expected and bright, really bright, like hospital cafeteria bright.  But, is was clean and the food was fresh.

If you like garlic, go for the garlic butter sauce, you will see mass amounts of minced garlic in the sauce.  The extra spicy sauce is excellent too.  Crayfish are not for everyone but if you like these little critters, Crazy Crab does an excellent job with them.  If you like shrimp, it&#39;s nice that you can get them whole with the head on, partially cleaned and deveined or if you are prissy like me, completely clean and ready to chow on.

We ordered the corn and loved it.  I thought .75 was reasonable for this add-on and it was infused with the garlic and hot sauce.  We went really early and there was no wait.

I plan on going back to check out their other offerings.  Many sound delish!"

Let me start by saying we went to Crazy Crab on a Sunday afternoon around 3:30pm. We were a fairly large group (9 people). Right after we walked in it was like the late lunch crowd got there because by the time we left it was PACKED with other large groups. I was happy to see a new restaurant with so much booming business. 

I love the fact that this new restaurant is different then your typical place in Schaumburg/The Arboretum in South Barrington. You can&#39;t usually find Cajun/Creole places in the burbs... You have to drive to a neighborhood of the city. I&#39;m so happy that this place is now in the burbs. 

I love the way you can customize your seafood selections. Some of us wanted our food a little spicy, and others did not, so we were able to customize our sauces and spices. 

5 of us split the following:
2 lbs of headless de-veined shrimp (these are monster size shrimp!!)
2 lbs of Alaskan crab legs
1 lb of mussels
1 lb of clams
2 lbs whole lobster

The five of us were definitely FULL when we were all done. Just a side note - When they say GARLIC BUTTER, they mean overloaded with GARLIC! We were all family, so we didn&#39;t care smelling like garlic, but I wouldn&#39;t go on a date there or anything your married and totally comfortable! You will leave smelling like garlicky goodness. 

I absolutely LOVE Crazy Crab. I&#39;m totally a fan and I&#39;ll definitely be back with my husband and other family members. This place is AWESOME for group dining and kid friendly. It&#39;s fun to share and eat with your hands and the ambiance is totally chill and very inviting. Our total bill for 9 people was about $270 before tip. We all walked about of there spending about $36 per person. I was pleasantly surprised considering how much amazing seafood we consumed. 

See you soon Crazy Crab!"

We had the snow crab with garlic and butter, but had to order two since it really is not enough. Also had the jumbo shrimp with all three sauces and probably should have ordered it like the crab with just the garlic and butter, but it was great too. The jumbo shrimp is where it&#39;s at! Lots of shrimp in the bag and worth the price. 

Adding the corn, potato and sausage for 75 cents is NOT worth it at all. Way too small for that price. Also, had the calamari and it was great too! Everything was fresh and tasted top notch, only gripe was the price on the add-ons. Highly recommended place to eat, just be prepared to pay seafood market prices.

Place was nice and ample places to wash your hands. There was a dedicated hand washing station towards the back.

It wasn&#39;t too busy, only three or four diners.    Like other reviewers, our wait person simply left the menus on the table and walked away.  No explanation.  Plus, the only way we got service was to call out in a loud voice &#34;Hey, can we get some plastic knives and a couple more napkins&#34;.  Bang! We got service--being loud pays off.  

We were taken aback by the crawfish prep.  Having been to many seafood joints in Louisiana and Texas, we were used to steamed crawfish.  But, what the heck, we&#39;re open to new ideas.

The crawfish were fresh and priced right.   After polishing off the crawfish, we were left with a bag of tasty sauce.  Sure wish we had some crusty French bread for dipping.  I would have paid for the bread.  It could be listed under the &#34;Add-on Items&#34;.  

And, speaking of &#34;Add-on Items&#34;, we were taken aback by the skimpy potato and sausage.  Charge a little more and give a better portion."

I consider it more Schaumburg than Streamwood.   The menu is simple you either buy your seafood by the pound or under the &#34;starters&#34; column you can get  fried fish basket w/french fries and that applies to the chicken tenders, fried shrimp or fried oyster basket.  My husband ordered the fried shrimp basket with french fries, I chose 1lb of clams in garlic butter with the spicy level of calm (least spicy).  I also ordered under add -on items corn on the cob.  Other family members ordered the headless devein shrimp in crazy cajun/lemon butter with the &#34;I luv Crazy&#34; spicy level.  The food came out quite fast and in a plastic bag if  you were ordering seafood by the pound.  
I have to say I loved the small clams it was delicious - BTW - the server suggested that if you check in on their facebook page they are offering a pound of crawfish with your meal for free!  
Since this is new, the restaurant is nicely done, with a hand washing station in the back of the restaurant (nice idea).  The lighting is perfect I don&#39;t like eating in a dimly lit restaurant this place was bright and had a few tvs mounted on the walls for people like my husband who didn&#39;t want to miss the sports going on. 
We&#39;ll be back the prices are definitely reasonable and the quality of fresh seafood was superb. I think as they get into the swing of this type of restaurant they will tweak their menu to the preference of their customers - how about a la carte...fried oysters no french fries?   Great job!!  the servers were friendly and attentive."

The seafood quality was fine but the sauce was very bland and it was all butter.  Even dipping every piece all you could taste was bitter garlic and butter.  We ended up having to add our own chili powder to the sauce.

The guy who seemed like the manager of or owner was very nice and attentive other than towards the end when we had to flag someone down to get the check and to pay our bill. 

Overall the food itself was good and is comparable to other crab boils in the area. The sauces weren&#39;t as mixed throughout the whole bag. 

Hopefully they fix their tweaks in the front of the house or at least have friendlier people helping customers as soon as we walk in and more organized with checking in."

My partner and I came here hungry and got the crazy pot assortment to try everything so that next time we&#39;d have a game plan. Favorites are the mussels, shrimp, clams and crab of course. Definitely aiming for lobster next time. Our bellies satisfied and our fingers butter greasy, we were happy as two seafood frustrated people can be when given the good stuff. My partner and I haven&#39;t been to a place like this since we were in San Diego/San Francisco and lord knows what the hell people go to Red Lobster for, cause it ain&#39;t the seafood. 

Shout out to Juan also. Great server."

The food is delicious and I love the options that you have to choose from as well as the option to add corn, potatoes, etc. I REALLY wanted to try the crazy pot but it was way too much food for two people eating lunch.

1. The seafood should not be greasy. 
2. Overpriced sides: 75 cents each for unseasoned 1/4 of a red potato and an inch long piece of crappy (non-Cajun) sausage. 2b. Just include one of each: potato (whole), corn (whole), sausage (whole) in with the seafood....and charge about $1.50. 
3. Poor and messy presentation: paper cartons for crab legs???? 
4. &#34;Cajun&#34; = Not at all. Not bad flavor, just too greasy and not Cajun by a long shot. 
5. Seasoning should be in the water, not post-boiling. 5b. Sides should be cooked WITH the seafood.
6. Beignets weren&#39;t bad but too small. 
7. Sinks for customers to use is genius. 
8. Decor is just a weird hodge-podge of mismatched beach trinkets that have zero to do with cajun cuisine or culture. 
9. Training is needed across the board - from the hostesses, servers to the managers - as well as fixing the cuisine. Some were polite but highly disorganized."

The shrimp and crab legs I ordered were amazing. The lemon pepper spiciness was absolutely delicious and I couldn&#39;t get enough. The drinks were average. The sweet potato fries were bland (bad choice on my part should&#39;ve gone with the boiled potato instead). White rice is white rice. The chicken tenders are worth skipping (once again my fault, don&#39;t order chicken at a crab joint). The bill was a little much. Their market prices are a little high for my taste. Overall, I came for the crab and it exceeded my expectations. The 4 stars are for everything else, but don&#39;t skip out because their seafood delivers on every level. Also, parking is free and abundant. They also include the tip on your check when you pay with your card which is a little presumptuous since they don&#39;t give you an option to not tip if you prefer to leave a cash tip instead which I often prefer, but it&#39;s no biggie."

The restaurant was not too noisy and what you expect from a restaurant that does boils.

We ordered a pound of shrimp, pound of Crawfish and pound of Alaskan King Crab legs.  The food was delicious, especially with 3 flavors all mixed together.  We had the insane heat which I consider mild but other thought was nice and hot.  Had the crab legs in the butter and garlic and delicious.  Everything was cooked to perfection and the crawfish tasted fresh.

Only reason why this is not 5 star instead of 4 star, is that they do not have french bread to soakk up the sauce when done.  This is a must if you claim to be a Cajun/Creole restaurant.  Pair with a local bakery and get it done.

And also, throw in some Abita beer on the menu :)

This is not a negative to me, but they do not have a liquor license, so prepare accordingly for beer.

Will return when back in the Schaumburg area."

Had to send my daughter&#39;s back twice because they could not comprehend that she wanted it mild and not spicy. Female manager seemed incompetent. They gave us splitters with the ends broken off. Asked for splitters that worked, waitress said owner got a gross of splitters used from another restaurant for very cheap bc they were all broken. They refilled foam soap dispensers with regular thick liquid soap so nothing would come out of the dispenser. How were the employees washing their hands???!!! Prices were slightly more than what you would expect at Joe&#39;s or red lobster but no options for salad or anything other than eating with your bare hands. Cheaper than Shaws or Bob Chinn, but it&#39;s a local dive not a nice restaurant, so it should be.

Tonight&#39;s meal was cream of rice soup and chicken Caesar salad. Their cream of chicken rice soup is sometimes the reason why my wife and I go there. Thick and creamy, the way I like it. 

Their salads are huge. I&#39;ve been on a health kick lately and this hit the spot. They are generous with the chicken. Big tomato and cucumber slices that you have to cut. 

Other favorites of mine there are the hot, open face roast beef sandwich and the triple decker BLT.

Yesterday we stopped in for dinner.  I had a craving for London Broil and was hoping to find it on the menu.  The closest they had was broiled skirt steak.  It definitely satisfied my craving.  This was a large cut of skirt steak prepared perfectly.  It was such a large portion I ended up taking about 1/3 home.  I went with the dinner option and ordered a salad with garlic dressing.  The salad was OK and the garlic dressing was pretty good.
As I sat stuffed and contemplating just how good my meal was, the friendly server came by and asked what I would like for dessert.  She said dessert comes with the dinner and I could chose anything from the pastry case up front.  I picked the brownie chocolate chip cheesecake and she boxed it up for me to take home.
Here&#39;s the clincher for my skirt steak dinner = less than $18 without tax.  I think you would pay close to double at a fancy steak house.
Bottom line: For a legitimate steak house quality steak for much less than steak houses charge, give Dapper&#39;s West a try.  Your tastebuds and wallet will thank you!"

dappers-west-family-restaurant-addison,Tiffany W.,gxTIOq4i9WsKfE0DGiNhjw,"Addison, IL",0,1,0,0,3,e1TE_rVJBUp0-AjQVuipUQ,1.0,2015-11-08,"I&#39;ve been to Dappers a few times, usually preferring Sunmist or Dinos (further west down lake street). BUT neither of those are open late so to Dappers we went last night. I&#39;ve been here at all times of the day or night and it&#39;s never been all that good. Never been all that bad necessarily either though. However last night was just plain terrible.....

They were out of the cream of broccoli soup (sad) but I can understand that. My husband got the &#34;gumbo&#34; (if you could call it that). It was like slurping a liquidized salt lick. I felt my blood pressure rise after one spoonful to try it. His entree was the meatloaf dinner. It was very solid and looked more like thick slices of gyro meat in my opinion. Also, it was pink in random spots throughout which we found to be odd. It definitely didn&#39;t look like any meatloaf we&#39;d ever seen before. His gravy on the side was very clumpy....like snot. He barely ate any of it and felt the plain/bland mashed potatoes were better. 

I ordered the caesar salad and a side of hashbrowns (because even tho I wanted something light, potatoes are always necessary). WORST SALAD OF MY LIFE! How hard is it? Lettuce, dressing, chicken, croutons, and a dusting of parmasean cheese. This one? Soaking wet and WILTING lettuce, no dressing AT ALL, bland fatty chicken (I could swear it smelled weird too, but my man said that&#39;s what bland chicken smells and tastes like), and a ridiculous amount of vegetables piled on top. Raw onion, 4 wedges of tomato, cucumber, olives (like 5 or 6) and hard boiled egg. Ew to all of that. The amount was well beyond that of garnish or a bite here or there- I had trouble fitting it all on my little bread plate! I didn&#39;t order a mixed veggie platter. All the effort put into taking all that crap off and I was greeted with the wet, wilting, tasteless joke of a salad underneath. 

Plus side? My hashbrowns were undercooked. Luckily, I like them that way. That, plus the ketchup on the table was all I ate. The waitress was friendly and courteous, she kept our waters full which is more than other waitresses we&#39;ve had here have done. 

My husband let me have his dessert so I chose from the large bakery case. The only thing I&#39;ve ever had from there before last night was a cookie so I opted for the oreo pie. Surprisingly, the man at the register cut a rather generous piece and we took it to go. It&#39;s quite thick, but with a little bit too much whipped topping. Otherwise, no complaints on that one. 

I wanted to believe this bad experience was due to the time of our visit which was 11pm, but it&#39;s hard to accept when it&#39;s more than an hour and a half before closing and mostly empty inside. In hindsight, that should have been a clue. To add insult to injury,  any other time we&#39;ve visited the food or service was less than mediocre.  We left hungry and dissatisfied. This was the last straw, we won&#39;t return."

I have never felt completed to write a negative review of any where before.  My mother and I were warned by a patron who was leaving that he hoped we had a &#34;better dining experience&#34; than he&#39;d had and that the place had gone downhill.  We decided to give it a chance.  Dumb move... We ordered two iced teas.  Promptly delivered to the table.  We tasted it BUT It was undrinkable.  We went to the cashier and she didn&#39;t even apologize.. Just said that will be $5.20.  And we left..NEVER to return again.

My sister didn&#39;t like her order because of the condiments in it and asked them to change the order...they charged bit orders. Didn&#39;t ever warn us that they where going to do this. 

Brought dessert to us, it was spoiled. We told the waitress and she questioned us. 

She through our plates at us. 

Then we went to pay our bill and asked for an adjustment and they said they could only change the platter that my sister returned to 1/2 the price... I got on the defence and said &#34;NO&#34; I refuse to pay for something we didn&#39;t eat. I asked for the manager, he never came. The cashier (after 10mins) finally took the charges off.

But really the food isn&#39;t great. The soup is always fantastic, I&#39;ll give them that. But the prices have gone up. I had the shirt steak which was way overcooked. The fish is bland.

The kicker is that the owner sits behind the dessert counter and guards it like a bridge troll. He will absolutely let people walk out without their dessert if you don&#39;t ask for it. When you ask for it, he seems perturbed and cuts small slices. And forget about a bag, he won&#39;t want to give you one of those either."

As we walked in the door, I was explaining to my companion that THIS is a &#34;Greek (-owned) diner&#34; and to &#34;pay attention to the outdated &#39;80s furniture.&#34; I&#39;m a fan of it, btw..

And we walked in, and I squealed like a little girl when I saw the massive dessert display. (I&#39;ve been on a sugar kick lately.) It doesn&#39;t revolve, but maaaan, is it extensive. I spotted the Choco Cake I wanted immediately. You know, the one on the faaaaar right that is ALL chocolate.

People-watching was supreme: I saw a few nice &#39;stashes and mullets. The little old lady behind me was kicking me in the booth like a rambunctious kid. I saw all sorts of peeps of all age ranges, which seemed promising.

Our waitress called us &#34;Sweetie.&#34; Over. and. over. gahhhh. That should have been my first warning that things were awry in this joint.

The dinner menu has the soups listed as: &#34;Soup of the Day, Pea Soup, Chicken Noodle: $3.50.&#34; I asked what the Soup of the Day was and was told &#34;Pea Soup.&#34; Erm, alrighties. I went with it.  I also ordered coffee and a slice of the cake. (He ordered the Chopped Steak in addition to the Key Lime pie.)

The soup was insanely thick/condensed-ish and lukewarm. Ick. I&#39;m usually a member of The Clean Plate Club and have NEVER left a bowl of soup go unfinished (even the condensed Campbell&#39;s I&#39;ve made at home.). Not here.  The rolls and croissants in our basket were super stale.. two bites in, I stopped eating the stuff.

My coffee cup went empty despite our waitress checking on us (once), asking if I wanted a refill (&#34;yes please!&#34;) and not coming back until she brought us the check. Another waitress - coffee pot in hand since she refilled HER customer&#39;s cups - refilled mine.

I could hardly wait to get the check and GTFO. While my friend went to the restroom, I went to pay. Aaaaand waited. And waited some more. The &#34;manager&#34; or whoever he was (he kind of walked around the place intermittently) finally put down the Coke he had at the counter area and moseyed on over to me. He didn&#39;t ask how anything was - just rang my card through.

Bad, baaaad experience. We won&#39;t be back."

Food:
Philly Steak Sandwich ($9.05): the price has increased compared to the menu online...I think this is the worst Philly Steak Sandwich I&#39;ve tasted in awhile..I sure won&#39;t be getting this again here....the quality of the food products seems to be not that great...low quality meat?...i wish it at least tasted good....(I mean I would rather get Taco bell then eat here--is that sad.?..)..

Clam Chowder: creamy and good...but the clams tasted like it was from cans...

FREE Bread Basket--but maybe there&#39;s a reason why...our waitress dropped a piece of bread on the table from the free bread baskets that they offer and then she went to grab it (my friend and I thought she was going to toss it out) and put it back on top of the bread basket...ew.. really?.. how do you know if the table wasn&#39;t dirty or not.....makes me not want to eat from the bread baskets....then we asked a waiter for another bread basket..but he clearly didn&#39;t understand us (doesn&#39;t understand English perhaps?) and took it away and never brought us a new one...so on our 3rd attempt we asked yet another waiter and he brought us a different bread basket (wouldn&#39;t know if it&#39;s a new one or not.. but yea).....I&#39;m sure by this time.. we were halfway done with our soup...

Food Portions: are pretty big...an entree comes with fries and soup...

The whole front is chairs for waiting, long counters full of pies (they did look delicious) and the register. 

There were plenty of booths and tables, they were dated but comfy. 

One odd thing; when we walked up to the table there was a bread basket there that the hostess removed. I assumed it was there since dinner last night, I hope they don&#39;t regularly leave bread on the tables overnight. 

I had the pecan waffles, they were good, no butter but dusted with powdered sugar. Our waitress was attentive, constantly kept our coffees filled so that was great. 

We were the youngest people there by far, which was funny. ^.^

All in all I liked it, it&#39;s one of those comfortable breakfast places you can go with just about anyone and receive decent, consistent food."

Dappers is definitely ideal for breakfast, if you intend on going for breakfast feel free to disregard the rest of this and think of Dappers as a solid 4-4.5 star restaurant.

However, my praise ends after around 11:30. I&#39;ve been consistently disappointed in their lunch and dinner offerings. The service crew at night always seems to be changing and never that knowledgeable. The food is just average, from the frozen French fries to the overcooked burgers and chicken, oh, and let&#39;s not forget that I&#39;ve gotten undercooked fish on at least 2 occasions.

I&#39;ve pretty much written Dappers off when it comes to anything other than breakfast. When it comes to Greek family diners I&#39;d rather spend my money at several other similar places within 10 minutes from Dappers. If you absolutely must eat here after breakfast I&#39;d suggest sticking to eating breakfast dishes for lunch/dinner."

I also love their omelettes and some other items I usually get when I go there.  The only reason that they got 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are some inconsistencies.  I order an omelette pretty frequently and yet, I often get charged a different amount than another time.  I don&#39;t appreciate that.  When brought to the attention of the man ringing me up (presumably the owner), I&#39;m told &#34;you got charged extra because of this or that&#34;.  The point is that if I&#39;m to be charged extra for something, make it consistent!   The swing in price on this omelette is $1.50.  Pick a price and stick to it.

-They are cool about separate checks, even for large groups - perfect for workday lunch outings!

-HUGE menu - your standard family restaurant spare and a few surprises, I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here.  It&#39;s probably not going to blow you away either, but it&#39;s your average good food.

-BIG portions - even the soup that comes with your &#34;deluxe&#34; sandwich or entree is a big bowl of soup.

-Service is usually friendly and quick

-They have a bakery counter which always has lots of yummy looking things but I&#39;ve never had room to give any a try.

A few downsides:
-I don&#39;t know how long those baskets of bread/rolls sit out but I&#39;ve never had a fresh basket on the table.  Not sure if they are reusing rolls they&#39;ve put out on other tables that went uneaten or what but usually the rolls are on the dry/stale side.

-Regardless of how much food you are taking home they almost always bring you a little container to fit it all in. So unless you ate most of your food or don&#39;t mind piling your meal on top of your fries you may need to ask for a bigger container.

-Some may say the prices can be on the high side for a family restaurant but they do give you a lot of food and they do have daily specials available with lower prices."

Most of the time I don&#39;t have any complaints with my server, but I have gotten a couple bad ones a couple times.

If you do happen to go on a day when they have the cream of chicken and wild rice soup.....you MUST not leave the place without trying it!! I usually order a couple pints to go when I don&#39;t feel like dealing with the morning weekend crowds."

Each time we&#39;ve gone recently they are always out of something, for example potatoes, mashed or baked (out of both) roasted chicken, lamb, ham, etc.

How can a restaurant operate when they are always out of something?

Today we went and we had to wait 1 hour and 15 minutes to be seated.  As I&#39;ve done in the past, I&#39;ve ordered my Apple Pancake in advance, as it takes 45 minutes to be prepared. 

So when we were seated I saw my apple pancake sitting up where the servers pick the food up the food. I told the server that I saw the apple pancake and she asked me if I wanted it right then, what would she think it&#39;s just sitting up there getting cold.

Sure enough when she brought to the table it was room temperature not even hot anymore.  That was $10.99 down the drain. 
My husband my father, and my husband&#39;s grandmother all wanted to order the roasted chicken, they were out of it.  Then when they decided to pick something else their side item should&#39;ve been a potato mashed or baked, the server said they were out of both, how can a restaurant to be out of both of them?  Well needless to say this would be the last time will be going to this restaurant. Don&#39;t waste your time or money."

Honestly, it&#39;s a regular old Greek-style joint, but it offers a lot more than most.  

I&#39;m going to make this one short: 

1.  CHEAP.  You get a lot for the money.  I just mangia&#39;ed a soup, gyros platter, and a cheesecake for less than it costs to buy a decent drink at some places.
2.  CLEAN.  Enough said. 
3.  BIG.  There are even bathrooms for each side of the restaurant.  If you need reasons for why this is awesome, you have obviously don&#39;t have IBS.   
4.  GOOD.  Food, that is.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all good.

Last night, my family and I went out for a late dinner after returning from a graduation ceremony. 

Our waitress was very attentive, helpful, and accommodating. Otherwise... The experience was terrible. 

My mom ordered their tilapia on special and it was bland &amp; had an off appearance. She&#39;s a trooper so she ate it. My BF has the sea food Alfredo he said that it was rubbery, but he was hungry so he ate the noodles. My dad had the gyro platter and he seemed to enjoy it. 

I ordered the veal cutlet... It was terrible. 1) my plate didn&#39;t come out until probably 5-7 minutes after everyone else&#39;s plates. I was patient and reassured our waitress that it was okay. When the dish came out I was so disappointed. The breading was pale without a golden look to it and when I cut into it the veal it was rubbery&amp; had a grey color to it. I hadn&#39;t eaten all day and it was late so I gave it a try... disgusting.

I said something to the waitress and she apologized. The owner took the price of the meal off, but still charged us for the soup that came with it. I found that to be rude. 

If your kitchen made a mistake you should come out and apologize and see how you can make it better. 

People will continue to come to Dappers because it&#39;s been around &amp; the older folk like the bland food.  If you do go maybe keep your order to soup, sandwiches, and breakfast items."

It has a good selection of breakfast skillets that I am a big fan of and it is pretty close to where I live.  My experience with the restaurant was ok.  The host would seat, me - water would come soon after.  The waitress would bring a bread basket that was free.  I usually didn&#39;t eat any of the bread basket as not to fill up before my meal :)  Sometimes the bread looked like it might have been a little old too.

The skillets were good.  I enjoyed the food.  The selection was good and the food was comparable other breakfast restaurants.

The main thing I had a little problem checking out.  The waitresses leave the checks on the table and then you pay at the counter.  When I went to the counter I handed the gentleman my credit card and he asks would you like to leave a tip... Which I was a little surprised by.  Most restaurants don&#39;t solicit you to tip... But no big deal at that point,  I said, of course I would... So he says, how much... Which again I was surprised to be asked this... So I told him I prefer to write it out myself.  This seemed to put him out as he insisted he could punch it in and he seemed unwilling or unhappy to print out the receipt so I could look at it, calculate my tip, and sign the slip.  I had to sign the cc slip either way, I prefer to write out my own tip...  The whole exchange really did upset me as he insisted 3 times he would do it getting more annoyed when I said I would like to write it out myself.  I considered not tipping as well because of this, but it wasn&#39;t the waitresses fault.  So I was given my receipt to sign and leave my appropriate 20%+ tip, with a huff and puff from the cashier and I went on my way.

Had a similar experience checking out again, and now I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll go back.  There has already been a few times when I get a feel for a skillet, Dapper&#39;s is not my first choice, and will drive a little further.  The food was good, as good as other places, but with my experience, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.

If this wouldn&#39;t bother you, stop in the food was good."

Most entrees come with app, sides, and dessert

Apps
Chicken Veg Soup -  both ppl that had it liked it
NE Clam Chowder - mine was sour though I found a tomato in it, I wonder if it fell in while the Chicken Veg was being scooped, I will have to try it again next time to find out if it is always sour or if it was that.  Sadly the waitress did not replace it when I mentioned it was sour.
Manhatten Clam Chowder - I don&#39;t normally like this style (red) but it was actually pretty good


Entrees
Baked Perch - my friend loves this dish $9.50
Meatloaf - ok $9.50
16 oz King Prime Rib (secret: get it seared on both sides!) - Great! $17?
12 oz Queen Prime Rib - great!  Both prime ribs were so easy to slice through and succulent.  Both were cooked med rare. $16?

Sides
Hash Brows - I always get them extra crispy, they weren&#39;t bad but unseasoned
Mashed potatoes - pretty smooth
Garlic Mashed - mashed potatoes with a ladle of garlic and oil on it, wayyyy garlicy but I love garlic but it is way overwhelming
Mac &amp; Cheese (baked) only available Friday and Sat I think or Sat and Sun, I forget.  It was not bad, but not great
Fries not bad at all, pretty crispy

Strawberry Shake  $5
It was very sweet, it is made with either frozen yogurt or something from a machine then whole strawberries (lots of them) though I swear there is syrup in it because it was insanely sweet though the waitress claims there isn&#39;t any syrup, I def think there was.  If it wasn&#39;t so sweet it would be perfect

Desserts
Oreo Cheesecake - This was more like a cream pie than a cheese cake, kinda mousy
Peanut Butter Cup Cream Pie - I didn&#39;t get to eat this since I took it home and it somehow went bad by the time I had it 2 days later :("

Drove aimlessly and wound up here. I did a quick read on Yelp in the parking lot before coming. At 11pm, there were only a few tables occupied. People were cleaning up, but they were still open for business, thank God! I was hungry. 

I ordered the Gyro platter dinner, because they ran out of that day&#39;s special - Texas ribs and bbq chicken, :-( . This included a soup, salad, side of potato and dessert. When you walk in, you pass by a long display of mostly cakes and pies (all made on the premises). I ordered the French onion soup. It did not come with melted cheese on top, but rather a dry toast. The soup was salty and the onions were underdone. I told the waitress and she was happy to replace it with a bowl of creamy chicken and rice soup. This soup would put any New England clam chowder to shame (well maybe not...), because it was so creamy [and heavy] - probably 100 calories per spoonful. The flavor was pleasant. 

Minutes later, the waitress brought in the Gyro platter. It was a huge plate of meat. A mound of sliced gyro meat sat on a round of pita bread with white onion slices, wedges of tomatoes, slices of cucumber, cubes of feta cheese, and kalamata olives. The meat was dry! Where&#39;s the tzatziki sauce; she forgot. The sliced meat looked like cardboard. After about a few bites, I was done. Probably because I filled up on soup and salad, plus I was tired. 

The reviews described this place as a friendly, Greek restaurant. It was friendly but not Greek. There were only a couple of items that were Greek, but where&#39;s the moussaka, pastitsio, etc. The rest of the menu was American and Italian. The food was mediocre. I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here unless it&#39;s 11 at night and there&#39;s no where else to eat."

Service was super slow on a not busy Saturday afternoon.

Pancakes are awful. Seriously go to Millie&#39;s. Blueberry Pancakes should have blueberries baked inside or come with a disclaimer that you&#39;re just getting a pile of what basically amounts to blueberry jelly or blueberry pie filling. Dumping a bunch of goop on top is cheap and gross.

Skillet was ok.  Basic diner fare. There are way better ones in the area. Even iHop is better. I&#39;d take Denny&#39;s over this place.

Another night we went in to get pie. 4 people, 4 different slices of pie and all were terrible. Peanut Butter Cup pie tasted like cleaning solution. Not sweet, chocolatey, or peanut buttery.

Will never, ever return."

I have eaten here two other times and never had a decent meal.

Prices:  outrageous for what they serve. 

Salad: was watery, tomatoes were spongy.

Soup: clam chowder was extremely salty and missing the clams.  
Sweet and sour cabbage soup had a tin taste to it. 

Salmon:  very small portion,  overcooked,  served with one piece of broccoli  which was like saw grass, and one piece of  cauliflower that was cold and uncooked.

Spinach Pie:  burnt, dry no taste....I am Greek and this was the worst I have ever encountered...I have tasted better frozen ones from Costco. Rice served as side was starchy and pasty.  Served also with a canned peach that was old and starting to discolor underneath.

Left hungry...didn&#39;t even want dessert that we paid for since we got the dinner meals which they charge an additional $3.00 and change on top of the price of your meal...no bargain here. 

Waitress was nice....tipped her 20 percent as the quality of food is not her fault.

Tab came to to about $33.00 minus the tip. 
The older gentlemen at the register, did not even ask how every thing was. Rude, no people skills at all.  I proceeded to tell him what a terrible meal we had. He took my money, and his response was, &#34; what can I say&#34;.   I responded, &#34;what can you say,  offer better food &#34;.  

He did not even offer to take anything off our bill. Tells you right there this restaurant is not about customer service.   Needless to say,  they will not see us again....three strikes your out.  This type of establishment should be ashamed that they are charging so much for poor quality of food. However they don&#39;t care because it is a family restaurant,  who have the regulars that unfortunately do not know what  quality of food is and what they should be serving for the prices they are charging .... and that is the only reason they are busy."

It&#39;s like seeing a trailer for the Empire Strikes Back before you even watch A New Hope. You kind of have to ignore it or else you&#39;ll be staring at it like Hypnotoad is embedded in the tiramisu. 

Dapper&#39;s has been around for a while. When I lived in Addison it was one of the go-to places in order to avoid hanging with chain smoking goths at Denny&#39;s. Back then it was a greasy family restaurant, but after it was made over it looks pretty classy. The menu is pretty huge. I only ever used to go to Dapper&#39;s for breakfast. They have great french toast and the coffee is of the Kona blend. A great way to start the day. Admittedly I&#39;ve only been here for anything but breakfast once. I ordered a BLT, which came with some some fat cut french fries and a bowl of potato soup. You can&#39;t really screw up a BLT... actually yes you can. But Dapper&#39;s doesn&#39;t, which earns it an endorsement from myself. 

There&#39;s no dessert menu at Dapper&#39;s. Instead you just mosy on over to the case and take a look at the large selection of pie and cake and pastries. Last time I was here on Pi-day so I had to go with the pie. I went with coconut cream and got another slice to go (i.e. dessert for my girlfriend). 

It&#39;s an overall nice experience, with polite service and an attentive staff. I can&#39;t ask for much more than that. Other than maybe a job. But that&#39;s pushing the limits of what a restaurant can do for me."

Like many other greek-style diners, you can order your meals a la carte or deluxe and the desserts look delicious.

Everything I have had here (corned beef/pastrami sandwich, gyros, athenian skirt steak, etc.) has been excellent with one exception: The Chicken Kiev. When I cut it open, golden liquid started to pour out and I couldn&#39;t tell if it was butter (liquid shortening) or oil. This may be how the dish is supposed to be cooked, but I wasn&#39;t a fan.

I had the blt club which is always just okay. It is definitely light on the bacon. 
My other half got the skirt steak sandwich and it was phenomenal. Tender, juicy, not chewy, great flavor, not fat and cooked perfectly and served on garlic bread. If any of you know Booby&#39;s in Niles, you know they are famous for their steak sandwich. My other half said this one blew Booby&#39;s away, I concurred.

First time i had done this. The old lady(who didnt take the phone order) was incredibly rude and arguing that it was my fault and I ordered wrong.

Panic gripped my soul as I stared into the whirling hypno wheel of the menu, where adjectives and nouns spin in a crazy vortex. I have a few questions for you. Did you notice that the menu was an unreliable predictor of what actually came to the table? If you hadn&#39;t come up with the recipe yourself, would you ever guess that the shiny tissue of breading that exudes grease onto the plate contains either chicken fingers or fried mushrooms? The screwdriver. Any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde? If servers arrive with main courses and find that the appetizers haven&#39;t been cleared yet, do they try to find space for the new plates next to the dirty ones?  Do the Cadillac sized cockroaches count toward the fire code maximum occupant count? What is going on at this restaurant of yours?"

Roses are Red
Violets are Blue
You have delicious soups
and chicken kabobs too!

I don&#39;t know why I waited so long to review Dappers. I&#39;ve been going there for years now. They are definitely tied with Kappy&#39;s for my favorite diner in the area. Dappers always has 4 choices of soup, which makes me very happy. Some of my favorites are Cream of Chicken Rice, Split Pea, and Chicken Rosamarina.

The bread basket is also always fresh, and the coffee is not burnt. These are 2 distinguishing factors in a good diner.

As far as main dishes, I typically get the Greek chicken kabobs with a side of tzatziki and hot pita. Mmmm. I also will occasionally get the chicken sandwich, which is on a bagel with pineapple, cheese, and honey mustard. My BF thinks that&#39;s disgusting, but I love it. The salads are also not to be missed and the breakfast items are always good.

I&#39;m knocking down a star for the dessert case. Everything looks awesome, but the cakes and cookies are typically VERY dry. I will usually go for the baklava, which is better than average."

I also learned that this location only seems to have one salt shaker in the place. Odd. My sister&#39;s guacamole was under seasoned, so that lone salt shaker came in handy.

Which is superior? Which came first? Who cares, as I am pretty sure I would not be able to tell the difference in a blind taste test, and imitation is the greatest form of flattery after all. 

I can honestly say I have yet to have bad food at any Chipotle location I have visited, and this one is pretty much par for the course. The interior is a little smaller than you would expect given it&#39;s location, but the set up is the mirror image of any other. Hot sauce bottles are neatly stacked by the beverage machine, the same rustic looking waste baskets with a spot for trays, etc. 

I went with my go to burrito, the Carnita, with Guac. It was good as always and I ate it down hungrily. The assembly line service of food the restaruant is famous for was on point like a well oiled machine, as per usual.  In under a min I was paid up and off to find a spot to post up and eat. 

Since I am a foodie, I always enjoy exploring new restaurants and tastes, but at the same time, there is a lot to be said for having a default that you know is always workable. With Chipotle, you know going in that it is not going to set the world on fire. However,  if you are wandering in unfamiliar territory and see one of their restaurants, you can take comfort in knowing that it&#39;s a solid meal at a reasonable price."

There&#39;s tons of construction going on outside so be prepared to go around in circles, looking for a place to even enter the lot! (This is not why they got the rating they got)

It was hotter inside than outside! They should prob get that looked at... 

Got 2 burrito bowls &amp; they were both exactly the same.

The portion sizes are tiny. Baby scoops of rice, baby scoops of meat, baby scoops of everything... I get that they have to give a certain amount, but this was just so little! The meats are all cut so small! Every piece of steak that we got were all tiny, chewy bits. It&#39;s like chewing on rubber. Def feels like they used cheap pieces of meat. They brought out new chicken while I was in line &amp; all those pieces were cut tiny as well so I know it wasn&#39;t just me.

We got tortillas on the side &amp; they are dry, hard, &amp; chewy. Not soft &amp; elastic like they usually are. Idk how something so hard will even wrap a burrito without cracking open??

There&#39;s no flavor in anything. Not sure how they seasoned it. 

Either way, I won&#39;t be coming back to this location. I stopped by because it was close to where I was at, but there are better ones closer to my house &amp; I&#39;ll stick to those.

I will not return to this location and maybe even eat less of this chain food because of the reminder of the way the workers and the manager there were! 
We had a sales representative buy us food for our lunch, she asked us to call it/online in so she could pick it up on her way here, we are a dentists office, we have a limited amount of time to eat because we have to get back to seeing patients. She offered to buy us food as she could inform us on her latest sales that her company was offering. We made the order, 2 salads, and 1 burrito. We simply gave the sales representative the name of the order. However when she arrived to our office, we realize that we are missing a salad. And on our receipt it says that we ordered two, on the receipt that the store provided on the bag of the food, and there was no way of the sales representative to know that there was something wrong with our order until we checked. We called chipotle to let them know what happened, and because we know that they are starting to deliver, asked if it could be done, they said no, the company cannot, no reason provided at all. And when the sales representative had picked up the food, she had said that they were not busy so asked if a manager could simply make a delivery to make the customer happy, they said no. The reason why we couldn&#39;t go back was because of all the construction traffic and we only had about 15 minutes until our patient came. When we talked to the &#34;manager&#34;, she said she was the manager at the moment, and when we asked if could talk to the official manager she said he was not in, so we asked for his name and she began to say Juan and when we asked for the last name, she said &#34;oh wait I cannot give you that information&#34;. What&#39;s up with that? Also when we asked to simply receive our money back, they said you have to come in the store to do that or we cannot give you any refund, what the fuck? They did not in any way care about the customer! Need new employees at this location maybe, never had this bad of a service at a Chipotle. And of course, a worker at our work did not eat. Thanks Chipotle, I will not be going to this location and really letting people know about this, including my family, friends and patients."

I&#39;m allergic to onions and the last time I went there they put salsa with onions on my tacos when I didn&#39;t even ask for it. I pointed that out to the girl making my tacos and specifically said &#34;I&#39;m allergic to onions&#34; and she just started SCRAPPING the salsa out of my taco. Um...seriously? !

Luckily an older man, who I assumed was the manager, told her to throw the tacos out and start over which prompted a HUUUGE eye roll from her. Really?! It only takes like a minute to fix your mistake and NOT make someone violently ill, so suck it up and deal. Maybe try throwing a smile on your face while you&#39;re at it.

It&#39;s the dinner &#39;RUSH&#39; line. I am not kidding, every single time, and I seriously mean EVERY, we arrive at this time we are usually part of an &#39;out the door&#39; line. We see it, we know its long before we walk in the door. We are willing to wait. We know at the end, we will have a very good meal. So it&#39;s cool. BUT, no matter the what as soon as we hit that ordering station, all hell breaks loose. You begin to feel a lot like a COW, being herded though the slaughter house. 

We know what we want, we get it every single time. WE GOT IT DOWN!  But... and here is the big  BUT.. Ingredients are SCREAMED AT US and an alarming rate! WHITE OR BROWN RICE? Brown...ANY BEANS, VEGGIES, ..no. SAUCE!? yes, a LITTLE pica de...BAM!  A LARGE SPOON FULL OF PICA is thrown on the bowl or burrito.. Really? I was in the middle of saying &#39;little&#39; and I get BAM ...a pound of pico de gallo sauce. Now what? Scrape it off? Hear the WHAT? WHAT? HUH? YOU DON&#39;T WANT PICA DE GALLO? ...honestly. 

 Look I get it, its just a job that probably doesn&#39;t pay well. But we work VERY hard for our money. VERY HARD!  I don&#39;t want to be treated like I am &#39;in the way&#39; or the world will end if someone takes an extra 3 seconds to LISTEN to what I am saying! After all. this is a &#39;treat&#39; for me, at the end of the week to RELAX and not have to do dishes, or stress about cooking. Someone else is doing it for me!

 We don&#39;t eat at McDonalds, or Burger King or Wendys! BUT there is a Qdoba and 5 Guys that are close, and I have no problem suggesting that one of THESE places come to this area.. Just tell them to slow down a little! We beg you.!!!"

Now that your identified items such as:
tasty barbacoa beef, chicken, fajita veggies, brown and white rice, steak, and tortillas are all genetically modified.

That puts your restaurant in a category of serving shit at an expensive price.

 I will not pay for your GMO crap when I can go elsewhere and have the exact same food for less.

You cannot charge Whole Foods prices and serve meat tainted with commercial feed and call it Organic. 

The reason why I am writing such an angry review is because I have a household with allergies and health issues and I have to go our of my way to find good food that IS WHAT IT SAYS IT IS. All this time what we thought was anti-biotic free  and healthy really isn&#39;t.

I also have a friend with heart issues who eats there regularly and notices the blood pressure spikes. The news story I saw verified my thoughts when it showed people with higher cholesterol than ever from eating what they thought was healthy vegetarian at  your restaurants.

Now you are spinning this into a campaign that you are  volunteering the GMO  foods. Why now? Why create a campaign where you tell people they are eating healthy and they are really not?

Your food that I thought was healthy is crap and I will no longer stand in your cafeteria assembly line and deal with it anymore. 

I&#39;m really angry .

Your news article said you didn&#39;t notice any change in business from the news. Well you lost ten people right here."

First off, I need to say the food is still great if you like Chipotle. If not, there&#39;s a Qdoba where you can go eat by yourself or with the one or two other Qdoba lovers in the Chicagoland area just across the street. Assuming they are still in business. Just saying.

With that said, the overall time between when I walk through the door and when I bite into my first chicken taco has gone up significantly enough that I now notice it. I am not sure it it&#39;s an issue of more business people coming into the restaurant and ordering for their entire office, or if the staff turnover- also quite noticeable- has meant slower assembly times. Or both. Either way, I&#39;ve had to walk out a couple of times and go elsewhere for food (not Qdoba, which sucks) because things were just taking way too long. 

The greatest sin, however, is entirely the fault of this Chipotle. NO MARGARITAS. I love Chipotle margaritas, especially with a side of chips and guac. This location DOES NOT HAVE THEM. True, margaritas are the first two items on the drink menu. True, there are bottles of liquor easily within view of guests ordering their food. And yet, no margaritas. I have asked about this issue the past several times I&#39;ve gone and gotten wildly different answers from &#34;We don&#39;t have enough tequila right now (but we don&#39;t have any beer in our fridge either?)&#34; to &#34;There&#39;s on one over 21 working, so we can&#39;t sell any,&#34; to &#34;Our liquor license has expired.&#34; Any one of those answers is crap. It means that either &#34;we didn&#39;t order correctly&#34; or &#34;we didn&#39;t schedule correctly&#34; or &#34;we didn&#39;t manage correctly.&#34; Or it could all be cover for serving someone underage in Schaumburg and having your liquor license suspended- also not a ringing endosement of the staff if that&#39;s the case. Any way you cut it, this issue is the fault of this location, and as long as the liquor is out and on the menu, it makes them look bad. 

In either case, if you must have Chipotle, this location will work just fine, just make sure you give yourself some buffer time, and get yourself an iced tea."

If not, there are plenty of other great reviews here. I&#39;m going to consume all this white space outlining what I get, instead. Yummy yummy goodness.

I have forsaken the burritos at Chipotle, their tortillas are for lack of a better term, gummy. I&#39;m sure for some folks it works, I prefer the drier tortillas of any number of local burrito joints around town. But what they don&#39;t offer and Chipotle does is the illustrious BURRITO BOWL. Mmm, delicious burrito bowl. 

Now I know what you&#39;re saying. &#34;Matt, you dumbass, &#34; you&#39;re saying, &#34;you can just empty a burrito into a bowl and have the same thing, you dumbass.&#34; That second dumbass for added emphasis. And yes, I know that&#39;s a possibility but you quite simply don&#39;t get as much from a burrito as you do in a burrito bowl. They add more to compensate for no gummy tortilla. So bang for buck I&#39;ll take my burrito bowl any day.

So on my burrito bowl I get their delicious cilantro lime rice, the fajita onion pepper mix, then a mix of barbacoa and steak for meat then topped with lots of cheese, lettuce, corn salsa and salsa verde. No more, no less. It&#39;s outstanding and amazing, everything a meal should be. Usually I&#39;ll grab a side of the corn salsa in case I feel the need for more while digging in. So good. So, so good.

Yes it&#39;s not real Mexican food and yes there are probably better values out there but I don&#39;t care, Chipotle&#39;s burrito bowl will have me coming back every single time. Viva commercialism!"

Food is always fresh. Whenever something is nearing the end of the available amount, I usually ask if I can wait for the new stuff being made. They always are OK with it. 

Also if you have a smartphone (who doesn&#39;t) you can order ahead of time and pick up your order where you would normally check out."

Despite its not being TRUE Mexican.  It definitely has fresh ingredients in its menu.  I enjoy the corn salsa the most. As it is rather unique and not just your typical tomato-based salsa, which they also have as well. Their salsas range from mild, medium(2 choices) or hot. 

They have crispy, soft-shelled tacos as well as huge burritos filled with their highly-addictive lime rice, beans(vegetarian black beans or pinto beans), vegetables and meats.  Vegetarians need not have to fear from all their meat choices as they also cater to the vegetarian crowd as well. 

I&#39;ve only tried their chicken and steak meat choices and they are well-seasoned and definitely tickle the taste buds.  I also enjoy their guacamole, which is made fresh everyday.  Sometimes though the consistency of the guacamole is dependant on who made it that day. It can be too avocadoey with rather large chunks sometimes in some of the cups of guacamole I&#39;ve had. Or too spicy. I like the balance between the avocado base with their unique spicy-pepper blend. Yes, I&#39;m a guacamole snob...but usually their guacamole is rather delicious.  Their chips have a slight lime tang to them and I think it really accents the guacamole OR salsas rather well. 

If you are on a low carb diet, you can ask for things without rice or tortillas for that matter. They can even give you plain pitas to give to the kids to eat if your kids aren&#39;t that open to trying &#34;spicy&#34; foods.

This location gets busy during lunch and dinner time, so, expect to wait in line for a bit, but not too long as their burrito/taco makers are quick to serve.

As all Chipotles, this location has that sort of odd wood-steel decor and the upbeat mexican music fills the air. They have a patio area as well.

Overall, food is excellent, great service, and I am definitely coming back here with my family often!"

It was my first time and this location, and off the bat I knew something was off.  The customer line was long, and the employees working the food line seemed all over the place.  Out of the 4 people I saw working the line, one ran to the back to grab a rag while in the middle of serving customers, and the cashier left to attend to the dining room, which by the way, was empty and spotless.  Needless to say, it took forever to get our food.  We ate in and watched how they responded to a line that was now to the door.  To my amazement the cashier left the register again (to again a perfectly clean dining room), leaving a woman waiting to pay.  I couldn&#39;t believe it!  He must have left the cashier station at least two other times; I&#39;ve never experienced that before.  As we sat and ate I noticed that 3 people left the line to leave.  Maybe it was the slow service or maybe it was because I was complaining loudly during my entire meal; either way, who can blame them!  I&#39;m willing to try this location again with the hopes for a better managed and organized crew."

There is no close second place, and I love how they stick to their guns. This family goes above and beyond and does things their way... it is terrific 

Burger: Tremendous griddle-style burger with a killer potato bun. Better than Au Cheval and a ridiculous value. 

Beef: Perfect dip, top-quality beef, and the best giardinera I&#39;ve ever had.

Hot dog: This is a DEPRESSION STYLE DOG made famous on the South and West sides during the 1920&#39;s (a la Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s). It is more Chicago than that &#34;drag it through the garden&#34; option and covered in HAND-CUT fries. For those who are not impressed and who want an &#34;authentic Chicago-style Dog,&#34; try the concession stand at Schaumburg Flyers stadium. No factory made poppy-seed buns or frozen links here.

Porchetta Sandwich: The recipe for this alone sandwich alone could get Illinois out of debt. Try it an then take one home for later. It is the best fast-food sandwich in Chicago right now. 

Other can&#39;t-miss items: Homemade meatball sandwich, homemade tamales, homemade Italian Ice... pretty much anything homemade. Who else makes their items by hand? DEFINITELY not Portillo&#39;s.

There are not too many authentic, family-run businesses around, especially those who are so selective about everything that makes it onto their menu. Any rating on this site less than 5-stars is a travesty likely left by someone who would be better suited for lunch at a mall food court."

My father in Law took us to Big Ange&#39;s and I am now a HUGE fan of italian beef and anything else they serve up. My favorite is the homemade eggplant and sausage sandwich, out of this world. The home smoked Brisket is to die for and Kevin&#39;s Homemade recipe for Butternut Squash Tiramisu (ladyfingers soaked in Maple Syrup) is beyond unbelievable. Not only that, the whole staff is amazingly personable and kind (often giving samples of the italian ice, which made my 3 year old happy! Kevin even gave us a slice of the Tiramisu on the house) The place is spotless and impeccably neat. This is a Mom &amp; Pop joint at it&#39;s finest. You can tell how much pride and effort the put into every morsel of food. It&#39;s just delicious. Agree with other posters, not sure how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars, I&#39;m thinking they work for the competitors ;-) This is my favortie and I would eat here daily (while visiting) if I could!

Anyone that complains about the food here should put their head in a toilet and flush it a couple of times because you are full of number 2! You 1 star people are use to McDonald&#39;s and always eatin a Mc this or a Mc that but seriously you are full of McS(beeeep)t or a McTootsie Roll to be politically correct in this crazy world! Don&#39;t get your panties in a bunch like they already are you 1 star people.

Now to the food: The food is absolutely delicious! No matter what you eat here. I&#39;ve eaten at 5 star restaurants and went okay this suck&#39;s worse than eating an ingrown toenail on a Friday night sitting on the couch alone watching Netflix. 

The food here is amazing plain an simple! The homemade meatballs are so deliciously delicious that you would think you died and went to heaven and saw Mother Theresa doing the Irish gig that is how good the meat a balls are. 

Let&#39;s get to the Tri-tip sandwich! All I will say is dear mother of moooooskies the owners take pride in their cooking and it shows... 

To the 1 stars that don&#39;t know anything about home-cut French fries. This place gives you a pound of freaking delicious French Fries, are you kidding me? 1 star complains about ohhh they don&#39;t have cheese sauce! Well sweetheart you want cheese for your fries than GO MILK A GOAT AND PUT YELLOW #7 IN IT IF YOU WANT YOUR DAMN CHEESE FRY SAUCE! The other 1 star complains about how small the fries were, are you kidding me? The fries are so huge even John Holmes would approve!

The Italian Ice... I don&#39;t have to drive in the city anymore! It is homemade and oooooh so delicious!

Now to the 1 stars that complain about the hours... You don&#39;t make the rules! They do! You don&#39;t pay taxes on their property they do. Read the hours of operation, they are closed at 7pm! Do you 1 stars think you can go into your local McDonalds and say hey I know your closing but I want a McDouble... The workers will give you 2 McFingers as they&#39;re kicking your McA** out! So don&#39;t complain about the hours of operation. 

This is a family owned restaurant! They are a good family and I don&#39;t even know them. The food is incredible for the price and running a restaurant that has quality food made by quality chefs speaks volumes on what they are feeding us...

Ohhh...To the 1 star that claims the parking suck&#39;s and he doesn&#39;t want to be a fatality. Well genius open your eyeballs and put toothpicks in them if you can&#39;t see cars in their parking lot!!! Even Stevie Wonder can see that the parking lot is small and it has always been small because you brain never visited Jimmy&#39;s place! The parking lot hasn&#39;t changed in over 50 years!

Last thing... You won&#39;t be disappointed folks! They are new in the business and like everything else in life it takes time to work the kinks out but seriously I&#39;ve seen worse in established restaurants... This family is awesome and love their community and that is the most important.. 

1 star people have no idea what it is like to run a business! They throw rocks at other people&#39;s businesses and think it is cute to write a negative review on someones hard work when it is simply not true. I&#39;m sorry that you keyboard commandos feel compelled and oh so powered to write garbage when you never ran a restaurant! I hope you feel better now that you did that because at the end of the day you live a miserable life in your glass house but want to cast stones on others when your claims are not valid...

We went for lunch today and ordered an Italian Beef, Petite Cheeseburger, &amp; Hot Dog.

The Italian Beef was Tasty but def no comparison to your Chicago Style Beef like Al&#39;s, Johnnies, Portillo&#39;s, etc.  

The Petite Cheeseburger was good but nothing out of the ordinary.

We were really looking forward to the Hot Dog/Fries.  The Fries were really Good (Fresh Cut) but unfortunately we were disappointed with the Hot Dog.  Not sure of the brand they use but def not Vienna &amp; it lacked in taste, snap, and the typical Chicago style toppings.

If you&#39;re looking for a Mediocre Suburban joint for lunch/dinner at reasonable prices then Big Ange&#39;s is your place.  If you grew up in Chicago around the best Beef &amp; Hot Dog joints like I did, there is no comparison &amp; you might be disappointed."

Nice and porky - super tender. Could have eaten it straight out of the bun - it was that good. 

My daughter ordered the signature cheeseburger. She&#39;s a cheeseburger snob and but it got the thumbs up!

The italian ice was delicious! Pieces of fruit embedded  - not too sweet and just tart enough. 

My only complaint were the fries. Should have stayed in the fryer for a few minutes more. A little underdone.

Really good food and decent prices."

And to call it a hot dog place would be like calling the Chicago Marathon a stroll down the city streets with a few friends.  This place has freshly made food from scratch, like the tamales, meatballs, Italian ice, and dessert pies. 

I&#39;ve been anxious for this place to open because I&#39;ve been passing it for years and watching its transformation. So when I saw some cars in the parking lot tonight I stopped in for a quick meal.  Rocco, one of the owners, was so friendly and welcoming, but apologized that he is still a week from officially opening.  When he saw my disappointment he immediately said, &#34;I made meatballs.  Would you like some?&#34;  I asked if I could take it to go and he said, &#34;I&#39;ll make you a sandwich.&#34;  He couldn&#39;t have been nicer.  I could tell he&#39;s very excited to share his food with people.  After he wrapped up the sandwich, he said, &#34;Come try some of my homemade Italian ice!&#34;  There were 2 couples in the restaurant and we all went over to the case and got a serving.  I got his lemon ice and it was wonderful!  When I got home I ate the meatball sandwich.  I love Italian food and rarely am disappointed when I eat it. It&#39;s such a comfort food for me. So even when it&#39;s so-so, I enjoy it. But every so often there is the Italian food that stands far above the rest. Regina&#39;s on Campbell and Vail (now Carlos &amp; Carlos) used to have that kind of Italian food. Great red sauces, fresh ingredients and handmade all kindza stuff.  Ever since Regina&#39;s closed I&#39;ve been looking for that kind of spectacular tasting Italian food. Well when I took the first bite of the meatball sandwich I realized I&#39;d found it again. The red sauce on the meatballs was so good I wanted to rush back and get more.  It has a flavor that makes you want to put it in a bowl, tear off a piece of fresh bread and eat it like soup!  

I&#39;m so excited to know this place is more of an improvement than just the building and decor. I know it will be a frequent stop for me. My only hope is that Rocco will offer his sauce in containers to go!"

The food is incredible, the staff is so friendly, and the atmosphere is fun. 

I was a little nervous ordering their signature burger - no lettuce and tomatoes here! Instead they have a spicy Dijon mayo/mustard, pickles, and minced red onion. I honestly wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d like it since I generally am not a fan of those things. But my mother in law had been to Big Ange&#39;s before us and told me she had the same reservations but I had to try it and I&#39;d change my mind. After the first bite I knew she was right. Every day since then I swear I have dreamed of that burger. It is absolutely delicious, and the toppings are perfect, I wouldn&#39;t change a thing!

The fries are plentiful and delicious (you can easily share between 2 or 3 people). They are those nice, substantial fries that still have a little skin on them, and they are cooked perfectly. 

The lemonade is incredible - with a blend of oranges and lemons it&#39;s like nothing you&#39;ve had before.

My father in law had a meatball sub and my husband had a beef and gave rave reviews for each, but I honestly don&#39;t know if I can stray from my delicious burger to try anything else.

Save room for Italian Ice! It&#39;s homemade and there are a bunch of different flavors to choose from. 

Overall a great restaurant that will hopefully become a staple in the community! We love Big Ange&#39;s!"

We tried to go on the day the ran out of food and were closed. Went back the next week and found the burger to have a mushy bun and very little choice of condiments. Portions were inconsistent. The three of us all had vastly different amounts of fries.The fries were also inconsistently cooked, some white and mushy inside, and some very dark.

The decor is conflicted. They have a 50&#39;s pastel palette on the walls, but the staff wear primary colors and the artwork is a mix of blues musicians and what looks like Caribbean inspired art. No music playing, even though they have music notes painted on the walls. 

Not much atmosphere,  inconsistent food. I can think of a half dozen other places that sell the same food, but do it better."

I walked in and saw about a dozen employees chatting.  I stood looking at the menu (nothing remarkable) honestly I thought this was a hit dog place from their application to the village and then when I saw their sign thought it would be Mardi Gras inspired.  It looks as if this is kitchen favorites from whomever big Ange is.  

The menu needs some better descriptions - the restaurant smells like cleaning product (not fantastic food) 

I will come back but I have little time for people that cannot say hello- welcome- especially to their one customer."

We stopped here for lunch and are talking about going for dinner before they close today ;0 

Tamales are homemade and authentic. The tri tip sandwich is filled with tender slices of beef and the potato roll they serve it on is soft and fresh. The burgers are cooked perfectly, comes with their own special sauce and you can add bacon :) whatever the sauce is it is tasty. 

They always have specials, this last time we.visited we picked up a lb of rib tips, soooo good, better than most BBQ joints I&#39;ve visited, they season everything perfectly. My husband also got the BBQ brisket sandwich special, filled with tender meat just like the tri tip was! 

AND they also have homemade deserts,different options both times we have visited. The peach cobbler was to die for, they topped it with fresh whipped cream too! We haven&#39;t tried the Italian ice yet but plan on it for the next visit, they have like 6 different flavors to choose from all homemade 

Yeah, their parking lot isn&#39;t the greatest... but for food this good I really don&#39;t care! Glad it is a close drive to home, one of my new favorites for a filling lunch!!!"

After reading a few reviews on here, I was really curious to try the food. It absolutely did not disappoint! I got the Italian &#34;Porchetta&#34; Pork sandwich after sampling a taste of the pork. It was incredible! Great texture, super moist, full of flavor. My husband got the Italian Beef &amp; it was delicious. My young kids split a petite cheeseburger - we of course tasted it &amp; loved that as well! There was a special sauce that made it really stand out. 
We had some Italian ice as well - 6 homemade flavors (almost all made with fresh fruit) to choose from &amp; they were generous in letting us sample. 
They are family owned &amp; you feel welcomed in as soon as you walk in the door. Friendly people who seem to truly care that their customers are happy. 
This place quickly just became one of our favorites!!"

&#34;Thing&#34;,...the essence of food made with love.
What I tasted was an eggplant parm. sandwich that was succulent and tasted like it was made by my Italian Mama!
The marinara sauce had the most soothing end taste notes,that brought a satisfying smile to my face.
Very yummy and very satisfying.

The hand cut fries, doubled fried the old school way,tasted great. Just the right amount of soaked oil but not greasy to the touch. They were served in a brown lunch bag, old school presentation.

I had a Lemmon Italian ice. It was very good. It looked and tasted homemade. I wished it was made with a lot less lemon rind bits. The rind bits were a little overwhelming.

The omvionce of the resturant was awesome. I enjoyed the modern yet nostalgic vibe as I savored my lunch. The bathroom well decorated that reminded me of my rich Aunt&#39;s powder room. lol

I look forward to tasting and enjoying another lunch there soon.
Absolutly worth the tight  parking situation.

Delicious food with abundant portions at an economical price.  

I had the meatball sandwich which was perfect.  Just enough sauce to need a few extra napkins.  The 3 meatballs could have been by themselves, they were done great and didn&#39;t need the sauce to bring them back to life.  The sauce was a good balance of tomato and seasoning not too sweet or acidic.  I&#39;m picky as I have Taylor Street as my local Italian food.  Fresh cut fries which were just crispy on the outside, the portion is great to share which we did.  Finished it off with a cantaloupe Italian ice, refreshing and oh so yummy.  

Others in our group had the Italian beef with sweet peppers, I&#39;m getting that next time, it looked mouth watering good.  Polish sausage with caramelized onions.  Cheeseburger with the works.  They group sampled more of the eight flavors of Italian ice.  All of us walked away stuffed and happy with our choices and thinking about next time. 

The decor is light and airy which helped to detract from watching the Cubs loss on the muted big screen tv.  Tunes in the background were at the right balance to give energy to the place without overwhelming our conversation.  

Staff were friendly, helpful, and conscientious about environment. 

Kudos to Big Ange&#39;s looking forward to my next time to try that Italian beef or maybe the Porchetta..."

We came after rush hour (right before they closed) so they were out of &#34;porchetta&#34; and pork for the Italian &#34;porchetta&#34; pork sandwiches, so instead I got the Italian eggplant sandwich which was very, very good! The eggplant was perfectly cooked and the marinara sauce was great on the sandwich! The fries were perfect! Personally, I like a LOT of ice in my drinks so to me the lemonade was not cold enough but it was very nice! The staff there was warm, welcome, and friendly. My favorite thing was the Italian ice. I got the Piña Colada Ice and Oh my gosh! So good! It has little chunks of pineapple and shreds of coconut. I would for sure recommend trying it! However, be warned there is very little parking.

I had a hot dog with fries and the Italian &#34;porchetta&#34; pork sandwich.  The hot dog was a pretty standard Chicago style hot dog, and I mean that in a good way!  The fries were delicious too.  The porchetta blew me away.  The combination of the roasted pork, herbs, spices, and basil mayo came together for a really great sandwich.  If you don&#39;t know what to get on your first visit, I definitely recommend that one to everyone.  I also had a blue raspberry Italian ice which was quite good.  They have a decent selection of flavors to choose from including watermelon, pina colada, lemon, strawberry, and a few others.  I&#39;ll definitely be trying some of the other flavors on future visits.

Nice atmosphere with all the rock &#39;n roll and blues inspired decorations.  The staff was incredibly friendly too.  My friend and I were leaving right before they closed, and they gave us a couple of free sandwiches on our way out so they didn&#39;t have to toss away the left overs."

Went in this evening around 6:30 pm and it was hopping. First problem you have to walk through seated diners to get to register. There was a wait so some kid was giving out free samples of Italian ice and then randomly stopped. Guy at register totally confused overwhelmed etc. I think the owner was ready to leave but had to step in. Then one of the family I think who was schmoozing guests tells his friends in line to sit tight and then buts in and orders for him. Lots and lots of schmoozing. Wait time 8 minutes. 

I order hot dogs with no mustard or relish and they say so just onions and hot peppers? I said what about tomato and pickles? Nope don&#39;t have long pickles, tomato or celery salt. Fries are over $3 comes with fries whether you want them or not. I ordered two tamales sorry no tamales. I ordered the prime rib sandwich with fried onions, but it was $9 and no fries? 

Hot dogs made immediately and sat and sat while some old guy hand cut the prime rib very slowly. Wait time 13 minutes. 

Get the food home and hot dogs were ok, fries good, prime rib delicious. 

So.... Terrible service, hard to park and move about, high prices, out of food, ok food, waiting forever for them to open only to show up and have them closed then try again and they are out of food. I think I&#39;m sufficiently unimpressed which is sad."

They do not come with ketchup, they come with a dijon mayo red onion and pickles so if that is how you like them, great or order them the way you prefer. The fries are more of a natural cut and you get a generous portion as a side. The Italian beef is very flavorful. There are numerous varieties of Italian ice to try.  They gave us samples, all very good. The meatball sandwich was delicious.  I enjoyed the lemonade. It is a mix of lemons and oranges, very refreshing...not too sweet.

An expanded menu, but not overpowering. We ordered simple.  2 petite cheeseburgers and went with one of their signature sandwiches  Italian Eggplant/Sausage Sandwich Combo. The eggplant is lightly battered and sautéed, topped with provolone cheese, a grilled Italian sausage on an Italian hoagie bun with a lot of red sauce. Quite a mess to eat but delicious. My lunch companions enjoyed their cheeseburgers commenting on the tasty bun and fresh made patty. They compared it with a steak &amp; shake burger and said Big Ange&#39;s Petite Cheeseburger was bigger &amp; better. We all enjoyed the hand cut fries, which were not overly greasy.

They said they would open before the Cubs won their next World Series, and they did it, Big Ange&#39;s that is.  I do think the Cubs will do it this year also.

My wife and I came here on opening day.  It was fabulous. Everything we had, the Italian Porchetta Pork Sandwich, Beef and Sausage Combo, fries, their homemade lemonade (a blend of lemons and oranges, really different and great tasting), meatball sample and Italian Ice samples were all excellent, no complaints at all.

The inside decor is very light, lively and easy on the eyes.  You can see owner&#39;s Ang and John&#39;s music background with many photos of local bands and a nice sampling of guitars up on the walls.  Reminded me a bit of a mini Hard Rock Cafe.  Even the restroom was great, big, and attractive looking.  The music playing in the background throughout the restaurant was really nice also, good selections, loud enough, but not too loud.  The outside landscaping is excellent looking.  Looks like it has been there for years.  

The restaurant had to close after the first day as they were overwhelmed with customers and ran out of food, first day.  They replenished and reopened after 4 days, also with additional employees to handle the crowds.

I went back today for a takeout order.  The place was comfortably crowded, midafternoon, after lunch time, before dinner time. Today we ordered combos again, hot dog, tamale and fries.  The hot dog was great, nice taste, a good snap to the skin, Vienna for sure. The tamale was really unique.  Here is from their menu...&#34;Handmade &#34;In House&#34; (Pork tamale with smoked green chilies and avocado salsa, wrapped in corn husk)&#34;.  I don&#39;t think I have ever had a better one, even from very authentic Mexican restaurants. 

The entire staff is super friendly.

Make sure to stop if in the area, or even somewhat nearby, you will be glad you did.

Best wishes to Ang, John and their son Rocco.  You guys have a winner here.

The ordering seemed confusing to me, and that went on down the line of people (relatives). The Last person in this line was very nice which made this ordering more palatable. The main reason I&#39;m writing this is while I was sitting eating my food, one of the worker behind the line came out sat down with a customer/friend to talk. Rubbing his pants, chair, hugging his friends, he was wearing his plastic food serving gloves while with his friends. (which look like they have been on for serval hours, should be changed every 20-30 minutes). While I did not follow him back in to the cook line, I&#39;m sure he changed his gloves?

I had their double cheeseburger (which they call a &#34;signature cheeseburger&#34;, fries and a tamale. Everything seemed fresh and made to order. The cheeseburger was passable, no more. While a rung above your typical chain fast food burger, the meat just wasn&#39;t very tasty. I did like the fact that they allowed me to substitute a thick onion slice for their standard minced onions. Also, the patties are rather small, just slightly bigger than a McDonald&#39;s junior patty.

The fresh cut fries were very good, flavorful and nicely cooked. The rather unusual pork tamale was also quite good, if a bit pricey.

Their service was friendly and fairly efficient. Others have mentioned the tiny and cramped parking lot which is a serious issue (an accident waiting to happen for every visit). The indoor seating isn&#39;t exactly spacious, but they do have an outdoor patio."

Also ordered a hot dog (no Chicago style option) which was thrown in the bag with fries that were underdone. There was also trays of some kind of breaded patty just sitting out on racks. My prediction. They&#39;ll be closed before the Cubs win the World Series. That is, if they win it this year."

I was eagerly awaiting the opening of Big Ang&#39;s and finally was able to check it out for the first time yesterday with my dad and niece. We arrived a few minutes before 5 and there was no wait. Loved how it was decorated. We were greeted by an extremely friendly staff. John, the owner, gave us free tastes of the meat they use in their Porchata sandwich. SO good!! Definitely getting that next time. My dad and I got hot dogs with everything and fries and my niece got the meatball sub. I was disappointed that the dog didn&#39;t have tomatoes or a sliced pickle but it was good. The fries made up for it. Love fresh cut fries. The meatball sub was fantastic!!  John visited our table and gave us free samples of the homemade Italian ice he makes there. I had the pina colada-pineapple with coconut. Yum!! My niece tried the lime and my dad had the classic lemon. There were real pieces of fruit mixed in. Very good!! I can&#39;t wait to go back and support this small business!

The biggest surprise was the eggplant sandwich with sausage, I don&#39;t think I ever would have ordered that , but decided to try it , it was so good . The cheeseburger is outstanding, the meat tastes Absolutely Fresh and the bun just makes it perfect.

Since they&#39;ve opened, we&#39;ve tried a few items. The Signature Cheeseburger with chopped red onions and dijon mustard/mayo sauce and was AMAZING!!! I never order directly from the menu but one of the owners told me if I didn&#39;t like it he would refund me and give me whatever I like. We loved it! No complaints at all. Perfectly seasoned burger and very tasty. The french fries were also great, well seasoned and delicious. My husband has ordered the Italian beef and he said he liked it a lot more than Portillo&#39;s. A great portion of beef and very flavorful. A friend of ours ordered the hotdog and he said it was pretty standard, and tasted good. I&#39;ve only tasted their lemon ice and strawberry ice. The strawberry was FANTASTIC and extremely addicting. The owner told us it has no additives and only is ice, sugar and strawberries. Super refreshing and delicious on a hot summer day (or anyday)! We live walking distance away and absolutely hope to make this place a normal weekly treat for ourselves! Try them out!!! I should also add the staff were AMAZING and all super nice and helpful. It kinda stinks that they&#39;re closed Monday and Sunday and are only open 11-7 during the days they&#39;re open but I can see them changing that once they get settled and iron out all the kinks!"

Their egg, bacon and hash brown skillet is out of the world... 

Huge portion sizes but can&#39;t resist finishing the whole meal.. :D 
Love their bread basket. Consists of freshly baked breads, muffins and Danishes. 
I also recommend their pancakes!

It is interesting that the meaning of Omega is the end as this will likely be the last time I come to Omega. This place has always had a place in my heart when I think of dining. I first went to the location in Niles Illinois which was a great supper restaurant. Their meals would always include a wonderful breadbasket, a hearty soup, a menu that had many items that changed daily, and a dessert. I recently came back here for lunch and found it a little bit disappointing. It will a lot of the desserts had changed there was no longer the strawberry cheesecake but a lot of different pies and premade. The breadbasket was still nice however what was missing was the long crackers and other type of fresh pastries. Don&#39;t get me wrong the price is very cheap for the food you get. I ordered a Philly steak sandwich and I&#39;m not exactly sure what I got. It came out on a garlic bread roll which gave it a very weird taste. In addition the Philly steak was not sliced well, it was very chewy and difficulty eating.I usually look forward to the soup which was a beef and barley soup however it was so salty that it was barely edible. The server was still nice sort of like the old diner charm however it did not make up for the type of food they served. I don&#39;t think I will be back based on this eating experience any longer

Pros: Low price, traditional diner experience, and you can make your meal a complete meal including dessert and coffee for an additional fee

Cons: The food is no longer good in my opinion

Hidden deals:
They have a menu that changes every day with the menu insert. There&#39;s also daily specials"

The busboys kept asking to take our dishes away while we were still eating. We tried to explain that they came to our table over 8 times in a 5 minute period. It really upset my wife to the point she got up and left.The manager&#39;s response was not at all comforting.  He said it&#39;s hard to get good help. I left thinking they are not going to fix this. Even the waitress said the busboys should be assigned to certain tables and not have each one (5 of them) pollenating each table over and over.

I will not return. An upsetting experience.

BTW, I was really happy to find a single piece of clam in my bowl of clam chowder. Whippy!! I thought by mistake they gave me cream of potato soup.  Honesty, I don&#39;t know how they get away with it. Sorry I didn&#39;t save the piece of clam for the cook to reuse it."

Not nice at all.  Very poor food and we had an issue and now we will not go back.   I do not feel like they cared if we come back.  so I bid this place farewell!

We will not be going back here after coming here over 30 years!

We came in with a groupon and some in front of me standing in line hit my hand by accident and the groupon was marked redeem.  Did Omega do anything to try to help us?  No one thing some kind person google the corp office of Groupon.  Omega stool and stared at us like we were criminals!  I said we will never come back to Omega ever again!  They did not care.

What would have been the right way to handled this is to take us aside, help us call groupon and assisted us in a professional manor!  Of course that didn&#39;t happen!  This is very sad because I have been coming here since I was a kid!  Poor customer service wins."

Add a little lemon to it for a little zest or kick to it. Try it once, and you&#39;ll probably do the same the next time too. We wish Omega was open 24 hours like it used to be back in the day...

Everything is clean and the wait staff is great.  The hostess seems to remember everyone and is always social with the crowd. Also some of the best coffee I have ever tasted.  Can&#39;t go wrong with this place.  Pancakes have excellent flavor and they can substitute hash browns for fruit if you&#39;re trying to decrease your carb intake.

Only negative is the price of their glass of orange juice.  Wish it was a little cheaper.  

Overall, highly recommend."

I can&#39;t remember anything about that meal. Oh well. I did come here last week for dinner, though. We only came here because they were having a fundraising night for the school I work at: 50% of the bill (before taxes) would be donated to the school PTA. Since I live so close, I figured... why not?

We were pleasantly surprised at the large bread basket they placed on the table. I love bread. I eat too much bread. I ate too much bread here. The bread was good!

My husband ordered a burger and I ordered a veggie melt sandwich. Both came with soup. I had the french onion soup since the two other soups had meat in them. I&#39;m not really a fan of french onion. This one was good. I think. I&#39;ve never had it before so I wasn&#39;t sure what to compare it to, but it&#39;s definitely not a soup I&#39;d pick in the future if I have other options.

When my meal arrived, I was shocked at how large it was and how it wasn&#39;t a sandwich at all. The two slices of bread were side by side with large amounts of avocado and cheese draped over them. If you need to know something about me and food, I just CANNOT stand the sight of mounds of white, melted cheese draped over food. I was already repulsed. And the slices simply could not be put together as a sandwich. Disappointed, I cut a piece of the bread off anyway and tried it. YE-UCK! The Swiss cheese on top was mixed with Cesar dressing -- two of my not-so-preferred options mixed together just made me want to puke. I couldn&#39;t eat this.

When the waitress came back, I told her, &#34;Um... I don&#39;t really like this. At all.&#34; She promptly went to speak to a manager, came back, grabbed my plate, and told me I could order something else off the menu. OK, cool. I ordered an entree with breaded fish and a side of veggies. This meal came after my husband already finished his, but the fish was good! The veggies were OK -- I took them home. They&#39;re actually still sitting in my fridge. Oops! Our bill was about $25. Our waitress was really sweet and gracious throughout the whole meal(s) and we were thankful for that, too.

I have no desire to come back here simply because it just isn&#39;t my scene and I prefer other spots for breakfast and dinner. However, I was really impressed with their customer service and the prices weren&#39;t too bad. I can understand why people like to come here."

The food looked delicious and there was a lot however when I began eating it, the taste was overwhelming that these folks cook with rancid oil.  They do not change their oil often enough.  The eggs and hash browns were dripping with this old cooking oil.

I really wanted to like Omega House.  The people seem nice.  They heaped a lot of food into the breakfast skillet (enough for 3 people).  The service was fast and cost a lot cheaper than The Egg Basket however, these folks need to change whatever grease they are using, it&#39;s old.  I would rather pay extra for them changing their cooking grease / oil more.  I ended up giving this to our dog and I&#39;m not a picky eater.

I don&#39;t honestly know what grease or oil they are cooking with but it ruined their food, twice.  Yes the food looked appetizing, fresh, arranged nicely but again, use old, rancid cooking oil and it will ruin the flavor.

I wonder if they are also using lard because it&#39;s cheap.  When I do my eggs and hash browns at home, I simply use the Pam Spray or a tiny bit of FRESH Olive Oil."

We chose Omega since we both haven&#39;t been to it and have been wanting to try it for some time.  We get there get a seat immediately and order fairly quickly as well.  The only thing that was good was the waitress and the pickle.  

I ordered a Malibu panini that had Turkey, bacon, avocado, and cheese.  The turkey was of a Grey coloring and had a horrible texture.   Overall the sandwich was pretty horrible.  The fries were mushy and super store bought.  My boyfriend&#39;s hashbrowns were soggy and the omelet was of a weird texture and had a huge ball of cheese randomly placed.  We both love cheese but don&#39;t stick balls of cheese in our mouths for a reason;  because it&#39;s unpleasant.  

When I went to pay the woman she asked how it was, I said &#34;honestly not that good&#34;. I hardly ever complain when I&#39;m buying food because I used to work in the food industry and it&#39;s a tough business.

Went here around July/August 2014 and the place is much smaller than the location by Golf Mill Mall. 

Walked in and was told to give them 5 minutes. Turned around and within a minute was able to get seated. BONUS

Service was not great as the lady seemed to be too overwhelmed. She seems like she wanted to help the &#39;older&#39; tables first rather than a table with 2 kids (10 &amp; 14 yro) I had to ask for drinks as no one came to just give it to us. Food wasn&#39;t great either but it kept us content for a bit. We all had breakfast items and it was just decent. Decent to the pint where I can&#39;t even remember my fish. So nothing &#39;wowed&#39; me. 

I would go back to Omega near Golf Mill Mall any day, this place, not so much."

My wife and I would take are teen boys there couple times a month. We had no problems at first. The last couple times we went the service was very slow. My wife would ask what&#39;s taking so long and they would say something like &#34;oh we sent people home cause its a slow night, one of the cooks called in sick.&#34; So the last time we were there about a week ago. We ordered food, again it took forever to get are orders. My son had a buuflo chicken wrap, it was stone cold. We called the waitress over, he told her it was cold. She said let me get the manager. The manager ( a old guy) came over and asked what the problem was. My wife and son both told him it was cold. He proceeded to say &#34; I should have known you were going to complain about something. Why do you come here when all you ever do is complain. You and your family complain every time your here&#34; well needless to say we will never be going back to this place.

I haven&#39;t been there since I was little so I figured I&#39;d give it another try.  My co-workers and I were craving a breakfast for lunch type of thing and Omega is only a couple blocks away from our office so we decided to order from there.  The takeout was super fast.  We had three meals and they said it&#39;d be about 15 minutes and it was ready promptly at the 15 minute mark.  

My co-worker order the turkey island melt which I was also debating on getting, she said the bread was horrible, it looked like a soggy mess, but everything else was okay.  I ordered the Delicate Suzette Crepes French Toasty that was covered in strawberries and an orange sauce.  They were just okay.  There was a large amount for what you pay but nothing special.  I don&#39;t know if its because my sister spoils me with amazingly delicious crepes or if these were just not that good.  I also ordered hash browns which were abnormally dry and tasteless.  I know potatoes don&#39;t taste like much anyways but these were not good.  I only took a couple bites.  My other coworker seemed to enjoy his food - eggs, toasty, hash browns, and bacon.  I tried the bacon and it was pretty good.  

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go to Omega - there&#39;s a breakfast place on the same street that&#39;s better.  But, I would eat from here again if we ordered.  Definitely would try something different.

Oh it was a little on the pricy side as well for a breakfast type place."

Not a big deal but with a packed house and a wait, I would expect something a little better. 2) they put us in a table that basically blocks access to restrooms so people were bumping me try to get past. 3) Then they moved our table to make more room, but in doing so jerked the table into my daughter&#39;s fingers making her scream. Slow the hell down and try communicating with patrons. 4) coffee is still empty. Has been for 10+ minutes. 5) asked for water. Never got it. 6) wife orders coke 3-4 times before they finally brought it. 

All in all never coming back. Don&#39;t even care what the food tastes like when it arrives.

As an update, once we got the food, the pancakes were okay. Eggs were eggs, hash browns kind of clumpy. The ham was good though. I never got silverware. I had to take it from another table. Some silverware was dirty. Basically, you have other choices. This super crowded place was on par with Denny&#39;s."

Most of the time it is breakfast. Experience for this is pretty good. Decent food. Good service, prices are fine. I like the omlettes or skillets. The pancakes are good too. Avoid the bread basket, because who knows what the previous customers have done to it? Waitresses here are very good. Even the busboys have stepped up and refilled coffee or water.

However, on my last visit, my wife and I went in for dinner. The manager was on the phone by the entrance. We stood there, waiting to be seated, while he was talking and talking. He didnt acknowledge us (not a good start). Finally, we were about to be seated. They had closed the back area off. There was a larger group with a noisy child. Because of this, we asked him if we could be seated in the first booth on the other side. He explained that it was closed. My wife asked me &#34;do you want to go somewhere else?&#34; (loud enough for him to hear) and I said &#34;yea, I dont want to sit near that noise.&#34; (he heard this, too)

 To my surprise, we left without the manager saying or doing anything to keep us. I have not been back since.

In their service industry, customers are your life blood. (and we&#39;re always right)  If you can keep us there by responding to a reasonable request (or explaining why you can&#39;t) you should do so."

The last 2 years however, something has been &#34;off&#34;. The soup is no longer good. :( it is either over salted or almost tasteless. The Sunday cream of chicken with rice is terrible. Almost no chicken flavor and is an odd off white color. It tasted like white sauce with rice. The fries tasted like they were cooked in old stale oil. There is also a strong odor of &#34;perfume&#34; and old spice in the air.....which my son noticed right when we walked in.

Janie is still our favorite waitress - she just gets it.  Prompt, kind and even a little funny.  She just makes the meal so much more enjoyable when we get her.

The soups are much better than I remember from a couple years ago.  We have been going more often again and between the good, hearty soups, the fresh bread basket and the good service.  This is a good spot for a quick and casual meal.  

I&#39;ve broadened my horizons a bit and have found that I like the Grecian Chicken Breast...hash browns instead of rice please. The rice pudding is good.  The breakfast options always hit the spot.

Our waitress took our drink order right away and brought us some delicious fresh fruit. She came back a few minutes later and took our breakfast order. Wait time for our food was average. Food came out piping hot and was tasty. I ordered a veggie skillet and was slightly disappointed that there were so few veggies and lots of cheese. Don&#39;t get me wrong I love cheese but wish there had been more veggies. The hash browns were so delish. We will likely go back.

*Baskets of bread that look ancient

*A balloon machine

*Disgusting gumball machine and crusty mint/lollypop tray

*March of Dimes quarter collection

*Outdated plastic-covered booths

CHECK!  We have a winner here!

But, what you also get is: 

*no b/s service!

*Good, fresh salads (they are made to order)

* Well-cooked omlettes (although they are on the bit greasy side)

As soon as they realized that people loved their soup and would take it home in quarts, they DOUBLED the price.  So, we just don&#39;t go that often anymore.

Today I went to lunch there with my daughter because we both had a taste for soup.  The server brought me a bowl of chicken shell soup.  1/2 way through my bowl I felt something sharp and pretty big in my mouth, (thought I broke a tooth!!!) and spit it out to find a CHICKEN BONE!!!  YIKES.

I brought it to the attention of the server and could tell that she went to tell the owners but they had no intention of doing anything about it.

When I went to pay the bill, the owner asked if everything was O.K. I told her all but the chicken bone I found in my soup.  She said (unsympathetic) &#34;did she bring you another one?&#34;. I said, &#34;NO, I wouldn&#39;t want another one!!!&#34;  If one bowl has a bone in the same batch, wouldn&#39;t they all????? She just kind of pretended like I didn&#39;t say anything at all, took my money and we were on our way.

Funny thing is,,,on my way in I saw a &#34;YELP likes us&#34; sticker posted on their door!!  LOL

She could have at least PRETENDED like she cared as she took my money!!

We arrived at 10:45 and the restaurant was busy as usual. I&#39;ve eaten here on plenty of weekend mornings so this was not a surprise. We were seated within a totally acceptable timeframe and promptly placed our orders. The waitress was very nice and as responsive as she could be with the number of tables she had. After about 45 minutes, we flagged her down as we hadn&#39;t received our meals. She advised the kitchen did not make one of the four meals that were ordered and the chef was fighting with her about it. Shortly thereafter, 3 of the 4 meals arrived. They were cold. The waitress then delivered the 4th meal and we advised the other meals were cold. She apologized and said she could reheat them. We declined as we had to be somewhere shortly. She advised she would send the manager over. Rita, the manager, then comes over to the table. She first blames the waitress for the issues with our food. As this point, we don&#39;t care what the reason is and a manger pushing blame seems ridiculous. She then mildly apologizes as she walks away saying &#34;I&#39;ll give you a discount&#34;. Her response was incredibly disappointing. Regardless of the reason, it seems inappropriate for the manager to put blame on someone else. I&#39;ve worked in the service industry. A manager apologizing and attempting to make some form of amends is all that is required. She then applied a $5 discount for the cold meals. Uh, thanks for nothing Rita.

I have been coming here for a long time and as of recently, they have really been slacking. I actually have their number saved in my cell so I can call ahead and check on the soups for that day. Yes, I base my decision as to whether to go their or not, on the soup. I&#39;m a picky PITA that way.  The soup lately has been lacking. Normally, its overflowing with delectable veggies and nice chucks of beef or chicken (depending on the soup) and over the past few months, the soup has just been unsatisfying. The bread has a tenancy to be old. I should really find out what day they get their bread and head over that day. Their cream of chicken soup never really has disappointed me except that sometimes the amount of chicken is lacking.

The food is always pretty good. I typically order the Grecian chicken breast with rice pilaf and veggies with my bowl of soup. The chicken is always perfect- no joke. They got that down to a science. The rice is fine but the veggies are always soggy and mushy no matter what time of day it is. [as I write this, I&#39;m wondering why we still go here????]. My boyfriend orders the Chicken stir fry- I know...I don&#39;t know why, but it&#39;s actually pretty good and the veggies are much better than what comes on my plate.

You get a free dessert with most dinner entrees and their desserts are pretty decent. German Chocolate Cake is our favorite. We&#39;ll be back, but, like I said, I don&#39;t know why. :)"

It&#39;s also usually hangover breakfast, which means lots and lots of grease. 

I&#39;ve never had anything other than breakfast at Omega. Is it anything to brag about? Not so much. The food is your average diner fare. It&#39;s not fabulous...but it&#39;s not like eating cafeteria food either. I usually go for the two egg chicken coop which consists of two eggs ((as you like them)) with bacon//sausage//ham, potatoes, and toast. If you so desire, two buttermilk pancakes may be substituted for toast or potatoes. I always go for the pancakes ((best to sop up an alcohol belly)). And all this for about $6.50. Nice and cheap! 

Service is, you know, standard diner service. I like to put it as &#34;it is what it is&#34;. The servers don&#39;t love their jobs and they sometimes dish out more than just food ((like &#39;tudes)). And you typically have to have your water refilled. However, service is usually quite fast which is a plus.

Their breakfast is unbelievable and generously portioned. My fave? The Hobo Skillet w/eggs over-easy (don&#39;t knock it, til you try it). Their daily specials are also fabulous, so if you are unsure what to get, don&#39;t hesitate to refer to those.

Its only down-side is that it gets pretty busy, so if you are hungry, have some extra pieces of bread and butter while you wait. I&#39;m not going to lie, though, I can&#39;t wait to get my oil changed in a month."

better barbecued ribs than actual rib joints? The full slab of
ribs I enjoyed at Omega were meaty and tender and smothered
in a tangy barbecue sauce...unbelievable.

I have also enjoyed more standard fare at Omega, including
omelettes, pancakes, the Buffalo Chicken wrap, and
Broiled Whitefish, which were outstanding.

Coffee is always good and being refilled by a friendly staff--
and the hostess always welcomes me like family.

And the Beef Barley Soup on Tuesdays...always hits the spot!

What is there not to like at Omega?

Oh, and the bakery has Baklava...dangerous..oh yea."

Bugs in the salad, OK as disgusting as that sounds, it is really understandable. Being given a bread basket with a piece of bread already bitten. Hmm, still didn&#39;t complain since mistakes do happen, but on my last visit, this was definitely the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Had my heart set on potato pancakes, and they had a special, so definitely was excited to order my favorite. Normally I enjoy the potato pancakes, but on this occasion, I am disgusted and in pure shock at the decline of quality and service of this once great restaurant. While on my second bite, I bit into a metal string. Yes, a metal, not plastic string. I cannot put into words exactly what my thoughts were at that moment. My friend called over the waitress who wanted to take away the plate but i requested a manager. Although our waitress was very apologetic, the service from her was great I cannot say the same about whoever the supposedly new manager was. Yes he apologized, yes he explained what the metal piece is, which by the way is a scrubber to clean the grill with. He said he&#39;d take it off the bill and walked away. Our waitress came back to our table and was very apologetic and offered me something else, of course i declined. than again offered an apology and said the whole meal was on them. Okay great, but was it her responsibility or the manager to apologize, offer something else or tell us our meal was on them? i cannot or will not in my right mind come back here again or even recommend it to anyone."

Our friends had been here before but this was our first time.  We were seated very quickly and our waitress came over very quickly to take our drink orders even though the place was pretty busy.  We looked over the menu and the specials for the night and two of us decided on the Pork Tenderloin specials, and the other two got the Roast Leg of Lamb.  Our waitress, who looked like she&#39;s been at this for a long while, was an absolute doll!  She absolutely knew how to take care of her customers.  I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t catch her name.  Our food came out, and our waitress brought the sauce for the Leg of Lamb on the side, saying that not everyone likes it on the meat.  Thank God she did that!  The leg of lamb was excellent, very tender and well flavored, but the sauce had absolutely no taste at all of any kind and was overly salty!  The Pork Tenderloin was breaded, which was not in the menu description, and again overly salty.  The dinners came with soups and deserts.  I had the carrot cake which was huge and very good, all the others had spumoni ice cream which was....well ice cream.  The food, meaning soups and entree&#39;s could use much less salt.  I felt like the cook was trying to sabotage the owner&#39;s business by over salting everything.  If you go there, ask for no salt on your entree&#39;s and you might luck out.

This place deserves 5 stars for our waitress and 3 stars for our food due to the saltiness of the food.  I gained 2-1/2 pounds overnight...yep water retention due to salt!  Try it once and tell them to ease off on the salt and see if it works.  We will give them another try and ask them to take it easy on the salt."

I pointed it out to the waitress who told the owner. A younger man came over and said he was sorry told us it was a tooth from the brush they use to clean the grill. Well, ok. After that my appetite was completely gone and I barely touched my food. When the check came the owner had take the hashbrowns off the bill. A whopping $1.37.

There&#39;s a variety of food here that are averagely priced. Good portions, I might add. I had the crepes with strawberries with a side of Canadian bacon. My husband had steak and eggs, with a side of pancake and hash browns. He devoured everything except for the pancake. I took home half of my order plus the pancake. We were stuffed.

On our way out while my hubby was paying, I noticed there were sweets displayed by the entrance. They had quite a variety of sweets, but since there was baklava, I decided to order two slices to take home. After the lady placed each of the baklavas in two small plastic containers, one of the containers fell &amp; I noticed the slices were smaller than the usual slices I normally get from other bakeries. I was ticked that the lady didn&#39;t place the 2 containers in a bag in the first place. To top it off, when I was ready to pay for them, the guy informs me that the charge for the two slices was $7.22. I couldn&#39;t believe they charged $3+ for a small slice of baklava! I had to repeat the price he mentioned and the guy asked me if I ever had baklava before. Like I haven&#39;t had one before. Note to self: Go to Caputo&#39;s on Lake St. next time I have a taste for baklava. I can get four big slices for the price I&#39;m getting charged here.

I would recommend Omega based on the breakfast we had. We will have to try their lunch and dinner next time, but will have to skip the dessert display, which I think is just overpriced."

Lunch and dinner... not so good. Yesterday, we ordered breakfast to go. It was good... I say just good. I had the jr. apple pancake. Which took 45 mins to cook. No big deal. However, not really worth the wait. Not sure it was because we order take out..or what? It just was not that good. The crust was soft and mushy, and just fell apart. the inside, was jammed packed with apples and filling- not fully cooked. I usually order a skillet,  which is always really good. I think I will just stick with that in the future. They are reasonably priced, and overall, very good service.  When you dine in, they do give you fresh bread, muffin basket. It&#39;s always been very good. Sunday&#39;s usually are very busy. So there will be a very long line. Overall, very worth the wait."

And well we thought with it being so busy we would have to wait to get our food because there were a group of people and it was crowed but to our surprise we got our food very quickly we got the gypsy skillet and Wow was it great. They kept the coffee coming and when I got done with drinking water they were right there with another glass. Speedy and fast service and the waitress we got was really nice.

  Things we didn&#39;t enjoy were the desserts.  We took some to go to enjoy later and they tasted store made, stale, and unappetizing.  I was ready to break my diet for a big piece of chocolatey cake and I was dissapointed.  sigh- probably for the best. :)  Also, the bartender ran out of some things and tried to pass off other things in our drinks.

However, the last couple of times there have been disappointing but this last time is really going to be the last time. We went for lunch and I ordered a turkey clubhouse sandwich. Quite honestly not the best clubhouse sandwich that I have ever eaten. Bread tasted old, bacon odd and turkey processed. Husband ordered a Reuben sandwich. Now very possible it said open faced on the menu and hubby didn&#39;t notice that. This was a plate of well I can&#39;t really properly describe it because it was so strange looking for a Reuben sandwich. The corned beef was not thinly sliced at all. It actually looked like hunks of corned beef it was so thick. So now I am thinking well if it tastes OK so what? When I noticed my husband struggling to eat this I leaned over and took a piece of the corned beef. It tasted terrible and I told him this tastes sour to me. I didn&#39;t like the smell of it either.

I ordered soup and a sausage pizza that was delivered to me impeccably. The server was sure to bring out the soup ahead of the pizza. I also had a cocktail with my order and she was very attentive and brought out well before the soup and then came back to check on me a number of times to make sure that I was doing OK. 


This was a great dining experience in the Elkgrove Village area. If you&#39;re ever out here and craving Chicago&#39;s pizza I would recommend stopping at this pizza place."

I recommend ordering the frozen pizza 24 hours in advance and you can get the special order selection to go.  When you live in California it&#39;s worth it.  Yummy!!!

They get the pleasure of experiencing the real thing first hand during every visit back to Chicago and invited my wife and I over to share in their latest annual ritual of &#34;ordering in&#34;. The frozen version they shared with us was really good, and they said the fresh version would change my life when I made it to Chicago some day. 

Review: I finally made it to the Windy City for the first time, so naturally the first spot I head to eat at was Lou Malnati&#39;s. The closest location we went to was carry out only, so if you want to dine in and you&#39;re an &#34;out of towner&#34; like me, call ahead to the location and make sure the have a dining room if you so desire ;-).

Ordered &#34;The Malnati Chicago Classic&#34; complete with an authentic layer of Chicago sausage, a gooey mess of fresh mozzarella, topped with a great sauce, and an unbelievably good/out of this world/delicious/amazing butter crust. If there is a better pizza crust anywhere in this world, I have yet to find one better than what I just ate at Lou&#39;s. Crunchy, butter, flavorful, it&#39;s a home run. I also added pepperoni to my pie which was a generous helping that made it taste that much better since I love pepperoni.

Be prepared to wait a little as pizza this good takes time, and well worth the wait! They say 30 minutes or so for a deep dish pie, and this was right inline with our experience. When the glorious pizza made it out of the oven and over to our table, our server cut us our first slices. I&#39;m glad she did because I would have butchered the heck out of it if I tried. She had it down to a science.

First bite was hot, flavorful, delicious and honestly a pizza memory I&#39;ll never forget. Bottom line, if you want an authentic, delicious Chicago Deep Dish pie, go to Lou&#39;s. Period. My great friends from Chicago were right; this pizza will change your life a little. If nothing else, at least the way you look at pizza.

We tried the one in Park Ridge with  miserable results. Unfortunately I think they sent their cook to Elk Grove. When ordering a cheese and tomato pizza you should be able to at least pick it up. The middle half of the pizza was so thin the tomato slices were thicker. And to make things worse you could not pick it up. Imagine a slice of wet bread on a piece of cardboard. Same consistency. You literally had to spoon it up. It happened once and thought oh well but it has happened numerous times now. I&#39;m done.  Too bad as ordered weekly.

Being the secret pizza lover that I am, the deep-dish was on my list when I visited this city. 

My standards on pizza is pretty high since Cheese Board pretty much spoiled me on their most amazing thin-crust pizza. I was in my mind hoping that Lou Malnati&#39;s to Chicago would be like the Cheese Board to Berkeley. 

My friends and I got the &#34;Malnati&#39;s Chicago Classic&#34; and &#34;The Lou&#34; in small plus the Malnati salad. We LOVED the salad. It was fresh and the sauce is sweet tangy delicious. When the pizzas arrived, we were glad that we only got the small because we could not even finish 2 slices of these! I think if we had a 4th girl that would have been perfect. The Classic pizza was very good, the sausage was unexpectingly big and there was a lot of cheese, but then again we are talking about the deep-dish monster here! The Lou was good but not as good as the Classic in my opinion, and also probably because I was already pretty full half slice in! One of my favorite part of this pizza is the famous butter crust! It was so crunchy and buttery, kinda like a cookie crust. 

Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t think the pizza was as mind-blowing as I was hoping for, and definitely didn&#39;t surpass my love for Cheese Board&#39;s pizzas. Maybe I&#39;m more of a thin-crust girl? Anyways, definitely still a must try when you are visiting Chicago!! It&#39;s what it&#39;s known for!"

I am a Lou Malnati&#39;s pizza fan, no matter which location I visit.  The food was fantastic.  The service from Susan, was mediocre.  We had our Friday lunch there, right at noon.  It definitely wasn&#39;t crowded.  I&#39;d classify it as slow.    I got the lunch special of a personal size pizza, soda beverage and I chose the side salad instead of soup.  The salad was a good size.  The ingredients were cold and there must have been at least 5 or 6 different ingredients in the salad. So it wasn&#39;t one of those iceberg lettuce and carrot tossed salads.  Get it with the house dressing.  It&#39;s fabulous.

I got a cheese and sausage personal pizza as part of the lunch special.  My goodness, every time I take my first  bite of a Lou Malnati&#39;s pizza, I always notice how fresh the tomatoes in the sauce taste.  It was a fabulous pizza.  I forced myself to not eat it all so I could have some to take home.

We got a small thin crust cheese pizza also.  Loved it.

At the end of our meal is when the mediocre service came to light.  Our server brought me a box for my left over salad and then a small pizza box for my leftover pizza.  I had a devil of a time trying to fold the pizza box up correctly.  Perhaps she could have brought it to our table folded up already?

We had to wait a long time for her to pick up our check with the credit card.  Again, it was not busy so I didn&#39;t understand the long wait.  Actually, it would have been a longer wait but I flagged her down as she was passing by, not intending to stop at our table.  

Anyways, if the over 100 reviews of the pizza is not enough to convince you that it is terrific, please consider me another reviewer who says that Lou Malnati&#39;s is the best pizza and is my most favorite."

My husband and I use to go there once a week religiously if not more for years.  We have even had a few large parties there.  Then one day I noticed the deep dish pizza tasted different... kinda sour, I thought it was me.  We kept going and I just thought I was getting older and my tastebuds were changing is all.  I even changed from our usual pizza to just plain cheese.  That even tasted &#34;funny.&#34;  Well, I went from loving it to hating it, I stopped having pizza because I couldn&#39;t stand the taste anymore.  Soooo, needless to say I haven&#39;t had a Lou Malnati&#39;s pizza for over a year until my husband and I decided to stop in and try the Lou&#39;s in Schaumburg.  I couldn&#39;t believe my tastebuds!!!!!  It was the old taste.  It was wonderful!  It didn&#39;t taste sour like the ones in Elk Grove Village.  Then I realized, it wasn&#39;t me after all... that the Elk Grove Lou Malnati&#39;s must have changed some ingredient or ingredients a while back that made the pizza taste sour... shame on you Elk Grove!  Change it back because we now are going to Schaumburg where the pizza there tastes the way yours use to!  I don&#39;t know if you changed ingredients to save money but in the process you lost us as customers and now Schaumburg has gained us as customers even though we live minutes from your restaurant in Elk Grove Village.  And, I love deep dish pizza!"

I&#39;d order a &#34;Lou&#34; every.single.day if my waist allowed; one can dream. 

We dined in at the Elk Grove location on a Friday night after a very, very long afternoon in the city. The dinner was well worth the drive back to the suburbs. 
 
Our appetizers were tasty. A 3-dip sampler with pita chips and the fried cheddar cheese cubes. Yum-O!

Two of us ordered a medium deep-dish pepperoni &amp; sausage and two of us ordered &#34;The Lou&#34;-a veggie pizza with added black olive and onion. Both were delicious. 

Hubs and I spent $40 on our appetizer, medium pizza and tip. Our waitress was so friendly, but we never did catch her name...

We&#39;ll definitely be back!"

However, living in Chicago for 21-years, I never had much cared for deep dish pizza. 
I know, you may be thinking I&#39;m crazy for missing out on Lou&#39;s for all this time. 
After my first trip here, I felt like I must&#39;ve been crazy for never trying Lou&#39;s. 

My father and I decided to check out the local Lou&#39;s in Elk Grove Village. 
We headed down with open minds hoping it would be as good as everyone said. 
I guess the bad experience/taste of Gino&#39;s East kept us away from deep dish for a very long time. 

We entered the restaurant and it was not too busy for a Sunday night. 
We requested a booth and were seated near the kitchen in a cramped area of the place. 
This is why I deducted one star. There were PLENTY of other booths in the &#34;heart&#34; of the place that we could&#39;ve been seated. 

Anyway, we were seated promptly and our server, Linda took our drink and appetizer orders. She recommended we give the calamari a try, as it is fresh and hand-battered. We decided to go with her suggestion. We are huge calamari fans, so we were excited to hear it was FRESH calamari. Any place that serves frozen calamari should be heavily fined. ;) 

The calamari came out rather quick and piping hot! The presentation was excellent and the portion was HUGE for two people. We both dug in and commented how fresh the calamari was. The breading was well seasoned and not too heavy. Perfect in our book. 

Next, we asked what pie she would recommend, as we were first timers at Lou&#39;s. 
She recommended &#34;The Malnati Chicago Classic&#34;. It is sausage, extra cheese, and vine-ripe tomato sauce on their famous &#34;Buttercrust&#34;. We decided to go easy on the sauce and add spinach. We eagerly awaited the famous pie to make it&#39;s arrival to our table. Be aware, it does take 30-45 minutes for your pizza to be hand-made, baked, and delivered to your table. 

Those thirty minutes felt like eternity. The smells wafting around are of pure goodness. 
Our pizza arrived piping hot and ready to be feasted on! 
Our server served us our first slice and we dug in!
The slice was packed with TONS of melty, gooey cheese! Literally oozing!
Along with the cheese was mounds of sausage and tons of fresh spinach!
We used the fork/knife method, as the slice was impossible to pick up without a huge mess. 
The pizza was seasoned to the nines and packed with sausage in every bite!
Here, you don&#39;t get &#34;balls&#34; of sausage. They pack the whole pizza with sausage. Imagine how they load on the cheese, except they do this with the sausage, too!
It is literally a &#34;patty&#34; of sausage on every SIGNLE square inch of the pie. 
The buttercrust was crisp, buttery, and golden brown. 

We knew right after the first bite, this was our new favorite. 
My God I thought, why have I been missing this for 21-years!
I felt like I&#39;ve been living a lie eating meager, plain, boring thin crust!

After our stomachs were full (about 2x slices each), we decided to take the rest to go.
Our server packaged it securely in a pizza box and gave us reheating instructions!
I reheated our left-over slices at 350 degrees for thirty (30) minutes. 
I found this replicated the melty gooey-ness the best. 
Keep in mind, the sausage is very dense, so anything under 30 minutes won&#39;t cut it. 

We truly ate every single slice of the left-overs the next day. Couldn&#39;t get enough!
I can&#39;t wait for pizza night again next sunday! You can be sure, I&#39;ll be dining with Lou! 

Tourists Tip: Don&#39;t bother with Uno&#39;s or Gino&#39;s East, go to the source!
Go to Lou&#39;s you WILL NOT be disappointed!"

Flaky and crispy crust and fresh (or at least it tasted that way) tomato sauce. Way better than Giordano&#39;s. The wings for appetizers were great also. Prices are super reasonable, though that may just be from an New Jerseyan&#39;s perspective.

No but seriously folks this was terrific. I loved the tavern feel, of longtime coworkers and families huddling together after the day to wait half an hour for a pizza.

I swear this pizza runs in my veins. First of all, the crust is the best pizza crust in the world. It is perfectly buttery, crispy on the crust, and so flavorful that it really adds to the pizza. Most pizza doughs are like cardboard or aren&#39;t a huge factor in the flavor of the pizza, but not at Lou Malnati&#39;s! The crust honestly makes this pizza. Second of all, their cheese is so gooey and perfectly complemented by the chunky tomato sauce. If you just want cheese, it will be the best cheese pizza of your life. I definitely recommend getting toppings, however, specifically the sausage. They put a full sausage patty on top of the whole pizza. No, not just little crumbles of sausage here and there. They lay a FULL patty on top. That&#39;s a lot of sausage! It&#39;s amazing. My go-to pizza is the garbage pizza, with sausage, mushroom, onion, and green pepper.

Don&#39;t go anywhere else for deep dish. This is the only place you need!"

I had the spinach meatball soup. It needed a little salt but was good. The pizza was deep dish and had a nice crispy carmelized crust. Also comes with bread but don&#39;t waste your calories on it. I could have eaten the whole pizza but I gave half to my hubby since the personal wasn&#39;t quite big enough for him. Good thing because I&#39;m stuffed. 

You can also get a 1/2 order of pasta or 1/2 of sandwich in place of the pizza. 

Definitely worth a try!"

I typically dine alone as I travel a ton as part of my job. Several times I&#39;ll go to a restaurant where I more or less get ignored for being a &#34;party of one&#34;. Usually the mentality is either &#34;he&#39;ll barely tip&#34; or &#34;he&#39;ll know what he wants&#34;.

I ordered water,  mozzarella sticks, and their Malnati  Chicago deep dish with sausage and pepperoni. Food was fantastic and served in a timely manner. I saw my server three times in this whole experience - making the order, getting the pizza, and getting the check. Runners did everything else. No checks on how I was doing or if I wanted anything else. 

Food is an easy 4/5 stars. Service was a 3. This is when yelps ratings aren&#39;t the best. Server wasn&#39;t rude but where was he? It wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly busy in my eyes and I saw him check nearby parties several times."

I love NY-style pizza that I can fold and consume like a taco. With that said however, Lou Malnati&#39;s serves decent pizza and is probably the best deep dish I&#39;ve ever had.

On the last day of our business trip, my co-workers and I wanted to grab some deep dish pizza for dinner, and to also take home to our loved ones back home in LA. We were stuck in major traffic and short on time, so I called ahead to order in advance so that the pizzas would be ready to eat when we got there.

Upon arrival, a host seated us and let us know everything was good to go as they were well aware we were on a time crunch. However, after being seated for 15 minutes or so, no one came to greet us. I eventually had to go up to the hostess counter to remind them that we had a flight to catch and needed our pizzas ASAP. Our server came by to get our drink orders and another 10 minutes went by. After managing to grab our server&#39;s attention again, she told us that the kitchen bakes our pizzas for 15-minutes, then for another 15 after we arrive. We didn&#39;t have time for that and they should&#39;ve let us known over the phone or as soon as we arrived! Shortly after, our pizzas arrived and we were told our to-go orders were ready to go whenever we were ready to leave.

The four of us shared a large Malnati Chicago Classic™ ($21.25) and ordered another two large Chicago Classics, small Cheese ($10.25), and a small Pepperoni ($11.85) to-go. The Chicago Classic had this thin, giant sausage patty over the pizza, which we all thought was quite strange, only because we&#39;ve never had anything like it and weren&#39;t used to it. However, it was still quite tasty and the best part of it for me was that the crust wasn&#39;t too soft or soggy, like most deep dish pizza crusts I&#39;ve had. The bottom was crispy and provided good texture in contrast to the meat of the pizza.

I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to coming back to Lou&#39;s if I&#39;m ever in town again, but since I still haven&#39;t been to Giordano&#39;s, I&#39;d probably head over there first.

The crust is buttery and super thick, exactly what you&#39;d want in a Chicago style pizza, and the toppings were excellent on &#34;the Lou&#34;.

My wife was told by a salesman 2 years ago to try lous. So while in town this weekend We ventured inside to try it out. We thought the deep dish was good. But wasn&#39;t great. Just a personal preference. But me and my wife felt the sauce and meat toppings are better at giordanos. The sausage pieces was too big. And I most had a choking incident while we was there. As the cheese and the sausage almost went down the wrong way. Waiter was courteous and nice. We enjoyed our time there. But we prefer giordanos to lous. But still a good pie. Just not as good as giordanos to us.

This is a staple for when I&#39;m in town visiting my family.  My three brothers and I go all in for a couple of their Malnati salads and at least three classic buttercrust pies.  

The Malnati&#39;s salad is out of this world.  While people view a salad as just a salad the ingredients and the dressing take it to a whole new level. 

Standard pies for us are Crumbled Sausage, Pepperoni and The Lou - to which we sub out the mushrooms and add in pepperoni.  

A few local craft beers to wash everything down.

A few hours later as you look for a wheelchair to take you to your car a sated glaze comes over your eyes and you leave with a grin from ear to ear.

After having had their deep dish for myself i know Bobby was out of his game. Crust stays firm the sauce is thick and delicious. The acidity from the tamato reduced grease that would have came from the sausage.  They dont skimp on the ingredients.  3 slices was the most i could do. Great value for your money, the people are outgoing and freindly and it leaves you wanting to come back. A true staple of Italiano in America.

This is the first time I&#39;ve been to this location.  The Buffalo Grove location has a Chicago sports theme with memorabilia and paraphernalia covering the walls.  The Lincoln Park location also has more of a city feel simply because of the location.  This restaurant in Elk Grove is different from both of these as it has more of a suburban family restaurant feel.  You really wouldn&#39;t know that it was a Lou Malnati&#39;s besides the signage outside and the smell of pizza inside.

We came for the lunch special which is a personal pizza and a side of your choice.  The personal pizza is a decent size for a &#34;normal&#34; eater but may be too small for someone with a larger appetite.  The quality is identical to any medium or large deep dish version.  The side salad is rather small and practical falls over the edges of the plate.  

I also got a medium sausage pizza half baked and uncut  for dinner later that afternoon.  I popped it in the oven when I got home and was eating it for back to back meals in a matter of 30 minutes."

- buuuuuuuutter cruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust
- sausage patty with no sad gaps of non-sausage neglect
- soooooo  goooooooooooooooooooood

Chicagoans earn their pot bellies partially b/c of the plethora of good pizza that we have and will likely put up with even a long ass wait to keep our pot bellies nourished with our preferred deep dished num-nums. So believe this particular pot belly when it advises you to get thee to Lou&#39;s. stat.

Note to those who have prejudice against Chicago Deep Dish style pizza: certain unnamed pizza joints, including national chain pizza restaurants, parboil their dough (HORRORS) in certain areas of the country (cough, New England) where the impatient customers there refuse to wait for their carby num-nums. MY Lou Malnati&#39;s would never ever ever do that to you poor hungry suckers. Ever. And even a frozen Lou&#39;s tastes waaaaaaaaaaaay better than any deep dish pizza I&#39;ve had just about anywhere outside of Chicago.

There. I said it.

Until a few weeks ago, I&#39;d always avoided the famed &#39;Chicago deep dish pizza&#39;. I honestly thought it was just a gimmick, and how could that much dough be good anyway? Well, I&#39;ll admit it - I was wrong.

On my most recent trip to Chicagoland, I was immediately brought to Lou Malnati&#39;s - straight from the airport with bags still in tow. I was gently instructed that I would be getting deep dish pizza, and the rest is history...

Lou Malnati&#39;s deep dish pizza is the shiz, y&#39;all. I have no clue how they get so much deliciousness into a crust - strangely not too doughy at all! My friend and I split a Lou (minus mushrooms), and it was perfect. But be warned - the slices can be deceptive...I was full after just one!

The surprise star of my lunch, though, was the house-made creamy lemon garlic salad dressing! Whatever you do, get this dressing. Put it on something. Just get it in your mouth somehow. 

The interior space was very traditional and pizzeria-ish, and the service was fast and very attentive. 

Thanks, Lou Malnati&#39;s, for changing my mind about this whole deep dish thing. In fact, I&#39;m on their website right now seeing how I can get one shipped to me in Columbus."

This location was not really busy because we went early enough so that was a plus but that was one of the only things I enjoyed here.  We started off with an order of buffalo wings.  When they artived not only were they not spicy like we had asked for but they were cold.  The wings were also overpriced.  

Next we ordered a large deluxe pizza.  It said it would take about 30 minutes to cook but it was closer to 45 minutes.  The pizza was not only also cold buf it was watery from the tomato sauce that didn&#39;t cook up.  That was ridiculous.  The sauce was not really my type.  It was really chuncky with tomatoes.

Located in an average sized strip mall space, this restaurant knows what they&#39;re doing. The restaurant itself is clean, service is exception, and the food is affordable and delicious. I knew it would be a lot of food, but I decided to order the combination platter anyway so I could try a variety of things.

This meal came with falafel, shish kabob, chicken kabob, beef shawarma, basmati rice, sliced tomato, lettuce, and a side of tahini sauce. Sure, that&#39;s a lot of carne for lunch, but I was glad I got to try it all. I of course wasn&#39;t able to finish everything but I put a pretty good dent in this $9.75 plate.

The falafel was perfection -- crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. All of the meats were flavorful and cooked just right. The rice and veggies rounded out the meal nicely. It was all very good. Mazmez offers a handful of other entrees and plates including wraps, salads, appetizers, and sandwiches.

Being middle eastern I have certain expectations for Middle Eastern cuisine and this place was a complete let down.

Ordered the chicken breast and was told that they no longer carry that and only had the chicken shawarma. So decided to go with that choice. The chicken was over seasoned and salty and the rice was stale and crunchy. They charge you for extra sauce and no pita bread was included. Also got an order of fries which were stale and oily. Honestly I couldn&#39;t even finish my food. So disappointing.

The chicken shwarma was fresh and chicken was tender but just lacked the traditional flavor. The hot sauce reminded me of a saltier version of red chili paste that you get at chinese restaurants. Unfortunately I will not be back but I will admit the food portions are great and somewhere down the line the restaurant should consider a lunch special. I suggest Pita inn or Naf Naf for a  better tasting chicken shawarma.

Visited on a Saturday evening with the fam, and walked in to a completely empty restaurant.  Grabbed a couple of menus and a table.  After perusing the options, we settled on the following: vegetarian platter, combination platter, and fries.  I asked the young man behind the counter how many pitas come with the platters, and shockingly, he said none.  He must have noticed the puzzled look on my face because he offered to include them, no charge.  Ok, a bit weird but hey, he included them.

I was also taken aback at the $0.75 they tack on for every hot sauce and garlic sauce.  I can try to understand this if it were carry-out...but EVERY fast-casual Mediterranean place I&#39;ve been to (and I&#39;ve been to various all over the country) includes these gratis for dine-in orders.   Again, he says he&#39;ll include them since it&#39;s our first time...nice guy.  SIDE NOTE: if you&#39;re going to charge $0.75 for a condiment, at least fill the container up to the top. 

Out comes our food...and while it looked initially appetizing, we were let down by almost every single thing.  First was the vegetarian platter: The grilled vegetables were a salty mush, the rice was more like biryani rather than the usual fluffy pilaf variety, and oh yea, the aforementioned free pita was MIA.  But the falafel was pretty good, I&#39;ll give them that. 

The combination platter, however, was a complete fail.  The meat portions, considering it was a &#34;platter,&#34; were pitiful.  The chicken kabob was not a kabob but rather, marinated chicken cooked on a flattop.  The definition of shawarma is meat that&#39;s cooked on a spit and then shaved when ready to serve...but this was just chunks of chewy steak, again cooked on a flattop.   There was also a shish kabob was as uninspiring as the rest of its platter companions.  

So here&#39;s why I&#39;m so torn: because the people there are very friendly and genuine.  I want this family to make it, but I find it hard to imagine they&#39;ll break the 1yr mark if this is the best they have to offer.  Will I visit again? Most likely not."

The meat is well-marinated in garlic, ginger, onions and spices - I cook Indian food so I can tell by the taste that it isn&#39;t just a quick and cheap liquid marinade.  

The baba ganoush is deliciously smoky, the hummus is silky smooth and the falafel have satisfying crunch.  I love the accompanying pickled condiments - turnip, pickles, green olives, spiced onions.  The basmati rice is lightly spiced and so much better than the competition&#39;s converted rice variety.  

Prices are also very reasonable.  The service is eager and friendly.  I look forward to making this our regular middle eastern place."

Called in an Order for a beef shawarma plate and a chicken shawarma plate to go, $20, ready in under 10 minutes.  Got there in about 10 mins, the food was hot and ready, the kitchen and topings/Salad fixing area were clean and in plain view. The food was amazing, seasoned perfectly, not overcooked and dry like most of the local places. The meals did not come with pita, I was in a hurry and didn&#39;t read the menu which  clearly stated that. If the pita is good, this place dethrones the beloved NAF NAF grill. The chicken shawarma and rice are comparable, the beef is something not offered at NAF NAF and that&#39;s a game changer.   I will definitely be back for more."

This was one of our stops on a bar crawl and picked out specifically so we could get both beer or cocktails and dinner. I went with the Adult Mac &amp; Cheese. They make a big deal out of the fact that the cheese sauce is made with beer, but you could have fooled me. The whole thing didn&#39;t have much flavor even with added chicken and bacon. I had to heap on a heavy helping of salt and pepper to get it closer to something resembling satisfying.

Service was pretty prompt at the start but sort of fell off toward the end. We were in an upper area toward the back and away from most of the other diners and drinkers. The waitress was friendly and I think she was doing her best, but there were many times we wanted to ask a question or order something more and no one was to be found to help us out.

The cocktails were very good. I got a Moscow Mule and have no complaints about that.

I&#39;d be open to coming back, but I&#39;d go with a different dish. The Shepherd&#39;s Pie sounded appealing."

I loved the decor. Great feel to the place. Service was awesome too. I had one of their craft beers, that they rotate in, an Arrogant Bastard Amber. It was really good. 

I decided to try their wings and cole slaw. Not sure why I didn&#39;t try a typical Irish dish, but wasn&#39;t feeling it. I&#39;m glad I tried the wings. I LOVE wings and most places over cook them or don&#39;t have any good sauces. 

This place has really meaty wings, and they don&#39;t slobber on the sauce. It looks like it&#39;s baked on. They were so flavorful and filling. 

The cole slaw is way more than a side. It&#39;s a huge portion and really awesome taste. 

Service was excellent. 

I can&#39;t wait to go back and bring folks with me and try their Irish dishes too. 

The only reason I gave them four stars, is their chairs seem very wobbly. I tried three, and they were all the same. Other than that, 5 stars! The food is terrific."

First, for some reason this traditional Irish pub was BLASTING Euro-trance/House/Hip-Hop music the entire time, making conversation impossible.

Then, the Cod sandwich I ordered was just nasty - no other way to put it. 
The breaded exterior was very dark and crunchy hard, as if it had been re-fried. 
After taking a few bites and exposing the interior, I started getting the odor of rotting fish and (oddly) ammonia. 
The (normally white flaky) meat was a shiny, semi-translucent and gray. It was inedible. 

Our server was apologetic and offered to get me something else but my family was finishing up so I declined. He didn&#39;t offer to take it off the bill and I didn&#39;t ask.

If there&#39;s one thing you expect an Irish pub to get right, it&#39;s fried fish."

I still have had terrible experience (and good, though overpriced food) there, but I did notify the:&#34;contact us&#34; link on the website after the dog incident (I assume it was the owner) Brian McGonigal answered within 24 hours, addressing each one of my concerns. 

Regarding the dog (my biggest issue), apparently it&#39;s a semi-regular customer who has been told before that her dog is only allowed in the outdoor patio seating, NOT inside, MONTHS ago, so he was surprised at my experience/that the dog was inside for any length of time, and said that the entire staff was going to be retrained/reminded of the policy. He seemed to generally care that I had a negative experience, and I really do appreciate it. 

I will probably go back one more time, because if not for the dog on my last visit, I would have said 3.5 stars (factoring in kitchen mistakes), so maybe I just always catch them on an off day. I&#39;m willing to give another chance, cause the Irish Dip IS amazing..."

I was shivering from the elements and wanted something warm, so I ordered a glass of white white and a cup of the French onion soup with my apple and goat cheese salad. 

The salad was only OK and needed some nuts and cucumbers, but the soup? It was love at first sip. Not only was it picture-perfect, it tasted out of this world. I&#39;m going to have cravings for this soup for a long, long time. 

The drink menu was exactly what we were looking for, a mix of beer, wine, and mixed drinks. I ended my meal with an Irish coffee (decaf). It was pretty great, as well.

I have been a few times when I come out from the city. It is on par or better than most pubs in the city. I don&#39;t consider their British pub fare to be very authentic. So if that&#39;s what you are looking for, it is probably not the place for you. Having said that, the food is very good. 

I personally have never had issues with the service and I have eaten at both the bar and at a table.

The fish was tender and flavorful &amp; tartar sauce just right. Plates were presented nicely.

The shepherd&#39;s pie was good but not great. They really needed to drain the fat off the meat. I enjoyed the mix of lamb &amp; beef.

Irish boxty (potato pancake) with corned beef and cabbage satisfied my hubby&#39;s craving.

The beer cheese sauce and pretzels knocked our socks off, although $11 seemed a bit steep for bread &amp; cheese appetizer.

Lastly, the football game was on &amp; the front room loud, but they kindly seated us in the former bank vault room. We loved the decor. This place is welcoming and casual with great food."

It was inedible. Additionally, I asked for no salt on the fries, but they came salted anyway (the waitress gladly brought out a replacement). Instead I shared my wife&#39;s flat bread, which was okay,but did not have as crisp a crust as on previous visits. The waitress was very apologetic and did not charge for the fish.

First of all, the atmosphere is unbeatable. It&#39;s an old bank in downtown Barrington, and the mixture of old-school pub and modern sports bar was a lot of fun. 

As for the food, I really loved the Shepherd&#39;s pie. One of the few places I&#39;ve been to that uses lamb. I had a couple of different craft beers that were on tap (Delirium Tremens and Breckenridge 471 IPA), and I can&#39;t say that I know many places that keep beers like that on tap.

When you can&#39;t hear someone screaming right in your face and your only chance to talk to eachother is between songs played by a folky cover band, the music is too loud.

Our server came over and asked if that&#39;s what happened.  When we replied yes it had, he kind of rolled his eyes and walked away with out a word.

The pretzel and beer cheese was delicious.  I got Bangers and Mash.  The bangers were so hot I couldn&#39;t eat them right away, while the mash was so cold I didn&#39;t want to eat them at all.

Not &#34;Irish&#34; pubs with an Irish name that trot out the glossy cardboard shamrock decorations around St Patrick&#39;s Day, but otherwise work assiduously to grow the revenue numbers of the Miller Brewing Company and cater to ballcap-wearing twenty-somethings who &#34;need&#34; a place to watch sports and shout at each other over music that was on the radio when they were zygotes.

This one gets it right, not in the look so much (though that is a strength) but in the note-perfect vibe of low-pressure conviviality.  It&#39;s a great mix of folks of all ages, many of whom seem to know each other--and the staff.

This building was a bank, an honest-to-goodness, small-town, tall, standalone bank building with columns in front.  Inside, it looks like County Kerry, with a huge handsome bar and numerous tables in charming, architecturally eccentric nooks.  The music performance area is a small mezzanine overlooking the main floor.

You like beer?  So do they.  There is ONE Miller Lite tap.  They have Guinness, Harp, and Smithwick&#39;s, as you would expect.  They have some standard but solid favorites such as Blue Moon, Stella Artois, Hoeegarden, and 312.  Great Lakes, Breckenridge Brewery, and Leinenkugel&#39;s are represented, and they have some other excellent choices such as Murphy&#39;s Stout (God bless it) and Murphy&#39;s Red, not to mention Delirium Tremens, Pilsner Urquell, and Bell&#39;s Brown.  So, basically, a beer for every preference, occasion, mood, hour of the day, you name it.

Live music every weekend, friendly bartenders, a warm suburban crowd, and a food menu.  Sure, there are TVs but you can ignore them if you like.  This would be the best local pub in almost any neighborhood in Chicago, but you would probably ruin it by putting it in almost any neighborhood in Chicago."

Already hungry, m&#39;lady and I decided to stop here for a quick bite to eat and a drink or two. It fit the bill perfectly.

The service was really quick, and although it wasn&#39;t overly friendly, it was efficient. My Guinness was poured perfectly and was delicious. My girlfriend had a Stella and a Blue Moon and both...well, they tasted like they should! That may sound funny to novices, but many of us frequent beer drinkers can tell when something is off, such as in the lines...these all tasted quite good.

OK, so the food - we had an order of the Trinity Sliders off the app menus. These were basically corned beef on mini pretzel rolls with a delicious spicy mustard. Really tasty...we both enjoyed them greatly. 

Four beers (2x Guinnes, 1x Stella, 1x Blue Moon) + App for $29 with tax (but not tip). Maybe slightly high, but not terrible for the area."

They have a good beer selection ( I can&#39;t partake in it right now, but the man was happy with it), I dig the decor, and our waitress was really sweet.

For appetizers we ordered the Bryan and Guinness wings, and our waitress warned us that the Bryan wings were really hot and she couldn&#39;t take them back if we didn&#39;t like them. We usually order wings the first time we go to a place, and they&#39;re rarely as hot as they&#39;re made out to be, so we were curious to try these.

The wings are big, and have a nice char on them. The Bryan wings were hot, but not so hot that they didn&#39;t have any flavor, they were really good! They are definitely hotter than your standard hot wing you can get at other places, which was good for us. :) If you love hot wings you need to try them. The Guinness wings were also good, but we were hooked on the Bryan wings.

The french onion soup was ok. The broth was sweet instead of savory, and is the only reason i&#39;m giving this place 4 stars because everything else was excellent. 

The man was going back and forth between the shepherd&#39;s pie and the pot roast so he asked the waitress, and she said that her favorite thing is the pot roast. He went with that, and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best pot roasts either of us have ever had. ( He said that mine is better, but he&#39;s a damn liar. A sweet damn liar.)

I went with the Kilkenny burger with pepperjack, avocado, bacon, and sauteed onions. I was a little worried about ordering it. I&#39;m currently pregnant and can only eat well done burgers. I&#39;ve gone to a couple of places and ordered a burger well done, and it ALWAYS ends up being medium rare, and then I can&#39;t eat it and have to bring it home. It&#39;s always aggravating because burgers never reheat as well, and I hate sending food back. I had a perfectly well done burger, with a nice char taste on the outside, and the toppings were plentiful and tasted good together. I was really, really happy with my burger, and glad and relieved that they actually cooked it how I wanted it. so THANK YOU!


The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the french onion soup, everything else was excellent, including the service. I make homemade french onion soup, so that does make me more critical, but if they fixed the broth and made it savory, I would be completely won over. 

Overall it was a great dining experience and we will definitely be back."

Their order included fish and chips, Irish boxty, and a salad which they were all very happy with.  My order was the full Irish breakfast.  When it arrived, it looked delicious and indeed it was.  However, I was surprised to find just a single rasher of bacon.  I mentioned this to our server Jordan (who was charming, efficient and helpful) and she said that she would check with the chef.  A few minutes later she came back and let me know that the chef said that this was standard for the order.  I&#39;m stunned that a $13:50 breakfast only comes with a single rasher of bacon and a single banger (this is perhaps the highest price I&#39;ve seen for a breakfast platter).  I don&#39;t recall this being the case at any similar place.  Upon rereading the menu I can confirm that it does describe the breakfast as including rasherS and bangerS rather than one of each. Why list them in the plural if you&#39;re only going to serve one?  It might seem like a small quibble but having proper Irish bacon was a large part of the reason why I placed the order.  They need to update the menu to reflect this.  I was very tempted to give a lower rating, but because everything else was so nice I didn&#39;t think it would be fair to do so."

I would return, but I would hang out at the bar instead of coming for dinner and sitting at a table.   The atmosphere was great!  I&#39;ve never been to Ireland, but I definitely didn&#39;t feel like I was sitting in Barrington, IL. 

I ordered a reuben with no sauerkraut (just wasn&#39;t in the mood) and I was happy when our food was brought out and my sauerkraut-less reuben hadn&#39;t been mixed up with dad&#39;s which had the kraut on it.  Everyone&#39;s order was correct with all the correct condiments and garnishes, a big plus in my book.  The food was okay, about what you would expect. 

The one minor drawback was that the service seemed to be slow.  We were in fairly early on a Wednesday evening (got there around 5:30) so there weren&#39;t a ton of patrons.  Most were by the bar.  The service felt slow for the day/time and our very polite waitress took a long time to grab our bill back and run our card.  One thing I really enjoyed about our waitress was her honesty.  My mom asked about the chicken pot pie, and she told her it was the only thing on the menu she wouldn&#39;t recommend.  I was happy to hear her honesty instead of my mom ending up with something she didn&#39;t like just to get a sale.

Check it out and stay for the drinks."

Upon walking in we were assaulted by extremely loud music blasting from the sound system.  To make matters worse, the &#34;music&#34; was some kind of trash that was totally out of character for a place that&#39;s trying to position itself as an Irish pub.  :-(

We were looking over the list of draft beers (which seemed much more abbreviated than the list they have on their website) when the next song came on and it was even more obnoxious than the song that was on when we walked in.

Pros:

- Food quality is pretty high. Fish and chips were my favorite. Fries were seasoned and tasted really good. Fish was not bad. A little over breaded and overcooked, but does the job. 
- Overall the restaurant and bar area looks very clean. 
- Location near the train in Barrington is a huge plus. 
- TVs are generally showing something sports related and they play the sound from the TV rather than some annoying music that I don&#39;t want to be blaring over my conversation. 

Cons:

- Service during lunchtime can be a bit slow. I have had different waitresses on each occasion and found that the last waitress was an improvement. Expect to be eating there for at least an hour for a table of two. 
- The chairs in the bar area are incredibly uncomfortable to sit in, especially if you sit for an extended period waiting for food. Try to get actual seats over stools. 
- Food is a bit pricey. For Fish and Chips and two iced teas plus tip, it is over $20. Its good, but not that good."

I&#39;ve had the Fish n Chips and turkey club, both good, but I will definitely be back for the Fish n Chips. I&#39;ve been here for St Paddy&#39;s as well as their open bar NYE party upstairs. Always attracts a good crowd of your typical Barrington patrons. The owners are great, and really put in the effort to grow their customer base with live Irish music, events, an updated Facebook and newsletter.  Of course as a &#34;newer&#34; restaurant, enthusiastic owners should not be surprising, but it really is nice to see the passion they have for their business come through."

Bartenders know their stuff and provide correct glassware that is clean.  I have had their burgers and fish and chips,  all real good, however they serve a lot of other traditional Irish chow that I am not interested in.  Let&#39;s face it there is a reason there is no great Irish tradition of great cooking, they were starving to death on that island and that is why we all moved here.

Not wanting to admit exactly how often I go here, I have been here about 5 times since my last review.  I have gone for dinner, lunch, and another bar crawl since then, and every experience I have had has been nothing short of awesome.

My favorite things there are the strong mixed drinks, the fries, and the chicken sandwich.  The chicken is seriously so juicy and not dried out, and it comes on a delicious pretzel roll--you can&#39;t go wrong with that amazingness!!

On the pub crawl the other day, my friends and I were a HUGE group of 15 people, and our waitress kept up with us like it was nothing.  She even got us a plate of pickles.  I wish I could remember her name and the girl who served us before that, because they were awesome.  I think I will have to go back JUST to inquire about this.  Their boss needs to know how great they are!

The place is clean, fun, and a great time all around!  

Oh, and my friend wants me to say that she was disappointed that there was no foamy soap, BUT she really, really liked the paper towels in the bathroom :)"

The interior is warm and inviting...maybe a bit more &#34;themed&#34; than actually &#34;authentic&#34; but a decent environment. I know a few of the staff members (they used to work at the Curragh in Schaumburg before it closed) and they are GREAT additions to this place!

I don&#39;t like their 16 ounce pint glasses...but, I realize they are acceptable and market standard (the only true pint glass in my opinion are the 20 ounce tulip glasses, but I am getting snobby, so will stop)...The aforementioned staff will ensure the pour is proper! While I am a professional bar hopper, I have never had a drinking session in this place (I don&#39;t drive when I drink, and this is a bit out of taxi range for me), but I know they have some good musical acts like Morgan Fingleton and Fast Eddie MacAteer...awesome!

I have had a couple of dishes there - Chicken sandwich...awesome! I have had it three times and it has never ever been overcooked (and is there anything worse than a rubber shoe of a chicken breast?)...I know it is just a sandwich, but it is possible to screw up and McGonigals really delivers a quality product!

The chicken boxty - always a fan of a decent boxty! I was not disappointed!!!! I did have to use table salt though (which I NEVER use), but once that was added, I was very happy.

The pretzel nuggets with melted cheese...this stuff is Seven Eleven comfort food at its best...I mean that too...pretzels and cheese...whats not to love? Again, not exactly an old Donegal recipe...but whatever! 

My only bad experience here....the mussels. I went once with about 4 people and I was the only one at the table that didn&#39;t like them. For me, it was the broth....there was something about it that was just terrible in my opinion...but I think it was more a matter of my personal taste, rather than poor execution..."

This review is not for any item on the menu, except the burger. When you go to McGonigals, you order the burger. It&#39;s as simple as that. Other dishes on the menu, yes they are perfectly fine, but to be honest...don&#39;t bother. 

They are seasoned perfectly and probably the best in the area. The patty is so amazingly juicy, and are cooked exactly to your specification. Never have I ordered medium and gotten medium-well or well done. I don&#39;t know what kind of meat they use, or what seasoning, but it is just perfect. Last time I went, I tried something else...and I wished I&#39;d ordered the burger. I kicked myself until the next time we went, and so the saying was created &#34;when you go to McGonigals, you get the burger&#34;."

The shepherd&#39;s pie was worse. When we asked if they could play some music (this is an Irish pub after all) the owner said no because he wanted to watch the football game (American college) on TV. We asked our waiter for the WiFi password and he didn&#39;t know it and wouldn&#39;t find out. A huge waste of time and money (wife insisted we pay for our slop). So disappointed especially since there were some good Yelp reviews of this place.

We arrived early so we sat and had a beer and appetizer in the main bar/diningroom while we waited.  The ambiance of this place freakin&#39; rocks.  It&#39;s three floors.  All dark wood.  Cozy booths with large windows to sit by.  even though some of the tables are close together you still feel like you have privacy. Subdued lighting.  A cheery skull sitting on a shelf behind the bar made this Gravestomper feel at home. 

Our waitress, Joy, was just that...a joy.  She was bright and funny and attentive.  The bartender was smiling, friendly and enjoying himself.

We had the best spinach artichoke dip we&#39;ve ever had.  A steaming cast iron crock surrounded by a mountain of fried pita wedges.  It was a meal in itself.

When we made it up to the third floor for the Green Drinks gathering we discovered another bar up there.  Patrick our upstairs bartender was just as friendly and attentive as the staff in the main lobby. And he had a great sense of humor.  I say that because at another green drinks meeting we&#39;ve attended at another restaurant we&#39;ve always received crap service from the bartenders.  The manager&#39;s excuse to us? &#39;You should come here for regular service, not just a green drinks meeting.&#39;  I know--that sounds insane right?  Like we weren&#39;t real customers because we met with fifty other people there.

McGonigals, however,  proved that every time a restaurant has customers come in--for whatever reason: whether it&#39;s a banquet, business lunch, or intimate dining--is a chance to dazzle them with yours service and quality.  Great job guys!  We&#39;re already telling our friends about you!!!"

The drinks are great too! Great atmosphere. A little too bright maybe but that&#39;s my personal preference. I love the Irish Magners apple and pear cider they have. The bartenders and servers ROCK!  In love with the Irish pot roast. Sorry mom, but I&#39;ve never had better then here...now if I could only figure out the recipe! Love the pretzel bread and cheese too but thisis what knocks it down a star....$11  for THREE breadsticks? Maybe it&#39;s the cheese,  which they give us way more then we ever use, who knows. Either up it to 4 or drop the price and I&#39;ll give  them their star back.

PROs:  The food is absolutely delicious and fresh.  As simple as it is, the Boxty is fantastic, the spinach dip is unreal, the fresh pretzels with cheese-beer dip.... yummmmm.  We&#39;ve never had a bad meal here.  Everything tastes so fresh and homemade.  I also love the atmosphere inside (it&#39;s an old historical building from the turn of the century). 

CONs:  The hostesses dress a tad on the &#39;unprofessional&#39; side and look 16 (this could be a CON for a guy I suppose!).  They go out for many cigarette breaks and drag it back inside with them.  Also, the noise level in there is insane.  You&#39;ll have a sore throat by the end of the night.  We also generally have to wait since the space is so small.  And parking can be a bit of a burden.

Pros totally outweigh the cons.  I&#39;m not Irish...but McGonigals makes me want to be!"

They have a small &#34;stage&#34; (an elevated floor area) where we put the bride and her bridesmaids to open the gifts after our luncheon.  The food was superb and plentiful.  We opted for a limited menu of three different sandwich choices with a side salad.  I want to thank Lisa and Nicole for all of their help and especially Ismini who made our event - as one guest put it  &#34;The best Wedding Shower I&#39;ve ever been to!&#34;  The accommodating nature of everyone there and the attention to detail throughout the process is what makes MCGONIGALS the place we will recommend to everyone we know!!!"

Not a good place for watching sports as the TVs are too small and hard to see.  The food is good, but can be inconsistent.  For some reason, my main problem is a heating issue.  More times than not I get something that should be hot, but is luke warm.  The other day it was luke-warm chili that would have been really good had it been hot.  I have also gotten the pub pretzels with cheese and the cheese came out with a frozen block in the middle once.  This problem seems to be a kitchen one, since I have had this happen at both McGonigals, and the WIne Bar and now the Annex.  Just heat up the food properly, please!!!!"

The atmosphere was great, the food was fantastic, but the service was sub-par.  So it&#39;s not a very large place inside and there was a Michigan vs. Notre Dame game on, so the bar area was busy, but there were open tables in the place.  We got seated right away and sat at the table for almost 30 minutes before we even got our beers.  The waitress was not very personable, she never even introduced herself.  I have worked in the service industry and find it really irritating when someone doesn&#39;t even give you their name.  When she saw that we were done eating she asked if we were would like dessert, or any other drinks and my boyfriend replied &#34;no, thank you, I think we&#39;re all done.&#34;  She removed the plates and left the table.  She came back with a dessert menu and told us to take a look.....ummm we said no, thank you.   Then when she returned she asked if we had decided on dessert, we told her yet again that we were through.  She left, and returned once more finally with our bill.  MY GOD!  We paid and skidaddled.  Seriously probably some of the worst service I&#39;ve ever experienced.  I mean I can understand if you&#39;re extremely busy, but tell us that up front and make sure you don&#39;t put one table before another, it&#39;s just crappy service!  I really liked the place, had a great feel, but honestly I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll return due to the lack of personality/skill of the staff they have.

I was very pleasantly surprised as I grew up in Barrington and there was NEVER anywhere good to go besides Wool Street, which I find to be just OK.  McGonigal&#39;s is very tastefully decorated and actually resembles an Irish pub.  Their booths have beautiful upholstery and the stools are cushioned and comfortable.  The bar in the center allows you to get a good view of everyone who is showing up for the BHS reunion at night.  I do like the crowd better here and find it to be less obnoxious than at Wool Street.

The menu is well-priced with a variety of traditional Irish food.  I had the Reuben which was one of the best ones I&#39;ve had.  It wasn&#39;t too soggy and came with a great side salad that wasn&#39;t one of those wimpy iceberg ones.  My friend had a chicken sandwich which was just OK.  She should have ordered something more authentic in my opinion anyway.

I noticed that for football games they have 32 oz. of Miller Lite for $5. I am planning to go back this week and will recommend this over Wool Street."

Only wish we would have had a place like McGonigal&#39;s back in my younger days while living in Barrington (aka Borington) where the only nearby fun to be had was on the humdrum Schaumburg strip. 

A legit pub meets dining establishment, meets live music venue, meets event locale, is exactly what this Northwestern &#39;burb needed. There&#39;s a bit of everything to be found here and fortunately, they do it all pretty well. From what I saw, the bar was jumpin&#39; with the younger set consuming Guinness while the &#39;older folk&#39; sat conversing at long, gleaming wood tables over tasties like yummy Reuben&#39;s, Irish Boxty, Shepherd&#39;s Pie and Fish &#39;n Chips. 

A great spot to throw back some wings, watch the game and let loose or even take advantage of this building&#39;s historic past as Barrington&#39;s oldest bank and secure the cozy private dining room that used to be a safe - and still boasts all the combo locks and vault features! 

Impressive space and an enormous upgrade to Borington&#39;s, er, Barrington&#39;s social spectrum. Welcome to your new watering hole, Suburbanites, it&#39;s a keeper!"

I suppose that now that I don&#39;t live in B-town anymore that it&#39;s nice to go to one spot and see people you really haven&#39;t seen and/or care to see again.  

I did enjoy the 10 beer bucket special and the bite of my friend&#39;s reuben sandwich that she begrudgingly let me try.  And after a few buckets (don&#39;t worry, we had a DD), I almost had the chutzpah to go over to said chemistry teacher and berate him for the only &#34;D&#34; I ever received in my entire academic career.

The hostesses were a bit distance and rude they ignore you when you walk in even though you are standing in front of the host stand.  After about 2 mins they acknowledged and sat us, but were running short on menus and had to bring them to us later.  

Overall the atmosphere is great and they have a great beer selection!  I would not recommend for groups or families over 4 people because they have 2 &amp; 4 person tables with the exception of one family table tucked around back that can probably seat eight people.

The decor, the set up, and the service knocked it out of the park.  Great place."

We ordered a vegetable biriyani, lamb biriyani, and chole bhature - all three dishes were delicious. 

The biriyanis do have a good amount of spice, which we like, but if you not, spice can be adjusted for you. 

The chole batura is a combination of chana masala, and a friend bread know as bhatoora. The channa masala was so delicious, and was my favorite out of everything I had eaten. The bread was also very tasty, although it was a bit greasy. 

The prices here are so affordable, and the amount of food is more than enough. We were starving when we go there, and still ended up bringing half of our food home.  

We will definitely be back soon. Thank you!"

The food tasted good, but we did not get rice with our Curries which was unfortunate. The naan was flavorful, but flat and chewy. My partner&#39;s lamb curry had shards of bone in it. 

Service was very to the point. and tepid but wasn&#39;t unpleasant. Maybe if I&#39;m really desperate for Indian cuisine I would go back but there are so many better; albeit, more expensive options."

1) we were charged wrong for the food we ordered 
2) the Indian lady (with glasses)  started shouting at the cashier for wrong billing in Hindi - saying that &#34;if he is careless customers like us will steal this entire store &#34;
3) I challenged her saying she is not doing her job right so she yelled back saying &#34;she know how to do her job&#34; 
4) we waited 30 min for food still no sign of food coming out of kitchen - when asked to get food quick she yelled saying &#34;it ll be delayed if u can&#39;t wait I&#39;ll refund your money &#34;

Their prices were pretty low comparitively to many other places and the place itself was neat and well maintained.
We got their Andhra Spicy Dosa, Vada Idli combo &amp; Lamb Curry with Parantha dish and also their Black Forest Pastry.
Dosa was great , it was spicy and the size was huge.
Their black forest pastry was stale.
Their wada in the wada idly combo was dripping in oil and Sambar was bland.
Lamb curry with parantha combo was a total rip off, with about 2 spoons of curry and undercooked parantha.
Overall there are a few dishes that are worth the price and worth a visit like their biryanis and chat items , personally i would give up after my experience today but I will give one more chance for their biryanis ."

they are famous for their indian cake style desserts (with eggless varieties). Cake in India is unlike anything you get in america... so for those people looking for cake from home- you will find it here.

we ordered food to go:
-what&#39;s nice is that they bag each container separately (in case of oil leakage) so it doesn&#39;t go everywhere (no oil leaked)

we got:
-mutter panner: 
-navratran korma
-mutto chettinand
-chicken biryani
-lamb chettinand

everything of the above was standard fare, to be expected, comfort food. Nothing was mind-blowing or exceptionally good. There was a lot of gravy in the dishes (less veggies). Everything did taste different and it was of decent quality. I think if you want something fast,fresh, and spicy that reminds you of the comfort of home, this is fine. 

There are other options in other restaurants that are better- but this is affordable and decent!

I love that the idli and vada are super fresh (the vadas have especially been super crisp and delicious- they really hit the spot). The dosas are on point. The masala dosa is so good, and the prices are incredible. It&#39;s like $6 for a dosa. I live in Chicago, and you can&#39;t get anything on devon for $6. Chola bhatura is really good.

1. vada was like a rock ; it was almost stale i think; Both chutneys were not fresh and not made with fresh coconut ;Keema puff had no flavor or spice not even salt ......; my friend had dosa and told me it that vegetable fat smeared over it instead of ghee.

2. it was not chapathi but phulka ; curry came with a kidney piece almost immediately had to throw up 
3. Made sure to tell I dont want any neck piece ; liver or kidney etc. guy behind counter tells me they never put it in curry ; I told maybe it was a mistake from last time ; finally eat the curry ; just plain chuncks on meat it is almost he boiled chicken and put it in gravy ; reminds of dirty food stalls quality food ; the poratoa was just put on griddle and not finished so it was rock hard ; me thinks it was frozen ; mirchi bajji one dollar a piece was reeking of bad oil ; same oil used in fryer again and again ....guaranteed to give you a heart attack.

Food is consistently delicious but is spicy and has Andhra touch, mutton curries and biriyani are worth trying. Menu is well displayed and provides adequate choices for Veg and non-veg folks. Snacks are also good, pastries are very delicious. Dosa and Sambhar are good but chutneys are of very poor quality. 

Overall prices are very reasonable and almost half of a sit-in restaurant.

However the ambience for sit-in restaurant in very poor, chairs are of cheap quality and little or no though is given to folks who want to sit-in and eat. For kids who can&#39;t handle spice the only good option is Dosa.

Dirty dirty place. Is Health department sleeping? We sat on a table and they did not even bother to wipe it. It had remains from earlier party. We were hungry and had no inclination to find another place at that time so adjusted. Food quality has been going down in years but surprisingly with increase in customer base. Mostly Indian customers come to it because it&#39;s name resembles a famous bakery in India (not sure if it is same owner because quality is a big let down) and due to lack of Indian fast food choices in this area. We also gave it another try to see if there is any improvement. There was one, they have more siting area now with new booths added

The displays are dirty...electric wire from display lighting touches the food...tapes all over the display...no food warmers to keep bad bacteria away...we ordered chola bhatura, even the street vendor in India knows that Chola Bhatura is served with raw onion, pickle and lemon wedge...there was nothing in the plate...Bhatura were not fried completely and were like raw dough...we ordered 4 dishes(chola bhatura, butter paneer masala with roti and veg burger)...they were not only late they forgot one for which we had to wait another 30 mins...the forgotten one was veg burger...and it had a bun, aloo patty which was cold, lettuce and a mini slice of tomato..no cheese, no sauce, no onion inside

First - The food at this particular store is awesome. If you like spicy Indian food... the biryani is a must for you to try. The Indian style popcorn chicken is to die for! 
The chaat items however are not as &#34;wow!&#34; They are still good but nothing to be too excited about. The pastry cakes are another matter though. While not that great looking, the cake part is perfectly moist and the cream is the right texture to make the whole thing turn into a creamy molten joy inside your mouth. The fruity ones are better than the chocolatey ones, but the best is the butterscotch. If you want Desi style cake - do visit. For all the above combined I award them 5 stars.

Last - It&#39;s a small shop with some seating arrangements. The place looks kind of shabby and the people behind the counter quite annoyed. They are not particularly rude but seem lack public relation skills. For the chilliness I felt in a bakery, I award them 2 stars."

My wife can make better than this. My son had black forest cake he loved it. 

But then this lady comes to buy bread and owner was at the register. He asked her for her photo id. I thought that was strange like she was buying liquor or something banned items. For buying bread this store check photo id. 

Then he went inside and cashier came out and told the lady for her photo id. And she said she can&#39;t sell the bread to her. Lady was asking reason why she can&#39;t sell the bread. The cashier response was they can&#39;t sell bread to her. 

I saw couple of bad rating for food on yelp. But the checking photo id when you buy bread was new to me. I hope they discontinue this practice when someone buys bread.

The customer service is less than desirable to say the least. The staff is over worked, space is cramped, too much noise, shouting - both by staff for food orders and people just makes for a less than decent experience.

Avoid the place during Saturday lunch/dinner hours. I wonder if staff attitude is any better even in off hours though."

Chola Bhatura was amazing,  Masala Dosa meh
Biryani was good though I would have loved for it to have more chicken in there.

When it was my turn to pick out my sweets, the lady at the register disgusted me and I was about to walk out but I had to get sweets for my moms birthday. She was picking at stuff in her teeth while I was telling her what sweets I wanted. That is horrible customer service and something you should do in private in the washroom and not in front of a customer. I will never come back to this place and will refer my friends not to either.

Almost everything we had tasted like it had sambar spice mix in it. The chicken biryani was the worst thing we have ever had ! The masala chai is nothing but hot water, milk base and ready made spice syrup mixed together. The filling inside the puffs wasn&#39;t anything great and the overall flavor of the puffs got ruined once they were reheated in the microwave and served ! We didn&#39;t try the pastry or cake from here after losing our appetite over the bland dishes we tried. The manager/ service provider seemed least interested towards customers. We are not going back to this hot breads ever ! 
However we have been to the other franchise at Naperville twice and found the food to be a lot better. The puffs ( even though pre-heated) and pastries are worth trying from there. And so is the case with masala chai too. Naperville franchise is worth a try!"

First of, no such thing as customer service. I was there with my family and the lady who takes your orders and who runs the cash register was very rude in many ways.  She never acknowledged us standing in front of her waiting to place our order. It took us nearly 10 minutes before she took our order.  ( We were the first one in line and the place wasn&#39;t busy at all at the time)  The food was okay, not good in my opinion.  I have had better food with better customer service at many other places. The place was very filthy. But since we were visiting Chicago and my younger son liked their cake,  we decided to give them another try. And the experience was HORRIBLE!!!!!!! Again I waited a while to place my order. Even though I was first in line,  the same lady kept taking other&#39;s order and chatting with someone. Finally I got to place my order. And when I asked her for number of Idlies in an order,  very rudely she pointed to the board where menu was written and said everything is written - read! How rude!  There was nothing written that clarified the number of Idlies in an order anyway.  But her rudeness didn&#39;t just stop there.  I had some food with me for my youngest who found their food very spicy. My husband took the food out that we had brought in for my son, and lady rudely told me to pack up my food as they didn&#39;t allow outside food. I completely ignored her rudeness and politely told her that we would pack that food back and won&#39;t eat there.  She still had to be nasty about it!  She said what do I mean by that?  I need to immediately pack that, NOW!!!!! Very awful experience!!!!!! I would not recommend anyone to go to this place.  Dirty place with EXTREMELY RUDE customer service!!! I am very much surprised to see that they are still in business! I am just reading all the reviews of this place now. I wish I had read it before."

It is a no frills kind of place. They have south Indian food and bakery items. You order at the front, when food is ready it is called out and you go pick it up. When you are done eating you walk back to the counter and pay  

I would recommend their Dosas...I like the non-masala type, since it tends to be crunchier. Their samosa and papidi chaat is also good. Pastries are not bad either, they also have egg free pastries for vegans"

This was our first time in Bulldog Ale House. We have wanted to try it since we saw it being constructed a few months back. The place was hoppin&#39; at 5PM. Crowd is mostly the &#34;after work crew&#34; having a fun time drinking, watching the game, and socializing. 

+ FREE PARKING

+ GREAT SERVICE! We were greeted and were walked to our booth within seconds of entering. Our server, Erin, came to our table right away with menus. Given that the place was already crowded at 5PM on a Thursday night, this was a good sign. Erin&#39;s timing was just right: to get our drink order, to get our main dish orders, to check on us during the meal, to give refills, to check if we need anything else, and in the end to give us our bill. Bus boys cleared our dishes right away, too. Two managers came by our table to check if everything was ok.

+ EFFICIENT. I found a coupon for us to use and Erin was great in explaining what was needed in order for our coupons to be valid. A manager came to our table when we got our bill to approve the coupon. No muss, no fuss, no drama.

+ GOOD FOOD. We availed of the 89cents wings and $2 beer special on Thursday nights. We also ordered the prosciutto pear pizza (YUM!) and Cajun chicken pasta -- not as spicy as I thought it would be which was perfect for me coz I&#39;m no Spice Girl (Get it? Spice Girl? As in the &#34;I&#39;ll tell you what I want, what I really really want&#34; girl singing group? Children of the 90&#39;s would understand.)  =)  Ok...back to the review...

+ REASONABLE PRICES. For the amount and quality of food you get, the prices are comparable to other ale houses/pubs/restaurants.

+ CLEAN. Tables and booths were clean, bathrooms were clean.

+ PARENT/KID-FRIENDLY. Women&#39;s bathroom has a handicap stall and a baby changing table. Yay! They also have a kids&#39; menu. (Not sure about the men&#39;s bathroom because well, I&#39;m not allowed in there.)

Verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  We will definitely come back!

Shout out to our server ERIN! A party of 12 people came after us. She was the server for them and I could see she was running around and making sure all their needs were met. Erin was on point, man! Kudos to her! #BowDown"

But honestly a huge disappointment when coming to watch the football games and they don&#39;t have the Sunday ticket. Sorry man you got to be fn kidding me. You have people who play fantasy football and other non bears fans who were standing around waiting and hoping for more games to come on. I&#39;m severely disappointed I paid $12 for our beers and didn&#39;t even get to hang out and watch the games.

It turns out Thursday is $2 per pint nite here, and that was a nice big bonus for us!  The food is decent here also as we tried their pulled chicken nachos and a 14&#34; deluxe pizza.  I had several of their beers, and all of them were served in a Goose Island Green Line Pale Ale glass (not a biggie, but not tip top craft beer bar like either).  I had servings of the following and all the ales tasted pretty much the same except the creamy dark Bulldog Ale House ale which was distinctively darker and heavier.  Maybe the ale&#39;s are all the same but they just suspiciously didn&#39;t seem to be as tip top distinctive from one another as I expected, for whatever reason.

- Stone Delicious IPA ( 7.7% ABV)
- Revolution Fist City Pale Ale (5.5% ABV)
- Solemn Oath Punk Rock for Rich Kids Belgian IPA (5.5% ABV)
- Bulldog Ale House Creamy Dark (4.9% ABV)

Anyway, it&#39;s a decent and roomy place to have a catchup session and service was friendly and attentive.  The large space became packed on this Thursday evening.  Be warned that it can get quite loud here and it was a little difficult to carry on a conversation, and we were in the dining room away from the bar to boot."

Do not plan on getting what you ordered - we have gone multiple times because the location is great but on EVERY occassion we received another tables food in error.  Not even worth it to complain - they just cannot seem to get this right.

I don&#39;t mean to be unkind, but get it together, guys.  They also did a small thing with the bill that bothered me. I asked for my salad with the dressing on the side; on the bill, I was charged separately for a side of dressing. It&#39;s not a big deal, it&#39;s $.50.

It didn&#39;t help there was a child screaming in the booth next to ours though... Anyway, it seems like a fun environment, especially for a sports event since there are so many tvs. I can&#39;t imagine how nuts it would get!! The specials are just insane. Every single day there is a special. My husband wanted to go on a Thursday for our first visit since the craft beers are only $2. We shared some pulled chicken nachos to start off- they were delicious! The fall apart chunks of chicken were just great. I loved that it was hidden with the cheese and sour cream in between the layers of chips- instead of just on top!! Each chip had bits of goodness on it, which is how it should be. Of course it was a huge appetizer to share between the two of us (and we ended up bringing some home), so we had a rough time trying to finish our actual entrees (also brought some home). He ordered the turkey panini and I ordered the tacos with beer battered shrimp. The shrimp wasn&#39;t greasy at all, which you sometimes get once it&#39;s beer battered. My dish felt light, but filling. The baja slaw was great! It added a nice crunch to the dish, but I would have preferred it in a sauce format. The salsa served with it added a touch of hot to the mix to really bring everything together.
Overall, the reason why I gave this 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 was a mix of the noise level and the service. Our waitress was friendly but she was pretty MIA the whole time. I think I&#39;ll come back in a month or two and easily be able to give a higher rating!"

A few issues here, the wait for our food was on the longish side. Also my curly fries that I was upcharged an extra $1.99 for as fries along with my sandwich (vs. reg fries), the portion of these was tiny! 

Speaking of strange portions, my steak sandwich was literally a thick steak cut in half on bread with lettuce, tomatoes and onion. It would&#39;ve been nice to have the steak cut thinner so it would be actually eatable as a sandwich. I was also never asked how I wanted it to be cooked and I assumed it was more like a skirt steak which usually is cooked well done-ish and it came out med rare/more rare side and thankfully I was ok with that, but I can see how for many that&#39;s WAY under cooked. 

On a good note I had a bite of my bf&#39;s sriracha goat burger which had a spicy sauce and goat cheese on a pretzel bun and it was delish. 
The interior is also super nice with lots of TVs as well. There was also a large beer selection even though I stuck with white wine which was also good to see multiple options of whites and reds. We were also checked in on a couple times and that was nice."

We liked the menu beforehand and decided to try it . When we walked up to the desk a hostess was seating a party and their were three girls behind the counter and gave us a deer in the headlights stare until we said  2 please!! 

Overall thought they did a super job on the inside ! 
We ordered an app loaded waffle fries no sour cream, they came with sour cream so they had to remake ! 10 mins later out came out correct app then literally 4 mins later after we waited for plates and napkins our dinner order came :-( 

My husband ordered the all you can eat wings: HOT flavored they were fine no criticism really nothing great nor bad ! 

My BBQ chicken ranch salad was awful I order the same salad everywhere this was by far the worst! The salad was mixed with a dressing (not ranch) then sections of corn &amp; bacon I think, also a ton of tomatoes which I hate (not noted in menu) a manager even stopped and asked me if I ordered it with no tomatoes ... He noticed me picking them all out.  I said no it was not listed! Then the worst part of the salad was the grilled chicken with Barbecue sauce poured all over the top not coated just smothered! It all tasted horrible together! 

Another poor part of our experience because it was all Un-delightful was the amount of people seemed to be working and then the ones doing nothing! Our server was serving outside &amp; inside yet I felt she couldn&#39;t even handle us!

A lady &amp; man came to clean the large garage door Windows and door window.... We sat eating talking  and the smell was awful them cleaning while we were eating . Then the lady cleaning the door sprayed windex it flew right into my husbands back and almost our food, I tried telling hey stop she didn&#39;t even notice us ! 

Very poor first experience. I do however always give a new place 2 tries before I don&#39;t return! I will be back to try the pizza and hubby wanted to try a different item other than wings! 

A ton to work on I have opened 2 restaurants being a server in the past years ago ... the amount of training I went through was totally different."

The waitress&#39;s answer was, &#34;it&#39;s only a couple dollars&#34;.    It was our same answer with her tip!  We don&#39;t believe she even asked the manager.

Midnight on a Saturday, a Friday night and today for lunch.  Every time the service has been attentive and the food has been consistently good.  I am a big fan of the spicy garlic wings and the pot pie.  I got the onion rings today and they are tasty and a very large portion.  The beer selection is extensive and reasonably priced.  

All in all this is a good choice for casual food and drinks and to watch a game.  I also want to point out the wide variety of seating options."

This type of restaurant is sorely needed in that spot since Chili&#39;s closed.  I went there tonight with some coworkers and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back.  Our server, Ali, was very attentive and friendly. We tried some of their beers ($2 drafts on Thursdays!) and we did the pretzels.  Everything was fresh and fun. I had the Sunset Wheat and it was great.  There is a patio outside with a fire pit if you like dining on a patio.  And inside there are tables that look at the outside without having to be outside.  It was pretty packed and lively so the volume of the place would have made it a little tough to talk if we sat at, or near the bar, so we opted to sit at a high top table near the opening for the outdoor patio.  That worked out perfectly.  Checking out the menu it looks like there is a lot of choices for great meals and desserts. They will see me again."

On the plus side, the food came out very fast considering the crowd and the atmosphere was clean with kind of a rustic industrial theme.  On the other hand...

App came out, the kind of mac and cheese triangles you swear you&#39;ve seen someplace else before - the neat thing though is these were frozen in the middle.  Server took them back and very kindly offered to take them off our check.  Manager stopped by and mentioned the same.

As we waited, I wondered to myself how they would remedy that situation - unthawed mac squares going straight into the fryer, it&#39;s not like they&#39;d have some thawed and some unthawed laying around... they can&#39;t change the oil temperature...  there&#39;s probably not a 5 star chef back there troubleshooting...  

New mac squares come out.  Hilariously, also ice cold in the center, as predicted.  I wonder now how many more orders went out and came back that night before somebody said stop taking the cheese squares right from the freezer to the fryer.  Alright fine, change to pretzels, even though our food has now arrived.

Mac and cheese looks pedestrian but passable.  Elbows and a light cheese sauce, barely distinguishable from the sort you&#39;ve seen from a box, in a 3/4&#34; deep saucer and dressed up with a bit of breadcrumbs... most likely a treat for the drinking crowd with the munchies though, and certainly a high profit menu item at 10 bucks.

My breakfast burger was also a bit of a mess, with a sunny side up egg on top, crispy on the bottom and snot runny white on the top.  After drooling the liquid egg white onto my plate and assessing the rest of the burger, all looked good except my personal pet peeve: places that serve &#39;gourmet&#39; burgers and ASK how you&#39;d like them cooked, then almost universally overcook the sh*t out of them.  (If I had any confidence whatsoever in an establishment&#39;s ability to properly cook meat, I&#39;d ask for medium as mid-rare is a little iffy in a burger.  But I don&#39;t -  so I always say mid-rare to try and allow a bit of breathing room)  My mid rare burger came out well, and I don&#39;t mean well like they did a good job.  If we ever saw the waitress again I might have considered sending it back.  But it wasn&#39;t overly dry, and with the bacon and the waffle bun it was just a dissapointing background meat texture, so I made do.  The waffle &#39;bun&#39; was a standout though, carmelized sugary crust on the outside and good flavor, just knocking on too sweet.

Somewhere in the middle of the meal the third try at appetizers came out - the pretzels.  Pretty decent pretzels with a uniform texture, no crust to speak of, but good bar food.  Came with both a cheezy sauce and a watery tomato kind of sauce, I hesitate to call it marinara, it seemed &#39;stretched&#39; to me.

When they dropped off the meal initially the waitress asked if I&#39;d like ketchup for my (mostly soggy) fries.  I said &#34;sure!&#34; She said &#34;great!&#34; and then we didn&#39;t see her again until check time.  

If you can&#39;t/won&#39;t train your people to cook a burger less than well, that&#39;s fine.  But STOP ASKING your patrons how they want their burger done.  Make them all uniform well and only disappoint the people who expressly ask for a certain doneness.

We always hate to judge a place that&#39;s newly opened but we may come back in the future and amend our rating if warranted!"

But we got a high table right away.  Service was slow but we attributed that to it bring recently opened and very busy.  We ordered the sunset wheat and the honey Weiss.  Both were very good and a great price and during dinner we shared another sunset wheat.  I usually don&#39;t drink beer but it was fresh and tasted refreshing.

For dinner we had the 1/2 slab ribs and the shrimp tacos.  Both were excellent.  We shared the cheesecake for dessert and I ate more than I usually do of dessert because it was so good.

We liked that the large overhead doors were open to give an airy feel and on the patio they lighted fires since it was cool.  Nice atmosphere.

The music wasn&#39;t loud but maybe that was due to the lively conversation.

We will definitely return."

Problem #1: Waitress served me an iced tea with an already squeezed lemon. Did she squeeze it into my tea for me? Nope. What are you guys doing...recycling lemons or something equally gross and unsanitary??

Problem #2: One of the people in our party ordered a hamburger with no mayo. The burger he was given had no lettuce, tomato, pickle, but did in fact have mayo. When it was sent back, it was brought back without the veggies but this time it had cheese on it. What&#39;s going on here?? A burger is a simple order and it gets messed up...twice! A gift card was offered but refused...it&#39;s not like we&#39;ll come back here...and this person in our party wasn&#39;t going to attempt ordering anything else.

Problem #3: Another person in our party ordered a deluxe pizza. When food was served to our table, the pizza was given to another couple in our group and this mix up wasn&#39;t realized until 2 pieces were already plated by the other people. When the server was notified, she picked it up and moved it to the right person...missing 2 pieces! No one offered to comp anything and they never offered to make a new pizza.

Problem #4: Your Friday all you can eat fish fry is horrible. The fish was so greasy and heavily beer battered, that the fries underneath the fish were completely grease soaked and incredibly salty. The fish just crumbled apart, likely the result of grease, batter, and absorbed moisture from the fish and the fries. I didn&#39;t dare order a refill.

What&#39;s going on here, Bulldog Ale House? Your servers are very nice (we got a woman named Voula) but there is something very wrong in your kitchen and definitely in the way you compensate your customers for messed up orders. I will never return here and I&#39;m embarassed that our Meetup group had a dinner here."

Most importantly, they have installed the NFL Sunday ticket so they will be showing all games. 

I have spent my career in customer service. That is the reason I will not stand for poor service  but it also allows to to appreciate a genuine attempt at recovery. After all, no one is perfect. Bulldog has has done what it takes to make an excellent recovery. Kudos to them.

Our server Juliana had checked on is so many times, I just figured it was coming. When I eventually asked, she was so apologetic and I felt bad for even bringing it up, I didn&#39;t miss it. But Mike the manager came out and insisted that they were making the pizza. I offered to buy it but he refused. I am so impressed with how they handled the situation.

Returned on Saturday and sat at the bar this time. Beer was still a 5, service much better 4 but the food was a 2. Ordered tenders again and they left off 90% of the sauce. When we asked for more sauce, it took almost 10 minutes.

It&#39;s in the old Chili&#39;s building in Rolling Meadows. The inside is nicely redone and the 2 outside patios are cute.  It was quite crowded on this Friday night around 6:15pm. We got there just in time to get the &#34;last table&#34; according to the  hostess. This restaurant doesn&#39;t take reservations so get there early or be prepared to wait. At our table of four, we ordered burgers,  wings, chili, and the Friday special all you can eat fish fry for $9.99.  Everything was very good.  The big pieces of fish especially were very tender and tasty. For dessert, have the freshly made donuts with dipping sauces (chocolate,  caramel,  raspberry) -it&#39;s yummy goodness.  3 big fresh warm donuts -yum!  Be sure to check out the website before you go for their coupon offers.  Btw -it&#39;s very loud in this place, more than just bar loud.  There&#39;s high ceilings and nothing to absorb sound.  So if you are planning for a nice quiet dinner and drinks to talk to the people you are with, this is probably not the place to do it. I would definitely go back for the food.

In terms of food; We both ordered caesar salads to start, I ordered the mild buffalo chicken wings &amp; my girlfriend ordered boneless barbque wings. Being that my entire family is from buffalo new york I always love trying wings at different restaurants to see who has the best wings in comparison to anchor bar in buffalo new york where wings first came about. In my opinion the wings were about a 7/10. They were cooked well, had the perfect kick to them, &amp; they weren&#39;t to saucy but at they same time they weren&#39;t too dry. The service was pretty good as well. I drink a lot of water and on average I never went any more than 2 minutes after finishing my drink without being asked if I wanted a refill. The manager also stopped by our table (he visited several) &amp; asked us how our meal was. In my opinion that tells you a lot about a restaurant! Definitely plan on going back to try one of their burgers &amp; a chicken sandwich!"

I&#39;ve had this plenty of times at the other Bulldogs locations and asked for the &#34;build your own burger&#34; menu, with all the choices of toppings, cheeses, sauces so on. Waitress told us, &#34; oh we don&#39;t have one, but we pretty much have everything&#34; which led me to ordering the same old standard burger with bacon and cheese. Seems like a missing piece as people want to be creative with their selections. 

All in all, beer was good, just need more organization."

This was my first visit to the Schaumburg location. We went around 9:30 and our waitress didn&#39;t have many tables. We ordered chips and queso which took far too long to come out in my opinion. Our waitress was seated with 3 parties and seemed to not really care about my boyfriend and I.

I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta which had about 4 small pieces of chicken, so I wasn&#39;t very happy.  My boyfriend order the Bulldog burger, which came with what looked to be like  a smaller than normal portion of fries. I understand that this location opened not too long ago but the staff needs to be more enthusiastic and talk to their guests. I might come back to give this location another try."

I called the manager over it took three different times for the checks to come out in order to get the credit but only credited one of our checks. Waitress never smiled once , only came back to check on us as our food was being cleared away. We were seated before for other tables however those four tables received all of their food before we even got our appetizer. Maybe they should consider hiring someone over the age of 17. Very disappointing. We&#39;ll go back to the one in Roselle, they have trained servers, a nice manager and delicious food. Rolling Meadows has a lot of work to do on that location.

TVs everywhere which was awesome. I don&#39;t think there is any seat in the house that you could not see at least three different TVs. So we get there for the end of the Beats game and everything seems normal. Bears are on multiple TVs with sound. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks which was a really good Saturday special. Ordered burgers and while we were waiting for them to come, the Bears game ended and the Cubs game started. The only difference was there was no sound for the Cubs game. As we ate our mediocre burgers we asked if we could hear the Cubs game. The answer given was &#34;No, Bears we listened to, and playoffs maybe, but not a Cubs game&#34;. I would get this if it was billing itself as a restaurant, but once they hang 30 TVs then you are a sports bar. We finished eating and left. We will not be going back. If I wanted a burger and not hear what was going on TV I would go to a place like Kumar Korner for much better food. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was the beer specials. Don&#39;t waste your time on mediocre food. This place does nothing to distinguish itself from everywhere else."

I asked about the great coupon, but seemed the waitress was not trained on the offer,  She was knowledgeable of the more important items like the craft beers and the food, but again she could not direct me on how to take advantage of the coupon.  I finally realized that the daily specials voided the coupon and were a better value anyway.  I will go back for the food and beer selection.

We had problems that could very well be attributed to it&#39;s newness.
1. Poor service. The place wasn&#39;t busy on a Monday evening, but we rarely saw our waiter. And when we did, he was exasperated. Everyone wanted to sit outside because of the nice weather and the hostess kept sitting people out on the patio, but the one waiter had to juggle everyone. The waiter was obviously not extremely experienced yet...which is fine, particularly with a new place, but nobody was added to assist. Inside...maybe two tables were filled with patrons. Obviously this is a management issue they will work out.
2. Speaking of management...we had a coupon from their website, but it required a manager override or something to update the check to incorporate the discount. The manager completely disappeared. Left the place. He was walking around early in our visit, but was nowhere to be found when we needed him. Very unprofessional.
3. I had the pot pie. It was fantastic, but served in the little iron pot it was cooked in. It was incredibly hot, so much so that when I cut into it, the sauce inside hit the pot and immediately started boiling. If management is reading...watch that...I would have mentioned it to the waiter or manager, but...see #1 and #2.

One more note: we have kids, and they came too. Great kids menu, with crayons, but I would recommend either getting some kid-friendly cups (read: covers) or buy stock in napkins.

I realize this review is mostly directed at the management of the place, but all in all, we will go back because the food and drink is great, and it&#39;s family friendly. If service doesn&#39;t improve that will kill it though. I recommend it, but not if you&#39;re in a hurry, at least for the time being. When you go, check the website ahead of time...very nice discounts! (assuming they can find the manager)"

We&#39;ve come here 4 times since they opened and I really want to like the location more. They have great specials, a welcoming environment, and a great outdoor eating area (at least as great as anything bordering Golf Road can be), but there are still operational details that have yet to be worked out. Service is inconsistent. There are times we&#39;ve been served in a very reasonable amount of time and sometimes we are left waiting. The restaurant itself is too cold. When we made a comment about it, the server indicated that it always is like that. Okay, don&#39;t admit it, fix it! I don&#39;t mean this is a little cold, I mean it&#39;s freezing. I should not sit there waiting for my order to end to get somewhere warm. I&#39;m no HVAC man, but I&#39;m sure it can be fixed. Another pet peeve and maybe it&#39;s just me, but in a largely empty restaurant, I think a request for a booth could be accomodated. The hostess indicated that she was trying to get the waitress from this particular station more activity, but no offense, that&#39;s not really the customer&#39;s issue. The place wasn&#39;t a little empty, it was a lot empty. Just accommodate the request please. To the server&#39;s credit she then checked and indicated that the booth next to us was the servers after all and would move us but we had already sat down. Then she wouldn&#39;t let it go. Hopefully these operational issues smooth out over time, but the clock is ticking....."

Not only was Ali doing this but she was fantastic at it.  I would have rated 5 stars but I was disappointed in the managers. We came to the restaurant on 6/29 at approx 6:30pm.  Both male managers I noticed never attempted to help Ali even though it was obvious she had 11 active tables at once.  They could have helped the server clean off the dirty dishes etc.  I also noticed one of the managers on his cell phone.  I felt really bad for Ali. We also never had a manager visit our table but noticed they visited other tables.  My Wife had to return her meal but Ali corrected it right away.

Now, we have one in the neighborhood!!!   We&#39;ve been there the last two Thursdays and it has been a bit crowded.  The work crowd from surrounding business coupled with the nice weather is filling up the parking lot and creating a small wait.   But it is well worth it- Thursday&#39;s are $2 draft night.  ANY DRAFT BEER!!!  Can&#39;t tell you how much the pocketbook likes the tab after having a few Three Floyd&#39;s craft beers that usually cost $8 at other pubs.   Besides the beer, the food is great.   Burgers are popular with the boys and last week I tried the steak sandwich- it was flavorful, not chewy and cooked to a perfect medium-rare.    I can&#39;t wait for football season to start, Bulldog&#39;s has televisions everywhere and not a bad seat in the house.   Do yourself a favor and stop by for a pint (or two).

We arrived at 11:30 on a Sunday night, and it wasn&#39;t that busy. It still took the host a while to greet us and show us to a table. And then the server immediately came to our table, took our drink orders, and before I could ask her a question, she rushed off. After about 10 minutes, long after we were ready to order, I was wondering where she was.  Well, I saw her: hunched over the bar, flirting with a couple of guys.

After that, I made sure to nurse my beer pre next beer or order (even at +50% beer left) every time she came back.

They actually had a decent beer special for a weekend day if you&#39;re up for that (as far as I can see, mainly good domestic special otherwise meh).  The same can not be said for their food specials.

Though it&#39;s certainly not worth a large pilgrimage from afar. 

The beer selection is pretty decent and the food is cheap and certainly falls into the &#34;bar food&#34; category. Meaning burgers, chicken tenders, nachos, etc. The food we had was really good, but you also have to factor in that after 3 beers any food they put in front of me is going to have an elevated status. 

You are also pretty much surrounded by huge flat screens in every direction the second you walk in the door. If you happen to be a sports person, this is a great option. Assuming this place has NFL Sunday ticket, this might be my new post up spot for the coming season to keep tabs on my fantasy rosters. They also have all the UFC fights on pay per view, which is another huge draw for me. 

The service here was really prompt, especially considering how busy the place was. Also, (and I realize this is an intangible that has no bearing on my review) but our waitress was hot as the Sun. I&#39;m not talking garden variety not being able to turn your head away at a stop light kinda hot. This girl could start wars.

Recently on one of my visits the bill with tip was 40.00, I put a ten in the slots and won 50 bucks."

Top Definition. Rookie. A Beginner. A starter. Somebody that just doing or trying something for the first time.

Located in a strip mall.
Service attitude was typical of someone who doesn&#39;t want to be there, the food was typical bar style deep fried frozen products, just a entry level place that a few middle age buddies bought in together, I pegged this in a second with the manager &amp; gang hanging out at the bar hitting on the waitress.
I&#39;ll be back when they have a drink special for .50 cent Corona Light bottles."

Cash only that night and it was not good service.  The queso and chips were the worst I&#39;ve ever had anywhere.  They called it queso, but it was a canned nacho cheese.  Queso is a white cheese folks!  

The waitress with credit card systems offline seemed lost.  I waited 15 mins for my water while I was already eating.  Our beer took forever on the refill.  

The best thing they had going was the $3.99 chicken sandwich deal!  Other than that, we were not impressed at all."

It&#39;s definitely bar food, but good bar food! They give you popcorn for free at the table when you dine in and they usually have pretty good food and drink specials. Including $1 hotdogs and burgers.

The service is always really great, everyone&#39;s friendly even when you carry out. 

Tons of tv&#39;s everywhere, it&#39;s a good place to go grab a bite and watch the game.

I wish they had some of the specials even for carry out just because I work across the street so we&#39;d probably get it more often. Some of the other food is a little overpriced. 


Good place though! I&#39;ll be back often!"

So to people thinking about going here. It&#39;s not horrible. My rating is low because I&#39;m a regular and I see this place for what it actually is. 

THE FOOD BLOWWWSSS. (WAIT LET ME TAKE THAT BACK) 
DID YOU LIKE CAFETERIA FOOD AS A KID?? IF YOU DID, YOULL LOVE IT. 

Also it&#39;s really really odd to see the 45 year old + owners hanging around the bar feeling up the servers and bartenders. These girls barely look old enough to serve. It&#39;s so utterly blatant and uncomfortable. On the bright side because of this the girls are quick with your drinks since they know what will happen should they stand still lol. There are a couple of shady regulars. There&#39;s this 38 year old Caucasian guy who dresses like he&#39;s ice cube, steer clear of him. He gets greased up and thinks he is ice cube from the nwa days. Constantly harassing people outside.

The reason I&#39;m giving them three stars is because of the fact that they do have a lot of Tvs and decent drink specials from time to time. The free popcorn is a nice touch, the service again is pretty good."

I&#39;ve definitely experienced better (especially at the Hoffman Estates branch).

I came here on a Friday night with about 8 ladies. We were seated promptly but that was the only prompt action that was taken the whole night. We waited 5 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink, closer to 15 minutes before we got our drinks (and our drinks didn&#39;t even come out all at once, pretty ridiculous if you ask me). Our later guests had to wait another 15 minutes before their drinks came.

Our server Jessica was not attentive, did not come by to ask us if we were doing alright. And when she did and we asked for water and napkins, it seemed like it was inconveniencing her and she didn&#39;t even bring us napkins. 

Our checks were separated, which we asked before hand and she said it would be fine. Fine if she actually knew who was ordering what, very rookie mistake (pun intended). Once I did receive my bill, I noticed that there was an 18% gratuity on our bill. I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;ve ever gotten group gratuity at a bar and I&#39;m not sure I was happy about it especially with the service that we received. But then again, maybe we received the service we did because of the 18% tip she knew she was going to receive. 

She also dropped my card along the way and came back and told me I didn&#39;t add my card to the check I handed her... really? Once she found it next to our table, she didn&#39;t even apologize for her mistake. 

Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. If I go back to Rookies, it&#39;ll be at Hoffman Estates."

Came here one night to just hang out with some people and watch some basketball. It&#39;s good for that. Lots of TVs. They have drink specials too. which is always a plus. On this night they had a live DJ that was music video spinning so that was pretty sweet. 4 stars for the nightlife aspect.

2 stars for the food though. So it averages out to 3. I went on like a Friday so they had the 50 cent mini tacos. These are like literally mini, like the size of a chicken nugget. Not good quality either, tasted like it was microwaved. So I ordered a bunch of those cause I didn&#39;t think they were that small but it was no where near filling me up. Got the cheese and sausage panzerotti which is pretty muc ha big pzone. You can&#39;t go wrong wit ha Pzone, but this one seemed huge but was mostly filled with air. It tasted good, but had like barely any meat. Was pretty disappointed since it was like 9 bucks.

Service was alright. Our waitress was nice, a little slow though. Didn&#39;t check up on us too often. We had a bigger than usually group, probably like 12 of us. Mostly we ordered drinks, but she didn&#39;t think to have us split the check. So we had to go through it and split it ourselves. No harm no foul though, just a slight pain."

I went for a birthday celebration with my boyfriends family, about 8-11 people total. I called to see if they took reservations, and I was a little upset. However I saw a comment box and sent in a request/question, submitted it, and literally about 30 second later I got a response from John Alimissis stating that he can accommodate our party no problem. After a couple of emails it was all set. Definitely a perk!

When we walked in early, they were prepared and sat us down with no problems. We had a server named Brie who was super awesome, friendly, and overall a fantastic waitress!! She was very attentive and even brought me a birthday sundae!

I would have to say that this is a place I will definitely be coming back to, especially for the upcoming football season!!

I work in, like, the Bermuda Circle. It&#39;s a giant circle going as far west as 59 and as far east as Woodfield Mall. It&#39;s Bermuda because my money magically disappears and my waistline magically increases. And every couple years or so, I grow a new chin. I know all the little food &#34;barrios&#34; around my work because my coworkers and I eat out every day just to get out of the office.

Anyway, Rookies is part of this &#34;barrio&#34; that includes Red Robin, BW3, and a lot of typical lunch places (well...it&#39;s typical if you&#39;ve been eating there for 6 years). Rookies was one of the newer additions who enticed us with $1 Burgers a month before it opened.

Anyway, you walk in to this place and get the best part...POPCORN! Good ol&#39; movie theater style popcorn. I could seriously just go and eat popcorn and drink Diet Coke all day. Oh yeah, and I&#39;ve seen 670 AM The Score there a couple times during football season which was kinda cool too.

It&#39;s a nice looking sports bar, but more of an ADD type of sports bar than a &#34;Chicago Games On The Big Screen&#34; kind. All the TVs are about the same size and they might be like 46&#34; plasmas, but they&#39;re dwarfed by the place&#39;s high ceilings and what not. It&#39;s a nice casual sports bar that&#39;s very big and open so sports fans and hungry non-sports fans can cohabit the place.

Oh, right...the food.

So, as I&#39;ve said, I eat around these places a lot, and even though Rookies isn&#39;t anywhere near my favorite, it&#39;s just another choice in the daily lunch rotation. With so many opportunities to eat here, I have eaten just about everything off of this menu. You know how you have that favorite burger at Red Robin or that favorite sauce at BW3? I was trying to find that here, but man, I&#39;ve struck out like 15 times! There is NOTHING on this menu worth mentioning. Everything&#39;s average, everything&#39;s mediocre. I&#39;ve never tried the $1 burger, but man, if the $9 is that bad, I don&#39;t even want to know how bad $1 is!

SANTA FE COBB SALAD
You know cheap salad when you see one. I mean, Wendy&#39;s salads have more respect for themselves than this! It&#39;s real easy to picture too. You know what a cobb salad looks like, right? Well, now imagine that it was served to you at Denny&#39;s or IHOP at 4AM. Now you know what it&#39;s like here!

GYRO PLATE
If there&#39;s anything that I&#39;ve actually ordered more than once, other than Diet Coke, it&#39;s this. I mean, it&#39;s hard to mess up, really. Nothing special about it, though, that would separate it from any other place. 

BBQ RIBS &amp; CHICKEN
I decided one day, for dinner, that I was going to splurge and get the most expensive thing. This is actually fried chicken and ribs, not grilled. The skin on the chicken is pretty good; it&#39;s very crunchy (not crispy...YES there&#39;s a difference!) but if you&#39;re lucky enough to actually get meat, it&#39;s pretty dry. The ribs weren&#39;t too bad. They were actually &#34;Fall off the bone&#34; as advertised. I wouldn&#39;t mind the ribs again, but I&#39;m not much for &#39;em anyway.

So there you go. Want to get a drink and catch a game you&#39;re mildly interested in, come to Rookies. Want free popcorn? Rookies. Anything else, you&#39;re better off skipping this one."

The layout of the bar was spacious and it looked as if there was plenty of seating to handle a good crowd, but since we were there to watch the game, we sat up at the bar.  Our Bartender was attentive and friendly, always checking on us to see if we needed any refills.  Miller bottles were $3 each...not cheap, but not unreasonable, either.  But the Burger special that they&#39;d offered forces me to raise an average rating of 3 stars up one more.  For $1, you can get a 1/2 lb burger with all the fixin&#39;s along with a basket full of chips (easily an $8 or $9 entree anywhere else).  VERY tasty sandwich and yes, only one dollar!

Plenty of TVs around to make for a decent sports bar although a big screen or two might&#39;ve been nice.  Still, great food, great specials and attentive bartenders made our experience here a good one!"

I had some reservations walking in because I was told the owner(s) (at least in the St. Charles location) were very frugal if not downright cheap, and they only gave real effort to daily regulars, not exactly a warm bar to walk in to. That may be the truth but I can readily proclaim that my barkeep, Jaime D. (as it said on my receipt because they don&#39;t wear name-tags, which, by the way, is great...I&#39;m there for service and if that service-person is good, I will make it a point to learn their name), anyway, Jaime D. was a top ten beer slinger of all time. She just had her arms wrapped all the way around the customer experience...and I say that not as a male looking at a &#39;perty&#39; girl but one who was with a female colleague that got equal attention. The food was a disappointment. I ordered fish fry hoping it was a nice battered cod but it was a square piece of filet-o-fish pulled straight out of the US foods box stored in the freezer. The clam chowder was salty and off. With that negative being said, I would go back, order up some simple wings and I believe this would be a great place to watch a game and have just enough beers to need a cab ride home!

I don&#39;t think I will be returning here. The food overall was some what decent. 
The cheese on the cheese fries was very watered down and tasted like it came out of a can. 
The boneless wings were okay, except they were very small (looked like baby mcnuggets) and the sauce appeared to be poured right on top of them vs cooked in the sauce.  
The mini burgers were perhaps a step above what McDonalds offers, but not much more.
The chicken wrap was best summarized by my wife as &#34;different&#34;.

Previously, they were overcharging EVERYONE on sales tax. However, they still insist on charging the full sales tax on discounted daily specials.  That is, if a pizza is $20 they charge tax on $20 and not the discount price of $10 (Monday&#39;s special is half price pizzas). You don&#39;t pay taxes on a sales item&#39;s original price; you pay on the sales price.  If you buy anything on sale, you do not pay tax on the original price -- food, TVs, cars, etc. 

Also, their pizza prices on the menu do not match what they charge on the receipt.  Our $19.99 pizza was billed at $20.99.  In trying to bring their errors to their attention, we were told bluntly that they were to busy for us.  And, even told by our waitress that &#34;if you don&#39;t like it, you don&#39;t need to come back&#34;.  No worries there.

The economy must be back and booming for Rookies since they feel free to insult their customers."

Oh yeah - one adult must order for the regular menu to be able to partake in the Kids Eat Free special. No big deal to us really. It is all decently priced.

Pleasantly surprised by the many kiddie options, but, of course, my kids picked the chicken fingers and fries. Guess we could have went to the Golden Arches...  :)

As for my husband and I, we were expecting your typical bar fare and that is exactly what we got. No big surprises there. Husband ordered the $5 italian beef. He said it was super pricey. I ordered a club sandwich of some sort. No big surprises there either.

The service....NOT IMPRESSED - slow, Slow, SLOW! And from what I read on here - other reviewers feel the same way.

So, if you aren&#39;t in a hurry and you want to feed your kids for little money - go here.

We came here to watch the UFC and get our grub on.  We only waited about 15 minutes for a table, and once seated, no matter what you want to watch, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll be able to see it with the amount of tv&#39;s in the room.  So me and my wife are seated, and the first thing i notice is that the floor under the table is slippery, which gives me pause to check the cushion(we were seated in a booth) which happened to be wet.  So after the server takes our drink orders, I ask for some napkins, because there is either a beverage or cleaning solution on the cushion next to me.  Our drinks come out, and our server comes back ready to take our food order.  We order our food and I ask for the napkins again..  My wife got the berry nut chicken salad, I got a burger as usual, this time with the chips.  To my surprise, the chips were like the chips ffrom harry carays, not like the kind you get in a bag at the gas station.  

So, those napkins never came, and also, we have no utensils, and no server within 7 minutes of the last time we saw her, AND the chicken is missing from the salad.  I grow impatient and wipe that fluid off the seat with the back of my coat, which is dry-clean only, so I pray it was just water. She finally comes back, and we haven&#39;t touched our food yet(I wanted to cut my burger in half).  My wife tells her about the chicken.  Our servers response? &#34;Oh you wanted chicken?  It&#39;s probably in the back&#34;
Huh?  If you are just now realizing we ordered chicken for the salad, how could you know that it was in the back?  Another 5 minutes, and the chicken appears. By now, 4 of our friends are seated with us.  This was how it went all night long.  We ask for something once, she comes back and asks if everything is okay, we have to remind her that we ordered something 10 minutes ago, and then it shows up 15 minutes after that.  I asked for a cup of coffee at 1057pm, she says coming right up.  She finally shows her face at our table at 1121pm and asked if we needed anything.  I remind her about that coffee, to which she says, regular or decaf?  Dude, I ordered that 24 minutes ago!  Even if she used the excuse that it wasn&#39;t made yet.....I dunno.  I was sad that our server wasnt the same one we had last time.  I know she was busy, but she doesn&#39;t seem to have the multi-tasking thing down pat just yet.  And I know it&#39;s a hard job, but not all jobs are for everyone.  

On the plus side, it was a good fight card to watch for free!  

The stupid thing at the end of the night was that they cut the audio off during the post-fight interview for the main event in order to play &#34;sexy and i know it&#34;  Like, seriously?  Would it kill the DJ to NOT press play for just 2 more minutes?  We all know what that stupid song sounds like, I think we could have finished the interview before pumpin up the jam, know what I mean?

I&#39;ll be back again, but if I&#39;m seated in that girls section again, I&#39;ll go back to the hostess and tell her I&#39;d like to wait for the next table.  You can see the TVs just fine from the hostess area."

The first time, I went with a group of seven adults during a Hawks game.  We were seated right away and got our free popcorn (it makes the place smell like the movies if you like that kind of thing!)  Our service was pretty good--slow on the drinks but good on the food.  She was really on top of getting us our food and everything quickly.  She even took back my chicken when I ordered the wrong thing and couldn&#39;t eat it (it was a broiled chicken vs. blackened chicken situation).  There was no charge for that.  I give her a 4 for this trip.

The second time, there were four women, and three kids.  We went because all November is Kids Eat Free month, and they had a magician come in and entertain the kids.  The magician was really good and made all of them balloon animals.  He spent a lot of time talking with us, and was friendly.  The service--not so much.  It was $.39 wing night, and the waitress tried to tell me I wasn&#39;t going to be able to bring my leftover wings home because it was dine-in only.  Seriously?  Um, no.  I brought them home anyway.  And she never got us popcorn.  But our waitress gets a 3 from me for this whole experience.  My Gyro and seasoned fries were good, though!

The third time, we had five adults and four kids, and it was the same magician/balloon animal guy.  He was great again, and even showed us some new tricks!  He made each child two balloon animals and was very nice.  Our waitress was great, and really on top of things with both drinks and food.  Never had anything to say about my to-go wings.  I give her a five.  I ordered the veggie wrap and seasoned fries.  As well as mild wings--the wings were just ok, but my mom and I agreed that my veggie wrap was really yummy!!

So overall, I give this Rookies a 4--good for atmosphere, price, and selection of food (I liked my veggie wrap and their seasoned fries are delicious!!) but some of the waitstaff needs to bring it up a notch!"

I ordered their &#34;berry nut salad&#34; with broiled chicken breast. The picture looked amazing. But nothing like the real thing. It was the driest most shriveled salad I have ever had. The chicken was so dry I couldn&#39;t even swallow it without sipping my drink. The tomatoes were all wrinkled and the strawberries were half rotten. I even had to pick out parts of the spring mix that were shriveled and black. Even though I told the waitress that it was the worst salad I have ever had in my life, she did nothing about it. Didn&#39;t even applogize. NOTHING?!?!  I even ended up breaking my diet and eating my kids chicken strips. At least my husband was satisfied with his burger and my kids were happy.

If I was reviewing the place as a bar.. I&#39;d give it maybe 4.. so i settled on 3. 

I get lured in for the $1.00 burger they offer every few months, and contrary to others who have yelped this place.. I understand the up charges for cheese and fries.. that&#39;s fine with me. Do people really think they were going to walk in and pay $1 for their lunch and leave? Really? 

The burgers are always overcooked, so I make a point of ordering it a temp under how I would usually like it., for example, I like my burgers Med, to med rare.. I&#39;ll usually order it Med Rare.. and it comes perfect. If you say medium... you get well.. go ahead and use this nugget of brilliance I have just provided you and save your time writing the shitty review of the burger.. and remember.. it&#39;s still cheaper then that crap hole Red Robin next door.. but that&#39;s another review for another day.

This is in a strip mall and is a fairly typical &#34;sports bar&#34; - a big bar in the middle, lots of tv&#39;s and beer posters.  We went there for lunch and lingered for several hours.  The Chicken sandwich was indeed a dollar, though the fries  and extra toppings add to that.  Still a deal at $3 - 4  depending on the final format.

I like Rookie&#39;s. I just moved to the area and it&#39;s an easy place to drink beers and eat burgers friends (and their burgers are pretty damn good!). They also have beer nuggets, which is a rare find, and their appetizers are great. Probably not a good place to come if you&#39;re epileptic, as it&#39;s total overstimulation as far as TV screens and other visual clutter, but otherwise, it&#39;s a fun place.

Its ok...but like so many other suburban bars(or bars in general)...it lacks personality.  Sportsbar with lots of TV&#39;s, and good looking girls waitressing and behind the bar.  This combination will always bring the guys in.   But I digress.

I was hear for a b-day get together and a little reunion of high school friends.   It was a good time.   They kept the beer flowing along with the cascade of jeager(we do this too much and much and much) bombs.They have those funky plastic bomb cups with the little shot glass in the middle.  I have mixed feelings about this concept...Is the only shot in this world a Bomb shot now?!   Looks like it.   Just give me a shot of whiskey(in a glass shot glass) and I&#39;m good.   

I digress again.   They do have a lot of food on the menu...mostly bar food.   So when in Rome...one has bar food at a sports bar.   I had their triple play appetizer platter(chicken tenders, onion rings, and jalepeno poppers).  Which were pretty good.  Onion rings stood out...I ordered more.   They also noticed they had a double, triple, and quad? play...that must be intersting.  

A subtraction of 1 star due to the local police waiting for outside and busting a patron just when he backed out his car.  This is bad business...I thought police officers couldnt wait in the parking lot...not cool.

I went to catch a Hawks game, sat at the bar, and the bartender assigned to my section never acknowledged me.  It took 10+ minutes before another bartender asked me what I wanted, at which point the original bartender apologized and said she didn&#39;t even see me there.  Nice.

Decent price for drinks.  I had the buffalo-chicken wrap but it came with blue cheese in it.  My bad if it said that in the menu, but I hate blue cheese; it would have been nice to have a ranch option.  Anyway, that&#39;s not the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back.  Another time I went there for a few drinks during a Hawks game and the waitress shorted me on change.  Not cool.  I always tip 20+%, because I grew up with parents in the service industry (owning/working at a restaurant), but I expect the wait-staff to be honest and not try to pocket extra change when someone&#39;s had a few drinks.

It is located in the same complex as the BW3s, so you&#39;d think it might be a dangerous gamble going up against the chicken wing king, but Rookies manages to pull off a menu that&#39;s varied enough to make it a good alternative. That atmosphere is decidedly &#34;sports bar&#34; with TVs everywhere, high ceilings, industrial accoutrements, and the cheers of a happy crowd every time the Blackhawks score  a goal. There&#39;s not a scrap of carpet in the place, so between the metal ceiling, the brick walls, and the stone floor, it tends to be a little loud, but let&#39;s face it: you&#39;re not going to Rookies to propose to your girlfriend over a quiet meal. (If you ARE... well... good luck to your sir.) At first glance, I thought Rookies may have been going for a &#34;Hooters&#34; vibe based on the logo (with two round &#39;objects&#39; where the O&#39;s should be), but the wait staff was casually dressed. Yes, there were some short shorts and tank tops involved, but I&#39;d call that normal attire for the warm Chicago evening when we stopped by. Rookies was also packed with families, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about taking your little buckaroos here for the big game.

The menu is very typical bar food: fried food appetizers, some salads, a variety of sandwiches, and pizza. That bar had PBR on tap, so I was happy to start right there. I&#39;m classy like that. My wife and I started with an order of the Saganaki, which is described on the menu as &#34;The Flaming Cheese,&#34; and was it ever. Our friendly waiter served it to us on a platter that was quickly doused with (what I assume was) alcohol and lit on fire. Check the photos section for a shot of it, though I think I managed to completely miss most of the flaming tower with my high end photography equipment (read: cell phone).  Opa!

After the Saganaki, we had the pizza as our main course. As pizza goes, it was good, but nothing special. Enjoyable, but nothing unique. Not terribly different from any other similar bar in the area (Jersey&#39;s, Moretti&#39;s, etc.) The tomato sauce was a little on the sweet side, so keep that in mind if it affects your choice of pizza locales one way or the other.

In summary: will return. A good alternative if you&#39;ve tired of your normal sports bar destinations. Might even be a good long-term sports bar for you and your friends."

We were seated right away and given a bowl of popcorn , ordered our drinks and looked over the extensive menu . We were very impressed with all the choices , we chose Mac &amp; Cheese bites , they arrived quite fast and they were a real treat . The tv&#39;s were mostly tuned to the Hawks as was the sound , we were in heaven ! I ordered a Greek salad with Gyros , my wife the salad and half sandwich . Both were very tasty , our waitress was very good and restrooms were clean . Only problem was that with only two minutes left in the game the DJ started to play ! We were quite confused as this is a sports bar . I would give it a second chance ."

+The place itself is not too bad, though it is a strip mall bar. 
+Free popcorn-nice! 
+While we only had our own meals which were definitely good, the rest of the menu looks awesome.

Here&#39;s where my 2 stars come in.

1st we asked the bartender what the specials were and she said there were none. As 2 employees of a bar, we knew that there&#39;s no way this could be true. Even if it were something we didn&#39;t want, we find it hard to believe that there are zero specials. After looking around at the memorabilia I noticed a big specials banner that was placed on a wall behind us - and what do you know? There were about 4 different drink specials on Mondays. Strike one. 

The place isn&#39;t huge, but when we were in there were only about 15 people in the whole place - and that&#39;s probably being nice. We ordered the beer bread nuggets which for some reason took almost about 25 minutes to come out. Then we ordered our meals, I got a chicken wrap with chips and my roommate the Chicago style hotdog with chips - took another 25 minutes. Really? It&#39;s a Monday afternoon and 75% of the people in there were just drinking - why is my food taking so long?! Strike two.

Here&#39;s the kicker - and being an employee of a bar myself, I was more pissed off about this than other people probably would be, but it&#39;s the principle of the situation. So the skeezy, who I&#39;m going to assume is the manager is walking around, flirting with all of the girls working. He obviously knows a couple of the people sitting at the bar near my roommate and me and is chatting them up like any manager should do. All of a sudden our bartender (now keep in mind this isn&#39;t her fault...) is putting plastic shot glasses in front of everyone...but us. Some places use poker chips, some napkins, but it&#39;s the bartenders way of showing that your next drink has been bought for you. The manager bought EVERYONE in the bar their next drink BUT my roommate and myself. Can you say rude?! I mean, I understand that he doesn&#39;t know us and we&#39;re not regulars, but do you really think we&#39;ll be stopping in again? Strike three. 

I don&#39;t know what his deal was...and just the way he had been looking at all the girls as they walked by just gave me the creeps. YUCK.

Needless to say, I will not be returning."

Whenever there&#39;s a deal like this, I&#39;m always skeptical &amp; lower my expectations so the disappointment factor is minimal.  I took a look at the menu &amp; $1 covers a hamburger with chips, if you want a cheeseburger, add $.99, if you want fries instead of chips, you end up paying around $3.99, which still sounds reasonable, until you taste it.  I ordered my burger to be cooked medium, when it arrived, it looked burnt to a crisp which is never a good way to start off.  Thankfully, it didn&#39;t taste the way it looked, it was actually a little juicy inside but still tasted pretty bland.  The fries, man, could quite possibly be some of the worst I&#39;ve ever had.  They were worse than generic store brand fries that you have to throw in the oven on a cookie sheet, soggy, tasteless &amp; got cold within seconds.  One of my buddies ordered some chicken fingers that he enjoyed, but those came with the same crappy fries, so now I know to substitute seasoned fries for regular fries for any meal.  Our waitress was a character, had the fakest sounding tone &amp; comments, which was a little off-putting at first, but towards the end of the meal it became comical.  The environment was fine, good place to watch a game, just avoid the fries!"

Higgins Rd, Hoffman Estates, Il. Upon entering the Pub I found it to be very loud. The establishment was very busy for a week day night. As we entered the nice attractive female hostest greeted us. We sat at the bar which is located in the center of the building. The establishment has bar seating and table seating. The bar has a wide selection of beer, wine and spirits. They serve both bottles and tap beers. Then even had PBR, on draft for $2.25 a 1/2 pint. They also serve something called the beer tower, which is a plastic tower containing your choice of draft beer. This way when you sit at a table you can refill your own glass. The food is good and word on the street is they serve a great burger. We had a Flamming Greek Cheese side dish with pita bread. It was outstanding with a touch of lemon. The Pub, has multiple large screen TVs through out the place. The have at least four different amusement devices, including a dart machine and Golden Tee Golf Machine. Four the kids there is candy and gumball machines located at the front entrance. In addition there is a fresh pop-corn popper machine that patrons can obtain a basket of freshly poped, pop corn at no fee. The Pub is Family friendy during the the earlier hours. I found that the service was friendly and very knowledgable of different types of domestic and imported beers. I learned that Rookies is Family Owned and Operated by a very nice Greek-American Family. They are part of the Alexanders and Village Sqiure Restaurants. They been serving the Fox Valley area since 1974. They have restaurants/Pubs in Dundee, Crystal Lake, McHenry, South Elgin, Elgin and St Charles, Il. I found the establishment very clean. Even the Mens Restroom was very clean for a Pub. As for the prices, Rookies was very reasonable. I learned that they also have daily drink specials. Just a nice place, good service, good food, good prices, and great company. It was a nice experience and &#34; I shall return, &#34;... I give it four stars...... (:"

Olive Garden is not an authentic Italian Restaurant. I&#39;ve been to Italy.  I&#39;ve LIVED in Italy.   I&#39;ve never eaten anything close to what I was served at the Olive Garden when in Italy.  

But Thomas, you say, you were last in Italy in the 16th century.  Things have likely changed. No, they haven&#39;t, mate. Not that much. Granted we no longer think of tomatoes as poisonous, but that is nothing compared to the vast gulf between Italian food in Italy and the food served at the Olive Garden.

Having said that, I FLIPPING LOVE OLIVE GARDEN.  What can I say, I&#39;m a sucker for soft, squishy bread in stick form.  

I came to this particular Olive Garden after a grueling day shopping at the IKEA across the road.  You&#39;ve been there, mate, we all have.  You know that feeling when you&#39;re starving and your feet are killing you and your eyeballs feel like they&#39;ve been roasted on a spit from those horrible shopping center light fixtures?  That&#39;s what I felt like when I slid into a soft green booth, flipped open a menu and ordered pages two and three to be brought to me as soon as possible.  For starters.  While a bit incredulous at first, my server Andre was most helpful, especially after I informed him that I learned to eat with Henry VIII.  (One of my favorite things about this location is that, due to its proximity to Medieval Times down the road, I rarely get stared at in my somewhat unusual attire.)  My meal or rather MEALS were fabulous.  And so plentiful.  No, really, plentiful.  And I&#39;ve sat through three-day banquets at Windsor that would be the death of your average ancient Roman orgy fan.  

If they ever get a roast swan or peacock on the menu I&#39;ll update my review to five stars!"

The problem was our server, she just did not seem interesting in earning her tip.

I ordered the Chicken &amp; Gnocchi soup (my go to), and it came out luke warm.  Attempted to find the server to ask for a new bowl but she didn&#39;t reappear for at least 15 minutes after the food touched the table.  At that point I was over the whole experience.

The first thing I noticed is this location has outdoor seating, which is nice. We decided to eat at the bar. They have changed their menu quite a bit, and not for the better. It seems like they have gotten rid of many options and mostly serve the cheaper pasta dishes. We got the unlimited soup, salad and bread sticks. The salad was lacking some toppings (it was mostly lettuce). Everything else was good. We also didn&#39;t get the Andes mints when we checked out :(

I hadn&#39;t been to Olive Garden since high school, and they were astounded my boyfriend (a Canadian) hadn&#39;t been! I guess you can&#39;t deny the free breadsticks and heaping amounts of carb-heavy foods have some amount of comfort to it. 

No wait at about 1:30pm on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, though it was still pretty bustling and full of customers.

Our server was super energetic and friendly, and made us laugh with his little jests. I liked that at the beginning he asked right off the bat if we were in a rush at all (I can imagine some groups needed to get back to the office), and he was a nice presence through our meal.

Stick to their pastas, stick to their heavy rich dishes. Their non-pasta or lighter entrees are definitely lackluster. Here&#39;s what we got:

APPETIZERS:
* Free breadsticks - 3 stars
Not as amazing as I remember from 10+ years ago! The chunky salt on sprinkled on the bread is great, but the texture isn&#39;t as soft, the crunch not as impressive, even though it was supposedly straight out of the oven.

* Lasagna Fritta - 3.5 stars

One of the better items we got. The lasagna had a really great crunch to it, and there was just enough sauce to go with each piece. 

SOUPS &amp; SALADS
* Chicken &amp; Gnocchi - 2 stars
pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-schaumburg-2?select=JSFG0uODT3quc3m0mpeQJw#MT2WM_pUv3aqdNPy-T_Kiw
Pretty bland, rather watery. The gnocchi was soft and really big, but without a tasty soup to complement it, it didn&#39;t stand on its own

* Caesar - 3 stars

I replaced the regular side salad with this. Pretty good dressing, the lettuce seemed kind of old but retained a good crunch, the croutons were a bit too big, too few, and too stale. 

CUCINA CLASSICA
* Spaghetti with Meatballs - 3 stars
pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-schaumburg-2?select=JSFG0uODT3quc3m0mpeQJw#tA4oF5MQGDOvR0RDexLrfg
It worked to fulfill my craving for a classic. The pasta is a bit too hard, and the sauce could do with more meat. You should mix it all pretty quickly - not all the pasta comes covered with sauce and those pieces tend to get dried out and even harder.

LIGHTER ITALIAN FARE
* Baked Tilapia with Shrimp - 2 stars

I feel like if you&#39;re going to Olive Garden, you gotta just go all out and get their regular super rich entrees. My dad went with this one and it looked really lackluster, especially the broccoli that basically seemed boiled. I tried some of the tilapia and shrimp, neither of which seemed anywhere close to being fresh, and were flavored with a very light, bland gravy.

SEAFOOD

Not bad, another very rich one. The shrimp is more stand-able with a thick creamy sauce. As with the spaghetti, the pasta not covered by the sauce gets dried out pretty quickly.

I tried some of the chicken from my mom&#39;s dish and it seemed pretty dry. Didn&#39;t seem like a super impressive dish."

My server was Eva C. I went into the restaurant around 6pm (alone on a weds) and dined by the bar. Eva was very attentive of giving me my personal space so I can eat my meal in peace as well as politely asked if I was finished with my dishes. I literally only had to wait maybe like 10 minutes for my food to be brought to me and even faster for my dessert. Excellent observation and service ! Great job Eva! :)

It&#39;s always a nice place to eat and really like their house wines.  I&#39;ve been going to this location for a few years and seem overall pretty consistent.  The chief complaint from some of my visits is the servers sometimes bring the food a bit too late as I could tell the food was sitting a bit.  But this last time, our server Andre was awesome, very tentative and prompt.  The timeline he gave us app, soup and main course were very well timed.  Very nice experience overall.

I like places that don&#39;t try and nickel and dime you everywhere and if I like something I&#39;m more than happy to pay for anything. So I like that they give samples of their wines and bring out samples as you wait (if you&#39;re waiting to be seated).  It&#39;s something that gets overlooked a lot but I think it really goes a long way.  I think this is how I first came to try their house wines.  

The only complaint I have is how difficult it could be to get into their lot if your heading East."

The only thing that will stand out would be the quality of service.  

I came here on a Friday night hubby RSVP for 20 family members.  When we got there we ended up having 25 of us.  But they were so nice that they were able to accommodate ALL of us in one area.  Perhaps it&#39;s because we RSVP dinner at 6pm?  But no matter, for a big crowd like that it&#39;s still a lot to accommodate on a Friday night.
They even served wine sample to adult who were waiting  to be seated, so cool!

When we got seated, they were able to fit all of us within two long tables and a table of 4.  We had entertaining wait staffs the amazing Joseph and Spencer. With loud kids and adults, they were on top of their game!  Great job guys and the additional staff helping with the food and the drinks we ordered all night long.

All of our dishes were so good!  I recommend the following that we tried:
-Classic Calamari (lightly breaded, hot n crispy)
-Create a Sampler Italiano (fried raviolis&#39; and mushrooms fresh and not too bready)
-Moscato Castello del Poggio wine was sweet and fruity 
-Minestrone (soup was hot, flavorful, and hearty)
-Tour of Italy (chicken parmesan-crispy on the outside breading and the chicken was juicy not dry, Fettuccine Alfredo pasta had enough sauce to an equal amount of al dente pasta, and lasagna hearty equal amount of meat to cheese ratio)
-Spaghetti and Meatballs, you get three good size meatballs and pasta was a good al dente texture and not clumpy, tomato sauce was also flavorful.
-Pappardelle Pescatore (wide pasta, a bit spicy red sauce with equal amount of seafood to pasta ratio so good I&#39;d get this again)

And don&#39;t forget the unlimited fresh hot garlic buttered bread sticks, fresh cold salad with cold plates.  We had so much food that the majority of us took food home.

Overall, a great experience with such a a friendly staff, accommodating and attentive.  Food was  good too.  I would come back here again."

The food was what you would expect; it&#39;s chain so therefore, it is the same everywhere.

Our service, however, was pretty bad.  The waitress could not answer basic questions about the wine (what&#39;s your house red?) or basic drink questions (do you give free refills for xx drink?).

After taking our drink order, she brought back some pretty rancid sprite for my friend.  It was devoid of any carbonation.  We waited about 10 minuets for her to return before flagging down a passing staff member and asking him to please replace it.  He agreed it didn&#39;t look right and brought a new one right away.  Oh, to have him as our server!

After the waitress took the dinner orders, we waited another 15 minutes for soup and salad.  Then, we waited again for our entrees.  Then, we waited again for silverware and water refills.  Food at other tables seemed to be coming out kind of fast so, again, I think it was our server. 

Yet again, after our meal, we waited for our boxes, our check, to order dessert, etc.  We tried to get her attention but all we got in return was &#34;I&#39;ll back back eventually.&#34;  Okeeeeey.

At this point, we were in danger of missing the start of our movie (we&#39;ve been there for 2 hours at this point) so we ask to see a manager.

The manager was very nice; he comped our dessert and a dollar off each of our bills.  But, in the end, there was little that could be offered to us other than &#34;she&#39;s kind of new.&#34;  Okay, fine.  I&#39;ll cut a break but this was ridiculous.  I hate under tipping but I def. tipped only 15% instead of my customary 20% or more.  I generally give wait staff a lot of slack but ignoring an entire table for most of the evening is unacceptable."

She is foreign,  judgemental, guilt trips me and is an amazing cook.  She wont try anything new at all. She refuses to try papaya, smoked salmon, and even soda. Dont get me started on sushi and thai food. She only eats Albanian food and some (I repeat some) Italian dishes. So when I asked her where do you want to go for your birthday,  she responded Olive Garden. Oh dear lord here we go. Convincing her otherwise was pointless so I called ahead of time and made reservations at 7. We got there 5 minutes before 7 and the hostess said that we are a priority on the list so it shouldn&#39;t take more then 25 mins. I turned around to my foreign family and lied to them telling them that it should only take a couple of minutes. Well it took 25 minutes. Oh joy! 

We sat down and our server was Dimi. She was very attentive, sweet, patient as I had to translate every drink, apetizer and food order to her. We had the chicken fettucini alfredo, mozzarella fonduta, lasagna fritta, portobella ravioli, rosemary chicken and calamari. For drinks we had a peroni, classic margarita and this raspberry spritzer. I didnt care for the calamari and the mozzarella fonduta but everything else was good. It wasnt spectacular but it was good. The drinks were great. Loved my margarita.

It was the go-to spot for birthday and celebratory meals. A few years ago, I decided to break tradition and suggest somewhere else for these meals. My eyes were opened as I realized there was more than overpriced chain restaurants. But my husband&#39;s family? Well they love Olive Garden, and they still go there for celebratory events. That said, I&#39;ve found myself here a few times -- even two nights in a row last month!

This location isn&#39;t that bad, actually. We&#39;ve always found parking and there&#39;s never been a huge crowd in the lobby so our wait is usually less than a half hour. The manager is nice, the staff is friendly, the building has a decent layout, and the service is just normal. We&#39;ve never had any complaints other than the fact that they apparently don&#39;t take reservations anymore. Yet, Olive Garden in general is just done. I&#39;m over it.

I had the shrimp lasagna a new item. No complaints from me. Salad was good as always, as well as the bread sticks yummy. My only complaint about this location is the noise. For some reason it just carries in there like no one&#39;s business. I had trouble hearing the waiter.

I have updated my review more times than should be allowed, but this is my last and final. After a horrendous experience tonight, my family and I agreed we are done with Olive Garden.

Some of the highlights:
1. More than 20 minutes elapsed between being seated and getting drinks, another 20 minutes after that before getting our breadsticks, more than five minutes to get the salad... it was over an hour before we saw any of our actual dishes. This was a regular week night, mind you.
2. Waitress was beyond disorganized and reeked of her perfume. Had it smelled good, it wouldn&#39;t have been as much of a problem, however, she smelled of a bathroom when you frantically spray airfreshener after going #2. Yeah. Dirty rest stop bathroom... that&#39;s what you want to smell when you&#39;re trying to enjoy dinner (a dinner that took forever to happen).
3. Lasagna Primavera entree was a complete joke. I am a small woman, and people make fun of my portions sometimes. This was a bit small even for me. The picture doesn&#39;t quite do it justice, but as it was lasagna, I expected lasagna - several layers of pasta with filling. What I got was essentially a pasta sandwich - two pathetic layers with a little filling and several small shreds of chicken. The rest of my family thought they made a mistake and gave me a half-size.
4. Wine - I ordered the smallest glass, and a massive carafe landed on the table. Huh? Oh, she brought out the largest one. Interesting. It was corrected at that moment before she poured it into the glass, but of course the bill was not adjusted. It had to get manager approval to be changed.
5. Even the salad and breadsticks, something you could always count on to be consistent, were not good. Salad lacked the refreshing kick it had in the past, and the breadsticks were a bit hard and rubbery (we went through three baskets - she kept replacing them after we ate one stick, haha - so it wasn&#39;t a fluke).

I could go on, but you get the point.

Total headache, dismal experience, subpar food... Why on Earth would anyone go back after that? We won&#39;t."

We met our dad today for lunch. The atmosphere is  very upscale-feeling and clean; however, when you sit down and have paper napkins and a Ziosk on your table, it kind of takes away from that feeling. I think doing away with the Ziosk and adding cloth napkins would make it much more classy. Our waiter was okay. He brought our food out timely but was not very personable. He was very business-focused and frequently rushed to the table and interrupted our conversations. He was not rude, just seemed like he was in a rush the entire time and very busy. Our food was great and reasonably priced! If I would change anything about my experience it&#39;d be the napkins and Ziosk and that our waiter just be more personable.

We assumed this would be impossible to accomplish, but thought it couldn&#39;t hurt to ask our server as soon as he came to the table if he thought it was do-able. We told him our situation, he looked a little doubtful...bit his lip, thought about it for a second, and said, &#34;ya know what...I can make it happen.&#34; 

That superman&#39;s name was Joncarlo!! Everything went so smoothly: he was on top of everything from moment one...the orders were right, our cups were never empty, we were full, he took my credit card as soon as he knew we were satisfied with our food, and without even asking, he arrived at our table with to-go boxes/bags for our left overs! We were out on time--exactly 35 minutes. We never felt rushed...in fact, we felt downright spoiled.

I enjoy coming to Olive Garden but I do not appreciate rude service.  The 4 course meal menu just started and I ordered from that menu and I told our waitress that as well.  When my food came out, I  was brought the wrong entree.  When I told our waitress about it, she argued with me saying that what she brought out is what I ordered.  I didn&#39;t want to argue anymore so I said fine, I&#39;ll keep it but when i looked at the menu, I knew it wasn&#39;t what I ordered and it was not even on the menu to begin with.

We called the waitress back telling her that it was not right and that it wasn&#39;t in the 4 course menu.  She told me that I ordered it in my mind and not with her.  I was livid at that point and wanted my dessert and check so I can leave.  She eventually brought out the right entree but I longer had an appetite.

After that, she came and got our order for the dessert.  We were holding the 4 course menu meal and showed her what we wanted....again, wrong things were brought out.  She again argued with us.  After we got fed up with arguing, another waitress came and fixed our bill because of miscommunication.  We did talk to the manager right before jabbing and appreciate him for taking in what we had to say and wanting to accommodate us, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be back to this location....if I do, I will request not to have the same waitress...."

The donation was very generous and helped benefit Wounded Warrior Project. Our office was over joyed with the news that Olive Garden was willing to make such a generous donation. Thank you so much to Vanna!!!! She was the manager that arranged everything. If you are looking for great customer service or catering I would highly recommend giving this location a call and requesting to speak to her!!!!!!!!"

But after two different times I have discovered stuff in my favorite soup bowl  that totally changed my opinion. I took my coworkers for a nice lunch and as usual we sit down by the bar and I ordered soup, salad, and breadsticks that I really enjoy. Until I chewed on a piece of plastic that was left in my soup. After the conversation with the manager I was told it was the corner of the bag that it&#39;s used to store the soup. Ok stuff happens I didn&#39;t make big deal about it and was offered a free dessert which I declined since I don&#39;t really eat sweets. After a couple other visits for lunch I took my family to dinner and ordered again soup, salad, and breadsticks and on my second bowl of soup I started to choke on something that was again plastic. The manager again explained that this time it was the lid for some plastic containers that are stored right above the soup area.  This time I lost my appetite and decided it&#39;s time to go without finishing our meals but I did pay for them. I can&#39;t imagine if it was one of my kids that started choking on plastic bags or lids that are leftover in the soup bowl. That&#39;s the reason for 1 star Olive Garden. I think it&#39;s time to change some processes in the kitchen. 

Disappointed customer

Later that night when I got home I was throwing up non-stop for at least 5 hours I thought that I was going to end up in the emergency room. The next day we called to let them know about this incident and they could not offer any sort of compensation for a bill that was over 100.00 dollars. I would not recommend ever going there again."

It kills me that people would patronize such a sub-par &#34;Italian&#34; restaurant when we live in Chicagoland--the land of many small family owned authentic Italian restaurants.

Prices are outrageous for quality and quantity.

The calzones are frozen!! WTF!

Everything we tasted was drowned in sodium--a clear indication of compensating for inferior flavors.

The only good thing I have to say about this location is that the service has always been quick and polite. Even when they screwed up our order.

Skip the Darden corporatization and patronize a REAL Italian restaurant and you&#39;ll never return to an Olive Garden ever again."

I remember the days like 15 years ago, when the OG was actually a semi &#34;nice&#34; place to go to! You would go there after dances for dinner, a nice date...now I see people in sweatpants and hats in a restaurant looking a hot mess. 

We always come to this location. We had a gift card and a coupon, so a cheap dinner for us.  I ALWAYS order the same thing whenever I come here..yes Im one of those people.  Im not sure what was up with this last time we went, but both my hubby and I were sick the next day.  Mind you, we have never had an issue with their food, but unfortunately it put a damper on us going back to the OG for a long while.  The breadsticks were the bomb diggity though, I must say.

The service was medicore as usual...our waitress dropped our candy on the floor and still gave it to us...I know its wrapped but at least pretend like your going to go get us new candy and still give us the same one you dropped, we wouldnt know any better! Dont put the dirty candy back on our table lol!

I do love coming for lunch here I must say.  Soup, Salad and Breadsticks..for that I would have to give 3-4 stars!"

And, no, this has nothing to do with the food. This exceptionally large Olive Garden was the spot selected for a large group funeral luncheon. The place was jammed. Based upon that, I anticipated something utterly exceptional. Okay, fine.

When we arrived, our area was not totally set up, and though the bar area is fairly large, it was all ready filled, so we set up shop in and out of the restaurant. There are roughly 4 main setting sections in this O.G.

We were offered choices of wine, tea, coffee, or soda and then it was on to the pre lunch course. As is standard fare at most Olive Gardens, it is unlimited soup and salad for all. Though I have enjoyed their Minestrone in the past, I was in salad mode, and found it fairly limp and lacking in green greens; it also needed to be drained: which went along with the day.

As to the main meal, we were again given a series of options: sketties with meat sauce and angel hair pasta; chicken Marsala, or boneless ribs with ravioli. I chose the chicken which was to come with roasted reds and assorted grilled veggies. The woman next to me ordered sketties, but wanted marinara, and was told, &#39;no, we no do marinara, today&#39;. She ordered it anyway. The man next to me ordered the ribs.

We waited awhile, and bided our time with OG&#39;s garlic bread sticks, but it was tough to converse: it was not only jammed, it was noisy. The 2 servers assigned to us were both very good, and good natured as well. I am apt to up the review just because of them, but I think this is fair all the same.

And then: lunch was served. The sketties next to me did not look like what I&#39;ve grown up on, but the serving was really generous; my chicken was tasty, but the spuds were dry; I did, however, love the grilled veggies. But on my right; the guy with the ribs and ravioli was groaning in ecstasy and made short work of his food. Not only did the ravioli look interesting, but the ribs were like butt-ah.

There were also 3 choices for dessert, which included coffee or tea. Lemon cake, sorbet, or zeppoli with chocolate sauce for dipping. I went with the lemon cake, my 2 sidekicks both got the zeppoli.

Well, my lemon cake was absolutely delicious; subtle, not too sweet, with a little (oh so very Italian) custard in between layers. The zeppoli Italian donuts were huge, came in big bowls of about 8, with a side of hot chocolate. Holy cow; the portions were unreal.

All in all, we did what we came to do after a long day, enjoyed the good and the bad of it, and the Olive Garden came through for us as A-OK."

Food: we ordered the 2 for $25 dinner which comes with 2 entrees and 2 appetizers or 1 dessert which includes unlimited soup or salad..we ordered the eggplant parmigiana and the smoked mozzarella chicken for the 2 entrees and decided to stick with ordering 1 dessert (tiramisu)...

Eggplant parmigiana - very cheesy.....couldn&#39;t really taste the eggplant.. tasted ok..
Smoked mozzarella chicken - cheesy and bland...
House Salad - tasted good.. 
Soup - tasted good..
Tiramisu - delicious.. perfect ending to a meal..

We were stuffed by the end of the meal and had lots of leftover to take home as well..

The waitress asked me if I wanted a refill on my soup and I said yes. She never brought it... The waitress was nice overall. Our main course meal arrived at 7:42pm.

Olive Garden has never been on my bucket list of places to visit before going to the big buffet in the sky.  But after a friend&#39;s aunt passed away, I was really emotional and out of sorts.  What should have been a simple trip to a clothing store became an exercise in how NOT to get lost in Woodfield Mall.  What should have been a pleasant afternoon after a funeral became a yelling match between friends in a car.  So suffice it to say, I just wasn&#39;t thinking clearly.  We saw Olive Garden, decided to let our belts out a notch and enjoy unlimited salad and bread sticks along with some pretty bland food.  They were busy but not swamped.  Our waiter was Mario.

I looked at the menu and ordered something I wanted that sounded good.  Except one big thing: I didn&#39;t read the description.  I completely screwed up my own order--a $20 steak.  So I told our waiter, Mario, just how fogged up my thinking was and what I *thought* I had ordered in my mind.  He said, &#34;No problem, let me get you a chicken Fettuccine Alfredo&#34; and whisked my bad choice away--a steak dinner which just happened to be the most expensive thing on the menu, so I felt really bad.  I crawled under the table to hide in embarrassment.  Three minutes later--that quick, I kid you not--Mario delivered what was probably the best chicken fettuccine Alfredo I&#39;ve had in a very long time.

Another three minutes and a well-dressed lady with an Olive Garden name badge came over.  Uh boy, I thought--they&#39;re going to wonder WTF was going on.  No...instead, the General Manager, Angela Perry, told me Mario discussed why I had ordered the wrong thing and the circumstance.  She and I chatted about my friend&#39;s aunt, some of the other relatives...yeah, I&#39;m a softie for my friend&#39;s family peeps.  She listened and replied, &#34;Guys, this one&#39;s on us.  You&#39;ve been through a lot today.&#34;  My friend and I were humbled beyond belief.

Now anyone who&#39;s worked in a restaurant knows that a General Manager like Angela is the top employee--above the shift managers and above the chef.  GMs usually answer to the franchise owner or regional manager.  Maybe even both.  So she has the power to make things disappear, and the magic to make smiles appear.  The restaurant&#39;s owner will know about her kindness shortly via email.

For Angela and Mario&#39;s great service and attitude, I&#39;d like to thank Olive Garden for cooking up smiles and chasing away the blues."

The Schaumburg restaurant is nicely decorated and roomy.  The greeter saw us approaching  and personally opened the doors for us.  We were seated promptly and our server arrived not too long after that and offered a sample of their featured wine.  It was busy for a Monday night.  And lots of families too, with younger children like ours (ages 4 and 6).  Good variety on the kids menu.  Ours had pizza and pasta (build-your-own).  They also enjoyed the unlimited salad and breadsticks, which were as good as I remember.

I had the crispy parmesan shrimp; he had the seafood brodetto.  They were good...hearty, filling, and prepared well.  I had a glass of wine, but like that they also offer quartino sizes in addition to the full bottle.

Our server was very nice...friendly especially with the kids, attentive, and quick to compliment our dinner selections and offer menu suggestions.  We were seated next to a family of six, and they too, seemed to appreciate our server&#39;s friendliness.  The bussers were also great in clearing the table for us.  I already mentioned that the greeter held the door open for us, she also thanked us on our way out.  And, the manager noticed me looking for the &#39;restroom&#39; sign when my daughter had to go, and pointed us in the right direction.

Nice, quiet, family meal out.  It&#39;s been a while, and I&#39;m glad we came back.  Now that I have kids, I can appreciate how family-oriented the OG is and I&#39;m glad my kids like it too.  &#39;When you&#39;re here, You&#39;re family!&#39; 

But wait...

Go Olive Garden.  That&#39;s their new slogan right?  Whatever the new slogan may be, I love that they gave the old one to Jimmy Fallon!

So, Go Olive Garden!"

The bread sticks were amazing! They were super buttery, nice &amp; warm. I opted just for dessert this night---Triple Chocolate Strata! It was uber chocolate filled with was good for a chocoholic like myself. I was a bit hesitant on getting a cake dessert because I often find them dry at restaurants. This cake was quite moist though! Loved it!

We were in a bit of a rush to get to the new Harry Potter movie and often found ourselves waiting for our waiter to bring the bill, collect our money/credit cards, and then return them to us.

As with most chains, the food is pretty much always consistent from one time to the next. This location in particular is pretty hit or miss on the quality of service, especially at the bar. One time I got an eye roll when I asked to see a drink menu... while sitting at a BAR. They also don&#39;t take reservations, even on the more romantic couple-y holidays like Valentine&#39;s Day. Not that you&#39;d necessarily go there on that day, but I digress. There have been several occasions where we have had people meet us there and were told that there&#39;s over an hour wait and we&#39;ve had to go somewhere else.

Yes, it&#39;s a chain and the food is decent but I have definitely had better. My trip here Saturday night was for a friends birthday and it was her choice, she also had in mind some never ending pasta and since some of us were tight on cash, it seemed like a good idea. The food itself was actually very good. The asiago garlic Alfredo sauce was heaven. The service was what really spoiled the evening. 
We were a party of four and 2 arrived early to try to speak to someone about a birthday dessert and order a pitcher of sangria. I walked in with the birthday girl and went to the table. The waiter brought over a glass of sangria. My friend kept saying pitcher and all he thought was peach. Finally after emphasizing pitcher a few times, he apologized and brought the right thing out. After a few minutes we ordered the spinach dip appetizer and looked over the menu. All of us had the pasta special. 2 of us ordered the corkscrew pasta with asiago Alfredo and chicken, one ordered same, minus chicken, and one ordered regular fettucini Alfredo. We got our salad with no offer of cheese and bread sticks. We were still waiting for the appetizer. We asked and were told the kitchen was backed up. It came out 1 minute before our food and we decided to send it back. There was no point in having it now. Then came the food. Everyone&#39;s order was right but the birthday girls. They gave her Fettuccini noodles instead of corkscrew. She said &#34;its OK, I will wait&#34; and the waiter seemed shocked. Yes, I know the only different was the noodle but she wanted what she ordered and I don&#39;t blame her. We were still not offered any cheese and had to help ourselves to a cheese grater left on the tray behind us. When my friends order came out, it looked like it had been sitting out for a while. At this point, she gave up and just accepted it. Like, I said before, we were all happy with our food, it really wasn&#39;t the issue. The waiter offered to buy is 1 dessert as an apology for the appetizer mishap but after we were done, we had no room. He kept coming by, asking if we still wanted dessert and we all said no but our friend who made plans for a birthday surprise was pretty pissed since the waiter assumed to not bring out the birthday dessert either and his offer for free dessert wasn&#39;t offered as a to go option, something we didn&#39;t even realize until after we left. Even when we brought it up to him that we spoke to him about our little surprise, he didn&#39;t offer, he just said &#34;I misunderstood, you said you didn&#39;t want anything&#34;.
Overall, not a good night for service. It even stings more when it was for a special occasion."

The waiter even gave us soup and breadsticks to take home! Also I highly recommend the apricot chicken breast, it was SO good. My only complaint has to be that there are only 4 bathroom stalls. Being so busy I think they definitely could use a few more, especially because two of them were out of toilet paper (it happens) so a long line formed."

He def got my margarita fast, but that was about the only thing i appreciated from him... it&#39;s one thing when a waiter flirts with you, it&#39;s another  when one keeps coming back to your table every 10 minutes, to make conversation, while I&#39;m clearly trying to not make eye contact with him, and trying to talk to my friend...  He told me if i wanted another drink, that he&#39;d be off soon and we can go &#34;grab one&#34; uhh awkward!!!  There were defiantly moments of annoyance towards him, but i tried to avoid him and turn him down as nicely as possible.
Fettacini Alfredo was ok, i asked for a little extra garlic, since I&#39;m a garlic lover, and boy did i get my garlic fix. Woah!!!  I could of kept a group of vampires far far away! Meatballs are forgetful, couldn&#39;t finish mine that i ordered on the side.
I think it&#39;s average food, love love the salad, and breadsticks, i could just have unlimited salad and breadsticks as my meal! Strawberry margarita was strong, but good.
Since i have a gift card here, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll return sometime this year, but i wouldn&#39;t get the Alfredo again. Some of those chicken dishes look good!

ladies be careful here if you get that strange waiter! Toobad i forget his name!"

Been here twice earlier this year with a larger group and had great service. But today was totally different. Our waitress only came to the table to take our order and to bring us our food. She never refilled asked if we wanted any refills on soup or salad even tho she passed us when returning to the kitchen after helping a nearby table. The waitress also left our dishes at the table and didn&#39;t collect them. Luckily there was an extra seat at the table so we just had to stack our dishes there. In my opinion, this was very poor service today. I love pasta and love the unlimited soup and breadsticks that Olive Garden has to offer, but if I keep getting bad service, I&#39;d rather go down the street to another Italian restaurant."

That being said, I love authentic Italian but occasionally, I just want some really good shrimp or clam linguine, salad, breadsticks and stuffed mushrooms.  

Olive Garden hits the spot and has always had a pretty decent selection of pasta dishes.  What you see is what you get here.  

I would recommend coming here before the dinner rush, which me and my wife did.  We had no problems being seated promptly, had good service.  That&#39;s all you can ask for.  

Wife had the pork chops, which were super juicy, breaded and served with 4 cheese ravioli.  I had the shrimp and chicken linguini and it was really buttery, which was really good.

Not to this location at least. Our waitress was very rude and kept giving us dirty looks the whole night. She asked me if I wanted soup or salad, so asked what kind of soup they had. It only took her five seconds to name the all the soups and because she spoke too fast, I could not understand her and asked her to please repeat them and she just gave me an &#34;are you stupid?&#34; look and just stared at me until one of friends finally ordered my soup for me. Not only was she rude to me, but she was also rude to my other friend. The same waitress gave us two very big bowls of salad, but since my friend ordered the chicken flatbread (which was disgusting) and not a meal, she took her salad plate away and told her that she could not eat any of it. On top of the horrible service, our breadsticks were hard and the complimentary chocolate cake they gave us tasted like it had been in the freezer for several months and had just been thawed out. If you want overpriced food and good service, you&#39;re better off going to The Cheesecake Factory which is located in Woodfield Mall, just two minutes away."

But if you are really hardcore, you come here for the &#34;never ending pasta bowl&#34; special that they run once or twice a year. I happen to be nearly two meters tall and weigh around 135 kilos, so I am definitely in the big-boy club. Also I hang out with a gaggle of doods at work who are also all over 6 feet tall...so when there is a buffet we&#39;re probably going to hit it. 

So picture 6 of us coming in and, of course, having a competition to see who can hold down the most noodles. The first bowl you get is large (container and portion size), and subsequent portions are about 1/3 the size, served in a smaller bowl. I think the record for our team is 4 bowls right now. I&#39;d love to hear from anyone who has eaten more than this, and how many extra lipitor you had to take with your meal. 

Oh also you can add sausage and meatballs to this, so I encourage you to avail yourself of that option as well."

At this location, I have always gotten great service, and I love me some pasta, so this is always a good go-to spot for me!  Their breadsticks are pretty good, and if you don&#39;t finish your soup, they are more than willing to wrap that up to go!

Right now they are having their never-ending pasta bowl, and all of the choices are SO good.  They have two new styles of sauce--they are a must-try.

Oh, and now most of their wines come with a &#34;quartino&#34;size--it&#39;s a glass and a half served in a little carafe.  Their new Moscato is fabulous, but be careful--it&#39;s like drinking juice :)

They have a great to-go option, too!  They have NEVER gotten my order wrong.  And that&#39;s something I can&#39;t say for every restaurant for sure!

The wait was okay - 15 minutes, my friend and I just had a drink at the bar. No biggie. We get seated - bringing our lemonade and peach tea with us and our waitress is effing silly. I mean, I could use a better word but right now (since my pisstivity has worn off) she was just silly. 

First of all, our drink glasses were quite empty but she brought us nasty gawd-awful wine to try. We tell her no thanks. She leaves - minus the empty glasses...minus a refill request. Okay, whatever, she forgot, long day.

THEN, she comes back and asks if we are ready - we are not, she leaves again. Minus the empty glasses...minus a drink request. Um, okay, whatever, she had to pee, long day.

THEN, she comes back, we order an appetizer, I finally say &#34;Can we get a refill on our lemonade and peach tea.&#34; OF COURSE!!!! She says!! Duh, why didnt SHE think of that.

She brings our drinks, takes our order, leaves. Minus the empty glasses. Grrrr.

She comes back with our soup and breadsticks...no salad. Excuse me, but when was food ever ready before a salad? Whatever, maybe they were out when she was heading back to our table. She puts the food down, NOT EVEN LOOKING AT US and almost spills soup on my friend. And everything that is being put down is SLAMMED down. Grrrr and a half.

My friend and I are severely annoyed and I guess you can imagine my face by now. See, I have a thing about my face...I can NOT hide my emotions even when I know I should...its just sorta...automatic, if you will. Anyway, she sets down the food...leaves. I know you&#39;re thinking she&#39;s getting a helluva lot of unnecessary cardio right? Right.

Comes back with the salad. Here&#39;s the kicker, ready?: She moves the 2 empty glasses down by the edge of the table by my arm to make room for the salad bowl. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Really, it wasnt funny. She&#39;s on her way off into the sunset again when I say, &#34;Miss, take these 2 empty glasses please.&#34; OF COURSE!!! She says!! Duh, why didnt SHE think of that? Rotten sonofa...

Cheese? Yes we&#39;d like the same cheese that you offered your other patrons 6 times. Patron, you say? Yes this is what I need at this point in my annoying meal. She grinds cheese on the salad, and the table, and the floor, because once again Molly McDontGiveAShit is not looking at what she&#39;s doing. 

Was it my face?

Anyway, we get our appetizer, eat, chat, glare, chat, laugh, chat, glare, pay the bill, and leave.

Sorry, guys but you get THREE stars off for my recockulous post-shopping dining experience today. Maybe if I decide to go back and it&#39;s better I&#39;ll do an update. Maybe if I see her again, I&#39;ll inviter her to the parking lot...

No, but seriously...was it my face?"

The place was very busy and at times the waiters seemed to be a little overwhelmed.  Even though we made a previous reservation, we waited about 20 minutes for our table. Also, the service was a bit slow. On to the food; We all know the salad and bread sticks are delicious. As I was looking over the menu,  I asked the waiter about the Spicy Shrimp Vesuvio. I needed clarity on the arrabbiata sauce. He told me it was known as the &#34;angry&#34; sauce and was very spicy and white. If you have ever ordered this dish, you can imagine how surprised I was when I received my plate and it was a red, tomato based sauce. Fortunately, the dish was delicious, but it would be nice to have the waiters knowledgeable of the menu. Overall I had a good experience and this Olive Garden very similar to the others."

I don&#39;t eat at the Olive Garden often, but when I do, I look forward to those warm, soft, garlicky breadsticks.  For my meal, I ordered the Vino Bianco Pork Scaloppine off the special menu, and it was actually very good: pork pounded flat, lightly floured and sauteed, served with cheese-stuffed tortelloni in a white wine cream sauce with green onions and mushrooms.  Mmm.  I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s authentic or not, it was good (if a bit heavy).  My boyfriend and his parents seemed to enjoy their entrees, although I have to take points off because they requested their steak medium and it came out closer to well done.  Otherwise, the service was great and the restaurant is clean and looks nice (it was renovated a few years ago).

We didn&#39;t have to wait at all since it wasn&#39;t crowded. Our server was relatively new so when we asked questions, he&#39;d go check with someone and get back to us. 

I absolutely love the frozen tiramisu drink. It&#39;s been my usual for years since it conveniently combines tiramisu and a cocktail and is pretty and delicious! It isn&#39;t on the menu but they&#39;ll make it if you ask. 

I ordered a side of Alfredo dipping sauce and had to remind the server about that order. He only brought more breadsticks and water if we asked at least one (but we had to ask multiple times sometimes). My friend asked for her salad without dressing so they brought us each our own big bowl, and since neither of us finished it, our server brought out boxes and packed a box for each of us. It was nice he boxed our food for us instead of just throwing the boxes at us. 

At the end of our meal, we asked for separate checks and he accommodated our request correctly and without any complaints. 

The bathroom was reasonably clean, but I would have liked for them to have toilet seat covers. 

It was what I expected. I like olive garden (breadsticks + alfredo dipping sauce = happiness). Nothing special but I&#39;d come back here again."

Normally would have to go to China Town to enjoy the good Dim Sum, but being that I didn&#39;t feel like driving out there from the suburbs, this was a great substitute. 

They had a  pretty good selection of food that you could choose from for the Dim Sum hours. From the normal congee and shumai to the crispy crab claw and the crispy pork belly. The portion sizes were also really good (although, I wished we could&#39;ve gotten more than just 2 crab claws). We had ordered about 6 plates of food for 2 people and we were both super full. 

The only confusing part of this restaurant was that it was a fusion of Chinese and Japanese food as you could also order sushi. We went for just the  Dim Sum, but saw that the other patrons of the restaurant were ordering sushi. They said ti was good, but will not actually be able to fully comment of the taste until I can go back to try it later. 

It is a great place to go and enjoy either a cup of tea with a friend during the day or on the weekends with a group of friends for some good quality Dim Sum. The food also arrives to the table very quickly so there is no waiting around with a growling stomach for a long time.

The Shrimp dumplings are small but very tasty.  

Tried the Fried Taro and didn&#39;t like it but Fried Taro is a real popular authentic Chinese food and maybe I am just use to American Chinese.

The Xiao Long Bao was very good.  

Only gave Bistro Chen 3 stars because the food was over priced for the size.

bistro-chen-arlington-heights,Cecily P.,-MQNcf4688sfersNdVuJgQ,"San Antonio, TX",1,1,1,137,39,mPozqcsIiAJ4vv05zyqF0Q,5.0,2016-08-20,"My parents are almost weekly regulars at Bistro Chen for the dim sum menu and now I finally got a chance to see why. Walking in, I was already impressed with the simple but chic atmosphere and how popular they were already upon opening on a Sunday morning. Service was excellent from the get-go from those who already know my parents by name to our server who was new to the place (wish I&#39;d gotten his name!). The dim sum menu alone is enough to make your head spin so we mostly stuck to that as well as the happy hour drink pricing they already had going on. Can&#39;t beat that! We decided to go in rounds to gauge our hunger levels and they were very accommodating and patient while we debated. We started off with some small bowls of hot and sour soup, which I have to say was light years ahead of your normal Chinese takeout soup. It was thick and tart with just the perfect undercurrent of spice that left only the slightest burn on your lips, yet took the flavor profile to an unexpectedly complex place. 

We then started to receive our first round of dim sum: pork/shrimp siu mai, shrimp dumplings, and shrimp stuffed eggplant. I know what you&#39;re thinking - so much shrimp, but why? I was a little skeptical too but my parents assured me that it was not a mistake, and surely it wasn&#39;t. Every dish had shrimp as the star, yet the flavor and preparation was so different in each that I felt no redundancy in flavors or enjoyment whatsoever. The siu mai are meaty and tender; the dumplings are delicate while showcasing the sweetest shrimp I&#39;ve ever tasted; the eggplant was hearty and covered in a sweet, sticky sauce that married the flavors perfectly. We then moved on to a slightly heavier course with the crispy crab balls and the pork belly. The pork belly, while one of the pricier items on the menu, is actually a very sizable portion and therefore I think totally worth it, especially considering how rich it is. The skin was the crispiest I&#39;ve ever had on a pork belly which contrasted with the succulent, fatty belly perfectly. For me it paired very well with a little plum sauce; my parents, never having ordered it, were so enamored that they ate it plain. The crispy crab balls were equally amazing - while the breading looked heavy at first, it was actually very thin and gave way to a rich layer of ground shrimp encompassing a very meaty portion of crab. This dish is a crowd-pleaser for sure and it&#39;s worth ordering one portion just for yourself. We finished up with another round of the shrimp dumplings, since I wanted to end on something a little lighter and the quality and flavor had blown me away. 

When all was said and done we were seven alcoholic drinks deep with multiple rounds of food and still only ended up with a bill totaling about $80. How they&#39;re able to serve such exceptional quality food, especially seafood, while charging such low prices amazes me, but I can see why this place is packed on weekends and why my parents never get sick of it. I will absolutely be returning when I can next time I&#39;m in the Chicago suburbs."

This place is great! Love that we can get tasty, authentic dim sum in the NW suburbs, saving us the drive to Chinatown. 

They use a checklist-type menu so it was really easy to get our orders in, as well as add on if we wanted to. There was a great variety! Not only was there dim sum, but there were entrees as well as nigiri, Maki, and sashimi sushi! I was 100% in the mood for dim sum, so I passed on the sushi, but I saw them bring rolls out to the table over and they looked amazing. The amount of pieces you get per roll were very generous, plus the presentation looked great. 

We ordered Shu Mai, Shrimp Dumplings, Shrimp Rice Crepes, and Beef Chow Fun. They usually bring it out whenever each dish is ready but we requested if they can bring it all at once and it wasn&#39;t a problem. It came with rice, as well as a side of hoisin and chili oil for dipping sauces. 

Everything we ordered was great! Good portions, even better pricing. Our bill for 3 of us ended up being around $30, and paying in cash gets you 6% off. 

I highly recommend!!"

The reviews are correct. My parents and I were very surprised on how great everything tasted. It&#39;s very beneficial for us, so we don&#39;t have to drive to Chicago to get good quality dim sum. 

The place wasn&#39;t too busy around 1pm on Sunday. There was many seats still available and there didn&#39;t seem crowded at all. I don&#39;t know how many people were seating outside though. The place is very clean and the staff is friendly.

We ordered spare ribs, 2 pork &amp; shrimp shu mai, 2 shrimp dumplings, beef chow fun noodles, shrimp rice crepe (shrimp funroll), and roasted pork belly. Everything was very delicious and we had no problem with any of food. Their Jasmine tea is also delicious. Next time, we will inform the server that we would like all the food to come at once. 

Everything came out to be around $46 which isn&#39;t bad at all. Also, if you pay in cash you get a 6% discount.

Bubble tea smoothies are hit or miss. First time, it was powder but the second time, they used real strawberries. 

It is wheelchair accessible, including the restroom. But some booths are tricky. There is outdoor seating we haven&#39;t tried. 

Friendly staff."

We were suspicious and curious about this place for a while. Because the I-90 to Chinatown is always busy in the weekends, we decided to give this place a try. It has proven to be the best idea! It took us twenty minutes to get here and fifty minutes to finish our dinner. We were too hungry! 

Here are what we ordered. 
Scallop shrimp dumplings: average, fresh
Beef Siu Mai: fresh and good
Beef meat ball: tasty and fresh, you can tell its freshly steamed 
Sichuan string beans: deep fried with good flavor, not too spicy
Pan fried turnip cake: very good 
Veggie tofu skin rolls: fried, different from other places, nice mix of veggies, not too greasy
Roast duck: very good! Crispy and good roast flavor, tasted like the one I had in Hong Kong 
Egg w/ pork congee: enough to feed two people and taste pretty good 
Tuna sashimi and yellowtail sashimi: very fresh and thick slices. Each order is 4 pcs

We are very pleased with the quality, service and variety of food. Will certainly come back in the near future!"

The food here is flavorful.  They have a wide range selection of Asian cuisines, including Sushi!  

This place is comparable to some of the restaurants in Chinatown.  So if you&#39;re not keen on driving in to the city &amp; road raging through the I-90 traffic, the variety of tasty dishes here will satisfy your Asian food cravings."

I was a bit hesitant because after a quick look at Bistro Chen&#39;s menu, I noticed it has a bit of everything from pad thai to sushi to dim sum and I think I saw pho in there as well.  But I read the review and took my fellow Yelper&#39;s advice and paid them a visit.

I ordered beef shumai, pork ribs, shrimp and chives dumplings, egg tarts and a big bowl of Taiwanese beef noodle soup.  A bit of an expensive lunch ($28) but the dim sum that I ordered were pretty awesome!  The noodles for my beef soup were too soft for my liking, almost like spaghetti and the broth was thicker than what I&#39;m used to and a tad sweet.  It tasted like there were a lot of tomatoes in it.  What I did like were the carrots (that&#39;s how my dad use to make it!) and the preserved vegetables that were added on top.

The service started out great but then the man who served my dim sum one by one as it became ready kept confusing me with the next table.  I ordered a total of four dim sum items and he seriously messed up on all four, giving my stuff to the next table and giving their stuff to me each time.  I thought he was doing it on purpose for a second.  But the main issue I had was I felt like I was being ignored after I received my food from the confused server.  I had to flag down the staff 3 times for different things, including asking for the check after waiting 10 mins.  I&#39;m still impressed with this little gem and will definitely return!"

My favorites are the pork bun, shumai, shrimp dumplings, and chow mein. The prices seem reasonable at around $4-7 a plate.

I was sad that they were out of the pork belly when we visited and that the shrimp rice noodle roll is only served on weekends. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice and has traditional Chinese elements. It&#39;s also dark inside.

I have tried their regular Chinese food before and remembering it being just ok. The noodle soup did not have the best flavor, especially if you are used to the Korean kind. They are not really the same. It did include a lot of sea food though.

Also, one time I had their bubble tea and it tasted very artificial.  Another time I had their strawberry bubble tea and it tasted very fresh like it was made of fruit. Maybe it is a toss up and depends on what is in season.

Our waitress and everyone we met was very friendly.

There is a sign on their window that they have happy hour specials on their rolls. (I think before 6pm on weekdays.) Don&#39;t forget to grab a fortune cookie on the way out!"

Was a reluctant patron but pleasantly surprised by their dim sum. Turnip cakes and fried dumpling w pork were fantastic. Pork crepe was disappointing. Shiu mai and sticky rice (lotus wrapped) were solid. They were out of the pea sprouts but the baby bok choy were a delicious substitue. And the pork belly is a must-have. Will say that will prob return when do not feel like driving to Chinatown."

We were seated as soon as we arrived (what a difference a 5 minute walk out of the immediate downtown center makes!), the decor inside is quite lovely and the bathrooms were immaculately clean.  We were off to a good start!

Since we were going to the theater afterwards and it&#39;s warm weather outside we decided to share 3 smaller plates so as to not have any leftovers.  They have a large selection of appetizers &amp; smaller plates to choose from making it easy for 2 people to share &amp; try a variety - much more than other Asian restaurants we&#39;ve visited.  They also have some of what I would consider more &#34;authentic&#34; Asian items (I&#39;m not Asian so don&#39;t quote me on this...) that we don&#39;t normally see on other standard Americanized Chinese restaurant menus - in addition to the more standard fare of pot stickers and sweet &amp; sour whatever.  The price points were quite reasonable as well.  We shared a sushi roll, calamari and the chicken &amp; rice wrapped in lotus leaf.  The chicken &amp; rice wrapped in lotus leaf was quite bland tasting with no other apparent seasoning so we perked it up with a splash of soy sauce.  The other items were quite good.

Our server asked if we cared what order the items came out in, which was nice, and we said we didn&#39;t care. The food came out fairly quickly (the steamed lotus wrap dish does take longer) but the service in general, while it was very nice, was a bit on the slow side waiting for our plates to be cleared and then again for the check.  We were charged for 2 glasses of wine when I had only 1 so that took some time to be corrected as well.  We heard another table pointing out an incorrect charge for a food item on their bill as well with the same server so I&#39;m not sure what happened there.  We are definitely looking forward to going back and trying other items on their menu."

I hate when broccoli is not super hot because the sauce cools it down.  The turnip cake needs a crispier outside so they need to fry it much longer.  The egg tart&#39;s crust were hot but the egg filling was cold (gross).  That doesn&#39;t go well...the center needs to be hot.

Otherwise all the other things we had were good.  The snow peas that they have on weekends only are awesome.  I actually like it better than broccoli I found out after trying the snow peas for the first time.  The snow peas look more like collard greens sorta.  I posted pics, you can see the peas next to the broccoli."

Good dim sum is hard to come by in the burbs and this place pleasantly surprised me. Food was all fresh and the wait staff was very attentive.

Decor:  The place is modern/trendy Asian.  Only a few years old (according to the super nice waitress), it&#39;s a great place for business, dinner dates, etc.  Booths, tables, and a sushi bar... take your pick of what you&#39;re most in comfortable in!

Service:  Friendly from the start to finish.  The Chinese waitress also spent some extra time talking with my grandfather (in Cantonese, as well as Mandarin) and took great care of us.  Overall great service, but she was really exceptional.

Food:  You know, I came in planning just to get dimsum dishes.  And then I wanted to get a noodle dish for my grandfather (he&#39;s a sucker for noodles), and of course the porridge for my wife.  And then she recommended a few house specialties... so yes, I totally overordered...  But here&#39;s what I learned:

Rice porridge with pork and egg (congee) - Not very flavorful unfortunately... I&#39;m guessing that they have a big pot of porridge warm, and then throw in whatever ingredients you ask for with the congee (chicken vs pork and egg vs. etc.)  which is why overall, it&#39;s not very flavorful.  I&#39;d suggesting avoiding.

Egg drop soup -  Simple, warm, perfect for a 50 degree or below day.  And very tasty.  And it came with our lunch meal!

Turnip cake - Crispy edges, soft mushy interior.  Just right.  Exterior could use some more crisping probably, but the edges were just right.

Chinese Meatballs - These guys were so tender and light... and the flavor was just right, and steamed right in the bamboo container.  Delicious and worth getting.

String beans with pork - This was the hidden gem/sleeper of the place.  I have no idea how they made it, but this was really amazing.  I get this as a side dish everywhere we go just to have some veggies in our meal, but honestly, I&#39;d go out of my way just to get it here.  We even brought it home to my parents (too much leftovers), and they even mentioned how good it was.  When a Chinese mom that cooks all the time says it good, it&#39;s damn good.

Seafood Noodle Soup - The noodles were good, the seafood was plentiful.  It just didn&#39;t quite come together perfectly.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s a good bowl of noodles, it&#39;s just not quite perfect.

Crispy skin chicken - The waitress introduced this as one of their specialties.  It was quite tasty and definitely worth checking out!  Skin was crispy (per the name sake) the chicken was cooked just to the right texture to have some chew.

Eggplant and fish pot - Another one the waitress introduced as a specialty, this was out of this world good.  Lightly coated fish, eggplant, and all put into a pot simmering with a sauce... I could eat this all day.  Seriously, get this dish.  It&#39;s so good....

Pork belly - Skin was crispy, meat was tender and chewy... but I&#39;ve eaten and made a lot of pork belly in my amateur chef career, and I think I&#39;ve made better...

Verdict:  Amazing spot, wonderful customer service, more hits than misses with the food... get the string beans with pork, and eggplant/fish pot, and I&#39;ll nearly guarantee you&#39;ll leave with a happy stomach.  I definitely plan to return to try some of their other dishes!  

Note:  They serve sushi here as well... which I&#34;m always hesitant to try when sushi isn&#39;t the sole focus of a place... but perhaps we&#39;ll give it a whirl?"

First off this place gets super extra credit for not being in downtown Chicago or Chinatown.  The fact that people don&#39;t have to endure horrific traffic and nasty parking situations and lose an entire day just in logistics to eat dim sum is a Chicagoan dream come true in itself!!   

This place is AUTHENTIC.  And by authentic, keep in mind that I also mean it is like it is in China itself as well as Chinatown - which means sometimes they&#39;re out of what you want to order and some things won&#39;t look like the picture.    But that is the only downside, which is to be expected, to be honest if you&#39;re going for Dim Sum.  

In fact, the people I was with actually did not like one of their choices and the wait staff actually graciously took it back and took it off the bill! They were actually nice about it!  Not only that, the three of us ate to our fill including drinks for less than $35!   And it was Really tasty dim sum with both traditional and creative items."

Had a chance to go today and it was okay, not outstanding.

Service was very good, they kept my soda full, food came quickly and was hot, and they were very pleasant.

The food was just nothing to write home about.  Pork buns started great, the bun itself was not too heavy but very little filling.  The fried pork dumplings also at first seemed great, hot but not greasy, but the more I ate, the more I had breading and the sweet gooey interior until I got to the pork, which was not nearly enough.

The shrimp rice crepes were very good as were the spring rolls, nothing at all to complain about but not better than you would get at any restaurant in SF or London (but they would not be embarrassed there, either).

The tofu stuffed with pork and shrimp was okay but nothing special, the sauce lacked flavor.

I also had one other type of dumpling and forgot the name but again it was okay but not special.

I had Mongolian beef - pretty bland, fried rice - literally just rice and oil the highlight was the tasty egg roll and veggie shrimp tempura!  Yum

My husband had orange chicken that he really enjoyed, spicy tuna roll, crab ragoon, and fried rice - he was very satisfied.

Saw lots of general tso entrees being delivered - large family style portions

We used to eat at Chin&#39;s every year for Christmas Eve so when Chin&#39;s closed and Bistro Chen opened in it&#39;s place, we figured we&#39;d try it out, for tradition&#39;s sake. 

The new owners of this restaurant completed changed the interior. Gone are the long booths and the dark, almost intimate dining area. Now it&#39;s an open area with brighter lights and lighter wood tables. It almost seems much smaller.

The menu has changed in that there is dim sum and sushi on it. The entree menu is much smaller and streamlined. Which makes sense for the kitchen but it made it difficult to find something I wanted to eat. I&#39;m used to the long sprawling menus of Chinatown restaurants so this almost felt like a joke. I almost ventured onto the sushi menu but then I saw they had sushi with mozarella cheese - uhm what? 

After much deciding, my family of four decided on two orders of egg rolls, an order of crab rangoons, Kung Poa Chicken, and the Volcano Chicken. The egg rolls were quite nice and the crab rangoons had more crab than cream cheese. That&#39;s where my enjoyment ended. The two entrees were more than enough for four to share but the Kung Pao chicken lacked the punch you usually expect. The volcano chicken, labeled spicy, was just lacking. There wasn&#39;t enough chicken in either entree which was pretty disappointing. 

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t make the trek to go back. But since it&#39;s one of the only Chinese restaurants in the area, my family will probably go back... just becuase it&#39;s there."

Therefore, I was excited when I heard that a new restaurant was opening in Arlington Heights with dim sum available. I went here on a Saturday afternoon and the experience did not disappoint.

The interior is simple and comfortable -- without being either too traditional or too modern. The noise level was low and service was alright. Overall all the cuisine was generally light (you do not need to be overly salty or use a lot of sauce if you trust the quality of your ingredients). The oil used was light as well which makes this a healthier choice. All the dim sum is made in house and generally of high quality. There are currently 34 dim sum choices available which are prepared upon ordering so that crispy dishes come out crispy and all items are steaming hot when they arrive at your table.

My biggest complaint is really the dim lighting inside the main dining room which made it difficult to take pictures of the food without flash, but that is a Yelper problem completely unrelated to the food (which was presented very nicely). Several Yelpers have complained about the prices and portion size, but remember that this is cook-to-order and house-made dim sum in the suburbs so you won&#39;t find the bargain basement prices available in Chinatown.

Jasmine tea: It&#39;s clear that they use higher quality tea here. Served nicely in little glass cups with your own teapot that is refilled frequently.

Spare rib with black bean: Spare rib was nicely cooked and fell off the bone easily. The black bean wasn&#39;t overpowering.

Beef crepe: Crepe was soft although not chewy with a lightly flavored beef filling.

Rice chicken lotus leaf: Probably the least salty version I&#39;ve ever had. The sticky rice was very soft and served hot. 

Minced pork congee with preserved egg: A little expensive but the creamy texture of the congee was excellent. It had a nice savory flavor to it that wasn&#39;t too salty despite using preserved egg. The creamy texture does take a long time to prepare, so few people (outside Chinese food meccas like Toronto) will take the time to prepare it this way.

Steamed BBQ pork bun: Nice fluffy texture to the bun with lightly flavored BBQ pork inside.

Shrimp dumpling: Slightly sweet shrimp wrapped in a translucent skin. Could&#39;ve had a bouncier texture to the shrimp but overall pretty good.

Beef brisket daikon: The beef brisket and daikon were served firm to the tooth and could&#39;ve been a little softer. The gravy was flavorful although a little thick.

Egg tart: Slightly flaky crust with semi-sweet egg custard. The custard was a little lacking in flavor and could&#39;ve been silkier but this is next to impossible to find in the suburbs.

Fried dumpling with pork: Excellent crispy texture on the outside with chewy glutinous rice on the inside.

Crispy crab meat ball: Nice fried exterior with nice shrimp inside. Bouncy texture to the filling although the crab was a little lacking in flavor.

Chicken feet with black bean sauce: Cooked nicely with a chewy firm texture to the skin. 

Taro coconut: Done very well. You can taste the taro and coconut clearly without being too sweet. Probably better than any version done in Chinatown.

Crispy Taro with Pork: Very nice fine nest-like exterior with a light taro flavor on the inside that matched well with the pork.

Pan fried turnip cake: The best part about this dish is that the rice flour doesn&#39;t overpower the other flavors. This is also less oily than most versions you&#39;ll find elsewhere.

Steamed beef tripe with ginger and onion: Nice and chewy/soft-crunchy texture (it&#39;s hard to describe how both textures can exist at once - you need to try to understand). The sauce was light enough were you can clearly taste the ginger and onion.

Beef sui mai: One of the interesting things about this is that the filling is much like the steamed beef balls (ngao yuk) that is another dim sum specialty except in a smaller package.

Mango pudding: Perfect way to end the meal. You can clearly taste the mango whose flavor is heightened with a touch of condensed milk. 

The dinner menu contains a nice variety of sushi, Japanese hot items, noodles, standard Cantonese and Mandarin dishes, salads, and vegetarian options which I&#39;m excited to try sometime. For now, I&#39;m just happy to have saved the gas cost, hours of travel time, and the challenge of finding parking in Chinatown. I can enjoy nearby dim sum in a quiet relaxing atmosphere without a 30 minute wait."

The waitress tried to get him to take the child outside but he refused saying she missed her mother
TIP:  Get a wife, you idiot!  After a few minutes of this absolutely wild screaming child and very little understanding by the English challenged waitress/hostess we got up and left.

Update:  We decided to give it another try and found the service has improved. And they have some of the better dim sum we have tasted.  We really wanted to like this place and we&#39;re glad we gave it another chance."

My first visit in March had highs and lows so I wanted to go again before writing a review. The second visit was similar, the dim sum is great but the other offerings were disappointing. I had a taste from the entrees my friends ordered and they were very hit or miss with some being ok while others were bland. This is irritating because you have no idea what to expect. The drinks weren&#39;t anything to brag about either. 

My second visit was out back in the patio which was nice. It was 7pm on a Saturday night and it was almost empty inside. Ouch. Still, why the slow service? At least the servers are kind and accommodating. I didn&#39;t get to try my dad&#39;s entree but he was able to finish it on top of the egg rolls and dumpling he had. You know how at most Chinese restaurants you can split on entree with someone and be full? Not here. I split a noodle dish with my brother after a couple dim sum orders and we were still able to order another round of dim sum. The noodles were a letdown too, they ran out of duck so we had to go with pork and we asked for lo mein noodles although they didn&#39;t seem like lo mein at all. Also, half the pork was dry.

I hope this place stays open so I don&#39;t have to drive to Wok n Roll in Rolling Meadows for dim sum. I want to try their Ramen but they have limited options compared to Mitsuwa further down Arlington Heights Rd, and for sushi I already go to Naomi&#39;s.  Come on Bistro Chen, step your game up!"

The place is setup nicely. Their menu has so many choices from dim sum to sushi, to Americanized Chinese. Ordered geisha roll, seafood pan fried noodles, beef chow fun, pork buns. The rolls were &#34;OK&#34; -- the rice had the &#34;grocery store&#34; sushi consistency which wasn&#39;t good. I guess this place is known for dimsum. Usually I shy away from non-chinatown dimsum, but from all the other helpers, I shall definitely try it another time. The beef chow fun and pan fried noodles were dead in tasty though. Not a lot of &#34;Chinese&#34; restaurants serve these noodles, so I was very happy they had em.

Super clean bathrooms. Two stalls one urinal dual sinks, easy to open door, soap dispenser. Pull down paper towels. Sit or squat? Sit!"

The egg tart pie was falling apart as we picked them up and didn&#39;t taste good. 

Overall, not a legit dim sum place."

Food quality was decent to good, but service was AWFUL. Our food took forever to arrive, and the waiter had to be reminded three times to bring my son a Coke. The waiter also forgot to turn one of our dim sum orders in to the cook, so we finally canceled it. Even with the $10 off coupon, the bill was still way too high for what we received. We will not return. (We&#39;re better off driving the hour each way to Chinatown and back, where the food is better and cheaper). Several of the menu items were either marked off as unavailable or we were told by our waiter they were unavailable AFTER we ordered them.

Not impressed."

If you have the groupon you cannot order off the lunch special menu, and they will be charging you $3.50 for a better than usual but small pot of loose tea. I was solo on my first visit and I thought $3.50 was a little unnecessary and pricey. Better than the $2.50 Wildfish Numi sealed teabag in a cold coffee cup though, but still not nearly as good as Viet House, 92 Town, Koreana or Yu&#39;s superior included teas. And still a small pot of not-as-good-as-they-think-it-is loose tea; the green and jasmine have been unremarkable so far.

I ordered the beef soup for two, and I got the seafood, which was probably a better order, but not what I ordered. It was good, the egg rolls were very good, hot and crispy and while smaller did remind me of Sun Shui&#39;s excellent egg rolls. There were more odd communication glitches so I did have to file my first waitress in that odd competent-looking-incompetent category, based on the planet we seemed to be on, but nice enuf.

The regular &#34;special lunch&#34; menu that you cannot order off of with the groupon looks like it was printed by a fast food Chinese drive thru and westernized horrible; dim sum is definitely the way to go here. Repeated visits confirm this, and while pricier than I expected very tasty. Larger than I expected with a take out window and and surprisingly uncomfortable booth seating. Too dark in there unless your date is ugly and paying.

Pick up your fortune cookie out of a big bowl on the way out the door. &#34;Good luck&#34; getting what you order. Try it. A-OK."

Upon walking into the restaurant there was a horrible and strong musty smell. Also the place looked like a cheap pop up restaurant with banquet tables and chairs. 

I showed up 2-3 mins before my scheduled pickup time and was told it would be 5 more minutes. I said no problem and would waited outside with my bike. After waiting 10 mins and no one telling me my order was finally ready I walked back inside to find my order sitting in a brown bag on the host desk. I was handed the food and started riding home (0.7 miles). 

Upon pulling into my driveway I get a voicemail from the restaurant telling me they forgot to give me one of the 2 things I ordered. I get back on my bike and head back to the restaurant to get the missing item. Upon arrival I tell the hostess someone just called and there was an item missing from my order. She didn&#39;t know anything about it and said she was going to look into it. On her way to the kitchen a group of 4 people walked into the restaurant and the hostess turned back around and sat the group and left me at the hostess desk. Several mins later the bartender noticed me and asked if she could help, I told her I was missing part of my order and she went into the kitchen and grabbed it.

I finally get home with the food and open everything to find the orange chicken was a solid lump of thick bland sauce with uncooked broccoli. The golden dragon rolls (missing item) were poorly constructed and fell apart as soon as you picked them up.

Finally after everything and the smell / appearance of the restaurant I simply couldn&#39;t get myself to eat more than a few bites. I especially wouldn&#39;t let my wife eat the tuna from the rolls due to not knowing the quality or cleanliness of the kitchen. 

I would NOT recommend this place to others. If you want cheap tasting (defiantly not cheap in price) Chinese food I would suggest getting Panda Express from an airport!"

Yes, sometimes even when going to China Town, I have a really hard time getting veggie dim sum that doesn&#39;t have fish sauce with it..  You won&#39;t have that issue here.

When we are out in the suburbs to visit family, we actually make a detour out of the way just to come here for Dim Sum brunch. We&#39;ve sat both inside and outside (the outside is lovely, although you are definitely  in an alley of sorts). 

I usually order just about every veggie dim sum on the menu. My favorites and recommended are the Veggie Crepes (weekends only), Veggie Tofu Wrap, Steamed Bok Choy, I also enjoy the apple and seaweed salad.

The chinese entrees look fantastic, we&#39;ll have to stop in to try in the evening.

Lastly, every so often they get fish fresh from Japan. Recently my husband had a huge scallop and a clam. Amazing presentation, and the scallop was sushi grade perfection."

Keep in mind this is a suburban 4 for providing decent food, but closer to the city it probably won&#39;t stand a chance with this price to quality/quantity ratio.

I had wanted a cheap place to grab some dim sum near my location, but this is not really a casual diner as much as a more &#34;upscale&#34; Chinese restaurant with really nice yet laid back ambiance.

They sort of do it all: sushi, dim sum, Chinese classics, slightly more authentic Chinese, even ramen. I&#39;m glad their menu isn&#39;t gigantic but mostly picks favorites out of each category - it&#39;s manageable yet varied.

Dim sum was EXPENSIVE. Almost twice as expensive as Chinatown, and small portions. a lot of favorites weren&#39;t available, like those ho fun wrap things, and the egg and pork congee. I picked three of my usual favorites: clams, chicken feet, and spare ribs. Not much in the flavor department and everything left me thirsty for hours after my meal, but at least the ribs were tender and clams were clean. Also, the chicken feet were WAY overcooked to the point the skin&#39;s usually desirable chewy quality (which Western food hates) was just disgusting mush.  (2/5)

Tonkotsu ramen: can&#39;t call this a tonkotsu broth when it was nowhere near as creamy and milky rich as it should be. Not very good mouth feel and cloudy instead of creamy color. Served with sprouts, chopped chives, Chinese red bbq pork that was a bit dry, and a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg. Don&#39;t bother getting this here and go to Mitsuwa for Santouka instead (3/5).

Had a 4 pc hamachi that was pretty good for the price and quality (4/5). The apparently use house made soy sauce for their sushi. Cool. 

Service was very good for a Chinese restaurant, but those who don&#39;t like extra bubbly waitresses whose friendliness might borderline intrusion might not enjoy the service here. 

Good option for the farther away &#39;burbs to get your fix of niche items, but that&#39;s about it."

While the food is rarely, if ever, disappointing, the drive down to the city from the burbs on an evening after work can be a bit arduous given the perpetual state of construction occurring on the interstates adjacent to Chicago at any given time. With our local Dim Sum supply not even remotely close to good, we chanced it on a little place slightly farther away.

The food was absolutely wonderful in the best kind of way. Everything is cooked fresh, avoiding the dim sum downfall of circling on a cart for who knows how long, and you can taste it in each and every piece. 

On top of it, our server Kei (Pronounced like the letter &#34;K&#34;) was without a doubt the best my wife and I have ever had beyond reproach. She was attentive, friendly and more than happy to discuss Dim Sum, Chinatown and their chef with us.

The price was comparable with what we&#39;d get at Triple Crown or Phoenix in Chinatown without having had to fight our way down through city traffic. At $20 - $25 a person for a substantially filling meal, it won&#39;t break the bank, but may strain your waistline.

If you live in the burbs, anywhere remotely near Arlington Heights, this is your stop for fresh Dim Sum made from scratch. No excuse. My only regret was not being able to hug the chef in back.

I went to dinner last night with my friend and this friend is fantastic because like me---she likes to eat! Those girls who go to a restaurant and order a salad then eat half of it because they are full? They suck. We both agreed we would order a monstrous number of small plates and share the yum. 

I arrived before my friend and got us a booth. The restaurant is quite large and there were only a couple of other tables seated. I was greeted by the server who told me she was very happy to be my waitress tonight. How cute! The staff throughout the whole night was attentive, keeping our drinks filled and food flowing. Although I caught them giggle a bit when they couldn&#39;t fit any more small plates on our table. I think they may have never seen a couple of girls eat quite like us!

Our menu delight:
+Honey Walnut Chicken Salad ($7.50) - This is normally a shrimp salad, however they were more than willing to substitute chicken for us instead due to my allergy. The chicken was cooked well, sauce was just right and the salad ended up balancing it a bit making me feel like I was eating a semi-healthy dish.
+Dim Sum:
                -Crispy Taro Delight ($3.50 for 3) - Loved the filling of these. I probably wouldn&#39;t get it again because I&#39;m a weirdo about mess and biting into this, the crisp went all over my shirt, the table, my mouth, etc.
                -Egg Custard Bun ($3.50 for 3) - Good dessert type of item. The bun itself was soft &amp; a great consistency to the custard.
                -Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ($3.50 for 3) - This is always a hit with me. Great deal although I thought it could have used a tad bit more filling. The BBQ Pork inside was sweet and really liked it.
                -Beef Shu Mai ($3.50 for 4) - Finally a dim sum we could split evenly between the two of us! Loved it! Great ground up beef inside with a pea on top.
+Sweet Potato Roll ($4.50) - I had to try their Sweet Potato Roll! They deep fry the sweet potato in a tempura batter and roll it into a yummy roll. It&#39;s a no frills type of roll without any sauce or extra fillings but it gets the job done, I enjoyed it and I would get it again.
+Pickled veggies on the house!~

It&#39;s important to note that if you go outside of their normal dim sum hours (which are Sat &amp; Sun from 11-3), dim sum items are limited but they still have enough to make it fun!

With all the beastly food we ate &amp; drinks, it came to just about $20pp. I really enjoyed everything I had and will be back, even just for takeout it&#39;s a good option. Good to know there is good food North of Northwest Hwy in downtown Arlington Heights!"

We had the orange chicken and Mongolian beef as takeout. The orange chicken was white meat with very little breading (major plus in my book) with a very tasty sauce. The beef was good, although not necessarily a standout. I love that they offer brown rice for an upcharge instead of being stuck with white. 

I was impressed by the service. We got home and realized our egg rolls were missing. I called to see if we could just get a refund, and they insisted on delivering them to us. Very nice! The egg rolls were very good - and still hot!

We will definitely be back!"

Well last year, we went and after an hour, and a bottle of wine we didn&#39;t have any food and had no choice but to leave.  We decided to try again this year, they were on a wait, no problem, we put our name in and sat until we were called.  We went up to the hostess, before we could get sat a guy came up a said he had a reservation and said he wanted a booth, the hostess gave him the table, the only open table...when she came back I asked if she just gave our table away she said yes, no apology or anything, needless to say, second year of no Christmas dinner, we will never be back and advise others to stay away as well"

It is definitely a nice alternative for suburbia dim sum if you don&#39;t feel like driving to chinatown.

First and foremost, the place is super clean for a dim sum place. The bathroom was something you hope for if you ever dine in chinatown. It&#39;s clean and nice. You actually want to make your contribution there.

The dim sum choices are small compared to chinatown restaurants but it&#39;ll fix your craving for dim sum. They had a variety of dumplings today and one type of congee. The egg custard bun or pie were not those of the rich pineapple bun, with the sweet and creamy salted duck egg yolk filling. If you are looking and expecting those, you&#39;ll be disappointed. The shu mai was not that good unfortunately. The skin was rather tough and tasted a bit gamy. 

Other than that, I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. Oh, one more thing, I paid more here than chinatown dim sum. Maybe, we just ordered too much or price was indeed higher. But, if you pay with cash, they&#39;ll give you 6% discount."

The deciding factor: their website and their menu lists several items that they have not carried in a long time.  There is no reason for these to not be updated, especially the website.  Don&#39;t come for bell peppers with shrimp and pea pod dumplings.  

It is, however, an excellent alternative to driving to Chicago in the snow.  We made reservations and there were only 3 open tables when we got there so we&#39;ll make reservations next time we come. 

Compared to MingHin in Chicago:
- It was the same total bill for us, about $25 per person including tip, but we did not have to pay for street parking. 
- A few plates that are better at Bistro Chen: 
   Roast duck! Better flavor and a lot bigger portion size. 
   Veggie rolls.  Great filling. 
   Mango pudding.  Real pudding, not jello-like.   
- The ones we won&#39;t order next time at Bistro Chen: 
   Soy chow mein.  Crispy and salty.  We had leftovers that no one wanted to bring home. 
   Rice crepes.  Very surprised that these were bad as they are a dim sum staple. Lots of dough, very skimpy filling.  We ordered shrimp and veggie.  The veggie filling was better suited for fajitas than dim sum.  
   Rice in lotus leaf.  Another staple gone awry.  Chicken was hard, rice lacked flavor.  This is one that usually has mushrooms and this one had none.  
- What we cannot get at MingHin:
  Eggplant and shrimp.  It was excellent! Believe it or not, MingHin doesn&#39;t carry it.  
  Because it is on the menu: one in our party ordered sushi and said it was good.  

WE WILL DEFINETELY BE BACK.  We&#39;re very happy to have this option in the suburbs."

Most of the dimsum plates are good including chicken feet, taro puff, fried pork dumpling, and sesame seed ball.  I feel the skin of the shrimp dumpling and its variety is too thick. The rice and chicken lotus leaf is good but too sticky, you have to scrape it off the leaf with effort and it&#39;s a mess.  We had turnip cake in XO sauce instead of the turnip cake and it was very good.  It is a little pricey but I guess it evens out if you save on gas and time."

We went back there tonight for the third time and let me tell you it will be our last. The service was awful.  It took the waiter about 20 minutes to come take our order.  They forgot my husband&#39;s salad and my main entree. Finally after an hour we decided it was time to go.  It&#39;s a shame because their food is good.  They definitely need more staff and better customer service.

No problem and cool, live music. We we arrived they seemed understaffed and unorganized but we were able to get a seat outside. The hostess/bus girl was awkward and made a point to tell us she wasn&#39;t a waitress but that one would be with us soon. However there was 1 waitress for the while patio (about 8 tables) and people were constantly flagging her down. We ordered Mongolian beef, a California roll, and a spicy tuna roll. The beef was good, but the portion was small. The sushi was awful. Both the rolls are falling apart and had like a fish pate in it instead of one big chunk. Weird. 

When the waitress cleared one of the plates, the soy sauce spilled on me, which happens, fine. However there was no offer to remove something from the check or pay for dry cleaning. Then when the hostess/bus girl asked if she could clear other plates, I told her she could take mine and the proceeded to stand there and wait for my husband to finish. Super weird. 

To top it all off, they misplaced our credit card, the musician was strange an inappropriate (the opening song was like &#34;the only time I am sober is when my wife isn&#39;t around), and the patio furniture was mis matched and cheap. Never going back."

They have a wide variety of beverages as well as dishes. We came here for Chinese New Year. Traditionally we head into the city and brave the cold as we watch the parade. Then we march over to 3 Happiness for Dim Sum. Couldn&#39;t brave the cold this year. This was an excellent suburban alternative. This little place is tucked away in Arlington Heights right across the train station with ample street parking. We had a lovely dry and floral sake (yes, I know, it&#39;s Japanese) while our son enjoyed his Ramune. For starters we had the hot and sour soup. It&#39;s a creeper heat and most of it was on the bottom. Nonetheless, it was very delicious. We also ordered our Dim Sum: short ribs, steamed bbq pork buns, Chinese broccoli, roasted duck, crispy taro with pork, pork and shrimp in bean curd and rice and chicken in lotus leaf. So each item comes 2-3 mini pieces, hence the amount we ordered. My son loved the bbq pork buns, I enjoyed to Chinese broccoli and my husband loved the duck. As a treat, the chef sent out egg custard pies for luck in the new year! Very thoughtful. Gong Hey Fat Choy!"

Yes there is Chinatown for dim sum, but let&#39;s be realistic - it&#39;s not around the corner and there can be lengthy waits for a table. 
For my dim sum fix this place is it! They actually had some dishes I don&#39;t see at many Chinatown restaurant. 

I came with my family on Father&#39;s Day &amp; we were immediately seated. Our server was polite and friendly. My sons (ages 3 &amp; 5) enjoyed their meal. Our server had their food out quickly so they could start eating. She checked back frequently and overall all the service from everyone was stellar. 

We make sure our children behave whether we are the only ones or not in the restaurant. It is a business after all and yes, they are young but they know you don&#39;t run around in a restaurant. We didn&#39;t have any problems with the manager or any of the servers. We were actually complimented. 

Overall - really good dim sum and top notch service! Can&#39;t wait to bring my parents here for dim sum."

The reason I say &#34;one of&#34; is because I was already a fan of the chef&#39;s other restaurant Bistro Dragon in Elk Grove Village. The staff is always friendly and I am always impressed with the food. They take pride in their restaurant. Every time I take people there for the first time, it instantly becomes one of their favorites as well.

The manager knows all of the favorite dishes of my wife and mine but is always eager to have us try new dishes on the menu. It&#39;s hard for me to name a favorite dish because it is constantly changing. Currently, it is the BBQ pork buns on their dim sum menu. It is always difficult to find quality dim sum outside of Chinatown but at Bistro Chen, they&#39;ve done a great job. 

Another quality of the restaurant I enjoy is they encourage sharing. Many times, instead of ordering entrees, we will order an assortment of appetizers. Also, with the generous portion sizes, an entrée is easily enough to feed two people which are great for people like me on a budget. 

If you&#39;re looking for a relaxing place to sit back and enjoy good food and drink, definitely check this place out."

The dim sum we delicious! The food is made to order, as mentioned before, but they also walk around with plates of different items to offer you. They brought out a bbq pork pie that was so darn good we also ordered it again from the menu. Between the three of us, we ate a ton! And as everything has been pretty much covered below, I&#39;ll simply say we loved all of it. My mom loved the scallops wrapped in bacon, my husband loved the skewered pork belly, and I think the BBQ bun was my favorite.

The interior is very pretty. I had been going to Chin&#39;s beginning when I was in high school, you would never recognize the inside. Very much improved.

The service? Fabulous! We had two adorable servers, who were attentive, nice and personable. The food came out 3 plates at a time so our table wasn&#39;t full of plates of good getting cold.

However, the service is not that great, and due to a misunderstanding, part of our order waited in the kitchen only to harden and turn into dim sum balls with the texture of tough hard to chew nonsense.  We had to flag down a waitress 15 minutes after all of our items made it to the table just to get this dish. 

They also brought out twice as much of an item that we ordered, which we stated THREE TIMES upon ordering exactly the quantity we wanted.  After telling the server who brought out the extra food  this, she had the audacity to question us, and said &#34;let me go check&#34; as if we had changed our minds on what he had ordered.

Ambiance leaves a lot to be desired.  Feels cold and empty.  Hopefully that will change in time.  Wonton soup tasted like what you&#39;d find at a shopping mall food court. 

I&#39;ll return for a few dim sum items, but that&#39;s about the extent of my patronage to this place.  A true shame, I was hoping to really enjoy the food.

Let&#39;s just say its had a lot of ups and downs. We first started going because of the great lunch deal. Over time that deal has become more sub-par but we still go. Only for one reason, the food is actually pretty good. Of all the Mexican restaurants in the area, they are probably my favorite when it comes to the food. 

The service on the other hand is a joke. A few years ago it was good, but as of recent its been nothing but horrible.In fact a handful of my friend&#39;s just plain won&#39;t go because the service is so bad. Recently a single guy runs the entire place (probably because they don&#39;t get many customers over lunch), he is terrible. He&#39;s rude, slow and just everything that&#39;s wrong with service. In fact he has argued with people in our party before over the lunch special.He gets really angry when you ask him what the lunch special is.

Recently they swapped out the old furniture for some really crappy used furniture and opened up a second side to the restaurant. I&#39;m not even sure why they expanded, I can&#39;t ever recalling more than 1 other table having people at it when we&#39;ve been there in the past. It&#39;s especially surprising seeing that Noodles right next door is always packed. 

If the food wasn&#39;t decent and the price wasn&#39;t fair then I would never go back. But I keep going back once every other week because the food is actually good and I crave the chorizo tacos with the chips and ranch dip."

First of all, the food is subpar. My chile rellenos were mushy and watery. They also only stuff them with cheese here so they were pretty plan. The rice is the equivalent of white rice with a splash of yellow food coloring and the retried beans taste like they came from a can. 

The service here sucks and the only thing worth coming for are the margaritas which taste good but have minimal booze in them. The last time I came here the waitress was rude and acted like we were an inconvenience. None of us got the salt or sugar rims on our margaritas that we ordered. Mine did get a special garnish though. I pulled out a piece of the bartenders hair. When I told the waitress she asked me if I was sure it wasn&#39;t mine (which was back in a ponytail with a head band, longer and lighter colored). She finally offered to replace it for me but still charged me for it. I was annoyed that she suggested I would complain about my own hair. She also was annoyed we asked for separate checks (we were there with our book club). 

So why not give them one star? The margaritas have good flavor... Just make sure yours doesn&#39;t have an extra &#34;garnish&#34;!"

My sister and I came here about a year and a half, two years ago and the service was poor at best.  I requested a Patron margarita, I received a margarita with what was CLEARLY well tequila (i.e. the cheapest bathtub tequila one can find).  Rest assured, the server charged me for the Patron.  They serve a white ranch dip with their chips and salsa which is probably the least Mexican food item I can think of.   An employee&#39;s child loudly played nearby.  It was a terrible experience.  

But, everyone has a bad day and apparently I&#39;m a glutton for punishment because I went back there thinking they got their stuff together and listened to customer complaints and improved.  NOPE!  I walked in and the server (who appeared to be the only person working front of house) was standing directly in front of me waiting on one of two occupied tables.  Two men came in behind me.  The server finally acknowledged us and said &#34;sit anywhere you want&#39;.  Okay, thanks for the friendly greeting.  I sat down, waiting for my menu.  Nothing.  I finally see the server bring the two men who came in behind me their chips, salsa and Lay&#39;s Ranch Dip and ask if they&#39;re ready to order.  Huh?  I stood up to leave and said &#34;Excuse me, just so you know, I was here before they were&#34; and walked out.  Shout out to the two &#34;gentlemen&#34; who allowed this to happen instead of saying &#34;She was here first&#34;.  

Businesses need to worry less about reviews on Yelp and worry more about serving their customers in a way that doesn&#39;t get them a poor review.  Never again.

**Side Note:  To the person below named Melissa who asked for her fajitas not to be cooked in butter or oil but got oily fajitas...how the f**k do you think fajitas get made??  I&#39;m sorry, but that has to be the silliest request I&#39;ve ever seen."

1) Ordered 2 enchiladas.  Asked waiter to recommend chicken or beef, he suggested chicken.  Ordered 1 cheese/1 chicken, got two cheese.  Decided not to complain.
2) When the checks came... I had 2 enchiladas, $8.99, my friend had 2 tacos, $4.59 and 1 special margarita, $6.00
---My check was for a burrito was for a burrito $9.99, with a $2.00 fee
---Hers somehow came to $28
He told me he couldn&#39;t ring mine as the enchilada button was broken...And he said that he couldn&#39;t adjust because no manager was on site. I tried pointing out it wasn&#39;t the right price.  He fixed hers to two drinks, $20, even though she had one.  And then told us he couldn&#39;t fix it more because that he hadn&#39;t charged for her food.  We tried to explain it again, and he was like &#34;well, just don&#39;t pay, I&#39;ll pay for it&#34;
My friend then noticed my bill was time stamped 7:11pm, and we didn&#39;t even meet there til 7:20
-We called over the waitress, she corrected my bill (I guess the button DID work) and fixed my friend&#39;s bill, and the margarita still rang up at $8.  She manually adjusted the $2

The bartender who waited on us seem flustered by the six customers he had.  Was constantly  stopping mid-sentence to tend to others.

I felt bad for the guy sitting next to us (customer#7) who was waiting 20 minutes for two take-out tacos.  He was told, after they brought him someone else&#39;s order, that they only had one cook tonight.

As for the food,standard.  The red sauce though was very tomato-y, almost like tomato paste without much flavo"

I ordered the plate with a taco, enchilada, and a flauta. I of course had to have a steak taco. It was flavorful and good. The chicken enchilada was ahhhhhhmazing. The chicken had so much flavor! I want one right now actually. The flauta was equally delicious. 

And let&#39;s take a minute to talk about the sauce with the tacos. OMG so goood!! I want it by the bottles lol. I&#39;ve never had a sauce that tasted like that.

Enchiladas were falling apart soggy. The verde sauce tastes like it came out of a can. The ground beef has carrots in it, where is this beef from? When I saw the steak I couldn&#39;t differentiate it from the ground beef. It&#39;s super chewy and fatty. So disappointed. I won&#39;t be back."

Tortilla chips + salsas was a nice side kick to hold us over.

We got 3 taco plate (chicken, chorizo, el pastor) authentic style w/ corn tortilla.  As a surprise appetizer we got complimentary tortilla soup which tasted great and fresh!  Then came the tacos, in one word: tasty!  My favorite was chorizo.

The close location was great, too.

We pulled up and, from the outside, couldn&#39;t tell if it was open or just empty.  Blame the tint on the windows, because once inside we saw they were open and we weren&#39;t alone either.  The place looks really nice inside, like a cozy corner not a dive, 3 a.m. drunk taco stop.

We weren&#39;t in the mood to drink so we just got cokes, but all of the margaritas look amazing.  Better try them next time (and there will be a next time).  They also had mexican coke in glass bottles for those interested.

We came in hungry, so we decided to split the queso fundito (?) which proved to be a great choice.  We didn&#39;t use the tortillas it comes with but rather just dipped our chips in it.  The meat and cheese were both tasty.  The chips and salsa were up to snuff as well.

For our meals my friend got quesadillas and i got my standard steak tacos.  I wish I had known how big the tacos were, because I couldn&#39;t finish my meal and would&#39;ve ordered less.  But now I know for next time.  The tacos didn&#39;t wow me, but they were still good.

Let&#39;s give this a shot... 

I&#39;m a gringo and the way I know any restaurant is good is by the level of service I receive and the quality of the food as soon as my meal is concluded. If there are others eating there the food might be good (shocker, there were). Non gringos might feel their food is good too (wish I could comment on authenticity but I&#39;m a gringo that&#39;s never gone anywhere outside a resort town in Mexico). The rice was cooked perfectly. The chorizo was normal ol&#39; chorizo (yum), al pastor was so ridiculously tender and juicy that I&#39;d wish I&#39;d ordered more for the road and the carnitas were tender and juicy but could&#39;ve used a bit more flavor. The refried beans I&#39;ve known and loved all my life tasted like the same ones I&#39;ve had everywhere else, I&#39;m a fan of black personally but you won&#39;t find me complaining. The waitresses appeared to be having a good day and well I&#39;m selfish... because whether they were or weren&#39;t doesn&#39;t quite matter so much to me, their service and attitude was great throughout. I can&#39;t speak about the bartender because she didn&#39;t serve me but the patrons occupying her stools appeared to be in good spirits *ba dum tsh*. The taco stand that occupied this space before is no longer an operating business.

I&#39;m glad Maria&#39;s decided to fill the void in my food heart that is this little strip mall. I can now get my fix of Chinese, Mexican, or Pizza without having to think hard about what I want prior to leaving the house. Anyhow... A+++ would nom nom nom again. Thanks for a good experience and delicious food.

We came inside and were told to pick any place to sit so we went to a 2 person table next to the bar.  Waitress came by and took our drink order. Now mind you we are serious foodies and REALLY enjoy dining out having a good time and experiencing new places with great enthusiasm.  We are NEVER rude to our servers and engage in conversation with our server and ask their opinions of the menu and we tip 25% always.
BUT Saturday night we must have had a &#34;DONT SERVE THESE FUCKING PEOPLE&#34; sign on our foreheads.
After waiting 8 minutes and not getting our drinks I went to the bar to order them and our waitress moved over to head me off and say our order again to us.  I watched the bar tender make her way over to the taps, pour our beers, leave them at the tap and walk away to chitchat with the cooking staff leaving our beers there another 3 minutes.
We got up and walked out.
Sorry NEVER AGAIN.
We made our way to Schaumburgs Village Tavern, ALWAYS killer food and service."

But food wise. I had the best tacos i have ever had in the suburbs. And the spicy mango margarita was out of this world. The place is affordable, and most of all, tasteful. The staff was amazing. They provide such great service. They always made sure our food and drinks were great.

I have frequented this establishment almost daily since it opened not only to try out the menu but because everyone who works there is friendly and inviting. Many restaurants claim fresh food, but Maria&#39;s is hands down the best in this area. Made to order fresh Mexican food is hard to come by, and in my opinion, Maria&#39;s is spot on. Portion sizes are very generous which makes for this big guy with a big appetite very happy, but can also serve as a nice meal to share or even for leftovers.  Fresh squeezed fruit cocktails (margaritas and mojitos!),  4 Mexican beers on draft and a friendly staff who are always smiling makes for a wonderful experience. My humble recomendations are as follows. Appitizer: Elote (Mexican Grilled corn) served with tortilla chips. Lunch: Torta (Mexican sandwich) with choice of meat. Dinner: Many to choose from but I will say the Burrito Suizo. *note: very large portion*. There are many more delicious food to try and I recommend trying them out for yourselves.  I have heard some complaints about the lack of a extremely spicy sauce but a restaurant can&#39;t try to kill people with heat.  The spice level is fine and people who don&#39;t like spicy food can feel very comfortable eating here.  I am also quite sure the kitchen can whip up a &#34;fire sauce&#34; upon request. Overall, this newest edition to the area will be the talk of the town soon because the level of service combined with fresh food quality will be a sure success. And by the way, to the other person who posted, I was born in Mexico and love the food here."

Service was not good at all. we were there close to two hrs just to get a drink appetizers and main dish. The wait between drink order to actually taking our appetizer order was around 20 min.

Time of my visit: Lunch time

I decided to go to this place based on Yelp! reviews.  There is a huge selection of different options, I chose Hug Heaven.  I had an option of hot or cold, I picked cold and it came with the chips.  I also ordered large iced tea.  Right from the top, I was told, it would be just one free refill (I really appreciated that).  I reached out to pay with my AMEX and was told they did not accept it.  Sorry, but this is such a pet peeve of mine, either accept them all or be a cash only, this selected cards only is none-sense to me.

It did not take long for them to get me my food. While waiting I did notice there was a price difference between what was in the menu and what I was charged.  It was not a big difference, but nonetheless could be a bit confusing.  When my lunch arrived, the sandwich did not look all that big (size wise), maybe a little over 6 inches in length.  Chips were your typical, out of the bag, big brand chips, I was hoping for home style, home made chips.  The sandwich was not anything spectacular or out of this word, your typical deli sandwich, warmed up.  The bread was too soft for my liking.  Overall, I was not all that impressed and for pennies under $10, I was expecting a heck lot more.

I must comment and compliment on three things, efficiency, the food came out fast.  The cleanness, the place looked like you could eat off the floor.  The service, the service was awesome!  The lady behind the counter, the lady who brought out my food, both were very polite, sweet and nice.

However, C- is the best I can do.  It&#39;s almost not worth a drive for me on my lunch."

Located in the strip mall on Lake St., it wasn&#39;t hard to find and sits nicely among the other businesses.

Upon entering to meet Jacqueline B. for lunch, I was greeted sweetly by the lady at the counter. I wouldn&#39;t say the menu is overwhelming but there is a LOT to choose from. You&#39;re not weird if you need to ask for a minute to browse through all of the different types of hot and cold sandwiches and the rest of the menu. I picked up a bottle of water from the open refrigerated section by the counter, ordered myself a chicken pesto asiago panini and took a seat. It was immediately in the middle of a lunch rush so I&#39;m surprised I had gotten a table! This place gets crowded!

I have very few preferences and opinions when it comes to food so I thought my panini was a-ok to me. All paninis come with a side of chips which doesn&#39;t sound very filling but the sandwich was actually larger than I had thought it would be. The chicken was pretty scarce within the sandwich but the panini bread made up for it. The prices were what I expected (and had read from previous reviews). The prices are definitely comparable to a Panera lunch.

The one qualm I have about Crave is that from the chatter and conversations as well as the music throughout, it was really difficult to hear the lady say the order when your meal was ready. From the ambience and looks of the place, I had honestly thought your order gets brought to your table - especially because there is outdoor seating. It may be really inconvenient for those outdoor customers to peek in-and-out to see if their food is ready.

Overall, the space was nicely decorated, very clean and had a nice rustic look to it with the warm colors and dark wood. The employees were really sweet and really take care of the place from the looks of it.  I&#39;d love to visit again and try more on the large menu!"

Unfortunately no stars for the food itself. I really hate giving bad reviews but their food is nothing spectacular. Perhaps I had too much expectations given that this place was 4.5 out 5 stars (33 reviews). It was a total let down for me. I do appreciate the variety of sandwiches they offer. 

They advertise fresh soup which maybe it was but the taste was bland. I had the mushroom soup and it was bland with big slices of mushrooms. 

I asked for their most popular sandwich and the lady said it was the chicken pesto panini. The bf had that and I had the Cuban panini. The chicken pesto was bland with tasteless chicken and same with the pork in the Cuban sandwich. Both meats were tasteless and it could&#39;ve been more tender. The bread... Have you ever had a sandwich that hurt the top of your palate because the bread was too hard??? Yep, the bread on this one surely didn&#39;t make the cut either. I ended up taking out the meat and leaving the bread uneaten. 

The Cuban panini came with seasoned fries. $8.95. The meat filled half of the sandwich, but then again if you don&#39;t enjoy the taste, why have more of it?  Not worth it. Chicken pesto panini came with chips. $8.99. Not worth it either. 

Sad to say I will not be back."

Crave Cafe is one of the good choices. The small café has about 10 tables and it&#39;s half full at lunch time on a Saturday. The menu reminds me of Panera Bread, with sandwiches (hot and cold), soup, salads, but there are also at least 5 different kinds of burgers and some &#34;south of the border&#34; choices. 

I decided to go with the special of the day: fish tacos with fries. Each of the 3 tacos had a good-sized well-seasoned fresh-off-the-grill tilapia fillet, not small pieces of unidentified fish like many other fish tacos. I devoured all of them. The crispy fries were the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. If the weather was cooler, I would have tried one of their homemade soups. 

The San Antonio Burger he (by he, I mean my spouse of choice) got was a little messy to eat due to the BBQ pulled pork, but he said it&#39;s yummy. 

Prices are on a par with fast casual restaurants, but you can expect more of &#34;made from scratch&#34; here.

I remember them fondly for being especially nice to my father when he visited. He came in and asked them a thousand things and left without buying anything. Still, they answered every single silly question and wished us well.

I&#39;ve had a chance to eat here a couple times and we order from them at least once a month. Their burgers are delicious and their sandwiches hit the spot. It&#39;s a lot of food for not too much money and service had always been tops!

I got the Asian Chicken Salad for about $8. The size is good, ginger dressing is delicious but my salad is FROZEN. 

Yes, FROZEN. It took the guy all but 3 seconds to put it in a bag for takeout which must mean that they are premade. In any case, a frozen salad is not a salad. All the lettuce is frozen and the chicken as well. That said, the menu said &#34;grilled chicken&#34; and I had hoped it would be warm. Or at least room temperature, or edible. Also, the chicken looks processed.

I would try it again, but would not do a salad."

 The sandwich was bland, lacking real character.   I know you say it&#39;s a turkey sandwich - what did you expect Vince?  There was nothing exciting in the sandwich - the turkey was boring, bacon basic and the spicy mayo lacked zip.    

The chili saved the lunch.   It was smoky, full of meat and was an excellent rendition of chili.   I&#39;d go back for this by itself and try something different on the menu.

Staff was pleasant and space very clean."

Politely advised the older gentleman, I think he was the cook as well. Asked if I could possibly have something else since cheese was melted all over the salmon. He responded &#39;it&#39;s already made.. We can take the cheese off..&#39; which wasn&#39;t an option, it was seriously all over...

Unfortunately had to walk out $12 short and still hungry.

Granted they have a service deliver for them and they don&#39;t have their own drivers. I definitely won&#39;t order delivery again because it takes well over an hour and they even called me a few times because they needed to clarify my order. It wasn&#39;t complicated and it was a small order so getting 3 calls about it was odd to me and made me feel like they weren&#39;t paying attention.

This is a cute, super clean, friendly and tasty, sandwich shop.  They offer a wide array of sandwichs, pannini&#39;s, burgers, salads.  They have pastries and a breakfast menu.  They serve Coca-Cola products from the fountain, but they also have a cooler with water, juice and Pepsi products as well.  This cafe is just west of Caputo&#39;s in the Georgetown Shopping Center in Bloomingdale.  

 First of all, this place is immaculate, clean, bathrooms were spotless, shiny, attractive artwork and a fragrant aroma.  Floors were spotless.  Attendant was very helpful and for only an additional twenty cents I upgraded to a meal for my Bleu burger with carmelized onions.  Food came quickly to our table, the french fries, which I almost didn&#39;t order were fantastic.  Owner buys a seasoned fry, pays extra, but they were crispy, tasty and golden brown.  Just the way I like them.   The sandwich, which only cost $5.29 was GOURMET all the way.  Bleu cheese, was so tasty and not an incredibly strong bite, perfect for my tastes.  The Bleu cheese is a Stella&#39;s product which is an excellent brand of food.  Owner goes high end with all of his food orders, pays extra for a higher quality of food.  

Atmosphere was pleasant, they had a nice run of lunch customers which were taken care of quickly.  We were able to relax, no hustle and bustle, here,   Great mood to enjoy  friends and good food.  Not noisy like many restaurants.  

Be prepared to have a great experience with your cravings at Crave Cafe.  Five stars, period!!!!   Great place to pop in after your dance workout or weight training session or visit to Caputo&#39;s,  stop in and satisfy your cravings."

Ambience was casual. This place had traditional music, decor, and even traditional seating. There are two seating areas: one with regular table seating and another area with traditional, floor seating. We did traditional floor seating.We were asked to take off our shoes before stepping in the area. It was comfortable for me, but not so much for my boyfriend. Will probably sit in regular table for next time. 

This place serves food tapas style, aka small plates that are meant to be shared. So this would be great for both couples and groups. There were a TON of different small plates you can order, and not just japanese dishes. I saw a good amount of Korean dishes as well. There were also a good amount of sushi rolls offered too. 

We were planning on getting ramen, so we only ordered the Ton Toro for a light appetizer. It was so so SO good!! Definitely will order this again next time, and maybe even 2+ orders. It was sliced thinly, grilled nicely, and had nice, light seasoning. Reminded me of bacon. We basically inhaled it in two seconds. Again, it was a small plate, so I would recommend maybe 1-2 orders for a couple.  

I usually order miso ramen, but many reviewers raved about the Tonkatsu Ramen so I decided to give it a try. It has a very rich, creamy pork broth and is topped with 2 slices of pork and pickled radish I believe. The noodles were my favorite part-- you can tell these were fresh noodles rather than the ones you have to rehydrate. The broth wasn&#39;t salty at all. While I wasn&#39;t that much of a fan of the pork slices, they definitely were melt-in-your mouth and were very soft. I&#39;d probably order the miso ramen for next time, but this one was good, too!"

Note: Izakaya is in an unassuming strip mall location. 

+ great value on the dinner bento box, which includes hearty pieces of tempura, salad, 2 kinds of sashimi with octopus and squid, fried potato, veggies, a bowl of rice, and an assortment of other nibbles*.
+ pork cheek appetizer is offered here.  Tasty, savory, torched flavor!
+ nice char on the beef teriyaki, and plentiful portion.  This was one of my favorite food memories of the place.
+ friendly, attentive service

- *the assortment of other nibbles didn&#39;t look very appetizing.  It was presented in a square compartment of brownish gray offerings to eat and included potato, a gray gelatinous prism-like bite, crab meat, and sweet egg.  It looked a little like a petrified coffin of disintegrating foods (maybe I&#39;m in the Halloween spirit right now).  
- the pork cheek was chewy, which took away from the WOW factor. 
- the lychee ice cream was unique, but way too sweet and strong in artificial lychee flavor.  I couldn&#39;t finish the bowl.  :ox
- the pre-dinner hot towel was lukewarm.
- miso soup that came with the box was lukewarm as well.  I was expecting HOT!"

Sure, I&#39;ve been to many Japanese restaurants in my time, but I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve been to anything as authentic as Izakaya Sankyu although many restaurants have tried.  They can count me in as their newest groupie (if only Japanese restaurants could have groupies).

They have everything you could ever hope for in an Asian dream.  They have sushi rolls, fried rice, stir fry, ramen, classic Japanese desserts and probably anything else you could think of.  My decision was fairly easy because what lured me in was their ramen, but I could have easily chosen anything from their menu and been more than satisfied.  However, my decision was locked in from the moment I sat down and I ordered the Kimchee Ramen that I split with my fiancé.  The staff were even nice enough to split the ramen into two bowls without us even requesting this.  Oh, and yes, the ramen was fantastic!  What else was fantastic you ask?  The Tako Yaki, for one...and for all you new groupies - that&#39;s octopus inside of batter balls.  You&#39;ve not had balls in your mouth until you&#39;ve had these (sorry for the crudeness - I couldn&#39;t resist).  Serioudly, though - they&#39;re freaking amazing as is their dessert that consists of red bean paste smushed between green tea pancakes and served up with some classic vanilla ice cream.

I can&#39;t get over how awesome this restaurant was - everything was top notch, from the service, to the food (obviously), to the authentic dining areas.  Yes, there is an area where you can traditionally dine by sitting on the floor with a low-set table.  I may have considered this option were I not 6&#39;4&#34; with a history of being extremely clumsy, however - it&#39;s a nice option for some.  If you font prefer this then you&#39;re in luck - they have normal seating and bar seating available.

The other great thing about Izakaya Sankyu?  The prices!  I mean c&#39;mon, you can&#39;t get much better for such fresh food.  The ramen was only $8...and that thing was hugggeee.  Everything combined, my fiancé and I got a full-fledged meal for about $25.  Have you ever heard of such a thing?  

Anyways, please go support this wonderful business - I&#39;ll bd back, Izakaya Sankyu!"

Wanna know mine?  I should have found another place for our dinner this evening instead dining at Izakaya Sankyu.  

Hubby&#39;s GPS kept on taking us to the opposite direction.  Well, that was certainly a premonition.  As a sensitive Virgo, I should have developed a plan B.

Parking is extremely ample in the strip mall lot.  Izakaya Sankyu isn&#39;t a large place, but it&#39;s definitely not cramped or tight like Ramen Misoya or most restaurants in the city.  The service began with the young lady&#39;s spunky &#34;Irasshaimase&#34; and immediately followed by the hot towels.  By the way, Sankyu has a massive selection of alcohol, beer, sake, and cocktails.  Hubby and I aren&#39;t fond of drinking while enjoying our meal, yet I know many of my fellow Yelpers are alcoholic-beverage connoisseurs.  

We didn&#39;t order a feast and went with the basics: tan zaru udon and tonkotsu ramen.  I had to say the tonkotsu ramen was mediocre at best.  The broth tasted salty.  I felt some of the instant ramen purchased from an Asian market would generate better broth than what I had at Sankyu.  All the components and ingredients of tonkotsu ramen were there, but the entire dish turned to be unremarkable.  I was genuinely disappointed!  

Hubby, on the other hand, didn&#39;t comment positively on his tan zaru udon, either.  

Thankfully, the NHK channel was a nice touch.  At least I enjoyed their morning news and historical dorama even though my tastebuds suffered.  

Overall, Izakaya Sankyu seemingly has the potential.  With food being lackluster, I will take my business elsewhere."

I got the chicken teriyaki bento box, a futomaki, &amp; some nigiri. This is my standard lunch order for new places. It seems a bit white man but it touches on all the basics in Japanese food. Fried, grilled, traditional roll, &amp; nigiri. No mayo filled combo rolls with tempura flakes all over!!! To start I will say this spot serves up some more authentic items. I liked the pickled items and sides with the bento but that is about where the good things end. The tempura was so-so and the teriyaki was lacking flavor but it was cooked nicely. The nigiri was ok but the Futomaki was a sugar bomb! If you made this roll for a 4 yr old it might pass but for adults don&#39;t triple layer the fake pink sweetener!! People like this place because it&#39;s cheap and more authentic than other places they&#39;ve been to. Cheap yes, more authentic...in some aspects. Since I don&#39;t live that close I can&#39;t say I&#39;d go back... YMMV."

It was a delightful meal with top notch entrees and appetizers.  I&#39;ll go with 4.5 stars but there was still a significant snafu.  Our appetizers (delectable pork cheeks and yakitori chicken skewers) ended up coming out last, and due to tardiness, we actually cancelled one of them (the seafood pancakes).  They were quite busy and popular for dinner (I&#39;m not surprised given their quality and reasonable prices) and that probably contributed to the order confusion and our 2 hour dinner here (it was a nice 2 hours though).  Their beef teriyaki bento box is very generous and probably the best valued bento box we have ever had for $25.  Amongst our dishes on this evening were:

- pork cheeks appetizer, $6
- yakitori chocken skewers (2 for $4)
- chicken teriyaki bento box, $22
- beef teriyaki bento boxes, $25 each
- chirashi, $21
- tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet), $17
- lychee ice cream

Server was very apologetic of the appetizers snafu and waived the otherwise mandatory group 18% gratuity, as well as offered lychee ice cream for the entire table.  We shall return!"

This place still ranks as a great experience with awesome food choices and a friendly casual atmosphere. We ordered ramen and a few side dishes (gyoza, edamame, and one other I&#39;ve forgotten since we went a few months ago) and as usual the food was great. But what really stood out was the service. You always get more than one person tending to your needs. Anyone who walked by the table makes sure we were happy and didn&#39;t need anything.

My grandfather loves to chow down on noodles.  2.  I was trying to keep my carb count low and get some tasty protein into my system, so I figured an Izakaya with skewers would fit the bill well.

We drove up to the little strip mall, and headed in.  On the right some more traditional tatami mat set ups where you take your shoes off to sit on the elevated ground and eat.  Fun!  The left was more like a standard restaurant.  Decor isn&#39;t anything too interesting or crazy.  

So first off, they don&#39;t serve skewers at lunch.  Doh!  Guess I&#39;ll have to settle in for some chirashi and try to control myself with the rice. Yeah right.  I order the ramen for grandpa.

Chirashi:  Tasty and decent portion size.  Nothing stood out as terrible and nothing stood out as phenomenal.

Ramen:  I had a bit of grandpa&#39;s leftover ramen he couldn&#39;t finish just to try the noodles and broth.  Pretty tasty, and again, nothing out of this world.

Service was quite friendly and fairly quick to requests (water, salad, etc.) but given it was prime lunch hour, we felt like we were waiting awhile for food.  Plenty of Japanese and Korean customers who ordered grilled mackerel, curries, etc.  so perhaps I just got the wrong food...?  

Verdict:  I&#39;d try it again for lunch, but really was more interested in the skewers.  Guess I may have to try it at dinner sometime?  We&#39;ll see..."

We came at 5 on Saturday ,and there were only a few other diners, but by the time we left around 6, the place was pretty packed.
Our waitress was sweet, but not very helpful when we asked her for favorites/suggestions. There were a few specials we wanted to try but they were not available so that was disappointing.

We ordered the following:
pork cheek - tasty, simple and served with a squeeze of lemon
chicken gizzard/cartilage/skin/tail skewers- very good. especially liked the tail
tuna collar- not sure if this was an off night, but this was almost deep fried. would not order this again
takoyaki- not the best takoyaki but okay for chicago
okinomoyaki- pretty good but could use more bonito flakes on top
braised pork (on appetizer section...I think it was called ben kakuni)- this was delicous! so flavorful and tender. we could eat 3 more bowls of this
Sapporo- they have this on draught and it&#39;s very good

We will be back to try the ramen and have more of that delicious braised pork."

So there&#39;s no complimentary miso soup or salad like at the Korean-owned ones that we usually go to, but at least the food is high quality and legit.

Here&#39;s what we ordered:

A large house hot sake for only $6. I don&#39;t know what it is, but hot sake with sushi is like &#34;peas and carrots&#34;, Forest and Jenny, needle and thread. They just go together!

Crazy Roll: you are getting what you pay for! This roll is BIG. Some places either put way too much rice, or mayo, or something that makes you full faster. I don&#39;t like those &#34;filler&#34; places...this roll had huge chunks of tuna, salmon, and I forgot what other fish was in there. I loved the way the crab meat was flavored. And then the creamy avocado pieces were the best complementary touch.

Ton Toro: Wow, this was melt in your mouth yet with just the right amount of chewiness. I don&#39;t normally order pork cheek, but it just sounded good to me for some reason. I&#39;m SO Glad we ordered it, because it was SO delicious! Smokey, salty, savory...Triple S!

Spicy tuna roll: it&#39;s your basic spicy tuna roll, but you can tell that it&#39;s made with love. Just the right amount of sauce, and just the right amount of cucumber in each section."

We sat at the bar, had a lovely time and I must say that we got excellent, fabulous service the entire time we dined there. Our drinks were well attended to and who I imagine is either the manager or owner was a very nice &amp; attentive lady.

They are known for having legit ramen though I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite as good as Ramen Misoya or the shop at Mitsuwa. The good thing about this hole in the wall restaurant is they have a wide variety of items with some more unique splendors to taste. It&#39;s kind of like getting Japanese tapas because of course you can get a big bowl of ramen or an array of sushi...but it&#39;s more fun to try a bunch of the smaller dish items. 

By recommendation of my Japanese best friend, we had their Okonomoyaki which is a mish mosh of various meats in a pancake format which made sound disgusto, but I promise you it&#39;s delicioso. I love that they cut it up in triangle slices pizza-style which made it much easier for us to share &amp; eat. 

The beef tataki was to die for. Perfectly cooked with yummy sauce covering it. We had various meat skewers that were all good, a tofu dish, a few other items. Honestly it was all tasty and I was deeply enthralled in conversation so it&#39;s all blending together in my memory.

We drank a bunch of Sapporos with all these yummy food and I was well impressed. It wasn&#39;t too badly priced either! Yep, I&#39;ll be back Izakaya Sankyu!"

By the time i walked in and saw a lot of Japanese businessmen/ women hang out, I know that this place must be awesome! I was really impressed with a big selection/ varieties they have on their menu from the typical sushi, sashimi, to ramen, bbq skewers, rice/ udon entrees, shabu shabu, and all the bento boxes. 

Food have great favors. I wish they perfect their execution a little more. I&#39;m not sure whether this was because the place was a little busy that night.

from what we had: 
whole fish grill: bento box: I LOVE their bento box. The portion is generous and great varieties: sashimi (a lot of pieces), fried croquette (lots of varieties), cold appetizers e.g. fish ball and etc, tempura, and the main fish item. It was $25 coming with rice, soup, and ice cream. It was definitely our favorite 

tonkotsu ramen: it had good flavor but you can&#39;t compare it the specialized ramen shop like misoya. the weird part was the pork and the boiled egg was a little cold. They were almost pre-made and have the broth over once someone ordered it. You can really feel it with the egg 

skewer: chicken gizzard, tail, skin. we have never had any of this part before. we just want to try things we have never seen. It was not that good actually. Either they have bbq it longer or use the better quality meat.. 

takoyaki: good flavor but some pieces were a little cold in the middle. so, that was a bummer. 

again, i will definitely go back there again especially week nights when they are not too busy. i was so impressed with their selection. It reminded me so much of Japan!"

And no there&#39;s no dairy cream, to get to that level takes many hours of skimming and boiling pork bones which I do not intend to do at home. (I recommend checking out the youtube video: Japanology, The Most Delicious Ramen Noodles (2011)  to really appreciate ramen).

Ramen, a simple dish, is not so simple. I can taste the richness of the broth. Noodles have a wonderful chewy texture, very good and similar to High Five in the West Loop. Broth is clean, mild and slightly sweet from the pork. The only thing I have to complain about is the egg is hardboiled, not softboiled, and temp is not as hot as I would like. The red ginger they put is a bit odd, but goes well with the bamboo shoots and pork slice. Other than that, it is a good traditional bowl and ranks in my top 3 ramen joints in the Chicagoland area. Since  the broths are so different, it&#39;s hard to say, but the ramen noodles alone, #1.

My server was very nice. She brought the whiteboard of specials so I can see what else to get. There was a cool selection of items I hope to try next time. Also, along the walls, you get to sit on the floor Japanese style for a more authentic experience."

We made reservations for 4: hubby, me and the boys on this Saturday night of Valentine&#39;s Day. There were lots of reserved tables already. It reminded me of Renga Tei (my other fav Japanese restaurant) but a bit roomier. 
 There were quite a few flat screen TVs around the restaurant. It almost felt like a bar. Some playing japanese news and others had food network and sports I think all on mute.

Food was great. We got 2 orders pork cheeks (bc all 4 of us liked it so much; haven&#39;t had this here in Chicago yet so this was a treat! last time we got it was at a Korean bbq place in LA), beef tataki (nice and tender, chicken skewers (skin, gizzards, and cartilage. I liked the skin the best), beef tongue (hubby really enjoyed this, it was tender and flavorful), takoyaki (are these always this big? very good though. Kids tried it for first time and my 2 year old liked it a lot.), spicy tuna roll (a bit fishy but I liked that it had lots of rice and lots of tuna bc usually spicy tuna roll is teeny) and we finished off with a bowl of tonkotsu ramen and a bowl of miso ramen. I think that was just the right amount of food for us whilst not getting overstuffed.

Hubby liked the tonkotsu broth better. It was the first time ever I&#39;ve seen him slurp down all the soup that was left. He said the tonkotsu ramen was the best he&#39;s had. I personally liked the miso broth better and that is 100% the case for all Japanese ramen I have tried. At this restaurant I did like the miso better but it was quite salty! This also had a bit of a kick so it was really spicy miso ramen. The noodles were perfectly chewy and soft at the same time. I loved the bamboo on top but was not a huge fan of the bean sprout topping (more a personal dislike) nor the slice of pork. It wasn&#39;t fatty enough ha! But overall I slurped it all up sans the broth mainly due to the saltiness.

We will come back to try the other stuff and more ramen though!"

Come here for a neat Japanese Izakaya experience! Their menu had a lot of variety of Japanese small plates and entrees. I had the Tonkotsu ramen and my husband had the miso ramen. We split an appetizer of Okonomiyaki. All three dishes were very tasty! The waitstaff were very friendly! Would love to come back here when we are in town again and try more things!! I highly recommend you check this place out!!

I see items here that I rarely ever see anywhere else (if at all). The best part about this place is it&#39;s perfect for meeting up with friends after work to relax over light drinks and food.

An izakaya is kind of like Japan&#39;s answer to the sports bar (a place to go have drinks and enjoy food intentionally prepared to be enjoyed with drinks) - the menu is extensive and in addition to the standard sushi and bento fare, there are several other sections of appetizers and small plate options to choose from.

You could easily come here to satisfy that sushi or ramen craving with their authentic dishes for such fare, but it&#39;s just as easy to be a little daring and try all of the authentic Japanese dishes (fried, steamed, battered, in broth, take your pick) that you probably won&#39;t find many places outside of Japan."

This is what I imagine any good mom &amp; pop place in Japan to taste like. You walk in this place, and 95% of the clientele look to be Japanese, so I take that to mean that this food must be on par with some of the great food you can find in Japan. 

Go to dishes for my wife and I are:
- Tonkatsu Ramen - Best ramen we&#39;ve ever had.. sooo much flavor!
- Any sushi - The sushi i&#39;ve had here is some of the best. The fish is tasteful and fresh, and the rice is cooked PERFECTLY!
- Buta Kaku-Ni - If you don&#39;t know what this is, and you are a fan of tender, delicious meat.. then do yourself a big favor and give Buta Kaku-Ni a shot. It&#39;s the most tender, marinated, pull apart, steamy/juicy beef you&#39;ve EVER had!!!!! I like to put some into my Tonkatsu Ramen... SOOOO GOOD!"

Some people really think they know what they are doing with this style and eventually they fall flat on their faces.  Let me tell you something - nobody at Izakaya Sankyu falls flat on their face.

When people ask me what this style of food is without fail I eventually wind up simplifying it to this &#34;think of it as Japanese Tapas&#34;, which to some respects is correct in that you will find that smaller plates of deliciousness are delivered to your table, it&#39;s also an abomination, because Izakaya is so much better than tapas.  (Sorry, Tapas.)

All of the standards are here, and I won&#39;t go into the futile attempt to spell it.  It tastes great and there will be little question left in your mind after you eat here about the superiority of Izakaya to satiate that urge for that unique combination of street style food, booze and great company.

Amazing service, selection and quality of food.  Honestly, I can&#39;t wait to come back."

tonkatsu ramen ($8.25) - 4.5 stars. Light &amp; smooth broth, less salty than Santouka&#39;s with thicker noodles. The two pork slices were sliced thick and incredibly tender &amp; flavorful.

sashimi platter ($19.99) - 4.5 stars. Good variety, beautiful presentation.

beef tataki ($9.95) - 4 stars. Good, but not a repeat buy for me because I&#39;d want to try something else from their menu.

We were not disappointed. We left with full bellies and stuffed faces lol! For 5 people, we ordered 4 diff rolls of sushi, beef teriyaki/tempura combo, shoyu ramen, tonkatsu ramen, and a small sashimi platter. Everything was delish!! 

The sashimi and sushi were good but didn&#39;t really wow me. They were fresh with simple flavors and huge servings and reasonably priced. My brother loved the crazy and rainbow rolls. My husband loved the shrimp tempura and philly rolls.

The ramen&#39;s phenomenal! The broth was excellent - rich but not too salty, unlike Ramen Misoya. The pork&#39;s tender and tasty but I think I prefer Misoya&#39;s pork over Sankyu. The noodles are the right thickness and texture. I think the toppings are adequate as well. The ratio of broth to noodles to toppings is well balanced. I absolutely love it!

I didn&#39;t care for the teriyaki or tempura. I&#39;ve had better in Renga tei.

As for desserts, we had the Japanese jelly mix with ice cream, coffee with red bean paste and ice cream, and plain green tea ice cream. My favorite was the coffee with red bean and ice cream. It was different and I haven&#39;t had anything like that before so I liked it. :)

Overall a winner for me. We will definitely be back!!!"

FOOD:
Sashimi Platter: it was ok, good portion for 2 people to share

Beef Teriyaki: it was ok, I&#39;ve had better..the teriyaki sauce was not saucey, but rather watery like soy sauce was poured on it or something...

Japanese Ramyun: ppl claim that the ramyun here is good, but I just thought it was ok when I tried it last time with my friends...maybe I&#39;m just not a fan of Japanese ramyun..

CUSTOMER SERVICE: the waitresses were nice, but busy so they didn&#39;t help me right away when I stepped in.. I waited about 10 minutes before they saw me and helped me...

When you walk in, the restaurant is split into two sections: a larger area with regular tables on the left, and a traditional Japanese seating on the right (i.e. shoes off, sitting at low tables on cushions on the ground).  As I love sitting cross-legged while eating anyways, we moved to the right to  be seated.

We had the unagi roll, an order of tayoyaki, seaweed salad, and the tonkatsu ramen everyone is always raving about.  

Unagi roll - decent portion for the price, had a bit more rice than I normally prefer.  

Seaweed salad - delicious with cucumber, actual flat kelp, and a wonderful dressing.

Tayoyaki - this is a common street food in Japan; essentially doughy balls filled with octopus.  I really enjoyed the flavored, however my dining mate thought the doughy texture was a little odd (then again she doesn&#39;t like doughy-textured anything, so maybe there&#39;s a bias there).

Tonkatsu ramen - wonderful, DELICIOUS broth.  Creamy and rich and super flavorful.  The ramen noodles themselves were thick and chewy and just the right texture.  Came with a small amount of toppings (half an egg, a little bit of pork, some veggies), but it really was all about the broth and the noodles (which it rightly should be in a good bowl of ramen).

Overall - I will definitely be back to Izakaya Sankyu for more ramen and to try some of their other goodies."

The food is great. They have an extensive menu and there are also daily specials that they write on a whiteboard and bring to you. I recommend the pork cheeks, beef tongue, and pork belly. I know they all sound gross, but if you can allow yourself to be a little adventurous, I think it&#39;ll be worth it! They also have different drink choices.

The sushi rolls are fresh and there&#39;s plenty of varieties. The spider is a huge roll at a great price! And the dragon is so yummy!

I was craving ramen but wanted a nicer sit down place than Santouka or Misoya. We arrived at exactly 5:00 when they opened and were ushered into an empty restaurant. 

Here&#39;s what we ordered:
1. Buta kakuni: I am an unabashed fan of anything pork belly and the buta kakuni was delicate and fell apart beneath your chopsticks. The soy marinade was spot on and not overwhelmingly sweet. A winner!
2. Beef kalbi: The soy marinade was very similar to the one used in the buta kakuni, but for some reason I felt that there must have been some alcohol/sake mixed in that wasn&#39;t fully cooked off. It was tasty nontheless - but the fact that we got 4 small pieces of kalbi for $8 and the lingering alcohol taste made us slightly miffed.
3. Yakitori: The chicken was tender and juicy, and the char was a great touch. 
4. Vegetable Tempura: The vegetables were fresh and the tempura light and crispy. We were both impressed by how light the batter was, which made it seem like we were actually eating vegetables. 
5. Tonkotsu Ramen: The broth did not have very much depth or body to it. Nevertheless, the pork belly was great (not too fatty) and the noodles thick and springy!

Overall, we were pleased with our experience. While none of the dishes were the best things that we had ever tasted, they were still strong dishes in themselves. That said, the only thing that was lacking in our experience was with the service. I was happy to see that they were fully packed on a Saturday night, but with only 3 servers it was definitely a scramble and there were points where we were forgotten.

Even so, we will definitely be back for more when we are out in the burbs!"

Very friendly service as usual. Yesterday, we decided to stop by for a bite and we&#39;re disappointed. The food was delicious, as always, but we got the feeling that the workers were rushing us into leaving on more than one instance. We were not being obnoxious or rude at all whatsoever. Our drinks didn&#39;t get refilled until one of the older ladies came by and asked if we were done(in a semi-rude way). We kept ordering food as usual so I don&#39;t see what the problem was. Our waitress took forever to come back and take our second order. A while later, after we were completely finished, one of the older lady just drops by with the check and leaves.

I&#39;m not sure what they said, but it was friendly and warm. We were given the option to sit at a table or seated on pillows on the floor. There were three televisions mounted high on the walls - two showed Japanese shows and the third was in English. The menus were written first in Japanese and second in English. The server brought out a large white board with 20-30 specials written on it. I wanted to try sooo many things!

I got the ramen because Yelpers said it was the best. I got it and was not really a fan. Maybe it&#39;s the best, but yeah. I just think that ramen isn&#39;t for me. I also got spring rolls and some fried meat balls. The spring rolls were yummy but the meatballs were just okay. And I drank a whole bottle of saki by myself which usually makes everything even better. SO, I don&#39;t think those things suited my palette.

I think that I should have had the sushi rolls instead. I know that I like sushi. I chose to be adventurous which turned out to hurt this review. I think that M liked her food okay, but her taste-buds were compromised (she was sick and things tasted differently to her).

Service: it was kindda slow at the beginning and then we realized they have a bell right on the wall next to us to get their attention HA! From there everything went smooth. A Japanese lady was serving us and give us insights on what we&#39;re having. A plus!

Food: We order bunch of food ranging from their ramen-sushi-tapas like-apps. I&#39;d skip their sushi, it&#39;s mediocre IMO. Prolly just a bad nite but we had the spider roll and it didn&#39;t impress us. Ramen was also same, it was miso ramen we had.

With that being said I will not take points off for this because they are Americanized Japanese food. The ramen on the other hand I enjoyed very much. Dare I say better than the one at Mitsuwa. It wasn&#39;t too salty like the other. Broth was mellower noodles were the perfect chew the pork sluices we delicious.

Its kind of hard to find because the sign on the street says Sankyu Sushi instead of its real name. Knowing a little bit about Japanese food culture, this place is suppose to be an izakaya which is basically the Japanese equivalent of a tgi fridays: a casual place where people get together after work for a few drinks and some snacks. 

This specific place is pretty popular for tonkotsu ramen (noodles in a deep rich pork broth and toppings) so thats exactly what I got:

Tonkotsu Ramen: It actually lives up to the hype! The best broth I&#39;ve ever tasted in a bowl of Ramen. Deep, rich, simmered to the point where the calcium and marrow has leeched out of the bones into the soup making it almost milky. Absolutely wonderful.  Compared to Santouka Ramen which makes the same dish, the noodles were a little chewier and thicker but Santouka&#39;s Toppings are better and more appealing to the eyes. This place tops its noodles with bamboo shoots, about 3 small slices of pork belly, some bean sprouts, pickled ginger, and half a hard boiled egg. (7.25)

I would say if you love your Japanese ramen topped delicious high quality goodies and pork go to Santouka at the Mitsuwa Market, but if you believe that noodle quality and depth of flavor in the soup makes a good ramen then this is your place. 

The meal also came with a crappy looking shredded lettuce salad which I kind of ignored and ended with 3 tiny fruit jello shots which was nice. 

If you want something close to an authentic Japanese experience, check this place out! Just keep in mind it has weird hours (Closed on Wednesdays?)

Try the Ramen!"

Come here for non Americanized, real deal Japanese cuisine. There is even floor seating if you want the full dining experience. If you aren&#39;t familiar with Japanese food, don&#39;t let the extensive menu scare you. There are lots of great items to choose from so ask questions if you aren&#39;t sure about anything. Sankyu has various entree and sushi platter selections, but a big draw for me are all of the small plate items. If you didn&#39;t want to commit to a single dish, you can get a few smaller choices instead. Such choices include typical appetizers like gyoza and fried tofu to meat skewers and chazuke. Entrees are stellar as well. Some of my favorites include tekka don and tonkatsu. Each comes with some sort of side like miso soup and pickled veggies. Sushi rolls are all good. Various beer and sake is also available. Different sake sizes can either serve one person or a group of people. There is truly so much to enjoy at Sankyu and I&#39;ve never been disappointed."

Forget all the fusion dumps, all the lounges, and whatever other trance-music blasting sushi joints you might have encountered in the city. This is tasty Japanese food without all the unnecessary pretense.

They offer a nice selection of a variety of dishes ranging from ramen, udon, sushi to bento boxes. You can even request off-the-menu dishes such as onigiri/yaki onigiri which for me is a must-have add-on to any entree. And Sankyu has to be one of the few places where you can find a decent okonomiyaki, as well as other izakaya-like dishes such as takoyaki.

Definitely a hidden treasure in Mount Prospect. I feel sorry for all the saps that head over to Sushi Station instead of this place, but glad that they don&#39;t know about it to be honest!"

To begin with Mount Prospect has a high concentration of Japanese residents.   All we heard being spoken here was Japanese and the most excellent food is as Japanese as you can get as well.  

If we were to show our photos to friends or family in Japan and tell them that they were taken in Japan, they would believe it naturally.   We tried about 10 different items from the menu and enjoy everything.   This is one of the easiest 5 star reviews I&#39;ve even put on Yelp."

I guess we&#39;ve gotten so used to Japanese restaurants that serve a mostly non-Japanese clientele, that walking into Sankyu was frankly a bit of a culture shock.  But it turns out, a really really good culture shock, which we enjoyed tremendously. 

When you first walk in, you&#39;ll notice right away the casual nature of the place, and that everything is primarily written in Japanese (with English as the second language). We thought that was very cool. Along with regular tables, there are also booths where you can kick off your shoes and sit on little pillows, in the traditional style.  Also very cool, and will try that next time.

While the service was prompt and fast, it was also casual. There wasn&#39;t any of the false obsequious stuff you sometimes get from servers. These gals were friendly but busy, moving about the tables in a cooperative fashion. We had three different people serving us throughout the meal.  It was neat and efficient.

Our Japan-immersion experience was also heightened by being seated next to a large and loud table of Japanese men (only speaking Japanese), who had apparently gathered for some sort of happy reunion. We thought it was a lot of fun to be in the middle of all that laughing and shouting.  Anyone who says that Japanese people are restrained, hasn&#39;t seen them comfortable and in their own element.

The food was good, filling and surprisingly inexpensive, compared to most restaurants, and especially other Japanese sushi places.  I was frankly shocked when we received the bill, and it was sub-$40 for 3 people.  The ramen was outstanding and flavorful, as was the crisp tempura and chicken katsu.  No refills on soda, but a full range of cool Japanese beers and drinks. 

They also gave us a complementary fried fish cakes appetizer, mung bean salads and a miso soup to match another we&#39;d ordered.  Very welcoming!

This really isn&#39;t a sushi place. Their maki rolls were fine, but not great. It felt more like the Japanese version of a neighborhood tavern. Casual, but with tasty basic vittles catering to Japanese tastes.

And that&#39;s the beauty of this place. It&#39;s an authentic Japanese tavern, that isn&#39;t trying hard to be hip or something it&#39;s not.  And last time I checked that, in itself, is pretty hip."

The calpico sour is delicious and everything we ordered tasted very fresh.  Anything deep fried here is tasty, the tonkatsu, tempura, soft shell crab, they even have takoyaki and okonomiyaki! 

This restaurant is very authentic, the waitresses and the cooks were japanese, so were the other customers.  I love the friendly atmosphere of this place.  Ironically, the first time I dined here with my boyfriend was after Acen.  We wanted some homestyle Japanese food and my friend recommended this place.  I&#39;m so glad we came!  It was a nice break from the anime mayhem that is Acen ;)

The interior decor is adorable, like other reviews have said you actually feel like you&#39;re in Japan!  The entrance is like... a restaurant inside of a restaurant.  You&#39;ll get it when you go.

Unsuspecting, I got lucky. Strangely enough, it was all because of Yelp. 

Four stars really means something in Austin, my hometown. But in Chicago&#39;s suburbs, its clout is slightly diluted. Tonight, the four-star rating redeemed itself with my visit to Izakaya Sankyu.

Ingredients-wise, they hit a number of my favorites: bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, boiled egg, and pork. Appearance-wise: it looked pretty similar to Tonkotsu I&#39;ve tried elsewhere. Flavor-wise? The taste was fine, but I tend to prefer a slightly denser broth. Not thick like a stew, but with a little bit more volume and weight, where this particular broth came on the lighter side. The noodles were fine, but I was a bit disappointed with the the quality and preparation of the pork. It&#39;s certainly a delight when you get well seasoned, or very tender pork. Given it&#39;s nature as a quick-serve street food, I&#39;m okay with not having that all the time. It&#39;s a different thing when the pork comes in particularly dry. I&#39;m not too fond of that.

It&#39;s definitely nice to know that there&#39;s another solid place to grab ramen from in the area, but it&#39;s likely not one I&#39;ll be making frequent or special trips for.

I also tried their gyoza which was pretty tasty. 

The restaurant itself had a decent amount of space, and the staff was pretty friendly when I was there.

If I get a chance, I would like to sample many of the items on their menu, and I suspect that my rating would be a 4-star rating in that case."

I guess they changed the name to appeal to a more mainstream American demographic.

Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I&#39;m sure their sushi is pretty good.  But personally I don&#39;t like to mix Izakaya (tapas-style) food with sushi.  I think there is a time for sushi and a time for tapas.  Good rule of thumb: &#34;is it good with beer?&#34;

Service:  Good service, no complaints.  Got lots of good suggestions for dishes

Ambiance:  I&#39;m a sucker for simple, salarymen ambiance.  This was exactly what I was hoping for

Food:

So I&#34;m a bit of a ramen junkie, and I&#39;m very fortunate to have befriended Jonathan T., the resident Chicagoland ramen guru.  He recommended this place and said it&#39;s the best in Chicagoland.  Well he&#39;s right.  IT&#39;S THE BEST RAMEN.   

Granted, this is no Ippudo; this is no Daikokuya, nor is this a Katana-ya.  This is ramen in the Midwest.  Had the tech bubble never burst, maybe we&#39;d have more Japanese people in or near Chicago.   But with their economy the way that it is, I think they couldn&#39;t care less about our ramen woes in Chicago.

All in all we ordered: Buta kakuni, tontoro, teba, and grilled beef tongue.

The buta kakuni (braised pork) was amazing.  Fork tender, savory and sweet.  We&#39;d come back just for this dish.  You should definitely order this.

The tontoro was good, but the texture was a little tough; but that&#39;s normal for cheek.  This dish was not mind blowingly good though.

The teba was seasoned Buffalo style, but cooked in a Japanese manner.  Very crisp and light, airy breading.  But it tasted too familiar, my mistake for ordering it.  It wasn&#39;t bad by any means; but I drove a ways to get out here so I wasn&#39;t in the mood for something American tasting.

Value: 

4 dishes and 1 large order of warm sake later the damage came out to less than 50 bucks.  Me and my lovely dining companion were both really, really full and had some leftovers to take home to our stoner friend.  

Overall: 

If you like ramen, next time instead of eating at Mitsuwa&#39;s food court; try this place.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll regret it.  Plus there are so many other great dishes you can try and at a fantastic price.  This and Kuruyama are my favorite two Japanese Izakayas in Chicagoland.  Thank God, we have at least this y&#39;know."

FOOD: Very decent. The menu is extensive, but they were out of the three items I was hoping to try - buta/pork kakuni, grilled iwashi/sardines and gindara! But I was happy to find some authentic dishes on the today&#39;s special menu, like cream crab croquette, maguro/tuna tataki and tofu shira-ae. (Note: it&#39;s written on a chalkboard in Japanese.) They have the standard izakaya dishes/appetizers, noodles (udon, soba, chuka-soba, ramen), sushi and rice plates. For the ramen fans, their pork ramen (tonkotsu) is supposed to be a popular dish...and you will hear people loudly SLURP here! Oh, and they have &#34;okonomiyaki&#34; - something I&#39;m sure Mindy W would appreciate.

Out of the five items we ordered, we really enjoyed the &#34;pork/buta kimchi.&#34; It was spicy, buttery and very tasty. The shira-ae and grilled kama were both decent, and so was the sushi. Not the best, but passable, and I liked the rice. I&#39;m sure with more sake, we would&#39;ve enjoyed our meal a lot more. 

AMBIANCE: Very Japanese. You can sit on the floor zashiki-style or at the table. You can watch the NHK broadcast on TV or read free magazines available at the entrance. There&#39;s also a big karaoke room (with the &#34;on-demand&#34; internet karaoke system) that can accommodate up to 30 guests. 

SERVICE: Not the friendliest, but careful and attentive. 

PRICES: You definitely get a good amount of food for what you pay.

The food itself was wonderful, and the portions were larger than I was expecting.  The buta kimchi was a classic dish done well (even if you&#39;ll find better kimchi in a good Korean restaurant), the pork in sugary soy sauce was sweet and savory, the cheese tempura was weird but worth a try, the spider roll was enormous and the kake soba warmed my bones on a particularly cold day.

If you have Japanese friends craving a taste of home, take them here.  It&#39;ll remind them of stories their parents told them about izakayas in Showa-era Tokyo."

I moved to the Chicago burbs from Atlanta back in &#39;08 and haven&#39;t been able to find a Japanese restaurant that rivaled my favorite in Atlanta until now.  Most restaurants that I have found are primarily about sushi, while Japanese cuisine is an after thought.  So much of Japanese cuisine is delicious that it&#39;s a unfortunate that it isn&#39;t better represented in restaurants.  But that&#39;s neither here nor there, so I&#39;ll move on to the review!

Isakaya Sankyu is a great balance of quality food and reasonable prices (with one exception that I&#39;ll get to later).  My wife and I went for lunch on Saturday.  The place was practically empty.  With not many people to wait on, we got some great service.  They started with some very good complimentary hot green tea.  Our cups were never less than half full before they would come back and top them off.  I ordered the tonkatsu ramen, which was very good.  It was $7 and change, and I was told I could get the ramen set for only $1 more, which included a choice of crunchy gyoza or pork shumai.  I went with the gyoza and they were delicious (not the frozen out of the bag variety).  I also went with a Rock and Roll maki (hamachi and unagi).  For only $5.50, I felt like I was stealing from them.  I thought that they might make the roll smaller, since it was so inexpensive.  Boy was I wrong!  The maki was cut into 8 pieces with a good amount of fish and eel in there.  That made up for the $4.50 single piece of unagi nigiri that my wife had ordered.  The nigiri are the only part of the menu that seem expensive to me.  Everything else is reasonable to cheap in price.  That being said, she really enjoyed that piece of eel.  It looked very good and was a decent sized piece of eel.  She also ordered the katsu don (her favorite) and the shrimp tempura appetizer.  I tried a little of both (I often eat off of her plate) and they were both very good.

Every aspect of the meal was very good and for a little more than $30 we had quite the feast.  With Mitsuwa just a mile away, we now have at our disposal a nice Japanese-themed outing in the suburbs."

(please read all the previous accolades) The SERVICE was flooded by the packed place and overwhelmed and the place was totally understaffed for a weekend night. I counted two (2) waitresses and two (2) bus people. Only, one shy mousy waitress spoke Japanese and the Entire counter/kitchen chef crew of two (2) ONLY Spoke Japanese, the rest of the help only spoke Spanish. There was a HUGE communication gap and we waited for 2 hours for our food after 3 reminders to the waitress who in turn went to tell the chefs/cooks. We were a party of three sitting on the sushi bar and watched and overheard every fight and miscommunication during our 2 hour wait. Our waitress who spoke a few words had quite a few rows with the chefs, but it did nothing to get out food out any faster.
I finally took my food home ala doggie bag when the main course finally came cause we just couldn&#39;t eat after waiting so long after a two hour long soup and appetizer course, we just lost our appetite to have the main course. We lodged a complaint IN JAPANESE to the chef, but not so much as an acknowledgment. much less any care for any apology for a meal and night out ruined. 
in short
price- reasonable
taste- exceptional
service- somewhat below average (wait help)
service, care and concern for your pleasant time Negative ZERO (chef/owner)

so if you are into an eccentric zealot chef who s-l-o-w-l-y presents you food at his convenience, but tastes pretty decent for the price, this is the place for you.  
If you want just regular service and good japanese food and want to actually eat when you are hungry, go elsewhere.
If you have all the time in the world and have a lot to talk about (or a fully charged smartphone or a long book to read, then bring a snack and come here to wait on your food, which at the end of the day, still does taste decent.
It is also VERY HIGHLY recommended that you speak japanese or they will probably get the order wrong. We watched 3 orders go horribly wrong or not placed at all which created people walking out or making complaints."

The sushi is traditional as well without crazy ornaments. The sashimi is very fresh as well. 

You can find all sorts of food like ramen, teriyaki, yakisoba, and many other tradtional Japanese foods. The food is very comforting.

I recommend the tonkotsu ramen. It&#39;s a very rich broth but not too salty either. There is a generous helping of noodles and is topped with assorted vegetables and slices of pork. The yakisoba is also delicious with many different vegetables and seasonings. The portion is HUGE for only around $13.

While I probably prefer the spicy miso vs. tonkatsu, the ramen was indeed delicious-just the thing as I was feeling a bit under the weather after the trip from Phoenix.

I was told the offending substance would be removed from the plate and the sushi chef was the one to blame for it.  &#34;They just don&#39;t do that here.&#34;  Um, so I can&#39;t eat sashimi mackerel because it&#39;s pickled, and you can&#39;t even just sub another fish on there?  Seriously?  Nope.  The chef doesn&#39;t allow it.  You pay full price.  So sorry.  
2. I asked for plain fish. Nothing on it.  No sesame seeds, no rice vinegar, nothing.  Lemon aaaaaall over it.  I&#39;m sensitive to lemon but I decided that THIS would be the night I&#39;d see how my system would do with lemon. ($21 for the sashimi dinner.  I wasn&#39;t going to try and send it back, based on the reactions I was receiving, or waste the money.)  Btw, I survived the lemon experiment. 
3.  The very first girl we talked to (2 out of 3 spoke excellent English), said she thought I could sub steamed rice for sushi rice in the rolls, but she wasn&#39;t entirely sure.  I didn&#39;t pursue that because I wanted to see how fresh their fish was. This same girl came back at the end of the meal and asked how the meal was. I kept saying it was &#34;ok.&#34;  She asked what was wrong and I explained #1 above.  &#34;I can&#39;t eat here again.&#34;  Her answer? &#34;Oh, that&#39;s just her!  That&#39;s not right.&#34;  And, a comment possibly about the negative waitress being a manager?  I have no idea what that was about but, hello (!), everyone at least be on the same page!  She was disappointed. Weeeeeell, I hate to throw common sense into the equation.....
My final note is about atmosphere. We sat very close to some sort of machine that looked like it might be a behemoth air filtering machine.  Huge tube from the ceiling, 3&#39; tall unit with 2 large tubes coming out of the top, one of which was aimed in our direction.  I kept smelling cigarette smoke.  I thought maybe the flow of air in the restaurant was dragging the smoker&#39;s air toward our table.  (It was a stretch, but maybe.)  I actually think it was this machine that was pumping the cigarette smoke in.  After my issue with the food, cigarette smoke was a definite NO.  Wth is with this place?
In short, I was looking for a sushi place close to home and this was NOT it. Go to the restaurant in Arlington Heights on Algonquin.  Their food is great, the staff is awesome, and in 3 visits, they&#39;ve worked with me every time.  Sankyu is not the place for me.  Huge disappointment considering how highly rated they are."

But, the place really kinda sucks service wise. There is no hiding behind the language barrier here, these people truly don&#39;t give a shit whether you&#39;re happy or not.
The sushi chef is more than non-engaging, he is just downright anti social.
Prepare for the waitress to pretend she doesn&#39;t know you exist even when she&#39;s literally staring right at you.
The food is great, but if I want to have a meal and get totally shit on I will just stay home. Eat here a few times, because the grub is pretty tasty. Watch out for the elitist, sour, totally assy ass people who own and operate this joint...See for yourself if the taste is worth the disregard."

I&#39;d give it five stars if you are Japanese and want an traditional restaurant with the true flavors of Japan.  Three stars if you are gaijin like me and prefer the sharper, less earthy flavors of  Americanized Japanese food.  

The ramen noodles are even better than Santouka&#39;s, though I like the broth better there."

Sankyu is an izakaya that specializes in small plates designed to complement the Japanese love affair with drinking sake and beer. 

Sankyu brings me back to my days in LA.

It&#39;s located in a strip mall. 
It serves respectable sushi.

I came with a co-worker on a week night after work. We ordered:

Grilled Chicken Wings with lemon
Deep Fried Buffalo Style Wings 
Hamachi
Tuna
Salmon
Halibut
Spicy Tuna

All the fish was very fresh and the rice to fish ratio in every nigiri piece was perfect. 

Wings with sushi??? Don&#39;t hate.

The wings should be illegal. They taste so yummy they should be classified as a controlled substance. 

If this spot was near me, then I would have their number on speed dial or demand an i-Phone take-out app.

Very good. Will be back."

I have been to Sankyu several times in the past and have always enjoyed myself, despite the ridiculous bill that always results. I wanted to have a fresh visit before I submitted my review and was hoping to submit a five star review. Alas, it was not meant to be this time but maybe in the future. Below is my story.

We arrived at dinner time on a Sunday evening, hungry for some tapas as well as the ramen that everyone raves about. There were three waitresses but the restaurant was already about half filled and busy. The menu is long so they either purposely gave us a lot of time to look it over or they were just too busy. No problem, I can understand a little wait. We ordered a pitcher of Sapporo to start and also submitted all four of our dinner choices as well. We ordered the tonkatsu ramen, eel tempura, pork cheeks, and a rather expensive yaki soba. The beer came out quickly followed by the pork cheeks and ramen about ten minutes later. We were told our other dishes would be out shortly so we started on the first two items. Being a little hungry, we finished both very quickly and then had to wait for the next round. The eel tempura was delivered about ten minutes later and we quickly devoured that as well in anticipation of our $16 yaki soba. 

We waited, sipped on some beer, waited some more then about fifteen minutes later were asked if everything was okay. My wife replied that we are still waiting on our yaki soba so our waitress said &#34;oh&#34; and quickly moved toward the kitchen. We assumed that she was checking on our order and would report back to us shortly. 15 minutes later, a different waitress came over and asked if we would like the check. Folks, it was at this point that I should&#39;ve known something was wrong and just agreed to receive the check.

I looked at her and asked what happened to our yaki soba. This waitress also quickly ran towards the kitchen without a single word of apology and must&#39;ve put in the order for our yaki soba because another twenty minutes later (the restaurant was very busy at this point) we finally received our yaki soba from our original waitress with a quick apology and no explanation. We had been waiting almost an hour for this dish to arrive and had lost our appetite from waiting for so long. I didn&#39;t say a word back to her because I didn&#39;t want to be that guy that breaks off a piece of their mind on a waitress in front of a bunch of customers. It was obvious at this point that she had forgotten to put our order in not once, but TWICE. Yep, that&#39;s right folks. TWICE.

We picked at the yaki soba then asked for our check and not only did we not receive another apology at the end of our meal but nobody tried to alleviate the situation by offering us dessert or not charging us for the dish we now didn&#39;t have the appetite to finish. 

Sick with dismay, I tipped accordingly based on our bill not including the yaki soba and walked out. 

We absolutely loved the food we ate that night. Every last bite of it. It was some of the best noodles I&#39;ve ever had and I don&#39;t think I can ever bear to eat instant ramen noodles again after being spoiled by fresh, real ramen. Even the yaki soba was meaty and tasty. Everything was tasty!!! The service was absolute s@#$. I cannot clearly express my disdain for the absolutely horrible service we received that night and could only calm myself down by telling myself that this was a fluke and it would probably never happen again.

The almost $70 bill for 2 people ordering 2 tapas dishes and 2 entrees with a $24 pitcher of beer completed the bitter taste in my mouth to accompany the rotten taste of sub-human service we received. Not even a proper apology.

One day, when I have finally rid myself of this awful taste, I will return to once again sample the deliciously expensive treats this restaurant can produce. I can only hope that when I do go back that we do not receive the same horrible service we received. At that time, I will raise (or lower) my rating accordingly."

Since I was out of options, figured I&#39;d try it.  Very impressed with the service, very attentive, yet didn&#39;t chew your ear off.  Beer &amp; drink specials were good, but the food sets it apart.  Very good!  I was impressed, as it has the look of a local dive-y bar, with limited food.  Check it out.  I had the steak sandwich, one of the best I&#39;ve had in a while.

If you want a romantic dinner - not your spot.  But for drinks, food, &amp; good times - this is the spot in the area!"

She pours a FULL glass of foam, doesn&#39;t wait for it to settle as ANY bartender  knows and serves it to us.  We waited 5 minutes for the foam to settle out and had 2 &amp; 1/2 inches of head on our beer.
Ordered the Bleu Cheese Burger and it was nothing special - no tomato, onion or lettuce.  
The owner should spend some time training his bartenders on a proper pour, there is no excuse for what the bartender served us. I doubt we&#39;ll be back."

This is MY go to bar. This is the place that when I get off work at 10, or 11, on a weeknight and I&#39;m hungry, crabby, and needing a beer, I head straight for.

The food is amazing. Not just amazing for bar food. I would say it&#39;s amazing even if this was a great diner!

The waitresses and bartenders are all friendly ladies in their mid to late 20&#39;s.

Let&#39;s put it this way. If you come here expecting lots of sports, dark atmosphere, townies, locals, 10 year graduates of Elk Grove High School, some noise, AND great drinks, food, and service. Then you won&#39;t be disappointed."

They have an AMI jukebox so I played a couple songs, they shut it off right after first song started because they were all listening to the hockey game. Like you really have to listen to the announcer to know what&#39;s going on.

The bottles are always cold, but the draft beer is just not cold enough and no frosted glasses to help the problem.
