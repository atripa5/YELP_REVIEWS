Furthermore, I wasn&#39;t offered a replacement meal and was left with no other choice but to eat a dry mundane salad. Very poor customer service and operations at this location."

I am writing an updated review here as I thought a one liner was not fair enough. I have been to multiple Chipotle, though the quantity was always a question, I liked the food. This one is closer to my home so been there like many times. But 11/25 me and my wife were here and we wouldn&#39;t go back to this location anymore. Rude server, like she was in a hurry or something, my tacos had 3 cubes of grilled chicken and she moved on!! Why do i pay 6.50? My wife asked for extra guacamole and there she shows a smirk and nod like she was tired of scoooing it out. Didn&#39;t see the name but was an asian lady. 

Anyway that wasn&#39;t the point.

This has happened before. They are rude except just 2 people I think, they are cheerful youngsters. And the quantity they put on is like &#34;hey if I give you theres nothing left for us or something&#34;. Degraded quality of service.

So we tried Qdoba yesterday night, which made me rewrite my review and we are not coming back Chipotle, save all that guacamole that you can.

Original:-
Very bad service. Quantity is way too less. Do not deserve even a single star. Never gonna go again. Better to grab from Qudoba or taco bells."

I easily eat at a Chipotle location 1-3 times per week, I have to say that this visit was exceptionally bad. Terrible, cannot express today&#39;s events.  My food was absolutely DISGUSTING and the service was beyond ATROCIOUS. Moreover, they made me look like a fool when I gave rancid food to my family. The order number is 275 for reference.

What a DISGUSTING restaurant (I can&#39;t stress that enough). I came in on Sunday and was served guacamole which was nearly black in color. I asked the person serving the food for a new batch and they replied it was was made today.To make matters worse, I overheard the two employees who had served my dish state that it didn&#39;t look right, and asked each other if the avocados were from yesterday. Of course, this came up after my food had been made.  

Secondly, after my food was made I waited several minutes to get rang up. The two people that served me spoke with one another for a few minuets and only asked for someone to find the cashier when another customer complained. People in line behind me started to question when they would get rang up. At one point, I was the only person waiting in line, but it soon swell to 4 or 5 people.  No one could find the cashier and ultimately someone opened the bathroom door and shouted her name. Sure enough she was in the bathroom. No big deal, but she came back and hadn&#39;t washed her hands. I was in disbelief. 
  
Soon after arriving home, my father tasted the guacamole and commented that the color wasn&#39;t right and that it tasted odd. I then proceeded to taste the guacamole and found it to be bitter and almost putrid. It was beyond disgusting. I had to rinse my mouth out. 

I then called the store and asked to speak with the manager. The gentleman who answered was somewhat understanding, but did not resolve the issue. I explained that the guacamole was rancid and also expressed my concerns about the service. He asked me to drive back and they could give me a refund. He stated that other stores were experiencing the same quality issues with their avocados,  I don&#39;t find this to be a satisfactory response. He should have decided to 86 the item or remake the guacamole. It&#39;s not okay to serve food that is substandard. This is how people get sick. Driving back to the store was not worth the trip, so I told him I would contact corporate rather than drive back for a 10 dollar refund. Going forward, I will not be visiting this location and may reevaluate going to other Chipotle/Shophouse restaurants for lunch."

It used to be decent but maybe the management changed or Chipotle changed how they do things. The employees seemed disgruntled, unhappy, and careless about their job.

I gave them one last try and the food was terrible...

The lettuce was old and had brown edges. It didn&#39;t taste right.
The rice was hard and half-cooked.
The meat was tough and wasn&#39;t seasoned well.
The mild salsa was like water

I was asked to wait for 7 minutes to chicken while they finished cooking the chicken.  They asked if I wanted a drink while I wait, which is why there are two stars instead of one.  Kind gesture. 

When I went to order 3 bowls (two chicken and one veggie), they asked if I wanted white or brown rice, when I said brown in all three she indicated &#34;this is all we have left&#34;, both brown AND white rice didn&#39;t not even a spoonful.  She asked if a guy cutting the chicken could make more and he said no because they didn&#39;t have any cilantro.  So, no rice.  

As they put the chicken in two, I reminded her the third was to be a Veggie bowl.  &#34;We&#39;re out of veggies&#34;.  Really?!  Mind you, it was 1:30 on a Wednesday. 

As I was checking out, I let the woman know how disappointed I was that the rice and veggies were out and not being restocked.  She listened and charged me the full price and sent me on my way.    When I opened it up, all three bowls were basically soup from the salsa and black beans.  Disgusting.  I&#39;m glad I asked for extra lettuce, but all three bowls were still only half full.  I understand if restaurants run out of items but not making accommodations with substitutes or discounts devalues the entire brand.  Two days ago they did a promotion giving away a free burrito/bowl which I did not participate in. Today I was IN the restaurant, PURCHASING 3.  They probably should have closed while they restocked rather than carry on so ill prepared.  Rice, after all, is a staple there for ALL orders."

Skip this one, and drive a bit East to the Streets of Woodfield location, and save yourself wasted time, money and energy.

The tortillas are usually warm and moist ...sometimes, and the staff is majority of the time, grumpy grumperkins.

If you&#39;re a Chipotle virgin, it&#39;s easy to catch on, and a new take on &#34;fast food&#34;.  You approach the starting point and decide if you want your goodness wrapped up in a warm tortilla (or in some beefy cases double wrapped), or if you want to go with the burrito bowl option, or 3 tiny tacos.  I don&#39;t know much for the taco choice, I have seen others in my party make that choice, but it just seems like you get way less food, and meh, not my style.  I usually get a burrito bowl, with a to-go lid option incase I can&#39;t finish the whole thing in the restaurant...which is the majority of the time, as the portions are massive...massively delicious!  My husband always gets a double wrapped tortilla, because it is usually a huge burrito baby.  

After choosing your food holder, you get your pick of:
-Rice: white or brown ,
-Beans: Pinto or Black
-Grilled Veggie mix of onions + peppers sauteed together (can&#39;t get them separate, unless you ask for them to tediously pick out which pieces you do/don&#39;t want...but I&#39;ve never seen that done... I would like to have just the onions, as my tummy is sensitive to peppers, so I wish they were separated, but they aren&#39;t so i avoid this step altogether because usually it is hella busy &amp; basically always a steady stream of hungry hungry customers, so speed is essential as patron and burrito crafter)
-Meat: Spicy Barbacoa (steak), Medium-Spicy Chicken, and pulled apart pork (least spicy), and maybe another option, not sure, and they may or may not have/are introducing a tofu option?  But for vegetarian options, you can choose to go meatless, and get guacamole at NO EXTRA CHARGE, when if you DO get meat, adding guac is like 1.80 extra... I think... Not exactly sure, as the hubbs &amp; I have been trying to severely minimize our animal products so we always get guac in place of a meat, and don&#39;t get charged extra for it anymore.
-Salsa choices...spicy, and medium? Not sure, I don&#39;t get the liquidy salsa, I just move on to the tomato mixture, and the corn mix...
-Sour Cream (when I used to get it, before going Vegan-ish, I would get the sour cream and it would always be... kind of rauncy, and tummy pain, it was tangy and not good, sketchy...
-Cheese: shredded
-Chopped Romaine lettuce
-and guac... FOR EXTRA! They will always ask you, &#34;the guacamole is extra, is that ok?&#34; **Unless you did NOT get any meat, then guac is NOT extra**

Then you&#39;re done assembling your mexican grill creation before your very eyes!  You can then choose the ever popular Chips + Guac side dish, and they have a fridge behind the cashier with a variety of juices, Horizon Milk boxes, Coronas, and possibly margaritas, but I think that&#39;s new...and the different variety of soda dispension and lemonade.

There is some seating inside, not sure if any outside... not very memorable"

For starters, they literally put 4 little pieces of chicken on each of my tacos. As I moved down the line, the girl adding ingredients seemed to be bothered by something, as she had an attitude. Then the next young lady serving up the guacamole began speaking in spanish with the girl who had the attitude. Little did they know I am also fluent in spanish, and did not find it tasteful that they were talking badly about a few of the customers. 

Don&#39;t even bother asking for extra ANYTHING, you&#39;ll get so little it&#39;s not even worth the breath it would take to ask for extra.

I don&#39;t dig the communal seating. It has a weird, Oliver Twist vibe, at least to me.   I felt closed-in and uncomfortable. I don&#39;t like to be shoulder-to-shoulder against strangers when eating, kthx. Eating outside is an option sometimes, but (a) I don&#39;t eat outside in the rain, and (b) I don&#39;t like bugs flying around me and my food while I eat.

The food at this location is always good and I have never had a concern about what I was consuming.  

My concern lies within the service that is provided.  Twice now, I have ordered from a girl who seemed to hate the fact that she was working there, especially when it came to interacting with customers.  During my most recent visit, this is what happened- I am a vegetarian, so I ordered a veggie bowl.  Simple enough, right?  The girl I placed my initial order with said &#34;okay&#34;, then proceeded to put steak onto the bowl.  I asked her if she could remove the steak, because I wanted a veggie bowl and had ordered a veggie bowl.  I don&#39;t think I was rude or short with her in any fashion, but she proceeded to roll her eyes, stomp over to a garbage can and forcibly throw the steak bowl away.  She then came back and started making a veggie bowl and said &#34;there, you have a veggie bowl&#34;.  Now I know that people can get tired at work and customers can be demanding, but I feel as though my request was a normal and simple one.  I really don&#39;t think it is appropriate to react in this manner toward anyone, let alone a customer while you are working.  This was disappointing.

I do recommend this location as it has good food and is in a good area.  However, I do think that the actions this employee displayed should be addressed."

This one is very good just like the others, same high quality food.  Now it&#39;s just a matter of the insides compared to the other ones and the service.

They have weird lighting in there and I&#39;m not really sure why each table is individually lit instead of using overhead lighting.  The ambient lighting (at lunch time) was good enough but the overhead washes that all out.

The washroom for the men is a waste of space, it&#39;s far too big for a 1 person bathroom, it really should have been made smaller because there are too few seats in this place.

The service was great as I have come to expect out of my lunch place of choice.  I go between 2-5x a week and I expect that any Chipotle I go to has great food and service.  Both were met here.  There was just one catch, the person that wrote on my burrito, I think she was new so this is forgivable, wrote so hard she punctured the foil and wrote on the burrito shell itself.  I did not notice until I was halfway done with my food since the C was in the middle.  I ate it, no big, but really should be more careful about it.  I must say she was the only person not smiling and enjoying her job.

Depending on how bad the lines keep up (there was about 10 people in line when we showed up, I may continue to return to the Barrington rd location."

Here is the major thing that is wrong with this location: THE MUSIC IS TOO DAMN LOUD. The staff cannot hear you when you order, also the 6 foot tall sneeze guard does not help. In additional combination of having a high turn over rates for employes, my order almost always starts wrong. 

Here is a typical order from this location:
Approach counter, get on your tip toes so your mouth is over the edge the sneeze guard, talk loudly over the music. Ask for a Burrito Bowl with white rice and no beans. Server proceeds to make a regular burrito with white rice and black beans. They cannot hear you interrupt them while they make the wrong order, but when they finally hear what you want, they start over and on the 2nd attempt, maybe make the write thing.
This does not stop here, they proceed to mishear you on the type of meat and additional ingredient. 
They know very well that they cant hear you clearly and yet the music is playing oh so loud.

As far as a high turn over rate for employees, I see fresh faces everytime I visit, all this means is that no one can roll a burrito. I dont even order one here anymore. The few times I did, it was a straight up chode, each time. 
But this is right next to where I work and whenever I crave it, I go here. I would give them maybe 2 stars but just earlier today they screwed up a simple order and another coworker who&#39;s order was placed over the phone that I picked up was completely wrong.

Turn down the music and remove that stupid sneeze guard, customers cant be heard over it."

The food is great, as it is in all Chipotles. But the service is TERRIBLE!  
I have been here 3 times around 8:30pm and each time the service got progressively worse. The last time I was there, I stood at the counter for almost 5 minutes before I was helped, it took about 2 minutes before I was even acknowledged. There was one employee helping another customer while another employee just stood by the register looking at receipts. Another employee walked up to the filthy grill as if to clean it, but just stood there and looked at it for a few moments, moved it away from the wall then walked away. 
When I finally got helped, the employee was completely distracted and took way too long to do simple tasks (I asked for a burrito on the side, she had to open a new package &amp; it took almost 30 seconds just to open it &amp; place a tortilla in the warmer). I ordered a burrito bowl &amp; had to repeat what I wanted on it at least 3 times before the employee finally did it right. After I paid &amp; looked in my bag to make sure it was all there, the tortilla wasn&#39;t there, I walked right back up to the register to ask about the tortilla &amp; the employee looked confused. The man who was in line behind me (and now paying for his food) reached into his bag &amp; said I think this is it, and handed me my tortilla. The employee just stood there, confused. The restaurat was not busy at all, but it took over 10 minutes to get my food. And the grill was still a filthy mess when I left. 
That was the worst service I have ever had. I&#39;ll give it another try because I love the food, but I sure hope service is better!!!!"

As per normal when I go out with people from work, I did not pick this place but it did the job for our needs (mostly medicinal drinking) quite nicely. I actually drive by this place all the time and had never even noticed it before for some odd reason. It&#39;s basically your garden variety sports/neighborhood bar, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. You do not have to bleed creativity and thematic brilliance to impress me, just cater to my &#34;typical guy&#34; needs and we are all good. It does the job in that regard brilliantly. 

The interior is pretty standard and what you would expect, with lots of flat screen TV&#39;s, random sports memorabilia, and one wall in particular that is a shrine of sorts with lots of pictures of the owner with celebs. For a guy that owns a bar in Hoffman Estates, he sure does seem to get around quite a bit. Play on playa. They also have especially trashily dressed bartenders and cocktail waitresses, which again, is far from uncommon in places like this. As a guy, it&#39;s not like you are going to find me complaining about gratuitous cleavage everywhere. Bring on the boobs. Naturally the other girls that were in our group were talking smack about this, which was somewhat amusing in it&#39;s own right. 

We posted up at one of the larger tables over near the dance floor (that I saw maybe 5 people on all night), and proceeded to order round after round in systematic fashion. Service was quick too! Even a little later when they got pretty busy, boobs girl was on point. Also watching her navigate around people with a full tray of drinks in her hand was pretty impressive. It was sort of like watching a professional baton twirler. 

The value here is fantastic compared to other places in the area for drinks. You will easily pay double for cocktails if you drive down the road into Schaumburg to a bar. The bartender also made the drinks STRONG. My Long Island could of been used to degrease engines. If it&#39;s to the point that I am making one of those grimace faces after taking a sip, then you know it is a frat house level drink. I was half twisted after only my second cocktail. 

This leads me to food. Just like on many other previous nights that I was not hungry initially, intoxication brings out the munchies so I ordered some appetizers for all of us to share. Most of the items on the menu are of the typical bar food variety (chicken tenders, potato skins, motz sticks, etc) but at least this place makes their own stuff from scratch instead of buying frozen. This is a quality that is as easy to identify as a girl with fake breasts when you eat out as much as I do.  The hand battered chicken tenders were sensational! Very crispy and they hook you up with a variety of dipping sauces. The other highlight was the nacho platter. It seems expensive at over 22 bucks, but wait til they bring it out. It is friggin gargantuan. You could feed half the population of a third world country with it. The food here is actually decent enough that I could even see stopping in when I am not drinking, which speaks volumes for places like this. 

Later on in the evening they had a DJ come in to play mostly top 40, dance and hip-hop songs. This made conversation somewhat difficult without going outside, but by this juncture in the evening I was pretty much over talking shop anyway. 

Overall, this is a great place to hang out on the weekends if you are local to the area. They offer decent food, cheap drinks, good service (with boobs) and a pretty cozy atmosphere. I am sure I will be back."

I guess I will follow the lead of Yelpers who have written reviews and do a pros and cons list. 

Pros:
-The best karaoke in the burbs. Seriously. I&#39;ve been several other places and this place has the best selection of songs and a cool DJ who isn&#39;t shitty to women. The DJ they used to have was totally lame, the new guy they have is way better. He can actually sing and he has fun with the crowd and does not think he is cooler than everyone else. 

-Drinks are pretty on point. You can&#39;t go wrong with the Big-Ass Tropical Long Island. It&#39;s a huge drink and is $10 on the weekends. Gets you drunk pretty quickly, I like it. 

-Food is not terrible. I have pretty much only had appetizers, but they are all pretty good. This is not a place for foodie freaks who want gluten-free, fat free nonsense. Just good old-fashioned bar fare. It is called AMERICA&#39;S bar, you know ;)

Cons:
-Service can be pretty slow. I went lasts night and I was surprised they only had two or three bartenders and the bar was packed! We sat in the back room by the bags and darts and we definitely could have left without paying the tab. I think this is more of a staffing issue than anything else. 

-Dancing area is pretty small. For the most part, you can dance on the stage and it is fun, but if you want to just be low-key, it is pretty small. I want to say they could take out some tables in front, but they are already pressed for table space. My suggestion would be to take out the bags from the back room on busy nights and have a second DJ spinning in there, because there is definitely room for dancing back there. 

-CROWDED. I started coming a few years ago and It was nowhere near as crowded as it is now. I do think they might be a little lax on carding as well, because there are some people I see there that do not look 21 by any means. I think this would definitely thin the crowds, or maybe have some sort of capacity? I have never seen it as crowded as it was last night, maybe that has to do with it being the weekend of the 4th? Also, they have to move the smoking area or something, because you walk outside and it is like BOOOOM CIGARETTE SMOKE! 

Overall, not a bad place to spend an evening. I try to go on Thursdays because I am a karaoke nut and it is tons of fun. I don&#39;t think it is all that expensive, I paid $19.50 for a Big-Ass Tropical ($10), a beer, and a double Manhattan. Portions on food are good, music is always good, and it&#39;s generally an ok crowd. There are going to be jerks at any bar, so to insult this bar for their clientele is pretty stupid. I&#39;d say give it a chance if you live in the area, it&#39;s a lot of fun."

The cons: 

- some of the clientele is shady 
- the food is basic 
- the food is over priced for what it is 
- the service can be sloooooow if you aren&#39;t at the bar 

So decent bar with sub par food. What else is new? At least it&#39;s close to a garibaldis!

K...well, I&#39;ve been putting off this review for a looong time! I&#39;m a meticulous guy, and I just couldn&#39;t figure out how to rate a bar. Well, I&#39;ve only had one practice review so far, but I think I got it...

I came here with a friend of mine sometime in early 2007 I think. It was just some random bar that opened, so we gave it a try after a particularly tortuous day. We sat at the bar and met Anthony and Kelli, our bartenders, and had one of the greatest nights ever! They were f&#39;in awesome, so it prompted us to come the next Friday, and the next, and so on. Over the years, we have met and befriended just about everyone who works there, including Bill, the GM, and Richard Garcia, the owner of the place. For the sake of this 5,000 character limit, I need to get started with this review of The Classiest Bar In Hoffman Estates!

BEER
In 2007, they had the bare essentials. Maybe 3 doms on tap and about 3-4 standard imports in bottles. Since then, AB bought the lot next door and doubled the size of the bar, and likewise, they more than doubled their beer offering. To compliment the 3, they now have Shiner, Stella, 2 Gooses, Sam, Shock Top, and Guinness on tap, and they&#39;ve about doubled their bottle selection. You may not find your brewery of choice, but it shouldn&#39;t be hard to find a comparable brew.

LIQUOR
They got it all! Van Gough Vodka is sorta their little display, and they have just about every flavor of it too, so there&#39;s nothing they can&#39;t make. One night, I made it my mission to have a Cranberry &amp; Vodka with all 14+ flavors, you know, for the advancement of...research. So, outside of Vodkas, they have plenty of liqueurs, like Godiva, Kahlua, Grand Marnier, etc. They have top shelf Vodkas, Gins, and upper shelf(?)  whiskey/scotches. You won&#39;t find Johnny Blue, but they have Glenfiddich and Gentlemen&#39;s Jack, etc. I hate all whiskeys and their cousins, so that don&#39;t bother me at all. 

SPORTS
It IS a sports bar after all. They have LCDs pretty much strewn all across the walls. Because of the # of TVs, technically, no matter where you sit, you will have a TV with a decent view. For Bears games, they have a projector and a screen, so it pretty much encompasses all you need. They&#39;ve got plenty to feed your sports fix, and while not a 10-score, I don&#39;t think I want them to, because it&#39;d take away from their other more important features...

AMBIANCE
I haven&#39;t been to AB in the daytime much at all, because I&#39;m too busy working my tail off working up the need to come to AB at night, but in the weird instances where I&#39;ve been here early, the place is very cool. Blue bar, Lady Liberty spinning, and fairly quiet so you can have a drink and relax in peace. Come nighttime, though, the place is rockin! It&#39;s a ton of fun. There&#39;re pool tables, darts, indoor bags, and when the weather&#39;s nice, an outdoor patio and bags too. AB is good at any time! Music can be loud on Friday nights, but if you want quiet, you can by the pool tables. If you want to get blitzed and have crazy fun, AB&#39;s your stage! And if you get really blitzed, there&#39;re 2 stages you can go up on and dance like a fool, and spend the rest of the week regretting! In addition, they have regular live bands, karaoke night, dueling pianos, and stand up open mic regularly in their calendar.

SERVICE
Their bartenders and servers are the best! They&#39;re all awesome and friendly, and even more, they know their stuff! They can tell you what beers they have, and if you mention what kind of flavor you&#39;re looking for, they can suggest one for you. Lookin&#39; for a crazy drink? They&#39;re more than happy to whip up any concoction you can dream of...trust me on this! All the while striking up conversation and joking around with you. 

Also, Rich, the owner, is not only funny as hell, but he uses his bar to make a difference in the community! He&#39;s hosted several fundraisers like St. Baldrick&#39;s and Toys for Tots and also hosted them for various individuals and teams for breast cancer, cancer walks, etc. On top of all that, he also hosts customer appreciation parties every now and then, plus AB&#39;s one of the bars that raffles off 
Bud Light cruise tickets! Great party pkgs too! 

VALUE
I&#39;m running outta room. Great daily specials, check website!

GOD BLESS AMERICA&#39;S BAR!
Let me tell you, it&#39;s awesome to have a bar that actually cares about you! I&#39;ve been to plenty of other bars, and some of the &#34;petite&#34; ones are friendly, but don&#39;t have the ability to entertain and host events like AB. Giant ones may have big parties, but it&#39;s like you don&#39;t exist! AB is a perfect balance. If you look at how much $$ I&#39;ve &#34;invested&#34; into AB over the years, it may come a surprise to you that I actually HATE liquor, but because the place is so fun and the people are so great, I look forward to Friday every week!

Pros: Good drinks. Bags. Stage for live bands. Room to dance. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s good on Saturdays...haven&#39;t experienced that yet. Good food at good prices. Clean bathrooms. The staff was attentive and made sure we were taken care of. No cover on Fridays. Good background music.

Cons: Skankily dressed waitresses. Odd pictures of the owner with every celebrity ever known around the entire bar. DJs that show up but don&#39;t actually play music. Friday...no one was there. Bouncers that are there for absolutely no reason. Looks shady from the outside.

We had a good time, especially playing bags. I&#39;m just not sure how many times I would come back. I think I would try a different bar before returning. I would definitely come back on a Saturday next time since I heard it&#39;s more crowded and people actually dance."

Service is a hit or miss depending on the night and time of day you go. Drinks are always good. I usually go here for more the atmosphere. There is a large outdoor patio area. As well as an area inside for darts and bags games. I enjoy coming here for Karaoke nights, as there is an actual stage you go on to sing. Ya know, got to live it up to have your 2 minutes with lights and on stage from time to time. They usually have one of two drink specials each night but nothing super great. I&#39;ll be sure next time I go to update this review with a little more info. Overall it is a large bar that has areas both with quiet and louder areas to hang out or play games with friends."

Waitress was very, VERY accomodating, literally asking us if we needed anything almost every 10 minutes (it almost got annoying, but whatev..)
Apps were decent--we got the artichoke dip and nachos--it was literally a chip overload and the meat in the nachos had no flavor at all.  The artichoke dip was good, nothing fab, but not terrible.
Some of my drinks were strong, some were watered down--whats up with that?!?
Music was insanely loud--we couldn&#39;t even hear each other and we were about 2 feet apart.  They did play, however, an awesome mix of songs, almost felt like I was at a wedding and ready to get my groove on."

What can I say about America&#39;s, except for the fact that it&#39;s the Classiest Bar in Hoffman Estates! I heard many good things about this bar so I decided to go here on my 21st and I have been frequenting ever since! I love it when I can walk in and have a cold beer waiting at the bar for me by the time I sit down. Both Rich Garcia, the owner of the bar, and Bill, the General Manager, make their rounds and say hello to everyone. It&#39;s extremely personable and that&#39;s what keeps me coming back. The bartenders and waitresses are all really cool, down-to-earth people that will strike up a conversation with you, given they have a moment and they&#39;re not busy. If you&#39;re on the fence about what drink to order, tell them what you have a taste for and they&#39;ll whip something up and you WON&#39;T be disappointed. They raffle off Hawks jerseys when the Hawks win. You really can&#39;t go wrong here!"

Good people hanging out; friendly bartenders, wait staff, and owner.  The owner, Richard, is cool.  Reasonable drink prices.  Good food -- especially love the jumbo chicken wings and the massive nacho platter.  Also like the outdoor tables in the warmer months, and the bags play out there too! Great place to get together with a group."

On a slow night the waitress takes at least 10 minutes to get your drink to you.  You could easily walk out of this bar with how little the staff pays attention to you.  The only redeemable thing about this bar is having bags indoors.

We came here for my friends&#39; party the other night, and even though she had reservations for MANY people, they said that they warned her she could only reserve two tables.  There were over 22 people coming, and they knew this.  Crappy.

So we considered leaving at that point, and to be honest, we probably should have...  But the food was meh and the drinks were watered down.  My friend and her family got treated like crap by the staff.

Our waitress was great and the music was good.  Hence the two stars.  I am not impressed!"

Since we don&#39;t drink alcohol much anymore, we both had an iced tea.  DON&#39;T get their iced tea.  My wife describes it as nearly undrinkable.  I think it&#39;s merely terrible.  We both got the mini filet burgers.  Little pieces of filet mignon on little buns.  It came with a horseradish sauce and au jus.  They mini filets were very good.  Fries were about average.  We sat at the bar.  The bartender was decent and didn&#39;t bother us too much but was around when we needed her.  Prices were a little high but I didn&#39;t think they were too far out of line.

We saw flyers on the wall about their karaoke nights and the DJ&#39;s they have there.  Haven&#39;t been there for either but some night we may wander over to check it out some night since it isn&#39;t too far from our house.  It is in a strip mall so there is a lot of parking available in the lot.

Overall everything was good.  Nothing fantastic, but we&#39;ll go back again."

Information that should have been brought to my attention YESTERDAY!    The person on the phone should have said that.  Very long hour to wait to eat.   I fault the management for lack of training and communication."

Both nights were crowded, with good music, and a lot of people dancing. 

I tend to avoid places that are loud and have dancing, because I can&#39;t risk getting knocked over. But the dancing was all up on a stage area, away from the rest of the crowd. So it was ok. When we arrived at 830p, there were only a few people.  The crowd grew throughout the night, and it was completely packed when we left at 2am. 

The owner is nice. This past Saturday night, when he heard we were there because we&#39;d just gotten engaged, he did a quick head count, and sent over a bunch of red and blue shots (the red ones smelled like red velvet cupcakes and were sugary goodness, the blues smelled like blue curacao and were a little stronger - but cute for the American theme of the place). 

Our waitress was very attentive for our large group.  A birthday party had reserved half of a sectioned off area, but we were told we could take over the other half - and we did!  The crowd was a good mix of ages, mostly mid 20s to mid 30s, with a few younger and a few older (the older looked to be relatives there for the bday party).  

The music was interesting, sort of an odd mix. There were some remixes that just made us say &#34;what? am i really hearing this?&#34; like Nirvana remixed with &#39;Play That Funky Music White Boy.&#39;  When friends went up to the dj with requests, he &#39;couldn&#39;t find the songs.&#39;  Not sure if I buy that. But whatevs.

The bathrooms were mostly clean. But everything in the ladies room is automatic. The sink, the soap, the paper towels, and the flush.  And auto-stuff like that will sometimes not work properly.  

It&#39;s also a very large place. They opened up a second area since the first time I went last year.  There&#39;s now another room with bags and pool tables.  

Don&#39;t know what smoking lounge other reviewers talked about, but it&#39;s unfortunately gone. We are subjected to smoke out in the freezing cold.  And if you think this place is a dive bar, then you&#39;ve obviously never been to a real dive."

Had I written a review based on the 1st couple times I went they would&#39;ve only earned a star, maybe 2 cause the place looked fabulous. But now I don&#39;t hesitate to give America&#39;s bar the 5 stars they earned. 

Overall it is a classy-looking bar in the suburbs with great drinks (martini&#39;s!) &amp; fantastic food that&#39;s very affordable.. 

Service is a little on the slower side BUT the food is absolutely delicious so it far outweighs the wait. Between my friends &amp; I, we&#39;ve tried almost everything on the menu &amp; I&#39;ve never heard any complaints. Actually I think their mini filet steak sandwiches are definitely award worthy..highly recommended.

From from the average local suburb bar. The bar top has specs of blue glitter and surrounds a one of a kind statue of a Marilyn Monroe/statue of liberty mix. She rotates on display in the center of the bar. The dance floor is up on a stage which also makes the perfect spot for the dueling pianos. There is plenty of seating at hightops scattered around the bar &amp; the bar itself has stools all around and hooks underneath for purses and what not. There&#39;s not a seat in the place that doesn&#39;t have a great view of one of their TVs. Bathrooms are very clean and I think it helps that everything is automatic; toilet, sink, paper towel dispenser. For the ladies bathroom has a full-length floor to ceiling, wall-to-wall mirror. 

They also recently almost doubled in size..adding another large room where they have a couple pool tables, darts, bags games(yes indoor!) &amp; more. America&#39;s bar has got it all (except frontage road access since they&#39;re located in a strip mall;)"

I am way too used to going out in the city of Chicago.  It&#39;s old, poorly decorated, cheesy, and had a huge statue of liberty with her skirt up in the middle.

Definitely not a place for happening 20-somethings.  Older crowd.  TV&#39;s everywhere.  I went there for a 1920&#39;s party and left within an hour because the place was not my style.  I would not go back.  If I&#39;m going to a hole in the wall, I will go to a hole in the wall within stumbling distance of my house!

They offer half off 98% of the menu during live trivia for those guests playing the game. I always get the fire cracker salad. My wife always sets a plai n hamburger. 
Unfortunately on this visit the popcorn chicken which is tossed in buffalo sauce (read: fire cracker) was cold. I brought it to the server&#39;s attention and after several minutes asked her if he mentioned it to management which she said she had. He hadn&#39;t made it over to the table yet which caused me concern. I asked er to send the owner over if he was still available. Apparently he was not as Bill appeared and when I asked Bill who he was I learned he was the GM. 
I told him I&#39;ve had this particular salad several times and the chicken was always hot. Today it was cold. He offered to take it off the bill, which is fine but my complaint regards the callous method in which he responded to the complaint. 
I feel that if a server tells a member of management that there&#39;s a problem that manager should make haste and get over and diffuse the problem with a little more than a shred of customer service and at least leave the guest with the perception that he cared about the issue.
When I offered that maybe the salad had been left in the widow a little too long I was told that in fact it had not. ...I guess they just serve cold chicken sometimes.
RACHEL is a a fantastic server and is in touch with the needs of her guests, or she gives the perception thereof.
To complete the evening, Bill didn&#39;t actually remove the salad from the check as he indicated he would. Thanks for the $4 salad."

Only it wasn&#39;t:(  Other than our waitress who was super nice and ourselves (who can manage to have a good time no matter where we go) it was horrible.  I usually don&#39;t post negative reviews, but I have to.  The food was all wrong, I had a California Chicken sandwih which came with no avacado and no basil mayo.  The fries were good.  Night goes on time to leave we are out the door the birthday girl goes back in to pay her bar tap and we are standing waiting for her not being loud just waiting.  First the bouncer comes and says move on, I explain we are waiting for the birthday girl, I am her ride home.  Then the owner/manager ,not really sure what he was ther than there are picures of himself all over the walls, tells the bouncer to come over and tell us to leave.  At this point I am not very happy with either one of them considering the smoking section was about 5ft from us, so if I wanted to smoke a cigarette and still drink their booze I can be outside nice......................  I did not appreciate being treating like a thug and being asked to leave their property without my niece and told them in a few choice words that I would never be back.

I am not sure what went on in the last year with management but it shows they have had changes, which is sad because it is a nice place with alot of space:("

My birthday was coming up and my first thought was to have my party here....I should have gave it a second thought!!! I called 3 weeks in advance to hold tables for the 25 people I had coming, the person on the phone said no problem just had to give a credit card number incase we didnt show and I would get charged a fee.....ummm ok....whatever.....
So the big night has arrived and im super excited, we get there at 6:30 and the place is EMPTY!!!! i talk to the hostess and tell her we are here for the party and she brings us to our section....with 8 chairs and 2 tables....UMMM WHAT???? 
since the place was so empty we move to a different section where there was more tables for the 25 people I had coming! the manager then comes over to us and says we cant take up that many tables and they had told me on the phone that I could only have 2 tables the HUGE dinner rush was going to be coming in soon.....Im sorry Im pretty sure if i had a large party coming i wouldnt have booked two tables for all those people...but thanks AND let me tell you we didnt order food until 7:30ish and it was still EMPTY...so one might ask what dinner rush!!! 
SO yeah, I was THAT person who didnt listen and we sat where we wanted and he left us alone about it finally. 
 
We started having a good time after that, our waitress was super nice and very quick with our drink and food orders.....then we found out maybe why she was so quick with our orders...they were all wrong. Every single one of our meals where wrong in one way, shape or form. The food we good wasnt bad, typical bar food(except the crinkle fries were REALLY YUMMY!!!) we all finished eating and started moving around talking, dancing and having fun then, our waitress was with us all night and took very good care of our drink orders for the night. Then we went to pay.....sigh....my friend had a groupon for the food....which the manager came over very rudely and said he couldnt use it cause they were going to have music LATER on that night....umm excuse me....what would music later have to do with using a groupon now. Finally after MUCH fighting he was able to use the groupon. We were walking out and the waitress came out to get me cause I forgot to pay my tab...OOPS. SO i went back in to pay and the bouncer told my aunt and cousin they could not stand outside and wait for me, they had to move on. My aunt told him that they were just waiting for me to pay my bill and we were going to be leaving, they bouncer left them alone then but the manager came over to them and said they needed to move on and they couldnt stand outside to wait for me...this is were my aunt got a little heated and started yelling because what did he want her to do, leave me at the bar!?!

So all in all I had a horrible experience at this place and WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!!"

On a good note, you would assume this to be filled with right winged, Budweiser loving, gun carrying, obese Americans, but, instead, it is just 20 somethings from the suburbs of Chicago that would shit a brick if a minority walked in.  These are the rich kids from all of those high schools with the highest ACT scores in Illinois who went on to U of I and ended up right back where they started in the same bars their non-smart friends have been drinking for years while they were racking up college debt.  Just kidding, their parents paid for college. Anyways, the drinks are cheap but that is obvious once you spend a night here.  They have indoor bags, loud music, and darts just like the best of them but do not ever plan on meeting someone here;  Everyone is too busy talking about supping up their infinity than to actually worry about the other sex, or getting any.  The servers here are cute little ditzy things just like any other &#39;sports&#39; bar, so do not expect good service.  To conclude, it is a typical suburbs bar."

I have been here about 4 times and never had a problem with service.  Dueling pianos are good and play every first Saturday of every month.  They usually have good bands.  I only ate here once.  The pepper soup is okay and I liked the Filet sliders dipped in the au jus.

I went for the dueling pianos on a saturday night (OCT 6th). We had called a week before to make a reservation and were beautifully accommodated. The reservation was re-confirmed the day before which was a good thing because we added 2 more guests. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very polite door guy.  We were escorted to our table immediately that had a reserved sign with our name on it! (maybe the solution is to call ahead of time to make your reservation).  Anyway... the atmosphere is casual with a comfortable neighborhood feel and a cute marilyn / statue of liberty spinning above your head in a well lit spacious room. We were served by a waitress named Tracy and to say she was awesome is an understatement!  My brother has some food allergies which can be difficult &amp; she was more than patient with us. She listed all the food &amp; drink specials and being a wine drinker I was more than happy to find out that Merlot was only $3 a glass... Yippee! (don&#39;t judge!)
Food... we ordered some appetizers Cheddar cheese cubes, Nachos and wings. The wings were hot (buffalo style) but I think i enjoyed the ranch just as much as the wings! The Nachos were just what you would expect - we ordered chicken on them and the plate was cleaned.... The only bad thing I can say is the cheddar cheese cubes could have been bigger.. they were DELICIOUS but also gone with our group on about 3 minutes.  My brother had ordered a plain chicken breast with a salad &amp;  im sorry to say I didn&#39;t catch his opinion. The Pianos were very fun &amp; interactive, a great way to spend a Saturday night out with a diverse crowd!  We have already made reservations for next month!  

They also promote karaoke &amp; live bands which may entice us to come on another night but we have yet to experience them. 

Try the Cheddar Cheese Cubes!"

There is a massive bar that fills the floor with a five foot Statue of Liberty twirling in the center. On the opposite side there is a miniature dance floor surrounded by the DJ area &amp; tables with chairs. There are flat screen TV&#39;s so DJ&#39;s can play videos while they spin. During my after work visit there seemed to be very little variety. It started off with your basic Top 40 but then gradually went into a lot of 80&#39;s with some late 90&#39;s pop tunes. When the DJ started at 10pm we went through it all over again. All the Top 40 songs we just listened to at six o&#39;clock were in rotation again. It was like listening to the radio.

Service: The service was slow and unhelpful. After finishing my first drink it took the bartender 15 minutes to come by and ask me if I wanted another. There were countless times she came over to serve others and completely looked past me. Even when I tried getting her attention there was no such luck. Me and my two friends decided to order some food while sitting up at the bar. We each ordered an appetizer to share; popcorn shrimp, popcorn chicken, &amp; an order of spinach artichoke dip. Now I know their food is fresh &amp; made to order but goodness it took 45 minutes before we got served. And when we did only one order came out. We told the bartender that we were still waiting on our popcorn shrimp &amp; chicken, she said &#34;food comes out as its ready&#34; instead of &#34;oh let me go check on that for you&#34; or something to be a little accommodating.

Parking: There is plenty of parking in this shopping mall lot.

Overall: This is a starter bar, it gets empty the later it gets. Getting a drink or some chow at Americas Bar is a long lasting wait. The food was tasty &amp; worth the wait at a reasonable price. The crowd and atmosphere is welcoming and parties til 3am every morning. Majority of the drinks seem a little much for a suburban bar but if you pay attention to the weekly specials you can find a good deal."

It&#39;s a great place and pretty classy without being over pretentious. The bathrooms are glorious! The waitresses are all fantastically nice and I really enjoyed talking to them. I went last summer and they have bags and tables outside which gives you a beer garden feel in their strip mall location. I&#39;m comfortable there in anything from jeans to a nice dress. They have a lot of cool themed nights and charity events as well which changes the atmosphere a bit so it&#39;s not the same crowd all the time. The food? O.M.G. Try the mini steak sandwiches. They rock. Or ask for a grilled cheese with bacon. All the cool kids do. ;)

All around a fun, comfortable setting - affordable and tasty too!"

I used to come to America&#39;s Bar with a group of friends every week for team trivia (which is great!) for over a year. If you win trivia, your team gets a coupon for $25 to use at America&#39;s bar. Then they made a rule saying that you can&#39;t redeem the coupons during trivia, so you have to come in at a separate time to use them.

I went with a group of friends on a Friday night to use multiple coupons that we had from winning trivia. They were all about to expire and we asked the manager if we could extend some of them since we come here every week. The manager said, &#34;No, you&#39;ll have to use them all tonight.&#34; The bartender was part of this conversation, and she said that she would let us know when we were getting close to the amount of our coupons so we wouldn&#39;t go over. 

So we order drinks and hang out. When we go to leave my friend gets the tab and gives our coupons to the manager. Now he says that he can only accept two coupons on one bill. We said okay then can you split the bill because there were about six of us and we only got one bill to make it easier. The manager said no he couldn&#39;t split the bill and couldn&#39;t accept more than two coupons a night. It was ridiculous that he told us we needed to use all our coupons and then wouldn&#39;t accept them a few hours later. If that was the rule, why didn&#39;t he explain that at the beginning of the night when he knew we were planning on using all of our coupons. We continued the conversation and the manager would not change his mind. My friend called the police because he thought we were being charged unfairly. The police came and heard what happened from us and the manager. Then the officer said that they should honor the coupons they issued, the tab was settled, and we were fine to leave.

My friend just got his credit cart bill and he was charged $91 by America&#39;s bar even though the police came and settled the issue. We are now disputing the charge and getting a statement from the police.

The bartenders and wait staff at America&#39;s bar are great. They were very helpful to us and tried to make the situation better. The management made a bad situation worse and permanently lost about 10 regular customers.

I will never go back to America&#39;s Bar. Reading other people&#39;s comments, this is not the first time people have been ripped off or treated poorly and I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be the last."

No cover, check 
Tropical Long Islands $4, check 
80&#39;s music, check... 
and out we went. 
We arrived at eleven, the music was not 80&#39;s and the dance floor empty. Not a whole lot of party vibe at that time to get our easily buzzed off of the Tropical Long Island asses out on the floor. 

The smokers of the group said the smoking area was really smoky, even for them, but warm. 

The bathroom was really nice. It had a floor to ceiling mirror, stained concrete floors, more sparkly counter tops and roomy stalls. Lovely for what seemed to be mostly a sports bar. 

We admired the Marilyn Monroe trying Statue of Lady Liberty, the sparkly yet sticky bar and entertained ourselves with stories about, of course, ourselves. A gentleman ac cross the way bought us all shots, nice. We bored quickly, however, and left for Cadillac Ranch."

First in 2009 and again just last night. Met the owner both times. The bar has expanded and they now have a very nice pool table area. Ladies&#39; bathroom was clean, but it was early in the evening.

Pros: plenty of parking and very reasonable drink specials. Plenty of TVs to catch sports. They also had music videos playing when we were there in 2009. Don&#39;t know if they stopped. Clean. Good decor. Very open floor plan. Bar has really neat tile and Statue of Liberty posed like Marilyn Monroe that rotates. I think it&#39;s pretty cool and distinctive.

Cons: It&#39;s tucked away in a strip mall far from the road, so unless you know exactly where it is, it&#39;s easy to miss. The mall has a lot of vacant shops, so it&#39;s a bit desolated. Don&#39;t know how he expects to draw traffic. No Happy Hour specials. He has daily drink specials, but nothing just for Happy Hour. Not too smart, considering there&#39;s a lot of businesses in the area. The food menu is extremely limited, but everything we&#39;ve tried, we&#39;ve liked. They do make everything from scratch. Hot wings are awesome. But be sure to ask for bleu cheese - it costs extra, but they won&#39;t tell you that. Since we were there last, he&#39;s added an all-girl staff that wear skimpy black costumes. The girls ranged in age from 45-plus to 22-something, and are every SIZE in between. Not too flattering for the costumes he chose them to wear. Definitely no eye candy there. Last year, they had a great male bartender. He left. I don&#39;t know why, but he was super personable and I thought a real asset to the bar.  The old bartender with the plastic jugs is eh. Service is horrible. There were maybe 7 people in the place, and he had 3 girls working. Way too many. The bartender could have easily covered all of us, but it was so beneath her to even bring us the menus. The waitress we had has zero personality and NOT a good bar waitress.

All in all, we&#39;re looking for a good Happy Hour place, and he made some good moves, and some not so good moves. HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS!! Bring back the first bartender!! Friendlier staff!! Get rid of the cheesy costumes or hire models to pull them off. I think cute tank tops with the bar logo on the chest and skinny jeans would be perfect. It&#39;s like he&#39;s trying too hard to please everyone and can&#39;t decide which way he wants to go - Hooters style, or nice lounge/bar and grill. I&#39;m interested to see if he makes it."

It&#39;s just a hazard of suburban life. Located in the Barrington Square shopping mall, America&#39;s Bar is a hidden little gem. Not visible from the street, or even the parking lot for that matter, you may want to leave a bread crumb trail to find your way back to your vehicle. 

The first thing I noticed was the decorating. The bright blue quartz bar takes up 50% of the entire establishment and is under the constant gaze of a five foot tall rotating Statue of Liberty holding a martini glass perched on a pedestal in its midst. There are plenty of high top tables and a small stage that is taken by the occasional dueling piano act. Not quite &#34;Howl at the Moon&#34; caliber but fun none the less. 

There is one very good bartender that I met and one very bad. I also sat at a table another time and received competent albeit slowish service for a less than busy night. 

There is a dedicated outdoor smoking lounge with easy access, tables and cocktail service. For a smoker that is a nice touch. 

The clientele is another story. The idea it seems is to attract a 30-something crowd judging by the constant stream of 80&#39;s videos on the flat-screens. OK, but it&#39;s never been crowded in there, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing...I guess what I&#39;m saying is that it just doesn&#39;t feel very cool to be there. It&#39;s a cool place without enough cool people. Maybe if you show up...

America&#39;s Bar is a suburban joint that would very much like to be a cool city joint. I&#39;d give it 3.5 stars if I could."

Lets start at the beginning. Call ahead of time to see if I can get a reservation for pianos. Sure probably not going to get it but ill try. I talk to a bartender who said a manager would give me a call back later. Three hours later no call so I call back. Talked to the same guy who said he didn&#39;t forget about me. Great! Well no phone call back. I bet it was the bartender. Or maybe the manager who dropped the ball. Get there at 8 pm in order to score an unclaimed table since this is the policy on their website as well as the policy thr I have been told previously when making reservations. Apparently the bouncer thinks they hold it until 9 but I can wait to talk to a manager. Great! I wait and have been waiting over 40 minutes to speak to this manager. While I sit here I hear the bouncer ask the bartender about getting free cover if you checkin on Facebook. They both laugh and I proceed to pull out my phone and prove to the bouncer that not only was I correct on the table policy but the other customer was right about the Facebook checkin. Still haven&#39;t seen a manager. 

I&#39;m staying for pianos tonight. But I&#39;m going to think twice before coming back again and you should definitely do the same. 

I welcome comments and the chance to speak with management when they are ready to finally speak to me.

That said, the waitress was really attentive.  The dueling pianos were okay.  The crowd was only moderately into it, and the place was not that crowded.

The guy who took my order (Branden) was friendly and efficient and, quite frankly, multitasking like a boss. Aside from register duty, he was running out orders to waiting cars, including mine.

The shake was soooo goood. $3.25 for a small and tasted like homemade, but with better whipped cream - no RediWhip. Totally worth it.

I ate the sammy (cold) the next day and it was satisfying.  The veggies - artichoke, peppers, spinach, mushrooms - were so good.  My only gripe would be that they didn&#39;t cut it in half, but it&#39;s probably less messy that way."

We got the burger and beef with fries on the side.

The burger was good, it was probably a 4 star except that the bun was hard as if it was sitting out for too long. Plus side is that it was huge and definitely hit the spot.

The beef was great, the bread wasn&#39;t too soggy by the time my husband got home and we opened it up to eat. The spicy peppers were exactly that, spicy - I loved how spicy they were. The beef was a bit salty but I haven&#39;t had any Italian beef that wasn&#39;t salty. We didn&#39;t have cheese on it but I&#39;ll have to try that next time.

The fries were thicker cut fries with lots of potato with each bite. Perfectly cooked and fresh. The only down side was that they were pretty salty. 

We will definitely try this place again and try some other things on the menu, overall this place was alright."

For $6.50, it included a 7&#34; beef, a choice of side (fries, cheese fries, parmesan chips, cup of soup, small Caesar, house, pasta or fresh fruit salad) and a refillable Pepsi drink. LImit 2 worked in our favor! A 7&#34; just about costs this much on its own.

Chicken Fingers: mediocre and Luke warm...barf. the ranch covered it up.

Chips: I always look forward to when somewhere has the hand sliced chips like the have at fairs and such! When I got them they had parmesan cheese powered all over them which it never said they put on the menu and I don&#39;t like chips dusted with parmesan...so that was annoying. They were also over cooked and dark but whatever kind of oil they fry them in is really light and tasty of the chips I got that were over cooked.

I ordered the turkey club panini... it was large and in charge and filled with delicious amounts of meats and veggies. The sauce they use in the panini was very flavorful.

However, the other items were slightly less than average. I ordered the pasta salad and instantly remembered why I wasn&#39;t a fan. The noodles had a weird flavor, and the dressing was tart. The fries did not seem fresh since they had no crisp to the bite.

I would try them again for their burgers or other sandwiches."

And almost every other time when I order food from them something goes wrong. I wouldn&#39;t write this review if it was just one time issue, but talking to their manager and seeing that nothing was done makes me unhappy. So, here is some stories: two times in a raw my order came without French fries, when it happened first time I mentioned it the guy who brought our food and he never got back with the rest of my order, so talked to the manager and he gave me my money back for the fries. Second time when it happened, it took them like 10 min to get me the fries. Just last week I ordered their BLT sandwich which supposed to be served with avocado, it wasn&#39;t there. 
If I ask for something extra like mustard, every other time I don&#39;t get it or I would have to go to the cashier and ask them for mustard. Last week, i went to get some napkins at the station where they keep all silverware and there was none left, so I asked of the guys if he can get some napkins into that station, the guy said that its not his job and left off without saying anything else. So, I went to another station to get napkins and a few minutes after that I saw someone from Bona filling up the station with napkins.

I&#39;ve been driving by these things for a year and never realized the great value they had! I went a bit looser on the wallet so that might explain why, but the food is awesome! First off, in a taste scale, I like things generally more plain and not too saucy. So what did I try...

The soup. It was a potato soup that was the special for the day. I got a small bowl while I had a cold and it definitely hit the spot! It wasn&#39;t TOO creamy, but there were a lot of good potato chunks and a couple of pieces of either chicken or bacon in there. It&#39;s one of those nice (not too chunky) soups that you&#39;d eat during a cold rainy day and you want to offset a bad mood.

The Italian beef (I already forgot what it was called) but it was fantastic! I got the largest size thinking (go big or go home!) and the 9&#34; sandwich really hit the spot. I asked for mozarella cheese on it and for sweet peppers because I don&#39;t like spicy peppers. The sweet peppers were slightly overcooked but they provided enough texture in the sandwich that it wasn&#39;t just a beef tasting Italian Beef. I love their bread as it&#39;s soft but not too soggy. It&#39;s definitely something you want to eat immediately because I can see the bread getting soggy after awhile. The mozarella cheese definitely gives it a cheesy flavor which I loved! The beef is so tender and juicy that it goes so well with the bread, peppers, and cheese!!

The location itself is very busy during the lunch hour. It&#39;s even difficult to find a good table to eat at. But they are pretty good at getting your food within ten minutes and it&#39;s a hustling and bustling place that there are all sorts of conversations going on.

I&#39;d recommend going here. I remember Portillo&#39;s Italian beef having tougher beef and tougher bread which I wasn&#39;t a fan of. But it&#39;s been awhile. Give it a shot!"

I hadn&#39;t visited in a long while and then have gone there twice in the last 3 weeks. Both times purchased the 10&#34; beef and a full salad. The salads are fine, but I couldn&#39;t taste the beef due to it being loaded with salt. On the 1st disappointment, I figured the staff had salted the sandwich. The 2nd time I specified no salt. So it seems a heavy amount of salt is inherent in the recipe and/or there is no quality control. 

I&#39;ll not return for another beef of salt, and other places have better salads for the money. Too bad Zippy&#39;s closed... after doing a beef crawl I knew it was my favorite. Now I&#39;ll have to drive farther to go to Portillo&#39;s for a fast beef pickup."

Then today, I warmed up my leftover beef sandwich for lunch at work and I took a bite and it tasted fine. Then I went to take another and noticed there was a little green on the piece of meat.

I was in the area &amp; was on my way to Garibaldi&#39;s but decided against it as soon as I saw Buona.  Their menu is very extensive &amp; has something for everyone so it took a minute to figure out what I wanted, but I went with an angus cheeseburger with fries.  Surprisingly, they don&#39;t have any meal deals, I swore they used to but now everything is a la carte so you need to order everything separately.  When I ordered a cup of water, I was given the largest free water cup ever, must&#39;ve been at least 12oz, so bonus points for that.  The burger tasted a lot better than the last time I had one, which was more than a year ago, but the fries could&#39;ve been hotter.

I had a side of onion rings. They were crisp and hot. I also ordered a tamale because I&#39;ve been on a kick recently.

I assume that the cook behind the counter was too lazy to stir the pot, prior to putting the sandwich together. So he just scraped the grease off the surface. He also didn&#39;t fill the bun with beef ( only about two thirds covered ). As for the fries, they were over baked and way too salty for me. All around, a bad meaI.

I&#39;ve been there probably 5 or 6 times from lunch to dinner to late night, and it&#39;s always clean and bright, and the staff is pretty friendly, so I enjoy coming back and don&#39;t hesitate to bring others when we need something tasty and cheap. I&#39;d like to say this is a 3.5 star place more than a 4 though, mostly because it just doesn&#39;t stand out from the crowd among diners, not much character to be had here.

The first time I went, I ordered a pork souvlaki sandwich (I&#39;m always on the hunt for a good one!) and it was AMAZING. I don&#39;t know what cut of pork they used, but it was nice and fatty, making a flavorful, chewy, tender, greasy souvlaki, just the way it should be. I don&#39;t know if someone complained about the pork&#39;s fat content, because the next couple times I went, I got much leaner cuts of pork, and while healthy and still tasty, just wasn&#39;t the same. Maybe I&#39;ll try asking them for the fatty pork next time, eh?

I also had ordered the rib dinner once and that was fantastic. Fall off the bone ribs, so tasty. I&#39;m salivating right now as I&#39;m writing this.

Anyway, I did mention that there wasn&#39;t much character to this place, but I totally forgot to mention the stony-looking Yaya that sits in the corner of the restaurant (maybe the owner&#39;s mother? never asked) and makes sure the place stays clean. She totally looks like she stepped out of &#34;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&#34; and I never talked to her, but I love her."

Our orders went like this:
Mine-pork kabob plate with greek potatoes and drink
Wife-chicken kabob sandwich,no onions
Kid-chicken finger meal with fries and drink

The kid liked the meal (a hard meal to mess up unless the chicken is too greasy)
Wife said the sandwich was so,so and nothing remarkable, not a lot of flavor
Mine-I asked for no onions and extra tomatoes. I was told by the lady that it didn&#39;t come with tomatoes and was not offered them 
I received the meal with a grilled french bread on the side. Have to say I really expected a pita for a kabob plate which is the norm.
There was no tzatziki with my meal. When I asked I was told it did not come with the meal. I asked if I could buy one.
The lady told me it was $.50. I forked over a dollar and received my change.
The pork was not a traditional kabob and was more like a chopped up fatty pork chop, grilled with green peppers.
There was not a lot of flavor to it so I&#39;m glad I paid for a sauce.
All in all, not a place we will frequent as although the food was mediocre, the lady&#39;s (maybe owner?) didn&#39;t set my or my wife&#39;s world on fire.
Brandy&#39;s on Wolf &amp; Oakton is much better than this place. Maybe we should have tried the gyros, but with the way the lady treated us, I felt like she felt as though we were bothering her. We are not very demanding or picky customers so I&#39;m kind of at a loss."

1. Terribly skimpy portions.  Where else can you order a burrito and still be hungry?  2. Dirty tables and floors.  3. Tables outside in summer are never cleaned.  4. Constantly out of iced tea.  5. Condiment area not stocked-- frequently have to ask for forks, straws, lids, etc.

I know they sometimes undercook their rice. I often end up with stale chips. The barbacoa can be fatty at times. The salsa sometimes is made with underripe tomatoes. 

This particular location is almost always the culprit of these issues. I eat at many locations and the Elk Grove location continues to let myself and my coworkers down. 

We don&#39;t know why we keep going...perhaps it&#39;s because we think maybe one day they will get it together but sadly, this day hasn&#39;t come.

The only reason I&#39;m even bothering in writing this review is because I noticed that this particular review page has reviews that have been deleted. Particularly: bad ones. Whether it is this Chipotle location or Yelp administration, that is unacceptable and down right insulting. Reviews should be used to HELP the business improve, or let them know what they&#39;re doing right. You can&#39;t just throw them under the rug. Despite that, on to the actual review.

This place was the first Chipotle I&#39;ve ever been to and I&#39;ve had some fond memories of it. I used to go here every Monday in my senior year of high school back in 2010-2011. Me and my friends loved going here. I slowed down on going there since I graduated and went to Aurora University. But back then, I remember their chicken and their steak being perfectly cooked. Their rice was just as perfectly cooked, not at all crunchy. Even the peppers you can get as an option were very nicely cooked. Not only that, but the employees looked like they seemed to enjoy their job and were very kind.

Now lets cut to about 3 years later; November of 2014, which will be my last visit to this Chipotle. I went in around 4 pm after getting home from a long trip. I go inside and the line and customers are non-existent. I approach the front and tell the employee I want a steak burrito. The employee goes off in the back after asking this and doesn&#39;t come back. I was there for about 3 minutes before someone came over and actually helped me out. While I was waiting I decide to look at the actual food. It looks like the counter was splattered with salsa, steak, chicken, guacamole. It looked like the kids table at Thanksgiving dinner. A lot of the food was also mixing in with other stuff, which is rather risky for people with allergies. It looked as if the salsa was mixed with the others. There was quite a bit of medium salsa in the hot salsa and guacamole in the mild.

Once another employee replaced the other employee, she asks me what I want. Once again, I tell her I wanted a steak burrito. She begins to prepare it. It was a generic deal. She asked me what rice, what beans, and what meat I wanted. To be fair on the meat part, its good that she wanted to be sure she heard the right order. So I &#39;ll give the employee that much. The entire time she was asking me what I wanted though, she just sounded so miserable. Like she didn&#39;t want to be there and was acting like I was just wasting her time. I decided that I would like a little more meat and so I ask for it. She literally puts two extra pieces of steak on the burrito. At that point I just knew it was going to be bad. I just told her &#34;never mind. If you&#39;re just going to ration it out so poorly, just take it off.&#34; She just scoffs, groans, and scrapes off the two extra pieces she put on.

The rest of the preparation went without much problem. nothing that was mixed in with the other stuff on the counter got into what I got. So that was pretty nice of her to do. She rings me up, I pay and I get home. Overall the experience at this chipotle was horrible enough to make me give this Chipotle a low review.

Then I took a bite of the burrito. My mouth was filled with an over cooked tortilla, crunchy rice, and chewy dry and over cooked steak. It was by far the worst burrito I&#39;ve ever gotten from Chipotle. It was like I was eating something from taco bell it was that bad.

I haven&#39;t been back since and that&#39;s definitely for the better. It&#39;s not like they were the only Chipotle within a 20 mile radius. There are two that are just as close to me as that one was. I will be doing my business at those locations from now on. Unless I hear this place actually improves or start to take reviews seriously instead of deleting them. Advice to the people who actually read these reviews before going to a restaurant: Go to either the Rolling Meadows, Schaumburg, or Randhurst location. You will get a significantly better experience overall. The employees are happy there, and the food is fantastic at each of those locations. Go there. Don&#39;t go to the elk grove location."
chipotle-mexican-grill-elk-grove-village,Brittany B.,rLM6fEPOqL22G_5tHK8rOQ,"Elgin, IL",0,1,0,75,25,yTQSjOVjAJEjjUjC2JPt8g,1.0,2015-07-16,"This is the first review I&#39;ve ever posted on Yelp, and I only do so because I felt it was absolutely necessary. Today I placed an online order around 11:30am to be picked up at 12:15pm. A lot of times I do rapid pickup at the Panera across the street and am thrilled with their service which is always ready to go when I arrive, so I was hoping for a similar experience from Chipotle. 

I was meeting my parents there for lunch since they are headed to Florida for vacation and said I would meet them there and grab us a table since all I had to do was walk in and grab my food. I had paid for my meal online already, so if it was ready on time I should have been able to just walk in, show them my ID, and grab us a table. When I arrived my parents were still in line (about halfway back) so I gestured to them that I would get my food and get us somewhere to sit. There was one pick-up order in front of me that still needed to pay so I was patient and understanding with the staff. However, even after she left with her order, I continued to wait so long for my small order (a burrito bowl and a drink) that my parents actually made it through the line and were able to sit down and start eating before I ever got my food. 

I arrived there at 12:12pm and didn&#39;t get my food until 12:23pm (yes, I watched the clock because the food should have been ready on time). I know 8 minutes shouldn&#39;t seem like a long time and that they are super busy at lunch, but when you place an online order it&#39;s usually because you are in a hurry and only have a certain amount of time for lunch. That 8 minutes seemed super long as I watched like 20 people in line get their food before me, while I had placed my order 45 minutes before them...And to top it off, the only thing I received for the long wait on my food was a &#34;Sorry for the wait.&#34; I feel like if you don&#39;t have an order ready ON TIME (like you are agreeing to for online orders) that there should be some sort of system in place to get your customer satisfaction back after you don&#39;t fulfill your requirements as a company (like a voucher or gift card or something to say sorry we didn&#39;t come through for you as we should have). 

Anyways, I wish I could have given this a better review but this was super poor service in my opinion. When you have an online ordering service as a company, you should have those orders ready to go when promised. End of story."

I love the taste of the food. Typically, I&#39;ll get a burrito with either steak or chicken, but I chose carnitas this time. 

Chipotle serves enormous burritos. The portions are really huge - gluttony at it&#39;s finest. When I do go there, I typically eat about 1/2 of the meal, then eat the rest for lunch the next day. This time, I had a business meeting over lunch and without really thinking about it, I ate the whole thing.

This was a problem. I&#39;m a small person with a small stomach. Eating an entire Chipotle burrito is way too much for me. I&#39;m afraid I suffered for the rest of the day teetering between wanting to fall asleep and from the discomfort of over eating.

So, this is why I only go to Chipotle infrequently. I love the taste, but my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I leave in pain. This was certainly the case for this visit."

Overall, love Chipotle! Their food is fresh and I can get a Chicken bowl and not carry guilt with me all day because I splurged.  Love the seasoning on their chicken and that their salsas have a nice kick. (On that note, I&#39;ve stopped going to Qdoba for that reason...not enough spice!)

Here&#39;s my deal though: the portioning here is always SO inconsistent!!!  Some days I walk out with a nice, heaped bowl and other days it seems like it&#39;s hardly half full.  I have no idea what the true portion is supposed to be at this point and it&#39;s incredibly frustrating.  I have to ask myself most of the time if I&#39;ve gotten my money&#39;s worth or if I&#39;ve just gotten a great deal.  

There are other little things that are concerning....employees eating chips out of the bin in the backbar area right in front of customers and I also once witnessed an employee take the garbage out with his food prep gloves on and then proceed to come in and work the food bar without washing his hands or changing his gloves.

I like the pork because it was really tender and juicy so I think I will stick with that from now on.  

I usually get the Burrito Bowl which is everything you can get in a regular burrito without the shell. You can choose from the type of salsa and rice, to the sour cream and guacamole. (the guacamole is extra).

When I say dry I mean dry, no liquid surrounding it at all. I asked them about it and they looked confused as if this is normal.

The cashier was the same person who was confused the last time. She rang me up and didn&#39;t charge me for quac, not cuz she was being nice but because she was careless and didn&#39;t notice. After today I will be avoiding this location. Oh ya the mens bathroom only has one handle on the sink and its for

Here are My reasons:

1.)They never smile
2.) They rush you through your order, to the point where you need to tell them to slow down so you can make sure their getting it right.
3.) He portion sizes vary immensely at each visit. There is no consistency at all. One time you get too much meat and then other times you get 4-5 pieces of meat...
4.) As of late, their steak is inedible... The last visit, I paid for extra meat b/c they literally were refusing to put more than 4 pieces of steak on the taco and when I got home, I had to throw away almost all of the steak because it was all fat... Disgusting and disappointing!
5.) Chips seem to always be stale... Used to love the chips but they are stale everything I get them.

I can go on about other reasons but it is clear that this is a Management problem at this location as this was never the norm at other locations of theirs. 

I will never go back and waste my money at this location and I suggest you do the same. I&#39;m tired to complaining to a manager and having the same issue happen each visit.

Chipotle needs to clean house at this store. I cannot be the only one who feels this way."

1) They could do a better job wrapping the burritos. The burrito wasn&#39;t wrapped properly, so once I was at the end of the burrito, everything started falling out. I could not take the foil off without ingredients falling. This has happened most of the times that I&#39;ve gotten a burrito from this location. I typically get burrito bowl. and yes! I have come here many-a-times! 


The next thing is not related or is not why I lowered and gave them a &#34;meh&#34; with two stars. The 2 stars was solely based on the above. I think that burritos should be wrapped properly and with care! especially when the joint is a burrito joint. Can&#39;t have the ingredients falling all over at the ends because of improper wrapping.... that&#39;s just my opinion, though.

Another thing to note: 
There was a dead fly in my husbands burrito bowl in the evening. Sometimes, you can&#39;t help dead flies, I understand. This was found when we went in the evening and it&#39;s not as busy and hustling as it may be during lunch. Since the meat, ingredients aren&#39;t covered or weren&#39;t covered, I&#39;m sure it was easy for a fly to get in. My husband found his fly in the midst of the lettuce. It happens, I totally understand. He let them know, and they just made him a new bowl. We weren&#39;t necessarily expecting a refund or anything, but it didn&#39;t seem to be a very big deal... 

If the manager reads this, I suggest covering the food especially during non-busy hours to protect the food from unwanted bugs! =)"

This review is based off of this particular chipotle.  Every time I come here nothing is the same, either the chicken is burnt, the rice changes flavor, the steak is undercooked and fatty.  They don&#39;t understand the concept of just a little hot sauce, they ALWAYS overload it, the servings are always different.  50% of the time I come here one of the employees are either eating the chips out of the big bowl they serve to customers, or chewing down on cookies.  I also don&#39;t like seeing them handle the food without gloves.  What mostly made me write this review is the fact that anyone that has some seniority always is very rude to the new guy/girl, especially in front of the customer to show that they know more, get off your high horse buddy...you work at chipotle, in-conclusion, go to the one at The Streets of Woodfield."

 The nachos were amazing very authentic! They had just the right flavors and it was not heavy at all for Mexican food lol. The meat was delicious I like mine cooked all the way n this one was cooked just right with so much juice. My dad said their cal do de Rez is even better.

I had the burrito dinner meal with a HUGE steak burrito with everything, refried beans, and rice. The beans were good and the rice was nothing special. The steak was actual steak but tasted like it had been boiled before or cooked in its own grease. Something was off on the taste. The tortilla and fillings were good and everything seemed fresh but not the BEST  I&#39;ve ever had.  Everything cost about $10-$11 bucks. 

I went at about 12:30ish on a friday afternoon and it wasn&#39;t busy but there were several tables inside occupied by patrons. The restaurant was clean and the woman who took my order was friendly.

Steak was cut into small cubes... most of it was chewy and not that flavorful.

Spicy pork was not hot-spicy.. but definitely had an exotic spice of some sort. Tasted like cloves to me.. which is not my cup of tea.

Chile relleno was decent.. on the mild side, pepper-wise. But not worth ordering again.

Chicken was the sole winner for me. It had both shredded &amp; cut meat in a paprika sauce.. yum ! That will definitely be my burrito of choice, the next time I visit here. And I *will* visit again, especially after reading favorable reviews of their horchatas :-)

BTW... the onions &amp; cilantro on the tacos were very fresh &amp; tasty. They made enough of a good impression on me to mention here !

Salsa rocho (red) had a good charred taste with mild to no heat. Salsa verde (green) had an almost-spoiled taste (?!) with moderate heat.

The cashier &amp; waitress girls (late night) were also *very* polite."

If you are driving by, or in the area, by all means try it.  But don&#39;t go too far out of your way.

The steak is NOT the best around.  Maybe the best on Lake St in Addison, but not worthy of lofty praises some bestow upon it.  If you think it&#39;s the best, take a fifteen minute ride west to Hacienda de Roselle and try that.  Then, come back here and tell me this is benchmark quality (there are better places than Hacienda de Roselle, but I can&#39;t think of one in this area).

Slightly better than average taco stand fare in big porttions at average prices served by nice people in a place clean enough to pass inspection.  That just about sums it up."

I am glad the prices haven&#39;t gone up ($5.99 for a regular bowl) in the last several years and the meal portions are still reasonable. My Pesto Cavatappi was just as wonderful as I remembered; the size of the Caesar salad disappointed me, but whatever. If you do decide to add meat or sides to your meal, the price does add up, but it&#39;s fine if you stay simple.

They use very fresh and appetizing ingredients, which is a variable that makes all the difference in the world to a (I admit, highly Americanized) Thai noodle joint. Also like Chipotle, they kick out food in very rapid succession in an assembly line type of fashion. So no need to feel intimidated if the line is long and you are on your lunch hour, as they kick out product lightning quick. From the time to place your order until the time you are paying for it will be 2-3 min tops. 

As for the food itself, it is pretty spectacular for it&#39;s type. I have been here several times since it is so close to my office and handy for a quick lunch. I have yet to get a bad bowl. Consistency is an important variable to places like this, and thus far they have held up their end of the bargain. If you want to throw caution into the wind as far as nutrition, go for the mac and cheese bowl with parmesan chicken. It is creamy and fantastic, and with a little Sriracha it&#39;s absolutely heavenly and worth a little extra time of cardio. Trust me! 

On my most recent visit I decided to go more traditional and opted for the Tomato Bisque and Bangkok Curry with shrimp. The soup was amazingly good, with a tangy like zip of flavor that was very satisfying. On my previous visit, the chicken noodle was not as good. It was loaded with great ingredients, but the broth was somewhat bland. Not the case with the bisque, as it was phe-nom-nom-inal! 

The Bangkok curry dish was also fantastic, and they did not overdo it on the curry either. This tends to be the case at many places that serve a similar dish. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the flavor of curry, but when they go overboard to the point that I need to take a half hour shower and gargle bleach before even attempting to come near my GF, I would call that problematic. Cheap Indian joints are notorious for this. I envision kitchen exchanges in places like those to be something to the effect of: 

Cook 1- &#34;Oh, the flavor is a bit off, you say...?&#34; 

Cook 2- &#34;No problem, just add 12 cups of curry powder to the sauce and it should fix it right up&#34;. 

Yeah, lame! 


The noodles themselves were not sticking together and tasted very fresh and the vegetables were also a cut above average. I like my vegetables to still maintain a minor amount of firmness, not be cooked to mush like you get at a Mongolian BBQ, so good marks there. 

Lastly, service from the staff here has always been friendly during my visits and the restaurant has always been clean. 

Overall, this is a great option if you are in the area and want to grab a bite. Not worth traveling a great distance for, but the food is quite good and it&#39;s inexpensive enough that it&#39;s not going to be a problem if you stick to a budget. Yes, it&#39;s a chain, which tends to bring out harshness by those with a pretentiousness complex, but I can assure you that the food stands well on it&#39;s own merits."

Generally the food is decent, the portions are decent, and the price is decent.  There is not really a wow factor here but consistency does have its merit.  

I noticed they have a lot of baked dessert goods (rice crispy treats, cookies, and brownies) that look good but I have not indulged to date.  

Overall noodles &amp; co. is a good place for a quick lunch.  You will get a decent amount of food for a decent price in a generally clean environment from generally friendly people."

We ordered a macaroni kids meal, though the apples &#34;tasted like bug spray&#34; to my daughter, probably due to whatever lemon type stuff they put on the slices to keep them fresh (it did not taste like plain lemon juice).

N&amp;C is a always a good alternative to the usual.

I ordered the Pesto Cavatappi, and added a grilled chicken to it (added cost). Second time ordering it and it&#39;s just fantastic. Best part about this place is they have Sriracha sauce on hand, and well, everything is always better with Sriracha on it!!

The service was quick today and our food only took a few minutes to come out, and I must say, it was pretty good."

Could we call it the noodles version of Pei Wei? It has more variety in terms of cuisine, but when you are presented the menu it works the same way.  You pick a flavor - different cuisines like Asian (Bangkok Curry was very good, Pad Thai was pretty good) to Italian (Pesto Cavatappi) to American (Mac&#39;n&#39;Cheese) - and then protein (Pork was great, shrimp was OK).  There is a gluten-free/carb-watcher options where you can order &#39;in the buff&#39; by swapping out the noodles for a bed of spinach and an included protein and extra veg.  (I wanted to go &#39;buff&#39; but with noodles also, but didn&#39;t try on my first visit).

The people at the front were great helping us navigate the menu and options our first time.  And also making sure we enjoyed our dish as we ate.  The regular sized order is plenty enough food for the price with the protein, has a good mix of veggies to noodles to protein.

There was no way to have them make a dish spicy in the kitchen, but they do have a sriracha sauce and slammin&#39; spice blend that adds enough to your dish to get the job done.  (For real, that &#39;Smoulder From Boulder&#39; blend of just red chili/black pepper/cayenne and paprika was great).

We&#39;ll be back."

My best friend and I both got a small bowl of the Wisconsin Mac, and it just wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. It certainly helped that it costs less than $5, but that doesn&#39;t excuse getting elbow noodles with a pinch of shredded cheddar, plus a few drops of liquid cheese below, but not enough to balance the noodles. I was really excited when the bowl landed, because the noodles are cheese-colored... then I realized they were bare, apart from the few shredded pieces, haha. Honestly, given the choice, I would rather make boxed mac &amp; cheese.

That said, service was prompt, price was right for eating out, and I was just thrilled to be with my best friend. If/when we come back, I&#39;m ordering something else."

This is the newer location in Schaumburg across from Costco. It was not particularly crowded. I ordered Pad Thai. It was okay - not as good as I would expect to get from a real Thai restaurant. But, it was certainly fresh and filling.

Here, you order at the counter and they deliver it to you when it&#39;s ready. At least you know it is freshly made. This is not my favorite way of being served at a restaurant, which probably accounts for the three stars more than anything.

I had water, but I noticed they had one of those new Coke Freestyle machines for those that are fans. (I like &#39;em but it takes too long when somebody doesn&#39;t know what they want.)

Got my dish of noodles but immediately surprised by the amount of bean sprouts littered atop my meal. Not cooked, but I guess it works. Mixed in with the noodles, the crispness came down making it more manageable to eat. I didn&#39;t realize this was a spicy dish, but that&#39;s ok. I can scarf down kimchi like nobody&#39;s business. Noodles were good but tasted a bit too close to pad thai for my liking. Chicken was cut flat, and was dry.

Will I come again? Given the choice of an authentic Thai/Indonesian restaurant or Noodles &amp; Co., probably not. Was the food bad? Not really, but it wasn&#39;t great either."

The service was super fast, the location is very convenient to my work, and the dish I had was quite good. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this but I&#39;m about to give a chain noodles place 5 stars.

I was sent a coupon because it was my birthday so I ended up getting my dish for free. However, for a regular sized portion of pad thai with no meat or tofu it&#39;s $5.25. For me, that is perfect because I prefer my pad thai without any meat. So in the end, I would end up getting a cheaper pad thai then if I ordered from any other Thai place. For those meat eaters out there, it&#39;s $2 extra though! And veggies can run $1 extra! This could really add up. So my big, bargain lunch at $5.25 could be your more expensive $8.25 dish and you probably wouldn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re getting such a good deal at lunch. Got all that? :P

I was skeptical getting pad thai from a non-Thai place but was pleasantly surprised. I absolutely loved it! The portion was big, the flavor was spot on for me. It had less calories then other items on the menu, as well. I&#39;m super weak with spicy stuff and this had a kick to it for me. However, it was the perfect amount...a little kick but it truly enhanced the flavor. My mouth was on fire when I finished eating! I&#39;m such a weak sauce.

All in all, I&#39;m glad I got the coupon for the free lunch because I see myself coming back here a lot of lunch!"

Funny how free things can do that to a person.

Mostly because they don&#39;t hide the fact that what you&#39;re getting is about as far away from authentic Thai cuisine as Earth is from the sun. They don&#39;t argue the distance, they just do their best to make up the lost ground in a pinch.

Pad Thai, Japanese Pan Noodles and Indonesian Peanut Saute are all fantastic choices for someone looking for a comparable dish to appease cravings for Southeast Asian cuisine when the real thing isn&#39;t available, a bit pricier or your preferred locale is closed. The important thing to remember is setting expectations within appropriate bounds and still relishing that, all things considered, it isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s something. 

The location is great without ever feeling cramped and is ultimately inviting. The staff is awesome and is more than happy to accommodate even exceptionally outlandish requests, within reason of course, regardless of how far it may deviate off the menu. For a place that serves off-shoot cuisine, it&#39;s my preferable locale, hands down.

That being said, my favorite is the Pad Thai, without a doubt. Be sure to have them add extra shrimp, twice. Trust me, you won&#39;t regret it. If you enjoy a bit of variety, which is the spice of life, be sure to nab a bottle of sriracha and give it a bit more of kick. You might enjoy it a lot more than you think.

I think if there is one thing I can really complain about is the cost, which can spiral above $30 for two to have a satisfying meal. This isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, after all you&#39;re paying for this food in a pinch, but at the same time - not being a monopoly guy and all - it is certainly a back alley knock to the gut for anyone&#39;s wallet when looking for Thai on a budget.

Ultimately, despite invariably countless Noodles &amp; Co scattered about the area, this one sticks out in my mind. Not necessarily for the food, but for the service, which has proven to consistently be spot on when my wife and I step in. If you&#39;re looking for authentic though, it still bears mentioning, there are plenty of alternatives."

Avoid getting there at noon - lineups get long and seats scarce.  Typically service is good, though there were a few bumps when they first opened up  - very normal.

I usually order small with meat and a rice-krispie square and it ends up being around $7 to $8 if memory serves.  (Did I mention?  Great rice krispie squares, one of my favorites).

Would I recommend:  Yes
Would I return:  Yes"

How about waiting for about 10 minutes and after having waived to everybody  including the people who clean tables, feel like making an attempt to jump over the counter, grab your food and run?

That&#39;s almost what I did at this restaurant. The army of clueless people running into each other behind the counter did everything possible other than handing me my food until someone decided to finally hand me my bag with pasta that had been sitting there for almost 15 min. I was trying to eat before a meeting and by the time I got back to the office, I was hungrier, angrier and late. When I opened the container with my Caesar Salad, a surprise!!!! NO DRESSING! Yay!

I went during lunchtime and the service was super fast.  They also had a carry-out register.  My order took about a minute to cook and I was on my way.  But I didn&#39;t enjoy my lunch very much, so I&#39;m not sure about coming back."

I ordered a regular size mac &amp; cheese with meatballs and a drink and it came to $10-something. The cashier failed to give me a receipt (and almost forgot to give me a cup for my drink...had to ask for a cup) and I felt silly for getting back in line and asking for it (ridiculous, I know). I&#39;ve ordered from this location before (similar order) and it never came to that much. I understand Schaumburg has a high tax but not that high...a $2-4 increase since end of December???  Rats, I wish I asked for my receipt. 

The food at this location is of the same consistency/quality as other locations so no complaints there. My only suggestion would be to have a bench or something where to-go patrons can sit while waiting for their order.

They lost 2 stars because I didn&#39;t like what I ordered- because I ordered based on the employees suggestion that I would LOVE the dish she had in mind... It wasn&#39;t packed full of spicy flavors as I expected per the cashier&#39;s insistence so I was sorta bummed...They gained a star back because when I left the manager gave me a free dish card due to the fact that she watched me struggle to pick through my dish and eat only certain parts of it! 

The restaurant was very clean on the inside. I went right at opening time, my food was prepared hot and fresh to order. This place filled up fast... For a fast food restaurant I was served on real dishes with real silverware. I almost felt obligated to TIP! 

They also served wine and beer here, I have been to Noodles &amp; Co. only one other time- in Michigan and I don&#39;t recall the dishes or the alcoholic beverages.

We had been to a Noodles many years ago, but wanted to give it another try. We got the Japanese Noodles and Pad Thai. We waited a few minutes while our food was being prepared and one of the women working there handed a full try to another woman and said &#34;here, you take this.&#34; The woman was already helping another customer, but took the tray from her anyways. then the first woman laughed and said &#34;she doesn&#39;t do anything anyways!&#34; It was sickening to watch it! 
Once we brought the food home, we kept sniffing around thinking our dog had an accident near by, only to find that it was the smell of the food! So horrible! Th cucumber tomato salad is not a salad, just chopped tomatoes and cucumbers, not even any seasoning or dressing! We were so disappointed!

I got the Japanese Noodles with Thai Soup. My husband got the Red-based American pasta with basil tomato soup. (Please excuse my lack of knowledge on names. I do not have the menu in front of me and honestly, I&#39;m too lazy to look it up.)

The dining room was messy and dirty.  We moved 2 tables until we found one that wasn&#39;t sticky. The restrooms were DISGUTING and smelled of urine even in the hallways. I don&#39;t think they were tended to all weekend.

The food was as good as usual but we left there saying to each other that we would NEVER go there again and would stick to our ParkRidge location in future. No comparison. It was late and we were too hungry to go somewhere else. I&#39;m not sure how they keep their franchise licence. If the Health Dept. came in they would be fined at the least. I wonder now about the kitchen....yuck. 

The worst part...

I broke out with a cold sore on my lip in the following next few days..and I&#39;ve never had one in my life. I&#39;ve read it could be transferred from silverware....and suspect it was from the Noodle &amp; Co.

The place is pleasant enough, but kind of has a &#34;Marriott&#34; vibe to it, if that makes any sense.  Very commercial fabrics, lighting, etc.  I ordered a spicy asian noodle dish with tofu, and sat down.  The noodles were pretty tasty, albeit a bit greasy for my liking.  But the tofu sucked.

No matter what I get it with, it is my favorite pasta dish in the ENTIRE WORLD! No exaggeration. 

Other dishes that are good (like...if I&#39;m eating a bite of my family&#39;s lunch because I&#39;m eating the PENNE ROSA) are the mac &amp; cheese, butter noodles and Mediterranean salad.

There&#39;s tons of ways to customize your dish (adding meat, extra veggies, or removing anything that you don&#39;t like), and super accommodating with allergies too.  Whenever I go there and order my dish with rice pasta instead, a manager swipes a card to alert the people making the food that there&#39;s an allergy.  I&#39;ve never had a reaction when they do the allergy alert card swipe thing, and their mac &#39;n cheese with rice noodles is really good.  Back before I found out I had allergies, I loved their pesto cavatappi! The noodles were always perfectly done, and their pesto sauce mixed with the chopped tomatoes was always a good combination.  They recently introduced family size dishes, so if everyone is getting the same thing, it&#39;s a good option to cut down on costs.

It was like a dance contest to see who could go the longest without cleaning the table. The competition was fierce. I will have to really give it a strong thought before I head BACK TO THIS SPOT AGAIN."

Much of the menu I wouldn&#39;t order because I&#39;m a picky eater, but the mac &amp; cheese here is really good so I usually order that.  I don&#39;t come to Noodles &amp; Co very often since it&#39;s hard to justify spending $9 for a single serving of mac &amp; cheese when I can easily make 9 times as much at home for the same price.  I wanted to try the parmesan crusted chicken with my mac since it came so highly recommended, but when I ordered it, the girl at the register said that they were out, super weak for a Saturday afternoon.  A little distraught, I just ordered the pasta with no add-ons &amp; a water to drink.  The girl told me I could have soda for free since they were out of the chicken, I didn&#39;t think much of it until I saw the Coke Freestyle machine.  I heard all about these but never actually used one first hand.  As cool as these machines are, this location has 1, which can only be used by 1 person at a time, so during busy times, there will almost certainly be a line of people trying to figure out which flavor to choose let alone how to work said machine.  My pasta was brought out just after I sat down which was uber quick &amp; even though it was sans chicken, it was delicious &amp; only cost me the equivalent of 5 servings instead of the usual 9."

I guess I&#39;m not really suprised since noodles really are best served fresh. Preparing pounds of noodles in anticipation of a lunch crowd that needs to be served in less than 5 minutes, probably compromises the quality of the noodles.  Oh well.  The sad thing is that the other ingredients are so good!   I had their mushroom stroganoff, and everything but the noodles (once again) was delish!  They do have fresh bread, which is quite tasty.  The staff is nice and efficiant.  Overall, not a terrible experience, but  don&#39;t come in expecting a great noodle dish."

My family and I have been going to Pepe&#39;s ever since my mom and I moved to the area (my stepdad and stepbrothers have been regulars all their lives, I believe). But, it&#39;s always been consistently good every time we&#39;ve gone! I it&#39;s still just as good nowadays when I visit my parents as it was back in high school.

Most recently, I went there with my parents about a week ago when i was in town. The salsa is still amazing (I downed I think 3 bowlfuls myself!!) and the chips are plentiful, warm, and fresh. I ordered the fajitas, my stepdad ordered the veggie burrito suizas, and my mom got enchiladas suizas, as usual. We all really enjoyed our meals. My fajitas did have an unusually large amount of onions, but I just pushed whatever I didn&#39;t want to the side. the quantity was STILL enough that I had PLENTY of leftovers to take home. 

Service was great as usual. My parents love Leo and always ask for him as a server when we go in, so he definitely took care of us! And the busboys were always on top of keeping our salsa bowls and waters full :) 

In the past I&#39;ve had enchiladas, their burrito suiza, chile rellanos, quesadillas, and tacos and honestly I&#39;ve never really had a complaint about any of their food. For birthdays, they bring out a complimentary sopapilla which is always SUPER delicious. I think they automaticaly put strawberry sauce on this, so if we&#39;re there for a birthday, we&#39;ll request them to change it to chocolate (our preference).

I always look forward to visiting pepe&#39;s when I&#39;m back in the Chicago area and I can&#39;t wait until I&#39;m there again! :)"

It is definitely a more Americanized Mexican food. The place is not a big place but plenty for a small family or friends. I noticed a lot of people having different kind of drinks on their table so I&#39;m sure they must be good. Everyone that was in there had some sort of margarita so that was good and would probably be the only reason to eat there. If your going to just eat food I would suggest saving your money and going to Taco Bell across the street. The waiter was nice as well as the restraint itself. There was one waiter for like 10+tables so the service was a Little slow.

My family and I have been coming here and are repeat customers. However, this was by far the WORST service I have ever received; lets just say, I could have gotten better service at TACOBELL down the street. We all sat down, waiter (very rude and had an attitude) took drink orders. Clearly, he wasn&#39;t using his memory- he forgot half of the tables drinks and we had to re-order our WATER. Next, it took 30 min just to put in our order for food. Come on, 30 mins? I understand you are busy and the place is packed, but 30 mins to just take our order?

He takes our orders, rolls his eyes, and then goes. Our food came and everything was fine. NEVER did he come by to check on us or on our food. He came 30 min later to see if we were done. We requested the bill. We were all walking out, and he came outside to flag us down. He said &#34;you only tipped me that much? I did you a favor when one of your members made a ordering mistake. You need to tip more&#34;. WHAT! SERIOUSLY? YOU WANT ME TO TIP MORE JUST BECAUSE YOU TELL ME TO? IS THAT HOW TIPPING WORKS? 

This guy made me come back inside and he tried to get more money out of me. Obviously SERVICE was horrible and I was not about to tip him more money. Haha best thing yet, the dumb front desk lady then comments &#34;Oh you are only tipping that much of that bill? you need to put more&#34; WTF

AND then the guy starts slamming shit infront of us. Are you kidding me?

I wish I went to TACOBELL instead of this disrespectful place. DO NOT teach me how to tip. I know good service from bad, NOT YOU. THANK GOD i didn&#39;t use my credit card. Also, STOP SERVING ALCOHOL TO MINORS! I hope this place runs out of business. NEVER WILL COME BACK HERE IN MY LIFE!"

First and foremost, our waiter was awesome. Made friendly side chit-chat with us - super personable! Immediately would refill our drinks and are chips and salsa without us having to ask. Definitely above and beyond expectations...

We both ordered the Mayan - rice and beans, enchilada, tostada, and a taco. It was delicious and filling! Came in a reasonable time too. 

CHIPS AND SALSA - we definitely read the Yelp reviews of the &#34;ketchup&#34; salsa before we left - we have NO IDEA what people are talking about......it was good, and the chips were better than other mexican restaurant &#34;leftover&#34; chips that I am use to.

We also ordered the 60 ounce pitcher of the on the rocks, strawberry margarita - wasn&#39;t the strongest in comparison to other restaurants I&#39;ve been to, but definitely did the job. :D

Unfortunately, Pepe&#39;s hasn&#39;t kept up with the times. While most Mexican restaurants nowadays offer the standard tacos, enchiladas and burritos infused with flavor and/or regional Mexican fare that is out of this world, Pepe&#39;s remains mired in the 70&#39;s. 

A trip to Pepe&#39;s nowadays consists of what looks like a dish from &#34;your grocer&#39;s freezer&#34; that&#39;s been in the oven for 40 minutes and placed on your plate. That&#39;s how I felt after the last time I left this place. Really disappointing to see that a place that was a forerunner of Mexican eats in Chicago hasn&#39;t done squat to keep up with the times.

This restaurant has been my favorite since I went there the first time.  Besides the food just being wonderful, the customer service goes far beyond what I would expect at todays establishments.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  I am going back today for my birthday!!!"

I&#39;ve been to other ones and the food is not as good. My whole family has been going to this place for as long as I can remember. Never once have I had bad service here. You just have to know when to go - eariler in the week when it is not completely packed.

the chips and salsa had no taste, the salsa tasted like ketchup, lacked any real flavor.

the food came out suspiciously fast, the cheese looked like they melted a cheap slice of american cheese. i ordered the mayan (taco, tostada, enchilada) and everything was bland and the cheese was fake plastic tasting.

last time i went to pepe&#39;s was probably 4 years ago but this last visit convinced me to never eat pepe&#39;s again.

also, if you want spicy more flavorful salsa with your chips they charge you extra for it, and even that wasn&#39;t good!

ridic. like in a bad way."

We were pleasantly surprised however. I had the Carne Asada Tampequina (sp?) with a Carnita taco. The meal comes with ranchero sauce, a taco, tosada or enchilada on the side, rice &amp; beans, guacamole and chips. My husband had the burrito. We have been back a few times now and both get the Carne Asada. One negative is the  Margaritas are very weak. Service is great though. Give this place a try."

We were seated right away and the chips and salsa came quickly. The waiter was really friendly but seemed to be the only one working the whole place. The food came out and was ok. There wasn&#39;t much flavor but it was hot and the portion size was large. It was difficult to get our drinks refilled. We actually walked up to the carry out area to get our drinks refilled. The dining experience was ok. It was better then taco bell.

Go to Taco Bell...food is 10 times better and you will spend less.  I&#39;ve been to Pepe&#39;s once (oh about 7 years ago), my grandma used to always rave about it from when her and her girlfriends went back in the 80&#39;s(?).  So, I wanted to take my daughters out to eat last Saturday night.  I wanted Mexican and thought, what the heck?  Haven&#39;t been to Pepe&#39;s in forever, it&#39;s right down the street...SURE WHY NOT?  Well, upon turning onto New Wilke, I&#39;m reminded that a Grande Jakes recently (a year and a half maybe?) opened kiddy-corner from Pepe&#39;s.  Should we go to Grande Jakes?  I&#39;ve been to the one in Buffalo Grove...not earth shattering, but still good food.  Nah, I want to go to a &#39;restaurant&#39;.  We pull into the parking lot...VERY empty.  Well, it is only about 5:15...a little early for Saturday night &#39;dinner rush&#39;.  We go in, are seated on the &#39;homely&#39; side (I think this is where you get put if you have children with you (mine are 2 and 6)..it seems distant and lonely...plus one of the bus boys phones was literally on the windowsill right next to my seat.  Anyway, we get our drinks.  Me a diet coke (wtf...tastes like it was from the soda box they opened when they maybe opened this restaurant), 6 y/o gets lemonade (um, pretty much water with a splash of lemon), 2 y/o gets apple juice (thankfully that is decent).  Chips and TOMATO FLAVORED WATER???!  Basket of tortilla chips and two bowls of &#39;salsa&#39; were placed on the table.  The waiter said this one is mild, this one is spicy.  Ummm, they both taste like water with a hint of tomato.  I ask for something spicy...I&#39;m given a orangish version with green onions.  A TEENY bit spicier...but still tastes like water.  No point in eating this.  My 6 y/o got cheese quesadilla and fries, 2 y/o got cheese quesadillas and rice and I got ground beef burrito dinner (rice and beans).  6 year old would not eat quesadillas after one bite.  Her fries were edible (no salt, but ketchup helps).  Baby was pretty good with her food..well, for a 2 year old.  I will admit rice and beans were pretty good.  The burrito however...first of all, was not ground beef.  You know that &#39;chili&#39; you buy in a can (Hormel?)..yea, that chili that is in a nut shell a mix of &#39;beef&#39; and textured soy protein??  THAT is what the &#39;ground beef&#39; in my burrito was.  It was that chili mixed with beans, thrown in a tortilla and topped with orange cheddar(?) cheese.  I took two bites and couldn&#39;t handle it.  Oh and this burrito was only slightly larger than the cheap yumminess of a Taco Bell burrito.  As &#39;garnishment&#39; on the plate there was lettuce and a dollop of sour cream.  I didn&#39;t sour cream is sweet???  Yuck.  Lettuce was good though :)  Me and the kids were not asked how our meal was or if we needed anything...NOT ONCE.  Finally I got the waiters attention and asked for to go containers (we had no intention of eating this slop, but I&#39;m not one to make a scene unfortunately).  I had no intention of leaving a tip (terrible service, terrible food)...but I&#39;m a softy.  When the waiter brought the bill, he brought my girls each a snack bag of Teddy Grahams.  DAMN.  Bill came out to 25...I paid 30 and said keep the change.  I fumed the whole way home about this experience.  I could&#39;ve gone to Taco Bell for HALF the price and would have been EXTREMELY satisfied.  Instead I spent $30 on basically one of the worst meals of my life when I could&#39;ve spent that at a different place for 10 times better quality.  Don&#39;t waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I always have to order to go a bag of chips n salsa after I eat there. Salsa is definately 5 stars.

The portion sizes are so small now for the price. I went ordered the Carne Asada. They brought me a pack of cards size steak, only not that thick. The thickness was about a half an inch, and burnt. 

They changed their beans, yuck.

Now, we started going to Good Tequila&#39;s in Elk Grove Village. Excellent food and prices. Don&#39;t waste your money on Pepe&#39;s anymore. Never going back again."
pepes-mexican-restaurant-rolling-mdws,John D.,o5_XdeOR72gWp1P3cPxujQ,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,1,0,0,57,DK0t88Du450TYFcUYPx-HA,4.0,2011-09-30,"After reading the other reviews (including the filtered ones) I am glad to agree that this particular Pepe&#39;s does not represent the chain at all.  In my opinion it&#39;s much better than all the rest.  Here&#39;s why:

1. Many of the poor reviewers are expecting authentic Mexican cuisine.  You will not get that here.  This is &#34;Americanized&#34; Mexican food.  I have to ask for my order to be &#34;extra spicy&#34;.  The American &#34;bland&#34; flavor makes it so I can still take my wife and grandma here without them having nothing to eat.

2. You know what? The Carne Asada sucks here, the same as it does at the Orland Park location and every other location.  I have tried other locations and they are terrible.  In fact, this is the only Pepe&#39;s I will go to in Chicagoland.  If you want a good Mexican steak, try a Mexican steakhouse like La Magdalena in Schaumburg.  If you&#39;re not ordering an actual steak I hope you enjoy your $15 filet mignon tacos - after La Magdalena overcooks the meat they taste similar to the steak tacos for $7.50 here.  But whatever, pay for what you like!

3. Speaking of tacos, this is the only place I&#39;ve ever had &#34;stuffed&#34; tacos other than taco bell.  That&#39;s right: it&#39;s a real taco, from a restaurant, not fast food garbage, that puts real chihuahua cheese between 2 tortillas.  For an extra 50 cents per taco.  Yes they are twice as delicious.  Yes they are twice as filling.  Yes you only need to order half as many.  Yes, I am a large man with a huge appetite and I get full with 3 stuffed instead of 6 regular (or 12 regular at taco bell, which are kind of gross/fast food-y anyway).  Yes, the option is barely noticeable on the menu and they only offer it if you know to ask for it.  I skip the rice &amp; beans sides (3 taco &#34;dinner&#34;) and just order 5 individual tacos at the 3 taco dinner price so I have 2 left over for lunch the next day.  They reheat perfect, so you can&#39;t over order them in case you&#39;re worried.  Get 5 or 10, they&#39;ll be perfect for a couple days in your fridge and almost as good microwaved as they were fresh.  You&#39;re welcome.

 4. The Queso Fundito appetizer is fantastic.  It&#39;s Mexican fondue.  It&#39;s slightly better in multiple places in Chicago proper (better Mexican cheese ratio?) but will cost twice as much for half as much food.  This appetizer goes great with:

5: The giant F-ing margarita!  Get the La Siesta.  For 1 person it is aptly named.  Split it between 2 people or order it for your date if you&#39;re under 30 and want a fun night (my wife has convinced me to order it many times because she prefers to drive!).  It&#39;s like half a pitcher.  It costs about $12.  It comes in a giant glass you can take home for an extra 5 bucks if you want.  What&#39;s not to love?

6. The shrimp.  Sure, it&#39;s a grandma dish - my grandma loves the shrimp quesadillas.  But I&#39;ve tried them.  They&#39;re huge shrimp they put in those things, and it&#39;s still only about $9.00.  Sometimes old people have good taste!

7. The salad.  Yeah, it&#39;s stupid to care about taco salad at a Mexican restaurant, but a lot of people do.  My wife orders it, and it&#39;s great for someone who isn&#39;t sure they like Mexican food at all or anyone who just wants a really good, giant salad.  It comes with the best shell I&#39;ve ever seen and fresh fruit (fresh melon slices, strawberries, pinnapple, etc.). Total waste of $ compared to a grocery store except for the homemade shell (just like taco bell but huge and not lousy).  Still a great deal at about $9.00 when you consider how big it is/fancy it looks and the possible combination with the $12 giant margarita (why didn&#39;t I remember this stuff when I was in college?!?)

8. The waitstaff.  They&#39;re the best.  They&#39;ll bring you extra chips without asking.  They&#39;ll bring you the super-hot sauce for free if you request it (it&#39;s American-Mexican remember -- most flavor is cheese, not spicy).  One guy worked his way up from busboy to waiter and now basically runs the place.  I forget his name, but if you get him you&#39;ll know it because the service will be perfect.  The other waitstaff... well, they change over the years, so it&#39;s a crap shoot.  Just look for the 6 foot +, dark haired (short hair), clean shaven, clean, light skinned Mexican guy and ask for him specifically to serve you.  He&#39;s also the host and the defacto manager, but if you request him he&#39;ll do it and everything will be PERFECT.

9. Yeah, the decor is stuck in the 70&#39;s as is the food.  If you don&#39;t like it, eat somewhere that&#39;s more trendy.  La Magdalena (expensive) or Fuego (also excellent, though much more authentic &amp; expensive).  Hell, if you&#39;re under 25 try Salsa 17: you might like it if you also like TGI Fridays.  However:

If you just want a reasonable night out that might actually impress someone, try this particular Pepe&#39;s.  In the race of chains it beats its&#39; sister restaurants like a fully fueled Corvette beats a malnourished turtle.  Like always, just make sure you know how to order and which wait staff to ask for.

Happy dining!
John"

First off, I was in Rolling Meadows for a job fair and decided to stop by here after it had been over. We were greeted and brought to our tables and given the salsa and tortilla chips, as every Mexican place has ever done. I ordered a beer and a friend of mine ordered a margarita. I also ordered the steak taco dinner meal with cilantro and onions. This is why it gets 1 star. The tacos I was given were in a wrapper and you can tell that the tacos had been reheated and not cooked. How could I tell? Well for one, the wrapper was stuck to the taco and the steak I bit into wasn&#39;t even hot. It was lukewarm! You could tell they just warmed it up followed by dumping the onions and cilantro on. Not to mention that for a non authentic Mexican restaurant, the place is pretty expensive for low quality food."

I had crisp corn tortilla beef tacos, and the crisp tortilla looked and tasted like the ones from the &#34;taco kits&#34; you can buy in the grocery store, which suck.  Too much lettuce, and not much else as far as the normal garnish that you find in a decent Mexican restaurant.

The place was pretty good a number of years ago, but it has gone down-hill with respect to the food.  The service was good, but I will not go back there again"

The food may not be the most &#34;authentic&#34;, but this is what I grew up on. This is our constant and we&#39;re all really happy with it. The busboys know who we are and they always bring us extra salsa because they&#39;d end up wearing out the carpet bringing us more while we wait for our food. I literally could eat a gallon of their salsa everyday, no chips needed just a big spoon."

If you remember Chi-Chi&#39;s, think food similar to that,  with a little more spice.    There&#39;s never a long wait, and the food is pretty decently priced. If you&#39;re a margarita person, they&#39;re very good and large for the price.

This place should have 0 stars. That&#39;s as simple as I can put it. Please listen to all the other reviews with one or two stars, this place is not worth your money, time, or patience. 

We arrived and we were the only table around 7:30PM Sunday night, and were greeted by a server that was not so inviting or happy. I&#39;m not over exaggerating my experience, I had to write a review so you guys stay clear of this restaurant until things start to turn around. The sushi was kid sized and I&#39;m not kidding, the time we waited for our rolls was around 30 minutes, remember, we were the only table. Our waters were barely refilled, we had to ask for our tea to be refilled, when again, we were the only table there. The proportion is just not worth it, and I know I had to write a review to warn everyone about this place, it&#39;s honestly not worth it and please don&#39;t go.

DON&#39;T COME HERE IF YOU LIKE GOOD SUSHI, REGULAR PORTIONS, AND GOOD SERVICE. 

I know it looks like I&#39;m being rash but it&#39;s true, I don&#39;t know what else to say, don&#39;t even go here if you have a Groupon coupon please, save your time I don&#39;t know how anyone can rate this place more than 1 star and I can&#39;t even imagine what service would be like if there was tables than just us (a party of 4). 

I never write reviews, but this is an exception."

Edememe comes free of charge as an appetizer, along with warm hand wipes and a personal water pitcher. VERY nice welcome. The sushi is fantastic! The cuts are thick and melt in your mouth!

We were even happier to find out that they had a Groupon deal ($15 for $30) so we purchased that and had our dinner here. Sometimes, when you purchase things on Groupon, you do wonder why they needed to have a promo and sometimes you figure out why. 

I don&#39;t think this place is bad, it&#39;s decent, but unfortunately, it&#39;s not what I expected in terms of taste and especially price. Even with our Groupon, we had to really budget and spent a bit extra just to feel a bit satiated. My first impression was that this place must be under renovations or something because from a look-standpoint, they were very bare in terms of decor. Even their menu was just a sheet of printer paper inserted into sheet protectors being tied together by a ribbon. There was no sign of &#39;under constructions&#34; and previous historic reviews for this place went back as far as 4 years ago so I was a bit confused by the look of it. They also didn&#39;t have that many tables set up and the layout seemed a little bit not as flowy. The overall ambiance of this place felt like it was a place that just opened and haven&#39;t quite settled into their decor or feel established.

Service was very nice and friendly though and even their sushi chefs seems to speak Japanese or Korean or some sort of authentic language so that impressed me a bit. However, the overall taste of the food was just okay. 

The rice in the maki wasn&#39;t moist, it was dry and the seaweed wrap was too chewy. The content inside the maki was okay portion and flavor was kind of bland. They gave sauces to dip on the side which is good, but I prefer the sauces inside my rolls to really let the flavor sink in. Each slices of maki was very thin and small. I couldn&#39;t tell if this is how sushi really is and I&#39;ve just been too used to bigger rolls that got super-sized or what, but I felt like it wasn&#39;t really worth the money. They had sushi maki rolls range from $5 to the upper teens. But even when we ordered a Caterpillar roll at $9, it was the thinnest and smallest 8-piece roll I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;ve had other house special rolls that priced around $14 that were much bigger, and I think I almost prefer a big roll that is priced higher than a medium priced one that is so tiny... 

Psychologically, the price and the portions at this place just didn&#39;t jive for me. The food unfortunately, wasn&#39;t spectacular enough for me to really rave about it. I think it&#39;s decent, but until I have a more interesting experience here, I can&#39;t say it really stand out among other sushi places."

Plus my kids love it. New owner is making changes - we are hoping he is careful and doesn&#39;t blow it. Used to have the best maguro crunch but he no longer offers it.  Getting a little cheap on some ingredients.  But still great sushi. 

With that being said, I still give it 4 stars because it used to be five stars.  Food is still delishous. 

Someone needs to help this guy turn this place into a money maker, it should be busy all the time.  If they advertised but I know that costs money. I don&#39;t have time for restaurant business or else I would turn this places second goal an obvious sushi catering service !!!

Remember at sushi restaurants, your food takes time so do not expect instant service. When I order for my family we get carry out because it is much quicker !!!  

You must try New Doctor Roll !!! You won&#39;t want to share it !!  

Salmon teriyaki is my other favorite.  Juicy hunk of salmon (NOT frozen cut slab of farm raised dryness) almost seems poached.  Mmmmm...

Small place, not flashy, but good flavors!!!"

My fiancé and I finally got carryout from here tonight because of all the great reviews... and the tofu salad which was supposed to be vegetarian had crabmeat all over it. Food was way overpriced for the taste. And even though we ordered 6 maki they only gave us a TEENY portion of wasabi &amp; a TEENY portion of ginger.

We went there with high expectations and left without getting any food.  We were there at 5:30 and were 1 of 2 tables that was seated.  The lone server was engaged with the other table so the chef gave us the menus.  The server came over and took our drink order and returned with our drinks. That was the last contact we had with her.  She assisted the other table and then waited on a couple of pick up orders. That would have been ok but that took about 20 minutes.  My back was to the chef but my wife told me he was well aware of the situation but wasn&#39;t doing anything about it. So we decided to leave. At that point all the chef could do was muster up an &#34;i&#39;m sorry&#39;, so I replied that his service was sorry.  My advice, try another place.  Did I also mention that the prices seemed high."

The sushi when made by the head chef (and I&#39;m guessing owner) is great, many of his dishes on the menu are unique and innovative! Some are over price for what you receive though. When the food is prepared by under staff it can be very hit and miss, sushi falling apart when you pick it up with sub par, thinly sliced fish. Wait service can be friendly but terrible too, taking forever to take orders, bring orders, etc....one staff in particular is so timid and bad I now shy away from going here and look else where. It&#39;s hard to stomach the combo of bad service, high prices and walking away still hungry."

I live in the city, but will come back to the suburbs for dinner with my mother.  When we heard from a family friend about Sakuma, we had to give it a try.  We had to prebook two days in advance and allow the chef to prep their menu, and to ensure they had the appropriate fresh ingredients/fish they were serving.  Everything was absolutely delicious and incredibly fresh!  The fish&#39;s freshness is comparable to many sushi restaurants in the city.  The chef was extremely tentative and explained each course in detail.  Thank you, chef, for such a wonderful dining experience!"

It was really empty upon arrival and no one came to greet us immediately, some of the co-workers just stared and then someone came to help us 5 minutes later.

We were seated and the whole time I felt like we were rushed to order and eat... ok, I understand that we came at 9PM (late)..and the restaurant closes at 10PM.. but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been rushed like this at other restaurants when they were closing in an hr..(I eat fast, don&#39;t worry!)...they also give you mini warm towels to clean your hands before you eat.. and mine smelled like rags (not so clean after all...i think i just made my hands dirty..)...so I had to go to the washroom and wash my hands from the rag smell w/ the generic smelling soap......ahh..not a good start to the dining experience..

Food: 
Kake Udon ($8): not impressed at all.. I think I can make udon at home with more flavor and more ingredients!  they only had green onions and noodles in the soup...i&#39;ve had better at other restaurants....

Spicy Tuna Roll ($6): the rolls are really small and i&#39;ve had better at different restaurants for sure!!

Costs: appetizers and salads range from $7-$15, noodles range from $8-$15, specials range from $15-$25, Sakuma&#39;s specialities range from $6-$25+

Positive: free edamame (small dish), lots of space

Negative: customer service, costs are on the high range (not sure if it&#39;s worth it..)

I probably won&#39;t visit this place again.. :("

Sorry... but when I spend a good chunk of change on fine dining, I shouldn&#39;t be leaving there wondering &#34;So, what&#39;s for dinner?&#34; as I&#39;m leaving the establishment. That&#39;s all.

Not a great wine selection, but thats really my only complaint.  We have a tendency to order the same rolls all the time, but will always try new specialty rolls and always leave very pleased.  Some people get turned off as its in a small shopping strip, but definitely worth it.  Even if it looks empty inside that place stay busy with all their take-out business.

We had the special which included delicious duck, shrimp and chicken soup, a green salad and a plate with 15 different selections of sushi. 
They have built a wall to divide the dining room and another patron explained they are making a Sake bar which was confusing but not in use yet.
Unfortunately, the original owner/chef moved to California but we think he still owns it. His wife was usually there to hostess/waitress. Last night was busy and there was only the one gal that has been there for a long time and she was overwhelmed. 
The decorating is getting a little dusty and ladies bathroom could use updating and a towel holder that works.
They could probably improve the ambiance by dimming the lights slightly and playing soft music.

I picked up an Oyako Don, which is chicken with mushrooms and onions, served beneath an egg omelet (!) with some sauce and laid over rice. If I recall correctly, it came served with some really good miso soup.

I thought this was a relatively unusual thing to order for lunch, but I was rewarded with a really tasty meal all around. The mushrooms lent an excellent earthiness to the dish, and they gave me enough food for two days of lunch.

I&#39;ll definitely be coming back for more lunch dishes."

That being said, I will now move on:

Let&#39;s face it--my dinner here was very &#34;blind leading the blind&#34;.  Neither one of us had really ever had sushi before and he heard all about this place and really wanted to try it.  Meh, whatev, I am game.

We really should have taken someone with us who had slightly more &#34;Unagi&#34; (FRIENDS REFERENCE) with us.  &#34;Ahhhh, Salmon Skin Roll&#34;.

OK here is what we ordered:

*Shrimp balls (I don&#39;t know the exact name) as our appetizer.
*Beef Shogayaki - Thinly sliced sirloin sauteed with ginger soy sauce (comes with soup or salad and ice cream for dessert) and I upgraded to fried rice
*Some sort of chopped tuna that came in a mountain-like structure.  If I could tell you what it was called, I would.  But you&#39;re SOL for now!

OK, so the food was good, and the dressing for the salad was delightful.  However our food took a really long time, and it all came out at different times.  Really, really odd times.

It went like this:
My salad
My friend&#39;s meal
Our appetizer
(very closely followed by) my meal and fried rice

So I would have preferred to have the salad/appetizer before the meal, and my friend kept waiting for me to have something else to eat other than salad, but I told him to go ahead.

But my beef was goooood!  And the fried rice was amazing, too!

That being said, I am still a sushi virgin.  I need Candice in my life to show me the way of the sushi.  I will bow down to her.

I want &#34;Unagi&#34;."

We keep going back and it&#39;s always a treat. Sakuma has such pride for the dishes he prepares and we are willing to try anything that&#39;s put in front of us.

Fans of this restaurant undoubtedly know what I am referring to, but the real differentiators at Sakuma&#39;s are the quality of the food and the technical and artistic skills of the chef.

Chef Sakuma is a perfectionist and professional of the highest quality, and once you have tasted his homemade sauces -- including his unforgettable soy sauce and spicy hot sauce -- you will also have a difficult time enjoying any other Japanese restaurants in Illinois (or the rest of the United States).

I recommend dining at the sushi bar and ordering one of the Chef&#39;s Choice courses (note: Chef&#39;s Choice for Two is great if you are dining with a friend) if you want a unique dinner course that changes each time you visit. Or, if you want to build your own tasting course, then I would recommend ordering several of the artistic and delicious sashimi entrees. My personal favorites are the Ethnic Tuna Sashimi, Sunset Carpaccio, and Hamachi Royale, but the Maguro Crunchy and Helmut Hurricane are also staples of a tasty Sakuma&#39;s diet. If you are more into sushi, then I would recommend the Spicy Tuna roll and the Summer roll, both of which should immediately demonstrate the unique flavors that can only be found at Sakuma&#39;s.

If you do not have a taste for sashimi or sushi, there are many other great options: amazing grilled beef (the skewers are served with an exceptional homemade mustard dipping sauce), numerous hot and cold soups that make wonderful meals (note: the dobin mushi is something each diner should try at least once, and the cold soba noodles and the hot nabeyaki udon that is served in a cast iron bowl are both also unbelievably good), and tasty-yet-healthy salads (that also pair great with a small order of sashimi).

For dessert, the banana tempura with honey and vanilla ice cream should not be overlooked, but I also enjoy the green tea ice cream after completing a Chef&#39;s Choice omakase course.

If you are a sashimi enthusiast and are ever in the Schaumburg/Streamwood/Bartlett area, I would highly recommend taking the time to drive out to Sakuma&#39;s for an authentic and unique Japanese dining experience."

My husband and I decide to sit at the Sushi Bar today to see our sushi being created by Chef Sakuma himself!   I especially liked sitting at the Sushi Bar because there is better lighting to take food pictures, BUT I digress. ;)

It was a great experience getting our sushi served to us by Chef Sakuma.  There was a mother and her pre-school child and a friend of hers sitting right in front of Chef Sakuma for lunch.  The kid would occasionally make shrill sounds, but it was fine.  Having kids ourselves, we understood.  Chef Sakuma and his son, Akira(?) were apologizing to us profusely because of that, which I thought was very hospitable of them to do so. It isn&#39;t their fault, but they still expressed their regrets on it.

We had our usual Sushi Set B, but we added two special maki rolls.  Perhaps we were overzealous since we ended up spending about $70 on sushi for LUNCH, but we definitely didn&#39;t leave hungry!  We rolled out like a pair of maki rolls!  Hehe

We had the Green Turtle Roll and the Fantasy Roll.

The Green Turtle Roll was very delicious!  I had never had wasabi tobiko (flying fish roe - wasabi flavored) before, so it caught me by surprise.  

The Fantasy Roll was interesting.  It was deep fried in a tempura batter and had a squeeze of lime on it with raw tuna and jalapeno.  It was also an interesting take on sushi and a unique experience!

Akira had welcomed us again since he remembered us from last week.  So, it&#39;s cool that they remember their customers!

We thoroughly enjoyed our sushi lunch at Sakuma&#39;s and will definitely return....next week! :)  Try a different roll!"

I&#39;m not a fan of spicy and there are plenty of options to chose from that are delicious. We always get the salmon sashimi. Yum!

As the only Japanese restaurant to offer Sushi Making Classes to the public, we wanted to do a taste test and decide for ourselves if we would come back as students. I think it would make a great date.

Sakuma offers a 2-hour class for $40. You learn about the basic art of cooking sushi rice, preparation and use of various ingredients which include raw fish, egg and vegetable in making a sushi roll. You learn the technique of presenting it on a plate with a garnish. The best part is, you eat what you make at the end of the course with some green tea.

Cute lounge area tucked away in a corner with a tv, coffee table and couch. The servers wear a kimono. The decor is a bit outdated.

We arrived at 5:05pm with much anticipation. We were the ONLY customers during the entire dining experience. It was nice to have privacy while enjoying each other&#39;s company and food.

The complimentary edamame was undercooked.The wash cloth for our hands was cold.

I decided I wanted to order from their dinner menu which included miso soup or house salad and a scoop of vanilla, red bean or green tea ice cream. I chose the Uma Juu. For $35, I thought the house salad was tasty but too small. The broiled eel was served over rice in a large bowl. It was too big for me to finish alone. I had to give some to Jason. Unfortunately, he thought it was too oily and didn&#39;t like it.

He ordered the Sashimi Moriawase. A Small order is limited to tuna, flounder, salmon and yellowtail. He ordered the $35 Large portion of the Mixed Variety. The presentation was beautiful and fresh. Jason had a lot of seafood filet on his plate. He was disappointed that for the price, he wasn&#39;t offered a side of rice, miso soup or house salad or a scoop of ice cream for dessert."

I cannot get enought of their sushi. They are truely the best sushi around. Always fresh, and always delicious! Great variety. (Im not sure where the other folks below say it&#39;s all too similar.. clearly they have not tried the variety on the menu). 

There is only one thing they need to improve upon, which is the service.. and it all comes down to one person. She just doesn&#39;t know how to be a waitress and the owner needs to let her go. She is the only non japanese waitress and is just awful.

Regardless... I will continue to go since I LOVE this place and will not let that one person ruin my experience. The owner is typically at the door and the other owner is always behind the sushi counter. LOVE them!"

After our time in Japan, we tried to find restaurants here in the states that compared to what we tasted over there....that was a challenge!
Sakuma&#39;s sushi is comparable to what we ate in Japan...it is amazing, always fresh and we have never left unhappy.  
 The 1 star review seems odd to me...everyone I have talked to about Sakuma&#39;s raves about it.  Perhaps it was an off day or so...everyone has those, I&#39;ve just never ever experiences it at Sakuma&#39;s and I&#39;ve been going  there for 4-5 years on a  regular basis."

While the sushi was fresh, most of the rolls were 6 very small pieces. We have eaten at countless sushi restaurants in the area and in large cities across the country, and the size of the rolls here were very small (no more than an inch in diameter with small pieces of fish). This would have been fine if the prices were adjusted accordingly, but unfortunately they were pretty standard prices. In addition, the ambiance was slightly strange and the waitress did not provide plates, wasabi or ginger until the sushi chef had given us our last roll to finish. There were two of us and after having 3 standard roll and two specialty rolls, we were still quite hungry- something that has not happened to us when ordering this much before at any sushi restaurant in the past. Sadly, we will not be returning."

The other reviews are right. The looks of it are deceiving. Boring strip mall, bizarre decorating inside.. [I counted 5 ceramic cats from my chair. Not to mention Christmas garland &amp; Valentine&#39;s Day decorations in October]

But the food is crazy good. We love sushi and there aren&#39;t many great options in the Chicagoland suburbs but this is definitely a diamond in the rough. 

I&#39;d skip the $15 Mr. Sakuma&#39;s sampler [think that&#39;s what it was called] and head straight for the other stuff. The Turtle roll was highly recommended and was fantastic. Everything else was fresh &amp; really good. 

If you&#39;re able to reserve a spot at the sushi bar, that&#39;s definitely the place to be. 

Service was a bit slow but nbd. The owner&#39;s wife stopped by afterwards &amp; really seemed to care if we had a good experience, which was nice. 

Will definitely go back."

The maki tasted good, but although we ordered a variety of rolls, they all came out looking almost too similar.

The main reason I gave 2 stars and not 4 was due to our service.  I could never figure out who our server was (it alternated between two).  As it was a Monday night, there were only 4 or 5 other tables being served.  After we were finished eating, it took 25 MINUTES to receive our check.  We were asked if we wanted dessert, and after politely declining, all servers left us.  One of the servers kept walking past us and not even checking in with us, and the other server was drinking wine with a customer at the sushi bar.  I finally had to ask for the check, and it took another 10-15 minutes to receive our check.  With 2 servers and 6 tables, I expected way better service.

We will definitely keep going to our favorite sushi joint (Nikko sushi in Arlington Heights), as the food and service there are outstanding every time."

Although it may not make you full, it was the fascinating meal. Mr.Sakuma uses a lot of unique and different ingredients which I don&#39;t really expect to see in the US and definitely not in the suburb. We had &#34;Mr.Sakuma&#39;s special&#34; which was in bite size of different appetizers: tempura unagi, seared white tuna in soy sauce, sweet shrimp, tuna and Salmon with Avocado. I highly recommend this one. Another dish was Trio Chilli something. It was raw scallop, squid and octopus with different hot sauces. I love the texture of squid and octopus, not quite sure about the scallop though. Green turtle roll was great. Autumn roll and Scorpion roll was just ok for me. All the food presentations were great that I wish I brought my camera. 

I plan to go back there for its &#39;Gourmet evening&#39;. It was the 5-7 course fix prix menu for $70 include all drinks + gratuity + tax. I can&#39;t wait to go back. I took the sushi class there with Mr.Sakuma before. The class was fun. He showed us so many techniques that it ran over time by an hour.

It doesn&#39;t get better, ever time we go somewhere else we compare to the quality of this place.  It&#39;s true, the sushi is uber fresh here.  There dishes are trasty, usually have rolls (specials in they work with my palet) Beef wrapped in green onions is just yummy!  Joy Lucky is one of my favorite specials which Mr. Sakuma has told me I must drink the liquid afterwards because it&#39;s good and healthy for you.  I always do.  Oh and if you call two weeks ahead of time you can order Sukiaki, which is just so delish!!  The whole restuarant fills up with the smells and everyone else including staff wishes they were having the same thing.  And for dessert, the best is the fried bannana.  There is always room for that!  Yum-O!  

Staff is a little bit slow, but we are Americans people!  Can&#39;t expect them to be any faster then they are because it&#39;s not their custom to runa round the place.  They want you to enjoy your food and experience.  And yes, Mr.s Sakuma&#39;s wife, Lidia is just a sweet heart.  The staff gets to know you, very freindly.

I&#39;ve read these rave reviews and I feel like we ate at a different restaurant!

The sushi was simply not good. The usual stuff (salmon rolls, sashimi prices) was mediocre at best: supermarket takeout qualify. But the special plates that everyone raves about were awful! Fish was swimming in tons of sauce, weird flavors, very little actual sushi. 

The worst part though is the service. On a not busy evening, our food took 90 minutes to arrive in full. We had 30 minute gaps between plates. But here is the kicker: our waitress made a rare appearance with a plate of food and announced, &#34;here is your - &#34; Then she paused, brought it closer to her face , and said , &#34;huh! I don&#39;t know what this is!&#34;. Then she took it back to the kitchen (!!!!!!) for a diagnosis.  Seriously? Who wants sushi mystery meat that&#39;s been paraded around a restaurant?

I have to give some props to the very nice older woman who realized the disaster in progress and took off from the bill the cost of our drinks .  Bt then, when we clearly wanted to leave and  told her we weren&#39;t having dessert , she looking pleadingly at our children and tried to talk them into ordering some ice cream. Not cool.

Usually I would give a place another try but this was so bad that I am posting now."

I don&#39;t get to go often, but Sakuma&#39;s is one of my favorite places in the &#39;burbs for sushi and okayo donburi, one of the classic Japanese comfort foods.  Imagine escaping the bitter Chicago winter by sitting down in front of a steaming bowl of rice covered with egg, chicken, thinly sliced onions, and warm dashi broth.  Pretty simple, but astonishingly satisfying. 

The fish is very fresh and they excel at both traditional sushi and some modern rolls.  One must have is the hamachi royale.  Imagine four velvety slices of hamachi lightly dressed with soy sauce, truffle oil, jalapeno, and garlic.  Un-freakin-believable."

Their spicy tuna roll is the best I have had.  Also, the fantasy roll is a delicious mix of spicy and crunchy. I could definitely eat it for a week straight and not tire of it.

The service is fairly quick, and for a sushi bar they are VERY kid friendly, which is so nice to see these days.

Japanese owned, Japanese operated, Japanese sushi chef with 30 years in the industry.

What do you order here? You can dine alone, get a bowl of chirashi, call it a day in 30 minutes, or you can sit down for a full blown 7 course kaiseki. don&#39;t know what kaiseki is? doesn&#39;t really matter. 

If you get lucky, you&#39;ll get a few slices of fugu - when in season - during the kaiseki meal. if not, there&#39;ll still be o-toro and chu-toro, just perfectly sliced, perhaps in nigiri form, perhaps in sashimi form. does it really matter? especially when Iguchi calls this place &#34;Sushi Power&#34;? there will be mountain yam soup, made for the previously mentioned Royal Family, there will be intricately balanced amuse bouche laid on hand-signed sushi paper. finally, there will be house-made desserts such as mochi-balls, banana tempura, etc.

there are a few &#34;levels&#34; of kaiseki differentiated by volume and quality. the best way to see what this is all about, is by looking at the pictures... after that, it&#39;s a transcendental experience good for 2.5 hours."

Melt in the mouth isn&#39;t quite the right words for it, but their tempura is deeelicious.

We ordered a couple of rolls and was very disappointed. The rice was dry and the fish looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. 

I think the other reviewers must work for the place or something. I questioned his credentials. For a sushi chef who&#39;s supposedly worked in some prestigious hotels -- the sushi doesn&#39;t match up!

Great food. The appetizer (sliced onions with beef) and spicy tuna were delicious. Staff a little less attentive than what we&#39;re used to at american restaurants, but I guess it&#39;s normal?? we saw tables with dishes getting served at different times. People watching other people eat at their table while they waited. The place is quiet, they have tv&#39;s where you can watch the games at the bar. Kids (of age) friendly place.

A group of five of us got take out sushi from here on a weekday. We ordered almost one of every roll on the menu and everything was delicious (I wish I could remember specific rolls to recommend). One drawback was that anything that included tempura was soggy by the time we got home to eat it (our mistake for ordering it in the first place). Their house sauce is amazing as well as the wasabi mayo dipping sauce. I would order anything from their menu and would sit down for dinner in the restaurant next time as the staff is extremely friendly and inviting.

In a very non-descript strip mall on a very non-descript corner in Streamwood resides one of Chicago&#39;s finest Japanese restaurants.  This place is sure to satisfy a wide range of expectations.  If you only enjoy sushi rolls, the creativity and technique are amazing.  I would suggest the Turtle Roll and the Summer Roll.  Every item in the elaborate rolls are carefully sliced, balanced in size and tightly rolled.  You can taste the distinct flavors working in harmony.  It&#39;s hard to explain how expertly the rolls are prepared.  Chef Sakuma also has some amazing sashimi dishes Flounder in seared in hot red wine and Hamachi Royale (which I believe is Yellowtail with a Truffle Oil sauce).  If you want traditional Japanese hot dishes, Sakuma&#39;s also excels on this front.  We really enjoy Chawanmushi which is a small dish of steamed custard with bits of shiitake, shrimp and other morsels.  Of course, the sushi and sashimi fish is exceptionally fresh.  I was very surprised to find this place where it is located.  It appears from the clientele that many Japanese in the area have also found it."

Mumbai Cafe is a great lil place if you wish to sample some of those. The restaurant is set up more like a no frills cafe and true to street style eating we like to order a variety of dishes simply because it is tough to choose just one :) The prices are nominal and the quantity just right.

Whenever here we love to get the Sugarcane Juice, Chaats, Kotto Idly, Kanchipuram Idly, Vada Pav &amp; Mumbai Special Kulfi. The best way to wrap up the meal however would have to be the Sweet Pan - comes free with a Yelp check in. What&#39;s more it seems like they are all set to bring us more treats, new dishes like Kathi Rolls have been introduced.

A recent dine in for four adults set us back by about $40, totally reasonable considering that the food was very good and service hospitable. Can&#39;t wait to be back!"

We ordered one Pani puri, dabeli, pav bhaji and chicken 69.
Nothing was good. The pani for pani puri was worst. It just had some powder in huge quantity with added water. I never had this kind of pani puri.
Dabeli had no taste.
The bhaji for pav bhaji did not have any spices and had so much of water.
Chicken 69 was not worth the money. Taste is not good with just being extra spicy."

To start off, the lady at the register(not sure if she is the owner) is such a sweetheart! This was our first time here after trying the restaurant next door the week before, and we were very excited. The lady was so welcoming and made us feel so good there! She made us a sweet paan at the end that is said to aid in digestion - and it was delicious! 

We ordered a masala dosa which was so delicious that we had to get another one right after. The dosa was so fluffy and warm and not at all dried out like we had had before. It was all just perfect 100%. We also ordered the mumbai pulav and a chicken dish(I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t remember the name and I cannot find the name of it on the menu online). Anyway, both dishes were super good!!!! They were so flavorful and all of the spices complemented each other so well. The food is a bit spicy, but that is the way we like it! If you want it less spicy, we were informed they can adjust to your tastes if you just ask. 

The prices are super affordable, and I&#39;m almost positive that these are the best prices you will find this awesome quality of food in the area. 

The atmosphere is very chill and comfortable. There are plenty of tables to be seated at. Also, there are couches to sit at while you wait for your order or to come hangout.

Great place, one of the best! We definitely will be coming back soon. 

Thank you so much for your service! :)"

So off we headed on a Sunday afternoon.  There were a few people there but there was no one in line as everyone was already seated and enjoying their food.  We grabbed the table near the TV. 

We ordered a plethora of dishes (grilled sandwich, pav bhaji, bhel puri, vada pav, sev puri, and chikoo shake).  Everything practically came out one by one, which gave us a chance to enjoy each item on its own.

The stars of the show were the grilled sandwich and the bhel puri, although we all agreed everything was delicious.

I don&#39;t understand the service issues mentioned by the other Yelpers because the young lady that took our order was as pleasant as can be.  Also, the lady who made our food served it with a smile, so I guess y&#39;all just went on an &#34;off&#34; day?

Also, check-in on Yelp for 2 free sweet paan, tasty and made when you order them.

This wasn&#39;t my first trip to Mumbai Cafe, and it won&#39;t be my last...but both Delaware-ians  (is that the correct term?) put this place on their list of must-haves alongside Lou Malnati&#39;s and Portillo&#39;s when visiting Chicago."

Visit 1 - 

The girl at the register will not even look at me - while talking on phone with some friend - a full 3 minutes and then casually asked (no sorry for the wait etc)  what will you have !  Then went about putting in the order - yes expectedly - she screwed up or the kitchen -  instead of cheese pav baji - we received cheese DOSA !!  YES !!  and then when I pointed out she offered the Pav - but we were full - refused and she gave a Kulfi !!  But the key -  the total lack of care !  Again even this time - no sincere apology - a simple oh sorry....

Visit 2

This gets better !!  We went in when there was exactly one customer in the cafe !  and the same girl -  I was wondering whats in store - and was not disappointed - this time the order itself was not processed (she did charge me etc)  and left her shift -  and the new guy came -  and we waited a full 20 minutes for a simple gol gapa - and then I approach him - he was - oh I just walked in -  wait I will get you -  again not even a cursory sorry galthi ho gaya !!    and no offer to even compensate for wasting 20 minutes of 2 people !!  Saving grace the kitchen staff who gave it said in a friendly manner - sir tell me if you need extra pani !!!  LOL

-wait time is abnormally long
-food is subpar quality
    *idli was (I feel terrible for saying this) inedible. Home made chutney was solid though!
-disorganized infrastructure
    *our order was repeated from cashier to cook 3 times, whereupon the cashier left and the cook had to tell the new cashier what our order was? Interesting...
-tables were relatively dirty and infrequently cleaned
    *we noticed one table that had food on it for over.           45 minutes (mind you that&#39;s how long our food took to get to us...)
-THEY DIDN&#39;T HONOR THE CHECK IN SPECIAL. That&#39;s definitely breaking some sort of law... :(

I hear hot breads next door is apparently much better. There must be some redeeming qualities that I missed from reading other yelper&#39;s reviews... However I will NOT be back again to give them another chance. Rounding up from 1.5 stars."

Ordered their version of pau-bhaji. Service was fast, prepared quickly. The restaurant was empty. They couldn&#39;t alter the spice content as it was already pre-made. The bread was buttery and warm- just like in India. The  bhaji itself was ok- really oily. I think I would come back and try some of the other chaat style things on the menu.

When I asked the lady to replace my sandwich with 2 pans as they were of equal value she refused and kept saying it is ready.

The lady taking the order is one of the rudest people I have ever met. Maybe this kind of customer service works in India but she&#39;s absolutely the worst. Almost like she&#39;s doing you a favor by taking an order and she places the change on the counter (super rude). I hope the review(s) help this place change their customer service ways because it&#39;s a nice concept.

Food: It&#39;s good not great. Of course you can&#39;t compare it to India (Mumbai) ever dor you won&#39;t eat any Indian food in Chicagoland. Do find the specialty drinks, ice creams and desserts to be little pricey.

Restaurant maintained its cleanliness for several months but it&#39;s just a mess now.

There is no such a system in order taking it takes more than 30 minutes for them to deliver a simple order. Plus they don&#39;t remember what you order on your order and they have ask you what your order was what kind of system is this??
 What irritates me most is the lady who is always on the a cashier is the rudest person I have ever met on this  earth in my life. She should take classes For  what customer service means and what it is in order for you to gain the business.  I think she would grow far better business if she knew that plus she does not know how to take care of a customer or how to talk to customers in general.  She may think that she&#39;s so all good because she can call out people yeah maybe but you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re causing your business because the way you were talking to customers.  I have seen this over and over at this branch it is nothing but rudest way of talking to customers  I don&#39;t even know how the people take this from her. I personally can&#39;t stand her so that&#39;s why even If I went with family or friend I send them to order bcz I know If she says something i and her will have argument just knowing me how I can&#39;t take wrong stuff. Especially when I know I&#39;m right. 

Food don&#39;t even talk about the food it was very good taste when it started but now the taste is very very very horrible in fact they don&#39;t even fill in their food properly. When I say fill In I mean pack puri have 1 chanyo and 1 small potato ??? WTF?? Shit quality and on top no quantity ? It&#39;s rip off

You know what I don&#39;t have more time to spend on this it&#39;s not worthy time.

I hope people this spreads.

and i started going there more often... and ever since the kind of service and quality of things they provide has gone down the drain... Kulfi wayyy too sweet, pan - very very marginal, hygiene level its horrible (place is always super dirty), they give out numbers but no clue how they are serving out, they pretend to make fresh pav bhaji over there whereas all they are doing is reheating it (not even that on sunday, i got it straight of the tawa and it was ICE COLD, shame).... Only consistent thing has been shaved iced dessert which i can get any may places... So this one is off my list...

Does it live up to the expectation? Don`t think so. And yes...the name does no justice to the great city of Mumbai!! 

First Food-  
Vada Pav Just about average
 Pani Puri - will not order it again 
Bombay Grill Sandwich - Don`t get fooled by the name!!! 
Sugarcane Juice - Tasted like they added a spoonful of sugar syrup. The sweetness needs to come from sugarcane itself not from some chemicals.
Falooda- Mehh not at all exciting
Gola -  They got this horribly wrong!! If you have had 1 in Mumbai, please do not compare it with what they serve here. You will be disappointed.
Pan - Saving grace!! loved it.
Ohh BTW good luck navigating through the menu!! 
After all these setbacks, did not try anything else.

Second - Service and Ambiance
They take the order like any fast food restaurant and give you the food by calling out the name of the dish. Now there were 3 people for vada pav.. grab yours before someone else stakes their claim on it. There is a order number on the receipt do not wait for it to be called out. The guys working there are pretty good, but the process is not.
Ambiance - Good idea, bad execution. When you have the space for another 20 people to sit, they do not need a lounger sofa for someone to doze off on. 
It needs more chairs and tables so that people are not standing and staring at someone`s meal..glad I did not get a stomach ache or give one (hopefully) !!
The tables needs to be cleaned properly.. no extra chutneys for me please.
Guy does his job well, but he is understaffed. 

Its a tad expensive cafe...and certainly does not make up for it by food or anything else. 

One of the most standout items- they need is a trash can which can swallow a Styrofoam plate not just a cup. It will be a sound investment. 

Score Card
Food - 5.5/10
Service Ambiance - 5/10
Value for money - 5/10

Will have to be convinced to give it a try or spread the good word.

Good Luck to the team there."

Looks pretty neat as of now and I am hoping it stays like this.

First things First: They need to have trash cans. The ones they have cannot fit Styrofoam plates in them and can only be used for napkins, bottles etc,.  I absolutely did not like how there were used trays with leftover food sitting on various tables for long.

Few things I liked: their samosa chaat was pretty good, well balanced with their in-house chutneys. I also enjoyed their dahi puris a lot. 

Wada Pao: This was very basic. I wish they served chutney on side and some fried chillies. But a very mediocre preparation, nothing special.

It was not the same with Pani Puris. These were not as crunchy and the kanji(the gol gappa water) was bland. 

Worst was the Bombay sandwich: it was so soggy that fell apart as picked from the plate. This when I ate in India, we had option of grilling the sandwich, which is fine, I could have liked it, if it stayed in place. The bread was extremely wet with chutneys and potatoes were bland. I would not recommend this to anyone. 

Paans: My husband tried the meetha paan and he liked it, so I guess after dinner we could hit this place for paans pretty often.

Sugarcane juice: Loved it! Please go for some refreshing gingery &#34;ganne ka ras&#34;.

All in all, it&#39;s worth trying but nothing extraordinary.

The owners did not engage in conversations but looked pretty nice. I also saw same person who took our order, came and cleaned some tables. This place has a lot of room to improve and I hope they do, we need CHAAT joints."

They serve pani puri, vada pav, dahi vade, sandwiches, juices, coffee, teas, baraf ke gola (Indian snow cone), halwa and pan. Pan comes in sweet, chocolate and strawberry.  The owners are very friendly. The gave out complimentary fresh mitha (sweet) pan with each order. We gave a decent size order so the owner gave us free sugar cane juice which was tasty. Best of luck to this newcomer."

Food does take a bit longer to prepare because it&#39;s all freshly made. Only complaint I have is the tea cup is extremely small for the price. Just not satisfied with the tiny cup of tea. Food is consistently good time and time again. Love this cafe.

Vada paav was cold(hot would have been way better, bombay sandwich is terrible, PANI PURI (Gol Gappe) - Totally NOT recommended(they give diluted jaljeera water), dahi batata puris were all empty puris with no stuffing, Pav Bhaji - extra spicy which basically destroyed the taste! Kulfi and Gola are just OK,dabeli was cold uncooked(stuffed with ham burger bun).
I hope the owner reads this review and tries to improve all above things i listed. Overall Mumbai cafe name is not justified by the kind of food they provide. Sugar cane juice and paan are good."

As this establishment is new, we decided to stop in. The place was bustling and we placed our order, which was 1 dubley burger and 3 three-layered sandwich. While picking up our order, I requested glasses for water and the cashier&#39;s response shocked me. The owner stated that we can &#34;buy&#34; water bottles and that there is no cooler or water fountain available. Health wise, this opportunity to &#34;make more money&#34; will come at the cost of Mumbai Cafe&#39;s customers. Around 60 percent of our body is water, therefore, in order to digest food, water is a pertinent necessity.  Having no access to water, depresses our appetite and we eat less, a fact that this establishment has, perhaps, not considered. If we eat less because there is no water to process food, we will buy less of the food at Mumbai Cafe. I am an able bodied healthy individual, what if I needed water to swallow my medicine? What if I was at all sick in any form? dehydrated? In my case, I was parched and required some fluid between my snack and chai. Not having public access to water for Mumbai Cafe&#39;s customer not only does my culinary experience disservice, it causes loss of appetite for its customers. Since I have to pay extra for water, I will eat less and therefore, will not frequent the establishment or chose not to come at all. Having water is a public necessity and cheapens the experience of Mumbai Cafe&#39;s customers, since I won&#39;t be staying in a location where I can&#39;t finish a conversation because I am thirsty. This practice of &#34;dehydration-for-profit&#34; needs to be thoroughly reconsidered by Mumbai Cafe because if they can not provide a basic necessity, such as public accessible water, the customers will go elsewhere."

However, trying to decide between all three of us where we were going to eat, was a challenge.

Brock: Tell me to either turn left or right; just direct me to food.

With that minimum instruction I came across this little hidden gem.  There would have been a slim chance I would have found this on my own, but we are thankfully in the GPS days - dinner was saved!

The all you can eat sign was like a beacon in a foggy storm.  It was perfect for two grown men and myself.  $24?  Can&#39;t beat that!

The place was crowded when we got a table, and the walls were covered with customers filled sushi tables and huge smiles.  Really awesome.

The staff is legit Japanese, and the green tea was probably the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The all you can eat is lethal - you better get your money worth; get there starving like us, and you&#39;ll be so thrilled!  Roll after roll was excellent!  We loved the fresh roll options more than the cooked, but man, they were fresh!  Clean tables and floors, and they never rushed us to leave.  

I will definitely be hitting this place up again the next time I am in Chicago, without hesitation!"

I&#39;ve always felt that the service was personable and the sushi fresh and delicous.  

My recent experience was carry-out.  I ordered seaweed salad, a baked spicy salmon roll, and an unagi crunch roll.  My order was ready when promised and the food was great.  I think they have the best gyoza in town also.

Highly recommended!"

I&#39;ve visited twice since my last review.. Maki (roll) presentation is clean/attractive and portions are good. They haven&#39;t been heavy on the rice the last two times I&#39;ve visited; ingredients are much more balanced. Ingredient quality is also decent.

Oh, and it&#39;s a cute, clean space (bathrooms included). It&#39;s Japanese-owned, which I was surprised about, since all the ones I&#39;ve been to have Chinese or Korean owners and/or employees.


The Meh:
Service is slow when they aren&#39;t even that busy (tonight at 8:30 it was 3 tables of 2-5, including ourselves). We were seated for about 10 minutes before we got our AYCE sheets, and had to ask for them. Apparently you now have to ask for the (super salty!) miso soup, too. They&#39;re stingy with wasabi and ginger, again, unless you ask. Good luck flagging down the owner(&#39;s wife?), though - she&#39;s often behind the counter and doesn&#39;t really scan the dining area. She&#39;s not very welcoming or warm, but I feel she&#39;s a teensy bit more attentive after you&#39;ve been there for a bit.

The pictures on the menu are a general representation (stock photos?), but we&#39;ve been surprised (sometimes pleasantly, sometimes not) by some variations. This last visit we shared 6 rolls between the two of us and it was perfect. We typically get the Tempura and Fresh variety, and skip over the Hot/Cooked ones.


To Sum:
&#34;A-OK&#34;: we only come here if we can&#39;t make the hour round-trip drive to a different (and $6 cheaper per person) AYCE sushi joint."

I have been here 3 times because I love their all you can eat special but all three times the women serving us has been ridiculously rude and overbearing.

The second time I was there, it was a party of seven adults. We ordered about 24 rolls. She came back to us and told us we ordered 36 and it was too much and that she would charge $1 per piece left. We told her its fine and to just keep it coming. She purposely brought us one roll at a time, telling us she&#39;s slowing service because we ordered too much. We were the only ones in the resturant at the time so its not because they were busy. Every time she bought us a plate she repeated that we ordered too much, that she would charge us and that we had 30 left (Which was obviously not true because we ordered less than that initially).

Every. Single. Time. 

We were all so sick of her that we just told her to cancel the rest of the rolls and we left. This is an ALL YOU CAN EAT place last time I checked and 3 rolls a person is not excessive.

All three times I went there she was like this. Needless to say I have not been back nor will I be going back. 

The sushi was good but not enough to deal with this woman."

It&#39;s tucked back in  a strip mall and just says &#34;Sushi&#34;  that is visible Lake Street. Looks a little sketchy- but don&#39;t judge a book by its cover!

We had been going to 8000 mile almost on auto-pilot every time we wanted sushi. BUT NOW we have options! Abashiri offers a much more intimate dining experience and a much wider array of sushi options. It is also much more authentic Japanese cuisine.

Additionally, if you stuff your face with enough sushi, they will automatically roll you over to the unlimited sushi plan. Which is about $25 a person and includes UNLIMITED SUSHI. If you plan on going with the unlimited plan,might as well start and continue with the premium rolls.

Staff is so friendly and attentive-definitely, highly recommend."

The food we ordered included miso soup, which was &#34;meh&#34;. It had maybe a couple of small itty-bitty cubes of tofu and a tiny bit of seaweed, mostly liquid. Maybe it&#39;s because we came there somewhat late, and we were literally getting the bottom of the barrel.

This place had a decent overall rating, most people seemed to really enjoy it, so I figured &#34;it can&#39;t be that bad&#34; and gave it a shot. I ordered 2 rolls and 2 nigiri. The price was almost $50. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve been to MANY sushi places and I understand sushi is pricey. But this was crazy especially since I was ordering things like super white tuna and spicy tuna rolls. Nothing fancy really! But, I have needs, so I bit my tongue and paid up. The nigiri was ok, nothing to write home about. The spicy tuna was intolerable. The rice was hard, the tuna was almost non existent and what was there was tasteless and incredibly spongey which is a really strange texture for spicy tuna. Usually I&#39;ll power through and eat it anyway because I really love sushi, but I couldn&#39;t even eat it. I honestly don&#39;t remember what the other roll was that I ordered, but I ate a couple pieces and tossed that one too. I can&#39;t get on the same page with these 4 or 5 star reviews. I wish I could, because this restaurant is so close to my house. The food wasn&#39;t worth the price tag at all. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even give it another shot. Maybe... If I get really desperate one day. Weirder things have happened."

Interior is clean and quaint. When I stopped in for lunch there were a few actual Japanese patrons eating here which was a good sign. The menu is pretty extensive and they have a lot of good lunch combos.  I ordered sushi combo B which came with miso soup. The soup was hot and tasty. My combo came with 5pcs of sushi and I upgraded to spicy tuna roll instead of California roll. Sushi was tasty fresh and well prepared. Service was prompt even with one server handling 6 tables. I will return and possibly try the all you can eat menu.

The husband has taken a liking to sushi and so we are working the circuit. We pulled up in the parking lot on a week night intending on all you can eat sushi. At least that was the plan. 

When we walked in, we were promptly seated and given menus to review. I really liked their bento box options, so I went that route while my husband placed an order for a few rolls to start his AYCE adventure. 

The food took a while. A lot longer than he expected. I was prepared having read the reviews over the years. The waitress was pretty focused which meant that eye contact didn&#39;t really mean anything. If you want something, ask for it when she&#39;s at the table. She was the only one working the room, so she was busy. 

The sushi made my husband happy. He filled up way too quickly since the food was taking so long. I enjoyed my teriyaki chicken, the tempura veggies and shrimp, the salad and the California roll. 

When he decided that he just couldn&#39;t eat anymore, we asked for the check and the waitress just charged us for the rolls he ordered instead of the AYCE price since it was less that way. I appreciated that move on her part. I can see going back, but might try for an off time in the hopes that the food hits the table quicker to make the AYCE worth it."

Since the first time and to the last time I visited, it still stands, my favorite is the Lion King roll, I just can&#39;t get enough. Whatever sauce they put on top is on POINT!

I&#39;d have to say the oddest thing I&#39;ve tried at Abashiri is their shrimp boat.....sounds cool doesn&#39;t it? No, it actually doesn&#39;t. At all. lol

Well, I&#39;m not going to lie, I had to talk myself into eating this. It&#39;s a piece of open faced shrimp, topped with white rice, a quail egg and caviar. NEVER in my life would I have tried that but I&#39;ve learned that in life, you should always try things at least once. So I closed my eyes, inserted the boat in my mouth and closed it. To my surprise it was SOOOOO good! I could not believe that I, Osiris V, liked that slimy quail egg caviar topped thingy. haha But the combination gave it an exquisite flavor. If you visit, you should definitely try it for your selves. 

Just remember, AYCE sushi is only from Monday through Thursday and it runs around $25/pp. Which is not bad at all considering if you order one plate it runs you about 12-14. So it&#39;s very worth it. 

Plus they have really good Japanese beers!

Update: I guess they have AYCE sushi everyday except Sunday now!!! WHOA."

We did the AYCE which is fairly priced at 25 bucks. We may have picked some of the more complex rolls which had us waiting for a good 20 minutes. Cooked rolls are more time consuming (I assume). Our waitress was very nice and kept our table tidy as much as she could. Just says &#34;SUSHI&#34; outside on their signs but its wonderful! Located in a small strip mall by a bar and grill and matress store. The busier it is the longer the wait for your sushi is.

It was Girl&#39;s Night Out and right before Abashiri the 10 of us decided to do a little wine tasting the next town over and after a few wines and good company our bellies started to growl. Well, what&#39;s better than AYCE sushi after a couple glasses of wine? (Although I do recommend doing the reverse so you don&#39;t get &#34;tipsy&#34; at the tasting.) 

Abashiri gladly seated us and stayed patient with us as we struggled on what to order since everything sounded so delicious and there were many first timers. Between the 10 of us we ordered over 30+ rolls and yes, we ate every since piece and our bellies were extremely happy. Unfortunately, due to my hiatus I can&#39;t remember which ones were my favorite, but I do remember I enjoyed the deliciousness of the Fire roll and every piece I ate was fresh.

I&#39;m due for a visit and so are you.

I mean who doesn&#39;t like AYCE?"

. I found the list of options for nigiri, fresh rolls, cooked rolls and specialty items impressive.  It&#39;s a shame that I have lived next door for so long I never tried this place. The prices are very reasonable including the lunch and dinner specials, all you can eat sushi, and the bento boxes.

We tried two of the new specialty rolls. The one that stood out the most was the Lambada. We absolutely loved that one.  We also tried the albacore tuna in a specialty roll it was topped with smelt. It was very different, but a little too salty. We each had miso soup which I really enjoyed.

Needless to say, this will become a regular pit stop for good sushi."

Now that I&#39;m here in Bloomingdale, well, options for any kind of quality eats run scarce. You know the feeling. Yes, YOU DO. It took me two years to finally get my yellow ass to Abashiri, but not for lack of trying.  Luckily, relatives from the Rock were in town and I sprung at the chance to experience this joint. 

It&#39;s small, so claustrophobes beware. At least it&#39;s clean, so claustrophilic clean-freaks, come on down! It appears that Abashiri is actually owned by Japanese people, a weirdly refreshing change from all the Chinese-owned sushi bars in Chicagoland, which explains the more authentic feel and flavor. 

I pigged out because 1) a well-heeled relative was paying, 2) I hadn&#39;t had access to Japanese food for way too long, and 3) I figured I&#39;d work it off later that evening. Whelp, that last one was a bust. Maybe tomorrow. 

I really enjoyed the salmon tempura roll, with its crunchy, flaky bits of salmon and a light drizzle of unagi sauce. No one else would touch my Mexican roll, a fun, punchy riff on a spicy tuna roll that featured the addition of cilantro and chopped jalapeno (seeds included). It made this heat-loving Korean happy, but I have never been so glad to have been prescribed ultra-strength omeprazole. The katsudon was perfect, but perfect, the sweet soy sauce dripping down from the egg-onion-fried pork cutlet raft onto the rice. And in spite of the bones that required the deft kind of chopstick usage that I&#39;ve never managed to master, the salmon shioyaki (&#34;salt-broiled&#34;) was the best I&#39;ve ever had. Plus, if you&#39;re anything like my omnivorous grandpa, you&#39;ll crunch on the bones anyway and say they&#39;re good for your own bones. 

All that said, the sushi did not wow my socks off, and the rice was your standard domestic calrose rice - no super-polished short-grain koshihikari loveliness here - but the food was fresh, tasty and satisfying. I&#39;ll be back if anyone can ever bring my sad, car-less self here again."

I love Abashiri, if you are thinking about checking this place out, stop reading and go go go! 
I would say try the volcano roll, poor sushi bliss!! :-) 

Also, service is amazing, and the lady waitress was really nice. We were hungry and did not hear before ordering the unlimited that if you do order it you have to eat it all, can&#39;t take it home. If there is leftovers you get charged per roll. Honestly, we did not hear that and the lady was sweet and let us off the hook. 
SO just remember if you want unlimited, order 2 at a time not 5 rolls at a time (NOSHAME) lol!

Happy eating!! Enjoy!

Food:
All you can eat SUSHI ROLLS ($24.95): comes with free miso soup and the overall sushi rolls are good, I enjoyed the crab and lobster meat sushi rolls..

Kalbi Sushi roll.. it&#39;s just a little odd.. I think Sushi is meant for Fish....I guess you can get it if you want some Kalbi in your meal...it&#39;s just ok tasting.. I&#39;d just go to a kalbi place if I was craving kalbi..

Costs: it&#39;s sushi.. so on the higher end..the all you can eat is decent...if you want to try out different rolls, I&#39;d recommend that you just get the all you can eat so your not limited to only 1-2 rolls... if you order 2-3 rolls ... it&#39;ll probably be equivalent to $24.95...so yea.. 

Sushi Rolls ranges from ~$10-$13+ per roll that contain around 6+ pieces?...they are just average sized rolls...thankfully they didn&#39;t stuff my rolls with rice...

Wait time: no wait to get seated...wait for sushi wasn&#39;t too long..

Parking: located in a small strip mall..so you might have to walk a little if there&#39;s limited spots closer to the restaurant (meaning 10 steps to restaurant)... plenty of parking...:)

Atmosphere: it&#39;s sort of small so I wouldn&#39;t come here with a huge huge group, but with around 4 people it would be good...I came during lunch time so I just saw ppl eating here during their lunch break...

**Note: all you can eat is ONLY for Sushi Rolls..and if you have leftovers or can&#39;t finish your food.. they&#39;ll charge you..so be cautious in not ordering too much food that you can&#39;t eat..

It&#39;s good.. maybe I&#39;d come here again for dinner instead of lunch...not a good feeling when you feel like your going to explode (too much eating) + food coma returning to work for another 4 hrs.. which seems like forever! :)"

I went for a friend&#39;s birthday and had a very fun time. However, I&#39;m allergic to shellfish and finding rolls sans shrimp or crab was mighty hard. Nearly all their rolls have some type of shellfish included and if not that had jalapeno. I&#39;d go back to Abashiri but skip the AYCE madness and stick to just ordering a few things on the regular menu. It wasn&#39;t quite worth the price tag for me.

The rolls at Abashiri are a bit smaller than other places, however they offer a good variety of options. It was packed to the brim on the weekend and because of this it would take forever to get our rolls. I&#39;m talking 20 minutes of waiting with no food during our break times. It would be better if they brought the rolls out as they were made instead of waiting for a few &amp; bringing them out together.

All in all, I enjoyed Abashiri but am not rushing to get back. I absolutely would like to go again and try more items from them!"

It has a pretty good selection of sushi and tasty dishes for those who do not like sushi. They have changed a few thing with the all you can eat though, no more sushimi. 

The only negative is that it takes A LONG TIME to get your sushi if they have more than 4 tables of people. They only have two chefs cooking so It will take about 30 minutes an order at least if they are &#34;busy&#34;. 

The servers are very very personable and will joke around with you. They are also very knowledgeable about the different types of rolls and such.

My husband and I went here on a Monday night for AYCE sushi.  At $25/person and the awesome variety of sushi, it was well worth the 40-minute drive for us.  My only hang-up about this place previously was the long wait between rolls.

On a Monday night, there were a few occupied tables, and while the service was a tad slow, it felt faster since there were only two of us.  We split six rolls and left stuffed.  

My favorites are still the Paradise, Godzilla, Mango Tuna, and Crunchy Rainbow.  The Spicy Tuna was a little mushy, and the Mexican is too spicy with the amount of jalapeno and cilantro used, but my husband loves it.

On my previous visit...

Abashiri has all-you-can-eat sushi for $25/person, and that deal includes Friday nights!  I&#39;ve done the AYCE at a few places in the suburbs, places that do it all week, but they don&#39;t do it nearly as well as Abashiri.  Even though there are at least two other spots much closer to home for me, the 45 minute drive to Abashiri was well worth it.

I went here for a friend&#39;s birthday (happy birthday Ericka A!), and I had a great time.  Although Abashiri isn&#39;t responsible for whether or not you enjoy read more &#34; your company, my point is that doing AYCE is even better with a larger group of people.  Since they charge you extra if you do not finish what you order, it&#39;s totally safe to order something just to try it.  

My favorite rolls were the Paradise and Godzilla.  We also had the Mango &amp; Tuna, Crunchy Rainbow (even better than a regular rainbow!), Mexican (a little too spicy), Tiger, Lion King, Double Salmon, and I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve forgotten a lot more.  There were 7 of us, which means lots of rolls, and there was only ONE I didn&#39;t care for, it was baked and burnt the roof of my mouth.

The menu is HUGE.  AYCE includes miso soup, green tea, and a menu of 40 rolls to choose from!  Abashiri definitely has the biggest and best variety of rolls, and there&#39;s no way you will get through them in one visit!

The only reason I&#39;m giving Abashiri four stars and not five is because the service is so damn slow.  Initially, our rolls came out like 3 at a time, but then they came out in intervals of one roll.  In a big group, one roll doesn&#39;t last long!  I almost started to wonder if it&#39;s some kind of strategy - if they bring out the food slowly, we won&#39;t feel like sitting around any longer, and we won&#39;t keep ordering, right?  Of course, if we had ordered more, we might have faced the dreaded doom of paying extra for uneaten pieces.  You really just can&#39;t win.

The bottom line is that it&#39;s the best AYCE sushi in the suburbs.  Move over, Sakura!"

Put it in my mouth. I said my muthaf*ckin mouth...

Yep. That happened. &#39;Cause I&#39;m eatin&#39; all-you-can-eat sushi like all.damn.day... okay, maybe not all damn day, but defo for a few hours and defo enough sushi that a regular person probably could have spaced the quantity out to last the whole day. So there&#39;s that. 

Miso soup, green tea, sushi rolls like whoa and these little shrimp + raw quail egg boats that aren&#39;t part of the AYCE special, but are pretty much life changing and something you should for sure plan on getting on top of the AYCE menu.  

And while the sushi rolls weren&#39;t the freshest, nor the greatest, the $24.95 AYCE price and the variety of specialty rolls is outta control. I don&#39;t why you&#39;d do anything but that... and those shrimp+quail egg boats. 

I was glad I went with a decent sized group so we could all pig the f out and try a little bit of what felt like almost everything. I&#39;d get into specifics but honestly, I ate so much that it all kind of became a blur. In fact, at one point I actually inhaled the seaweed part of a roll that had come undone and partially lodged in my windpipe. I tried to dislodge it with my tongue and then by deep-throating my chopsticks to try and grab it, but then it became apparent that if I didn&#39;t get up and try to purge this piece in the bathroom, that I was probably going to involuntarily puke at the table with my group, or die choking on a friggin&#39; sushi roll at an AYCE sushi restaurant like some modern-day Mama Cass. 

Anyway, I *somehow* summoned all my strength and was able to clear a tiny part of my wind-pipe to silently excuse myself from the table and take care of business in the bathroom. I *think* I was discreet enough that no one noticed at the time, but figured it best that I come clean now so as to squash any suspicion of an eating disorder. No habitual or voluntary purging here, just a shoveler by nature and sometimes I pay the price. 

Anyway, check out the pics and see for yourself. I didn&#39;t take pictures of everything because we got sooo much stuff and I didn&#39;t want to be that super annoying and make everyone wait to eat before I can figure out how to work my flash."

It&#39;s in your face but you can&#39;t grab it!&#34;

Well that certainly isn&#39;t true about Abashiri. Not only can you have it all, you can have as much as you want, and grab it all day long should you so desire. Tho, they may get sick of you after a few hours. 

All you can eat sushi, baby! 

You know what really sucks about watching your caloric intake? Not eating out as much as you like. Which in turn means less opportunity to try new places. I gave myself the night off of my tedious calculation of everything I put in my mouth to enjoy a night out with friends for some serious face-stuffage. 

You&#39;ve gotta respect a place that is so confident in their product they don&#39;t even need to put their name on their sign. &#34;SUSHI&#34; is all it says, and that&#39;s what they do and do pretty well.

Admittedly, my friends and I were a little hesitant coming here after reading a few iffy reviews and hearing a friend&#39;s not-so-great recounting of her experience. I am happy to report that my experience was more on the positive than what I&#39;d heard.

Fiscally speaking, it makes the most sense when you come here to do the all-you-can-eat deal. For about $25 you can stuff your talk hole with pretty much any (or every, if you desire) sushi roll on the menu and keep them coming til you explode like the pig that you are. 

I&#39;m not going to detail everything that I ate. For that type of information see the wealth of other reviews. I will say that I agree with the reviewer who stated that the combinations of ingredients in all the rolls are well-thought-out and flavorful. I enjoyed almost everything we ordered, but I didn&#39;t contribute much to the choosing. I let my friends decide. The only one I didn&#39;t care for was the Mexican roll because it was too complicated and fall-aparty. With all the tomatoes and business cascading off the top, it&#39;s too hard to eat with chopsticks. 

Sidebar: I recently learned that when you share sushi with people, you&#39;re supposed to use the top, flat side of the chopsticks to take things from the shared dish and put them on your plate, then use the regular smaller, rounded part to eat with. Interesting, no? I never knew that. 

We didn&#39;t do that last night, just kinda mawed off the big plate because we&#39;re animals. 

Anyway, the way it works is you order off a card just like any sushi restaurant. But unlike most of the places I&#39;ve been to, they deliver the rolls one at a time. This tends to get annoying for the people in the group who didn&#39;t order the AYCE special because they get their food all at once and are finished by the time your second or third shared roll appears. My poor non-sushi eating friends had to sit for almost an hour after they were done eating. Patient souls, they are. 

So, yeah! Try it. The food is good. The raw stuff isn&#39;t the freshest, but I dealt. Some of my friends noted the very fishy smell, which you know is kind of a sign of that. The cooked rolls are definitely the way to go here. And plan to stay at least two hours if you&#39;re with a large group that&#39;s all sharing. And if you don&#39;t want the AYCE, stay home or go somewhere else because you will get bored with the waiting. Have fun!"

This night began at a sports bar next door where I was watching some football &amp; my friend came up with the idea to get some sushi.  I not only had not eaten here before but I didn&#39;t know of any sushi restaurants in Bloomingdale, let alone an all you can eat sushi restaurant.  

When you find an all you can eat sushi place it is a good thing but when you find an all you can eat sushi restaurant with AYCE sushi it is a really good thing, except for your pants that might feel tighter from eating so much food.  

The staff here was very nice &amp; the sushi all seemed very fresh.  The rolls here were prepared differently than some other places which is a good thing.  It is always nice to try different styles.  

I enjoyed my experience here.  The only things that I can mention that weren&#39;t the best is that the rolls were a little bit smaller than some other places.  The price was also $25 for all you can eat while other popular all you can eat sushi restaurants offer $15.99 for lunch &amp; $18.99 for dinner.  Other than that it was an enjoyable experience.  I would eat here again if I was in the area."

We were so excited to take on the &#34;all-you-can-eat sushi&#34; deal. 

The restaurant was smaller than I expected, but very quaint. We arrived a little before prime lunch time, and seated ourselves at the table close to the sushi bar, but far enough to not be judged by the vast quantities of sushi we would be eating. The deal is that you can order as many sushi rolls, and maki rolls as you want, and as many times as you want, but you will have to finish all of what you order or else they will charge you extra on top of the $25/person pricing. I think $25/person is very reasonable pricing for how their &#34;all-you-can-eat&#34; sushi is set up. They give you the standard white sushi sheet that you can mark which rolls you want after conversing with your dining mates.

After we arrived to a consensus on which rolls we wanted, we decided on a meager number of 11 rolls to start our sushi binge. The rolls were made fresh right in front of our eyes and this made us very giddy and hungrier. The lunch rush started to trickle in and we knew that we would be there for a while since there was only one sushi chef behind the bar. This was okay with us because we were on vacation and had some time to kill. The wait for the sushi was not too bad. We got our first 4 rolls in about 15 minutes, and then the remaining rolls staggered in 5 minute intervals. The next round we opted for 8 rolls. Every roll was great except the seared tuna roll which had an off-putting smoky taste and gasoline smell. All together we had 19 rolls. The last two rolls were not pictured since we were more focused on finishing the food than documenting the last two rolls that we could have done without. Oh the consequences of gluttony. 

We were a bit slow getting out of our chairs, but we were very sushi happy!"

Remember that episode of the Simpsons where Homer goes to The Frying Dutchman&#39;s all-you-can-eat? That was me at Abashiri, except they didn&#39;t give us the stink eye or kick us out. They just kept serving sushi with a smile.

Sushi might easily be one of my favorite styles of food, but I&#39;ve found that you either pay an arm and a leg for quality or you end up having mediocre sushi that&#39;s still more expensive than most meals. However, I&#39;ve discovered that you can have your rolls and eat them too to the tune of $24.95 per person Monday-Thursday at Abashiri. It&#39;s easily the most affordable and most delicious sushi option in the suburbs if not the entire Chicagoland area. Yea, I said it!

We were greeted in Japanese by a petite woman who was also our waitress. She was the only person working there, except for the chef, and there was only one other table when we arrived. It stayed relatively calm the entire night and only two more tables were taken by 7:30pm. It meant that we basically had the waitress to ourselves and the rolls came out at lightning fast speed. I especially liked that when we ordered 6 rolls to begin with that they brought them out to us in groups of 3s so we could begin eating instead of having to wait for all 6 to be completed.

Between the two of us we split a Red Dragon, Godzilla, Lion King, Double Salmon, Salmon Bomb, NY Steak, Super Philadelphia, Paradise, Mexican and another that isn&#39;t coming to mind. Some were better than others, but all of them were good. I especially loved the Godzilla and Mexican, but I might recommend saving the Mexican for last as it is quite spicy (by my standards) and might make it hard to fully appreciate the flavors in the other rolls. We ordered 10 rolls total and barely put a dent in the AYCE sushi list. You could easily come here at least 5 times before you have tried everything they offer.

They also have a small cocktail and alcohol menu that features sake, plum wine and mixed drinks. I almost felt as if we were robbing them with how much sushi we ate for such a small fee, so I tried to throw a few more bucks their way by ordering a Mai Tai. I believe it was just a little over $6. The only complaint I have is that it didn&#39;t have curacao and didn&#39;t have the signature taste, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a real Mai Tai. But it is really alcoholic, so I can&#39;t hate too much. Even after 10 rolls it practically knocked me on my ass."

Shortly after out came the Bento Box it was a generous helping of rice (probably 1 to 1.5 cups worth), decent amount of sesame chicken in a thicker teriyaki sauce (probably 4 ounces of chicken), small yet tasteful salad with the vinaigrette dressing not being overly bitter or sweet, and the tuna crunch rolls.

Of nigiri, yes, but not sushi rolls. So I was happy to come across their carry-out special of 3 rolls for $23.

Super Philadelphia - 3.75 stars. Salmon melted in my mouth. The rice wasn&#39;t as great as it could be.

Godzilla - 3 stars. Shrimp tempura inside with panko crust on top. A bit boring. With a name like that, I expected more.

KG - 3.5 stars. I liked that underneath the mound of tomatoes and tuna cubes were a few spicy tuna rolls.

Check out some of the specialty maki rolls at Abashiri! Sparks of yum were definitely flying as a group of 7 got together for Abashiri&#39;s AYCE sushi.  

Their AYCE menu consists of only maki and special maki rolls.  Abashiri is definitely for the folks that love creative maki and cooked maki rolls. My personal sushi taste runs along the traditional (nigiri!), but I found their maki very flavorful.  The flavors weren&#39;t just a mush of all kinds of ingredients, but seemed very well thought out and every ingredient complimented each other. 

Service was wonderful. The place is on the smaller side but even though we had a big group, service didn&#39;t suffer a bit.   My tip is that if you want AYCE, get your whole group to order AYCE.  Each of you should order 2 rolls and share away.  Still not full?  Order more rolls!  Tea and miso soup is included in the very reasonable price  ($25 bux).  I didn&#39;t know a few people in the group very well, but after some communal platters of sushi, we were all like a big sushi-loving family."

From what I can gather, the best way to do Abashiri is the way we did it: With a group of 5 or 6 people, on a weeknight, everyone doing the All You Can Eat and sharing lots of rolls.

AYCE includes miso (great for a cold rainy night) and green tea (good but there were no sugar packets on the table ... so I just drank it as-is) and lots of rolls. I&#39;m having trouble remembering everything we ordered but I know it included:
Ninja Roll (at least 3 of these)
Hawaiian Roll
Fire Roll
Godzilla Roll
Mexican Roll
Lady Roll
Mango &amp; Tuna
Lobster Roll

... and more, I think we ordered at least 15 or 16 rolls for 5 people. It got a little crazy.

I will say that I was a bigger fan of the fresh rolls than the cooked ones -- the one deep-fried one seemed pretty odd to me -- and overall the ingredients seemed fresh and tasty and pretty well composed. We also were treated by our sashimi-eating cohort to some sake and some kind of shrimp-fish egg-quail egg bite that was surprisingly sweet and rich. 

The waitress was attentive and kept the food and tea coming, and offered advice on NOT ordering rice, because that would just fill us up and we wouldn&#39;t have room for more rolls. She did fail to ask one of the sushi-eating crew if she wanted change, but it was easily fixed.

So: come here on a quiet weeknight with several friends who want to stuff themselves silly with sushi. The end. (Thanks also to OC Candice G who organized our unofficial outing!)"

I&#39;ve never had spicy tuna that was sweet, to the point where I cannot taste the fish flavor. That was a major disappointment to me, as spicy tuna is a staple of the majority of the sushi rolls that they offer in their AYCE menu. Their yellowtail is good and I do not have a problem with their other fish. They don&#39;t use too much rice on their rolls and there is a huge variety; however, with the AYCE option, you are limited to only rolls, not nigiri. And the rice has fallen apart as soon as I picked it up with my chopsticks, the rolls need to be constructed better structurally. Their handrolls were ok; again, we revisit the spicy tuna issue of it being sweet on top of sushi rice making it extra sweet. I would come to this place if I was trying to save some bucks for sushi, just because it&#39;s close to my house. Otherwise, I would have other options available that I would drive to further away."

I&#39;m always greeted by the nice waitress here and I usually am able to sit wherever I want given the restaurant isn&#39;t crowded. The lighting is perfect and gives it a nice dinner feel. It&#39;s not extremely fancy, but definitely has your typical dinner restaurant feel to it.  On the walls are the pictures of many people who, I assume, are people who go there a lot, almost like a wall of fame. A few pictures of some famous golfers, who&#39;ve been to the restaurant have been there, are up there as well.

The all you can eat is spectacular. It&#39;s only $25 and you can get almost any kind of sushi you want! The nigiri (fish on top of rice sushi) is off limits, but who cares? FREE FOR ALL ON THE ROLLS, I TELL YOU! Miso soup also comes with the meal, but the waitress had told me only if you request it.  My friends and I go to this place very frequently, so the waitress knows us now. The waitress tends to poke fun at me and it makes me laugh every time. &#34;You better finish that, or you&#39;ll have to pay for it&#34; she&#39;ll say, every time I have only one roll left to go! 

When we&#39;re done eating, the bill is delivered immediately after we&#39;re all finished and it takes no time at all for her to run the payments. She always gives us a nice &#34;Thank you&#34; and bids us farewell until next time.

First, the hours listed on Yelp are inaccurate. We arrived at quarter to ten, thinking that they closed at eleven. A few minutes after sitting down, they were flipping the sign in the window - it turns out that they in fact close at 10.

Second, upon walking in, we were immediately slammed in the face with the unmistakable smell of bad fish. Not a good first impression for a sushi restaurant.

My third point might be politically incorrect, but I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s a legitimate means of judging a sushi restaurant...

Every single person in the restaurant (not many) - and every single person on the customer wall of fame - was white.

I still haven&#39;t tried their nigiri yet, but their abundance of interesting rolls keeps me interested and wanting to come back when I get the chance.  

For $25, it&#39;s an all you can order for rolls and hand rolls.  While there&#39;s no nigiri, the rolls are made well, plated fairly nicely, and aren&#39;t over packed with rice by any means.  They&#39;re generous with their portions and the customer service is typically spot on.

Why only three stars with such a good review?  We had REALLY slow service... we came in about 8:00, ordered up our rolls, and didn&#39;t get our first roll until 8:35 PM.  After that, it was about another 10 minutes before another two rolls, and then finally our last two rolls made an appearance after.  We quickly ordered up another set of handrolls and rolls, to ensure that the food kept coming so that we wouldn&#39;t be dragging this out until 10:00 PM.

I was curious what happened, so I inquired with the waitress why the service was so slow?  She explained that the restaurant got packed, and then a few large &#34;to go&#34; orders were made so they were busy prepping the those orders.  

My interpretation is basically that since they had a captive audience (folks who are here for all you can order rolls), they prioritized the to go orders first and then had us wait.

After all that&#39;s said and done, we didn&#39;t receive any discount or comped dessert or appetizers... while the waitress was very apologetic, I was disappointed that another gesture wasn&#39;t made (ice cream?  something?)  We had come to Abashiri hoping that we would be in and out within an hour, and instead if took almost two hours and the rest of our night was shot...

Verdict:  Listen, the food is good.  It really is.  The customer service is great, friendly waitresses who are wonderful.  If the owners are reading this, my suggestion is that in the future, if you have a table that&#39;s been waiting for a long time for their order, bring out something to tide them over... edamame, or perhaps even have the chefs prep up one-two of their rolls to bring out and explain the situation with an apology.  Feeling like our order didn&#39;t matter compare to the &#34;to go&#34; orders leaves me feeling like the red-headed step child that the family doesn&#39;t love, and ends up souring the mood of the evening.  Will I be back?  Ultimately, yes, because the rolls are pretty tasty and the variety is huge.  I&#39;ll just hope that this is a rare experience and hope that the owners learn to adapt to pleasing the customers instead of being flustered and avoid our table knowing that we&#39;ve got long wait ahead of us."

No lies, no lies, no lies as Drake would say. Honestly I don&#39;t know how else to describe the sushi here except for it being BOMB as hell. It just has so much flavor. This is the only place that knows how to make spicy tuna rolls how I like it. I feel super full and healthy everytime I leave this place. I always always order alaskan and spicy tuna roll within the bento box. It&#39;s just the best combo ever. I&#39;ll order this for lunch and or dinner. For lunch it&#39;s under 10$ and for dinner it&#39;s around $14. I love that you can substitute some stuff if you don&#39;t like it. Also they have a great $24.95 all you can eat buffet for sushi. I don&#39;t think you can beat that price especially out here in the burbs. Abashiri I&#39;ve been wanting to be up there on your hall of fame. Someday one day."

Oh, and the Unagi Crunch roll...and the Baked Lobster Roll...and, well, I could spend a long time reviewing all the deliciousness of this place, but it&#39;s best if you just go and try it for yourself!"

Atmosphere:
Small sushi place with lots of the feels! As soon as you walk in, you can see the walls filled with the photos of happy customers. The decor has a lot of traditional Japanese items, and it has a real home feel. It looks a lot better inside than the plain and rather dull exterior lol. Can&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover indeed! I hope to be on the wall with my friends someday...

Food:
All You Can Eat, All Day and Everyday! Sushi is of surprisingly good quality and plenty of variety! You are bound to find a roll you enjoy. I love most of their Avocado rolls! They aren&#39;t skimpy with avocado either! However the only thing that dampens the experience for me is the use of Cucumbers on a lot of their rolls. I hate cucumbers, and the particular cucumbers they use has a taste you can&#39;t ignore. Other than that, I love the food at this place! Baked Spicy Salmon and the Super Philly roll are some of my favorites. Which I love and makes it a distinct place for me! This place has a knack for making their rolls nice and creamy. I would also definitely try their Baked Rolls for a new experience. Hot sushi never tasted so damn good! There is always a different taste on the menu to try. Don&#39;t forget to ask for the complimentary Miso Soup and tea!

Service:
We had this wonderful waitress that was very attentive and friendly. She greeted us at the door and took care of us the whole way through. She even made us smile and cracked a couple jokes too! My 6 six person group was well taken care of considering we ordered well over 200 pieces! All You Can Eat to the MAX!

I had a wonderful experience with friends here, and I would recommend it if your girl was in the mood for sushi! They really seem to treat their regulars well, and I hope to be on their wall of pictures one day. The $24.95 price for all you can eat quality sushi is hard to beat! The service and atmosphere are a very welcome addition!"

I happened to get an email from Yelp this morning about AYCE sushi and didn&#39;t realize there was a place so close to home. 
We walked in, not too many people, got seated right away with a friendly smile. After we got seated, the service did seem to lack a little.  There were people who came in after us and got their drinks before we did. We also had never been there, so wanted to know which sushi was all you can eat, but it took a while for the waitress to come over to us, even though there weren&#39;t too many people.
The reason I gave this place 4 stars was because when the food arrived, it was great! I can&#39;t even decide which roll I liked the most, they were all good! 
I do believe that we will be back, especially when we are super hungry to do the all you can eat again! I want to try all the rolls they offer!"

only issue i had was the service. it was unbelievably bad. we sat there for TWO hours  and only one roll came out at a time. we wanted to have a quick sushi dinner and continue our night but we sat there for two hours waiting to get all of our sushi. the waiters were not attentive to us at all, we waited nearly an hour for our first roll. I&#39;ve never had to wait so long in my life for sushi. we were all very disappointed. it was really hard to enjoy ourselves when we&#39;re sitting there splitting one roll at a time.

I&#39;ve been spoiled and had only gone to &#34;upscale&#34; sushi places.  My stomach, and my wallet, are glad my coworkers introduced me to Abashiri!  Fantastic sushi at truly reasonable prices.

I especially enjoyed the many &#34;combos&#34; they have to offer, affordable with a bit of variety.  I tried the 290 combo (most of the combos are named after the area so you have the local names, roads, etc.).  The combos come with 3 small fried dumplings (very yummy), a small house salad (loved the house dressing...I think it was Ginger/Orange?), and 2 different kinds of sushi/rolls - mine had the Philladelphia roll and the Spicy Tuna roll.  Delish!

My coworkers have tried many things here and said they haven&#39;t had anything that they didn&#39;t like yet.  AND they don&#39;t mind giving you seperate checks :-)

It&#39;s in a little spot in a strip mall, easy to overlook.  The big sign just says &#34;SUSHI&#34;.  The staff is very friendly and when they greet you hello or say goodbye it sounds a little like they are yelling at you in another language but it&#39;s fun."

The AYCE was not tested, as that kind of thing leads to obesity. My dinnner compadre and I have sampled sushi from north to south and this place rates... OK. Not fantastic, not great, just OK.

I would give it higher marks except for the service. Yes, I read the reviews that said the service was substandard, yet I was not prepared for getting our meal served piecemeal over 25 minutes, like separate courses. What did we order you ask. Spicy Dragon and Crunchy Rainbow rolls, and 6 pieces of nigeri sushi. What?!? And it took a half hour for everything to hit the table? Yep.

So even if the sushi was excellent they lose a star for the service. And it wasn&#39;t. It was... OK.

The bill came to $35.50. Not my kind of dining experience. We will not be returning, not when we could just as easily gone to Sushi Mono in Wheaton."

The waiter was attentive and friendly. They have an interesting ordering system - they give you the menu and a small ordering sheet. Once you&#39;ve made your decision, you put the quantity you want against whichever menu item you want on the ordering sheet. This actually seems quite brilliant, as there is no room for misunderstood words (and with my Australian accent, I have found this to be a problem sometimes!), and it probably makes it easier for the waiters and chefs. 

We ordered two rolls (total of 11 slices) and one serve of nigiri (total of 2 pieces). Our rolls were: one tempura salmon and some vegetables on the inside (can&#39;t recall which), and fresh salmon on the outside; one California roll. Nigiri was the salmon nigiri. That was enough to fill us up! All items were delicious and seemed freshly prepared. There were only four other tables/9 other people in the restaurant, so it wasn&#39;t very noisy or busy; just a nice, relaxing, quick, nutritious and delicious meal. 

It cost us $24 (before tip) for two rolls and two pieces of nigiri.

We will definitely be back!"

Seriously, though - Next time I might have to walk here...all you can eat!

And I did.

I ordered a few things based on awesome name alone - Godzilla Roll, Lion King Roll...and I LOVED them. This is the third sushi place I&#39;ve been, and it ties for the #1 spot. $25 for the AYCE, and I was more than filled. Almost everything was fantastic with the sole exception of the NY Steak Roll...which I tried for the novelty of having steak in a roll, and it was ... well, steak in a roll. Nothing terribly great about that one, but everything else, from the Double Salmon Roll, to the Paradise Roll (sweet goodness that was great), was fantastic.

Going back asap, no questions about it. And it&#39;s right down the street...I can call it &#34;exercise&#34; by walking there!

Great service and great food. I can&#39;t recommend this place enough.

Teriyaki sauce is 1) homemade 2) delicious, very very delicious. Its not overly salty, but instead has a nice balance of flavors that go well with smoky flavors from the grilled meat. Service was smooth and the cashier lady was very nice and accommodating not just towards my group but to all other patrons as well. We&#39;ll definitely be coming back. 

Honestly, if this place was in downtown chicago, it would have a very very good chance of succeeding. Nothing outlandish, just great quality food you can taste and very large portions for reasonable prices."

I had always wondered if there was anywhere to sit in this space. Yes, there is, and they have high chairs too. Entrees are, in general, around the $9 mark, but they give you enough for two meals, so that&#39;s not a big deal. 

Ah, the rice. They must have rinsed the rice a hundred times, because I&#39;ve never had rice so clumpy yet not starchy. Perfect chopstick-compatible texture. 

Me and the baby split a standard chicken teriyaki, as well as a pineapple chicken teriyaki plate. The pineapple chicken teriyaki wasn&#39;t bad, although next time I would stick with the standard teriyaki plate--teriyaki sauce + sweet and sour sauce doesn&#39;t taste quite right. 

Happily, the teriyaki sauce they do have is quite good. Nice and simple, not too mirin-y, not too sweet.  The chicken was cooked nice and tender, and just the right bite size for everyone at the table.

I also appreciated the house salad, which was fresh, though I couldn&#39;t tell you much more about the dressing.

Definitely give this place a shot!"

I don&#39;t know the difference between great teriyaki and bad teriyaki. All I know is that its suppose to be like a sweet soy sauce. 

Located next to an Aldi and a Chinese Buffet, this place is a small little eatery in a strip mall. 

Their claim to fame is their teriyaki sauce which I found to be tasty. I got the:

Chicken Teriyaki: (8.99) Chicken was juicy, it comes with salad and rice. It was sweet and salty and tangy. The salad had some sort of sweet creamy dressing which I like and the rice was a shorter grain than most Asian take out places which was a nice touch. 

What really stands out about this place is the HUGE portion. (See Picture), I got like half a chicken&#39;s worth of meat and a pound of rice. It all comes on a gigantic plate.

They also have extra teriyaki sauce bottles everywhere just in case you wanted more.  

Overall I would say if you&#39;re a teriyaki lover, this is the spot for you. I&#39;m pretty indifferent about it but I do recognize good quality and clean service which this place certainly does have. 

Keep in mind the food takes some time to come out because its cooked to order. 

Will definitely return."

The spicy pork was more sweet than spicy, and I liked the portions to this because I was full after half. There was a slight smokiness to it too, which I enjoyed, but it was too weak for me in spiciness. However, my tolerance for spicy foods is higher than average so.. haha.

Fast, efficient service. I had called in my order 30 minutes ahead. Google&#39;s navi directed me over to this pizza place on the other side of the street (-.-); thankfully a yelper posted tips on how to get there correctly hehe.

I&#39;ve had better spicy pork so I don&#39;t think I would order it again, but I enjoyed it nonetheless so taking into account the price, portions, and no-frills service, it would be a solid 4 from me."

I&#39;ve visited other businesses in this strip mall. But until yesterday, I never stopped here. 

I had a pounding hunger headache and I needed to hit the auto parts stores over in this area to look for some parts. Yelp reviews told me about how this place had fantastic homemade teriyaki sauce. As a longtime Japanese food fan, I&#39;m usually not the biggest fan of teriyaki -- mainly because a lot of people get lazy with it and just use store-bought sauce. If you&#39;re going to do it in a restaurant, make it your own. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too much to ask. 

This place does. Also, as soon as you walk in, you see that they have two things on every table: a bottle of their homemade teriyaki sauce (so you don&#39;t have to ask for extra if you eat in), and a bottle of Sriracha. (Proper Sriracha -- no Lee Kum Kee bootleg cocksauce here!) 

Lunch special is great. You get a little salad with a nice homemade creamy dressing, fluffy rice (white rice is included, but you can substitute fried for an additional charge), and your meat of choice. I had chicken. I&#39;ll upload photos in a moment. 

Drinks selection is your typical fountain stuff augmented by a cooler full of iced tea/energy drinks/Vitamin Water/Sobe. I wish they offered hot tea, but that&#39;s a minor quibble. 

Their homemade teriyaki sauce is great. Add Sriracha to the fluffy white rice and contrast the layered spiciness with the sweet/salty teriyaki and have a very happy party. In your mouth. I heard what I said. 

They also offer free samples if you&#39;re not sure. Stop in and give it a try. I want to try the spicy pork next time. :9"

I&#39;ve driven by many times and noticed it out of the corner of my eye, however I&#39;ve never been motivated to stop in and try it until today. 

Having seen some raves reviews here on Yelp and some good buzz around my office from co-workers I decided to try a few things on the menu. I ordered a spicy chicken teriyaki meal, an order of fried rice and a five piece side order of gyoza.

First off let&#39;s touch on the chicken teriyaki. The foam container had the chicken and some sauce in two pockets and a main pocket of white rice. The chicken itself was well grilled while still retaining a tender texture and the sauce was a very nice compliment. The overall taste was excellent and the portion size was very reasonable for the money. The white rice included was just regular white rice so there&#39;s not much to note there. 

The gyoza&#39;s included were pretty good as well but a little on the small side. For those unfamiliar with gyoza, it&#39;s a variation on the pot sticker. These seemed to include a seasoned white meat of some type (possibly pork). These were nice as an appetizer but I&#39;ve had better.

Finally to comment on the fried rice. The fried rice I had was pretty good there were chopped up vegatables and a lot of egg mixed in. I liked the overall taste though I would probably not order it as a standalone side again, but would instead upgrade the white rice bundled with the entree to the fried rice if possible. 

Overall I liked my food and will definitely be coming again. I&#39;ll give this place five stars for being great food at a great value."

The chicken teriyaki plate was good, and he enjoyed the chicken katsu plate.  The salad came out from the kitchen with a delicious dressing on it.  We decided to try the variety of sauces they had bottled near the kitchen.  We identified one of the bottled sauces as the salad dressing and I added some more to my salad.  WHOA, bad idea!  It&#39;s apparently a dairy-based sauce and is NOT good after it&#39;s been sitting out and fermenting.  Gross.  Please, PLEASE Joy Teriyaki - refrigerate your dairy-based sauces so they don&#39;t sit out and get rank.  That&#39;s a tummy issue waiting to happen!  I ended up having some tummy gurgles afterward. :( 

Aside from the foul-taste of the Sitting Out Sauce, the rest of the dining experience was good.  Joy Teriyaki was a no-frills place with fair-priced lunch specials.  I&#39;ll be back, but if I want any more salad dressing, it won&#39;t be from the bottle sitting out on the counter!"

Food - Wonderful.  The best teriyaki place I&#39;ve ever eaten.  Their spicy chicken teriyaki makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside its so good.  The perfect blend of sweet and spice.

Service - Sub par.  The latest complaint comes from my experience at lunch this afternoon.  I called an order in as I typically do at noon.  The woman on the phone struggled to comprehend what I was telling her and didn&#39;t understand my name even after providing it to her a 3rd time.  Once the order was placed I was told 15-20 mins for pickup, which pleased me since I work 15 mins away from their location.  Upon arrival at 12:15-12:20 the food was not ready so a coworker and myself paid at the register and found a seat to wait for our order.  12:30 rolls around and still nothing.  12:40, still waiting.... 12:55 was the final straw.  I went back up to the counter and kindly asked what was the reason for the delay.  You could tell by the shocked look in her eye that our order had either been given to someone else or forgotten, keep in mind several other people that came in after us who had not called in orders had already gotten their food and almost finished.  1:00 and our food was finally up!  Thinking they might offer us a discount or a credit on our next meal I was immediately overwhelmed with disappointment when she placed an order of egg rolls in front of us as compensation for the inconvenience.  Some of you are saying to yourself, &#34;I don&#39;t know, that seems fair.&#34;  If you have ever had the egg rolls from Joy Teriyaki you would have been just as disappointed as we were, especially after this last price increase cost us 15.00 an order for a plate of fried rice, chicken, salad, and a fountain drink.  I am not one to complain but I have had this happen to me several times in the past and nothing seems to change except for the price, which is now higher than ever.

To sum all of this up.  Joy Teriyaki has always been a favorite but I will no longer continue to give them my business given the current prices.  There is a great chinese restaurant in Glendale Hts off of North Ave called China Chef where the food quality is just as good if not better and the portions are larger for half the price, its not the same food but similar cuisine.  If you have had a similar story or are just fed up with prices like myself please join me in boycotting this establishment."

Their teriyaki is very good, I love that there&#39;s a bottle at every table and also several other bottles of various sauces available for your dish. 

I&#39;m glad they don&#39;t have too many choices, because I would never be able to make up my mind. But one day, I decided on the simple chicken teriyaki and I was very surprised at the portion I got...HUGE! When I was paying, I was thinking it was a little pricey but I then saw the amount of food I payed for and it made it that much better. 

All of the chicken in my dish tasted fresh and not very fatty, which is what I like.

I had the 7.99 teriyaki chicken lunch special. Came with a big portion of chicken, white rice and a side salad with what i want to call a sesame, rice vinegar dressing. Not a fan of vinagrette dressings but this one was really good. The chicken was tender but had a nice carmelized char from the sauce, the sauce itself was amazing. Each table had a bottle of teriyaki sauce and a bottle of sriracha, two very essential things to me when i eat teriyaki, so you have controll over the heat or sweetness. 

The portion size is pretty big for the price..i ended up boxing up almost half of it because i got full. One negative thing is they take a bit of time to get your order out, my lunch break is an hour long, it took me 15 minutes to get there around 15 minutes for my food to come out, 15 minutes to eat and 15 to get back. This being my first time it really isnt a big deal, next time ill call ahead, as i suggest anyone on a time frame to do so. Other than that, it was a great meal, the only thing id add is some sliced avocado, i dont know if thats just a california thing, but it makes a huge difference, also lookong forward to trying the teriyaki beef and spicy pork.

So she asks if she can get everything without sauce.  I think she missed the whole point of this place, uh derp? I believe they were willing to accommodate her.
Anyway, even though I pass this place several times a day, I&#39;ve been avoiding this place, as a typical Chinese cuisine place.  I remember, and liked when this location was a Caribbean(?) cuisine joint, which I liked, but didn&#39;t last. I figured this place wasn&#39;t going to last either.  Finally I took a look at the reviews and was intrigued, especially since it has lasted so long.  
I had the spicy pork, based on the recommendations here, and it did not disappoint!  The lunch special was a little pricey, but the portion was huge.  Another reviewer indicated they make their own sauces, which is a plus in my book; it all tasted freshly made.

&#34; yup, call in a spicy for me &#34; 
It&#39;s about the best lunch around and since I&#39;ve been there often, I can say it&#39;s consistently good. 
The &#34;call in&#34; part is key, as it appears all orders are made on the spot and not just scooped out of some vat in back . At lunch time, the wait can burn up a lot of your git ta&#39; et&#39;n time, also the place fills up quick. I&#39;m unfortunately creature of habit, so the chicken Teriyaki lunch deal is my thing- but I have dabbled in the spicy. And it&#39;s spicy spicy. Not OMG spicy, but just enough heat to remind you what you got with every bite. 
If you are dining in, lunch is served on a china plate, or a foam box if you get it to go. Bottles of teriyaki and Sriracha  are on the tables and real silverware is available. Unless you are one of those fancy know it all metro scooter riding types, then chopsticks are available to fumble with before grabbing a damn fork and eating like the rest of us. 
Not that I&#39;ve ever done that. 
Ok it was me. 
Tips: they like cash, and reward cash payments with a punch card, although I&#39;m not in the club so I&#39;m not sure what it gets ya. 
Enjoy Joy!"

This place should be called Happy Happy Joy Joy Teriyaki.  Located in the weirdly unholy Bermuda Triangle of good Asian food near Army Trail and Bloomingdale Road which has Pho Ha, Hong Ning and Joy Teriyaki within a 1 mile radius of each other,  this place managed to break a couple of my resolutions, nay three of them, thus keeping with the tri-themed review. 

First of all, as with 80% of the country, I resolved to eat healthier in 2013.  Less red meat, namely pork, which is the best meat in the galaxy.  I also resolved to exercise more in what free time I have, and to eat less, as in, eat until satiated.  Not, &#34;Eat until food bypasses digestion phase and escapes oral-gastric tract by means of nostrils.&#34;  Yes, eating until food comes out the nose is NOT the plan.   
So how did I come to squash these resolutions?  A fateful Friday where I dropped the wife off to visit a friend, and I was to kill a couple of hours in whatever way I imagined.  Go to the gym?  I could have, but I didn&#39;t bring my bag.  I suppose that couldn&#39;t stop me from finding a trail, or even a sidewalk to just walk off a few calories.  But no. I contemplated going to the Avalanche to have a drink and catch the Bulls game, but I thought I might get thrashed if I walked in there with tall Hunters on my feet.  SO, I went to Half Price, picked up a stack of 50 cent Cook&#39;s Illustrated issues and read some in the car while waiting for the call to pick up the wife.  When the approximate time came, and the call didn&#39;t come through, the hunger buzzer in my belly alarmed.  

Deciding on Joy Teriyaki out of the three restaurants named above, I opted for the Spicy Pork and Chicken Breast Plate.  It took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready, but good things come to those who wait. Time food was ready - 08:11pm.  Time wife called for car service - 08:13pm.  Went to retrieve her and ended up going to Target before heading home.  Ate salad portion of meal while walking around Target.  Home at 10:20pm.  Watched Netflix while eating my delicious Spicy Pork and Chicken.  From what I remembered, the pork was tender, with minimal fat.  And it was my favorite cut of pork - SHOULDER.  The Crash Test Dummies comes to mind.  Mmm mmm mmm mmm.   Wasn&#39;t too spicy, but it tasted great and the chicken was also very clean tasting.  The rice, I could have used more of it, but it was cooked well.  The best part of it all?  The teriyaki.  Holy shabazz.  Talk about unctuous in a good way, this stuff had mouth-feel galore.  I mixed a little sriracha into mine and fell asleep while eating.  Kind of sad, no?  I woke up rip-roaring full, and sad, because I had to admit defeat and put it away in the fridge until the next morning.  

2 days later, I&#39;m still saving it in order to prolong the joy."

From the outside you would think that it was like some low quality restaurant since the sign is so plain and the parking lot in front of it it getting pretty poor. But yeah, not too shabby.

I thought at first the prices were a little high, but then after getting the food I was just like, WHOA! I ordered the beef and they seriously give you about two handfuls of beef. It wasn&#39;t like amazingly  tasting beef teriyaki but it wasn&#39;t horrible either. 

Went here once and it was packed but I guess it all depends on the time of day because this last time I went, it was afternoon and it was like dead. Guy at the register was literally staring at the window. Good place to go if you want quick Asian style food with rice that&#39;s not americanized yet."

Its was excellent.  I went for the fried rice instead of the white rice this time as well.  All around good food.  The eating area does need work though as the walls in some places look like they might have small holes in them.  Kind of gives the saying &#34;hole in the wall&#34; a whole new meaning LOL.  It&#39;s really not bad and the place is pretty clean.  Other then the simple seating area, the place has good food.  You can see the kitchen area and it looks clean and organized which is the most important. They make their own teriyaki sauce and its very good.  I did see an small sign that said they were going to raise the prices on the menu in January 2013, I was bummed but if its only a buck or two, its still a great deal.  Overall good food!

I went here based on my love of chicken teriyaki and the good Yelp reviews. I came for a Saturday lunch and so it was not crowded and we had no trouble getting a table.  The chicken teriyaki is so tender.  The chicken Katsu is like very crunchy chicken tenders.  It comes with a side of good tasting barbeque sauce.  Portions are large, service was friendly.

After eating at Joy Teriyaki you will feel fat and you will feel full. 

You definitely get what you pay for here...in food and in flavor, especially for a &#34;fast food&#34; type of joint. I always go for their specialty, the chicken teriyaki. The chicken is always tender and you probably get about 10 ounces worth. I opt to either split the dish with someone, or else I find myself with lunch for the next day.

Yays: 
- Massive portions. When I say massive, 2 people could easily share a dish.
- Killer teriyaki sauce. And bottle of it at each table.
- Love the fried rice &amp; veggie egg rolls. And the gyoza.
- Spicy pork. It has just the right kick. 
- Salad comes with every plate. I suppose that&#39;s their effort to make you feel like you&#39;re eating somewhat healthy.

Nays:
- Service blows. It&#39;s not fast, and it&#39;s not friendly.
- I question where the chicken comes from. It tastes good, and it&#39;s tender. However,  I often wonder how much of  &#34;real chicken&#34; it is. ((I think I&#39;m jaded after watching &#34;Food Inc.&#34;))
- Kinda grimy inside.
- Gets very busy during peak hours. Expect a 15 minute wait for &#34;fast&#34; food. 

Overall, Joy Teriyaki isn&#39;t bad. It&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve eaten, but for a quick bite, it definitely does the job!"

I&#39;ve always tried the Lunch Specials (Beef Teriyaki, Spicy Pork, and Chicken Teriyaki).  All were great for the price.  The plates they use for dine-in are basically a serving platter in size and the food servings consume the majority of the plate surface.  I enjoyed the Spicy Pork the most, but it wasn&#39;t really that spicy it was more of a savory type sauce.  Pork was just the perfect texture.  It was cooked just right to still be tender.  This place can be busy so keep that in mind if you&#39;re in a rush."

Their teriyaki sauce is absolutely the best. Drench everything in that stuff. I&#39;ve mostly just tried their grilled chicken and chicken katsu, but I have tried a mouthful or two of their shrimp and it was also not bad.

So I&#39;ve told you how good their teriyaki sauce is- but let me tell you- their fried rice is AMAZING. It is quite different than your typical asian fried rice. Especially good if you squirt some of their teriyaki sauce on it. I highly recommend Joy. If you live anywhere in the 30 minute radius, it&#39;s going to be worth the trip."

Food:

Portions were very generous and MSG FREE! I was very full and probably should have taken leftovers home, but it was too good to refrigerate. They literally give you a gigantic plate for dine in lol. It was my first visit and I had a mixed combo of Chicken Breast and Chicken Teriyaki. The dish came with Fried Rice and Salad. The chicken was hot, fresh, and so god damn TENDER.... It was complemented perfectly by their homemade Teriyaki sauce. The sauce wasn&#39;t too sweet either which is a problem most Teriyaki dishes have. Not too strong either... Just right and they hand you a whole bottle for dine in! The Fried Rice and White Rice deserve a special mention as well. They don&#39;t use the typical bulk cheap rice. They use legit Japanese rice that is more pricey and has that hearty texture. You can taste the freshness of the steamed vegetables in the Fried Rice. The Rice and Teriyaki go so well hand in hand! The Salad is okay. It&#39;s just there. It&#39;s not bad. I am definitely coming back for the food!

Service:

Nice Counter lady. Food came out under 7 minutes when I came in while it had a decent amount of people in which was nice. Can&#39;t really say much else, it&#39;s a Walk in food place. The lady gave me good directions to find the place as well. 

Atmosphere:

Hole in the wall place. Not going to lie, the place is kind of depressing. It looks like it hasn&#39;t been renovated since the 80&#39;s. The walls literally have 80&#39;s convenience store wallpaper that is peeling off. You get used to it fast, but I would not take any girls on dates here. Good for groups of hungry college students for sure lol. It&#39;s also kind of hard to spot. It&#39;s located in the Walter E. Smite parking lot area and right next to Subway.

Overall, I will go here for the epic food! I was really satisfied on my first visit, I hope to update my review when I try out the other menu items."

I had the chicken and beef teriyaki combo ($10.50) and everything was excellent! I will say that I&#39;m not comfortable spending $8+ on work lunch usually so I probably won&#39;t make it habit, but I&#39;d spend $20 on this at a restaurant dinner and leave with a smile on my face.

We wanted to get it spicy at .50 cents more for each meal. A fried rice substitution was $1.75 more per plate. Egg rolls were $1.99 each. Plus the two drinks ran for a total of $30.09.

Surprise, it&#39;s actually the crack-like teriyaki sauce at Joy Teriyaki that defines modern addiction. (full disclosure: i do not know what crack is like).

I really wish I were kidding about this, but I&#39;ve been to this restaurant nearly three times weekly for the last six months. It is a running standard for my office, friends from the city, nearly anyone if they are hungry and within twenty miles of this location. The service is pleasant, the menu diverse (even though I always order the same damn thing), and they don&#39;t mind if you use an entire bottle of sauce, which my boss and I are prone to doing.

The food... After comparing it to drugs and addiction earlier in the review, it&#39;s hard to go up from there, but put simply, it&#39;s massive, massive portions, cooked perfectly, with a boatload of sauces and seasonings to tickle any palette. The store is not really all that much to look at, but if you&#39;re looking at anything other than the food, something is horribly wrong with your brain and it needs a checkup.

If you&#39;re remotely close to Glendale Heights, for any reason, this should be a top priority to visit. Drugs are bad. Joy Teriyaki is good.

PRO TIPZ:
* Call ahead. The wait isn&#39;t bad, but since they make everything fresh, if you let them know when you&#39;ll arrive for dine-in it can shrink the delay between you and your saucedrugs.
* The salad is fine, but I recommend opting for extra rice instead.
* If there&#39;s a big group, the quality does start to suffer as their small kitchen fights to keep ahead of the orders.
* There&#39;s nothing wrong with the standard Chicken Teriyaki, but I prefer the Chicken Breast, which is cents more and all white meat.
* Seriously, about the whole addiction thing. I&#39;ve had people tell me, after one visit, that they&#39;ve been craving Joy months after the fact. There is something really really unusually amazingly addictive about this place."

My dad recommended this to me and my family, so we went together for dinner.  I have to rave about that salad dressing like everyone else.  What is it that makes it taste sooo good????  I could eat salad all day with that dressing!  We usually bring some home with us.  My kids (1 and 3) love it too and I&#39;m thrilled that it helps me get them to eat veggies.

I definitely recommend the fried rice, gyoza, katsu, and their fried chicken (wings) platter.  My husband likes their teriyaki and kalbi.

You get a generous portion whatever delicious meat you choose, and a generous amount of rice with a nice fresh cool salad (dunno what that dressing is but it is delicious).  

I normally get the spicy pork!  Wow it has a smoky flavor to it, tender and stir-fried in a spicy sauce.  I love it!  The chicken is good as well, very tender and grilled.  The teriyaki sauce is sweet but not too sweet and flavorful.  The beef is bulgogi and was good as well but not as great as I thought.  Stick with the chicken or spicy pork.

Also their gyozas are amazing.  Its fried and crispy with nice flavorful pork and veggies inside.  I love those as well.

You will not get this type of food anywhere else so enjoy!"

They&#39;re located right by a subway, an aldi, a currency exchange and an abandoned Baker&#39;s Square.  I had no idea what to expect when we first went there.
My first impression was that it was very clean!  The cashier greeted me warmly and the menu was very straightforward.   They had chicken teriyaki on special, like $5 or so.  We had our 2-year-old son, so I was relieved to see that they had high chairs.  The Beatles were playing non-stop, and it was a happy little detail for me.  Our food arrived on big white platters, arranged beautifully in ample portions.  From first bite to last, the food was amazing.  The rice was cooked perfectly, the teriyaki was just right.  My son gobbled it up with both hands, he loved it.  The salad dressing is to die for!  We have since gotten their food to-go as well, with nothing lacking in portion size or quality.

Located in some strip mall next to Aldi and Subway, this place didn&#39;t really stand out too much at first. Not inviting, to be honest. My friend took me here one time and now after more than 2 years later, I still come here regularly with my husband. We are devoted customers - we have brought friends to this place. We even ordered their catering plates when we had a gathering once. The husband always get the spicy pork, I sometimes switch around between chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. DELICIOUS. Salad is fresh, the dressing makes it super yummy. We always try to grab the salad dressing and sweet &amp; sour sauce bottles from the counter but sometimes, no luck. If you do have those, mix these sauces together with the teriyaki sauce and sriracha (they are at every table), and you are set. Great price too! I always have some leftovers to take home.

Tried South Indian cuisine, chettinad dosa was amazing, so was rava masala, which we ordered twice.

Restrooms are dirty and they place chutneys right next to these dirty restrooms. Take a peek at their kitchen as well and I guarantee you won&#39;t be able to take the next bite. Hakka noodles are worse than Maggie/Ramen Noodles. Absolutely horrible and no I am not exaggerating. Chettinad dosa costs 12 bucks a pop and it is not even enough for an appetizer.

We were really hungry and were disappointed to find that there was no Weekend Buffet for lunch. Now, everyone ordered only Dosas all around the table. I had a bite off Masala Idli - which was really good, Chettinad Idli - which was pretty good and the Cheese Fried Idli - which was OK. Friends had ordered the Lamb Dosa - which was OK and the Chicken Dosa - which was really good. Then I ordered the Goan Fish Curry with Garlic Naan - Oh my god, I really really recommend this one. It was really really good - the best Curry I have tasted in recent times I have gone to various indian joints. We also ordered the Mutton Megalu - which was super spicy and delicious ( Indian spicy - so you might want to say MILD for this) and side of Bhatura - pretty big Puri (which is wheat based Fried roti). 

Staff were pretty friendly, but they were short handed - just one person taking orders and going around, one person who was just going around collecting the plates when done. It looked a little fine dining - when plates are shapped like a mini - banana leaf and every time they were bringing new plates for every dish, which was UN-NECESSARY. It was really expensive and the portions were small. Other than that, I would definitely think this place is good and serves good food. (Atleast when I went it did)"

3. Navratan Kurma - Price @11.99 and quantity so less that two people can hardly share.

You get complimentary soup to start which was too spicy for both of us. I got the lunch special which came with 2 different types of chicken which were moist (one was curried), green beans and rice, yogurt, vegetables, white rice. It was all pretty good. My roommate had the chettinad express which was minced chicken stuffed in a dosa and grilled crispy. It was good but so so spicy. 

Complimentary dessert of a doughnut type soaked in honey. Yum."

I&#39;m a &#34;southie&#34; born stateside.  I&#39;ve done the &#34;hotels&#34;  in India that do this type of cuisine.  I&#39;m used to it, my Ma makes it for me often.  This however was sub par at best.  I think it&#39;s the &#34;coconuts&#34; bringing their American friends that love it most.  I wish there was an example of the true South Indian goodness here that I could relate.  Closest example would be Udupi Palace on Devon ave in Chicago or this other South Indian favorite up in Lake Forest on route 60 but that name for some reason eludes me at the moment..  Beyond the dislike of their masala dosa, I found the buffet food to be just alright.  Nothing special with a few staple Indo Chinese type entrees.  Obviously they are trying to hit a wide niche of guests.

You would be surprised to know that this is a global chain restaurant and like most chains they stick to doing it the same, never straying from one flavor.  From one South Indian to another.. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.  From one American to another that may not ever travel to South India and discover truer flavors.. I guess it comes close.  You might like it.

If this place was on my usual trek I might stop in during happy hour and sample some other dishes.  Nice looking restaurant setup in a strip mall.  They did a decent job at trying to make it look like a real sit down restaurant rather than like a business that may or may not make it through the next couple years.  I.e. a strip mall eatery."

My experience with Indian foods involves many, many buffets and restaurants. Never have I found one that made delicious food and managed not to make me sick, too. This is partially due to my lactose problem and inability to stay away from Indian food. Since I can remember, eating restaurant Indian food has given me pain and ulcers. I always thought it was the spice, but not after I stuffed myself here at Sankalp. I ordered the combo dossa platter. I can&#39;t remember which dossas I ordered, but they were very good. We received two small hot &#34;soups,&#34; one refillable, to dip our food in. They were both delicious. I&#39;m not a fan of chutney, but others in my party enjoyed that.

The food was spicy, and though I&#39;m super full, my head isn&#39;t spinning, and I&#39;m not stuffing down burps and hiccups for the remainder of my work day.

Sankalp&#39;s style is South Indian, and from what I could tell, is less buttery and saucey than dishes at other restaurants I&#39;ve tried. They are spicey, but not necessarily saucey. I&#39;m judging from the paneer and other fillings I had in my dossas, so I wouldn&#39;t know about the other entrees. I really don&#39;t need a stick of butter or a pound of cheese in my food and this was refreshingly simple.

Someone who enjoys eating their Indian food doused in heavily flavored sauce may not enjoy this place as much as I did.

Also, the dossas are not exactly &#34;mini&#34; as the menu says. I am not a super eater, but had two dossas left over for dinner."

I figured this was some startup and had no idea this place is a chain of sorts. I totally expected it would be run down in this mall and dead. NOPE!
 This place was PACKED to the rafters on a Thursday. I am pretty new to the Indian food thing, I have to say that even though this place was busy, the guys there were EXTREMELY helpful. I had Malbari Paneer and some paratha...twas heavenly. I got so strung out on this stuff that I returned with the wife this morning. Same great service, same good taste...and what do you know? They have pina coladas and all kinds of refreshing house made soft drinks. I had a mixed up lime soda -slrrrp!

 Me and the wife (Wife and I?) did a repeat on the paneer, had a massive dose &#39;a dosa...and the ubiquitous samosa with green spicy sauce stuff. 
More joints like this would be so beneficial to our microlocal food scene.

Sankalp is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking.  As I walked from my car, the predominant aromas in the air were from the doughnut shop a few doors down.  I thought Indian food would be able to overcome that, but I digress.

The seating area was medium sized and held around 20 tables... maybe fewer.  The decor was clean, but nothing fancy.  The layout was dictated by the strip mall unit rectangle that we are all familiar with.
There was incense burning just inside the door, and the smell was too strong throughout the restaurant, but I was distracted from it once I started eating.

Prior to our visit, we were told that there is a lunch buffet, but when you walk in you do not see the usual table full of food.  We asked the waiter and he assured us that the entire menu was the buffet.  This was puzzling and we asked for clarification, but he reiterated that we could order whatever we wanted for the buffet price of $11.  So we sat down and prepared for lunch... and what a feast it was!

I don&#39;t know the names of anything I ate because my friend ordered everything for me.  What I do know is that everything came out freshly prepared and delicious.  The portions were huge considering the many items that we ordered.  I did my best to eat everything that was ordered and I felt a little guilty that we had so much food because being a &#34;buffet&#34; I assumed I wouldn&#39;t be able to take the leftovers home.  They even included desserts in this deal.  It was unbelievably decadent!

I ate so much food that I could barely move.  I didn&#39;t even feel hungry for dinner that night.

I don&#39;t know if they will keep this &#34;buffet&#34; deal going as I don&#39;t see how they can afford to, but I will definitely be back.
I usually like to eat Indian food in a buffet setting because I like to eat a little of this and a little of that when it comes to that kind of food.  But I think I could get used to eating at Sankalp because I like the fresh cooked aspect as well.  I just wish it wasn&#39;t so far from my work."

I don&#39;t remember the names of nearly anything we got, but it was all delicious. The 10 of us didn&#39;t have much experience with Indian cuisine, and much less when it came to Southern Indian, so we were at the mercy of the staff&#39;s recommendation.

I do remember the Cheesy Idli. It was fried, and almost like cheese-fries. Definitely tasty. I got the Mango Lassi for my drink, and that too was quite delicious. It&#39;s a bit thick and almost desserty.

I brought my own birthday cake for dessert, and with that we had the Indian Coffee. It was very rich and exquisite. I am a big coffee person, and this variant was quite delicious.

The service was prompt, but at times it took a couple gestures to get our servers attention (note: the place was packed, and there were people waiting 45-minutes to get a table). As I mentioned before, we got a lot of staff recommendations for the dishes we ordered, and each and every item was a *thumbs up.*

One of the criteria I use to judge an ethnic restaurant is the patrons. Almost every other table in the place were Indian, and those people waiting 45-minutes? Indian too. There was one guy sitting at the booth barefoot, sitting cross legged... That was kind of weird.

They do take the restaurant.com gift certificates, and we did use one. It make an already great meal even better.

Other Stuff:
- Bathroom: clean
- Decor: simple
- Space: a bit small
- Price: very reasonable.

Ambience I rate it poor, there is big need to improve the ambience to attract more people. Lets be honest I am not going to take any guests to this place simply because it fails the look. 
Food - I would give it an average rating. Yes they have some good variety but going for the unlimited dosa night it failed to impress me. The portions are so huge you cannot have more than one dosa. I wish they make the portions small inorder to qualify for unlimited dosa. Appetizers for dosa night rate this as poor. I mean Maggie and corn manchurian with dosa. The Maggie had some indian tadka and spices making it non attractive.
Dosas were good but chutney and sambhar not impressive. 
Service- poor! How many times do I need to ask for chutney and water?!?!

He also had the horchata and enjoyed it. Another friend had &#34;sangria&#34; in a small bottle. He said it was too sweet and watery. I don&#39;t remember what dinner he ordered but he liked it.

But it is great option as a carry out service. The waitress/owner is a little weird. This is her first time having a formal restaurant, and so her Customer Service is a bit questionable. They sell coffee but their coffee maker is always &#34;down&#34; so she brings out hot water, and prepackaged instant coffee for you to prepare. You are paying what? $2-$3 for this coffee and you still have to prepare it. No thanks! 

Like i said, I come here for their food because it is good, but only for carry-out. They are close, and affordable. They have good take out broiled chicken. Bring your own McDonalds Coffee if you want to drink some. Their is terrible."

Antonio Ristorante makes some great food. My family comes here quite often - and raves about it to me over the phone - so I made a point to do dinner here while I was in town.

We used to frequent this location years ago when it was still owned by Sergio, and whoever took it over is putting it to good use. The food was phenomenal from start to finish.

A basket of fresh bread plopped down shortly after us, and it had some nice Italian bread and delicious focaccia; that focaccia in olive oil -- YUM.

For drinks, we had a lemondrop martini, Chianti, and gin. Entrees were the Pizza Hawaii, Tilapia Ai Carciofi, and a special: Rolled Flank Steak. AWESOME food.

I feel confident leaving 5 stars knowing my family has dined here many times and never been disappointed, with the exception of one time (they were short-staffed and the meal took 3 hours end-to-end). To put it into perspective, that&#39;s roughly 1/30 visits. It would be bad if that was someone&#39;s first time there (because it would probably be their last), but it looks like it was just a fluke.

I would love to airlift Antonio&#39;s to my new home. I&#39;ll definitely be paying them a visit when I&#39;m back in town!"

It was a beautiful night to sit outside and Frank and Dave were setting up to play. That is when things started going downhill. The busboy brought us bread. Waited half hour to no avail, asked for a waiter, after about 40 minutes, a waiter took our order, brought our drinks out relatively quickly. Our appetizers took about 30 minutes which was then followed by about an hour wait for dinner. The food was subpar, fried calamari undercooked and a very small portion for $15. The Chicken Milanese was bland and served with romaine lettuce not arugula. When we ordered a second bottle of wine , they were out of the original brand so the waiter brought us a different pinio at the same price. Of course we were overcharged .
When I told the hostess about the discrepancy, she said &#34;what you want, free food ?&#34; No, just merely pointing out another mistake, one of many that happened throughout our evening, not enough silverware, wrong soup, check amount.....On and on. The tables around us were all complaining as well. Other then the ambiance and outdoor patio, thus 2 stars, I would never recommend this place. Customer service and management is nonexistent, food was subpar, overpriced for what you get."

The staff were attentive and pleasant and the menu had a bit of everything. We started with a calamari appetizer that was delicious and the dipping sauce was noticeably light and tasty. The kids ordered wood fired pizza and ravioli, both are big portions as well as the linguini del mare which had an abundance of seafood on a white wine sauce.

The lights were turned low setting a great ambiance. The menu was great. All classic Italian dishes with some very enticing, authentic to this place, items as well. I ordered the Calamari Alla Griglia, which is marinated grilled calamari and grilled vegetables. The calamari was tender and very flavorful. I tried the Spaghetti Puttanesca as my entree. I requested it be made a little spicy, which the chef did perfectly. I have been all over Italy as well as the U.S. and this place it top notch. I&#39;ll be eating there again tonight!

Went here for my boyfriend&#39;s work holiday dinner. I would say this place is 2.5 stars. 
Service was ok, again i understand it being busy but when you come in with larger party that you booked in advance you&#39;d think they&#39;d make sure there was enough help. Meal started a bit annoyingly as I waited for my white wine quite awhile after everyone else at the table had the red wine that was on the table poured for them. Then I proceeded to wait while everyone else had their drinks brought to them. Even the pop &amp; iced tea. 

Appetizers were a burnt and too chewy octopus and oysters rockafellars which were pretty tasty but again nothing to write home about. Minestrone soup was your standard non-homemade (or at least tastes like it) variety. 
My entree sounded much yummier the way it was described on the specials menu. Peas were mentioned yet I didn&#39;t see them. All there was was a ribeye (over-cooked) and literally 4 thin potato wedges surrounding the steak on all 4 sides. Not very fulfilling as a protein. Wish that was better explained by the server or on the menu. Dessert was a sampler platter with pana cotta, tiramisu, teeny tiny cannoli and cheesecake.

Again nothing special.  Not sure there anything unique or wonderful enough to make me come back again."

My wife and I ordered pasta.  I ordered Penne Bolognese.  This is my typical &#34;acid test&#34; when trying an Italian restaurant for the first time.  The sauce was excellent with nice pieces of ground sirloin and a delicious savory and somewhat smokey flavor.  This is not a just thrown together sauce.  It&#39;s obvious that they simmer this sauce for hours.  If you are a fan of Bolognese you would do well to give this a try.

My wife ordered bowtie pasta with salmon in a vodka sauce.  She enjoyed this as well although I think I had the &#34;winner&#34; of the two dishes.  Portions are ample and we both had enough for small meals to take home.

They offer dozens of wines and an extensive selection of Italian wines which is nice to see for a change of pace.  They are reasonably priced at $6 to $10 a glass but you have many more options if you order by the bottle.

This could have been a 4-star review except for a  couple of items.  The only areas that were just adequate was the salad that only comes with their house oil &amp; vinegar dressing.  (If there were other options, our server didn&#39;t mention them.)  I found it just average.  Our young female server was pleasant but didn&#39;t tell us that there were was a soup option other then Minestrone (Scarole).  She didn&#39;t explain any of the specials either as the male server did to an adjacent table.  Not a big deal but the place only had 4 tables occupied and she could have spent a little more time explaining the dining options.  Again, not a big deal and it certainly won&#39;t prevent us from coming back. 

Finally, although both of our dishes were very good, prices for pasta dishes are just a bit on the high side.  There are 3 other Italian restaurants within a 15 minute drive that we frequent and Antonio&#39;s seems to be at the high end.

As I mentioned, this is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Very good pasta preparations and an interesting wine list are highlights.  I&#39;ll be back to try one of their wood-fired pizzas."

The pizza was all right; nothing stood out or disappointed me as far as taste goes. The pasta, on the other hand, was interesting. I&#39;ve had black pasta before, but this was literally a TON of black squid ink dumped on linguine and its accompanying seafood. In fact, it was so astonishingly black, my first thought was, &#34;This is the most metal meal I have ever seen in my life,&#34; (then again, our waiter seemed pretty hardcore himself with his skull tie clip, but I digress). Anyway, the sauce was loaded with salt, which is a shame since the pasta was cooked well and the seafood was good.

The wine list was pretty extensive but I would have appreciated more options by the glass. The wood fired pizza list was inviting and I will definitely need to check it out the next time we come.

While the food was great and the place was adorable, one weird thing happened that knocked my review down,
I ordered a pizza and after a while, they brought out a pizza. It looked like the pizza I ordered, so they gave it to us and left. I picked up a slice and cut off a piece for my coworker to try. At this point, the server reappeared and it turned out that that wasn&#39;t the pizza I had ordered, it was brought to the wrong table. That&#39;s fine, it happened. But he had my pizza with him, and when I asked to have the pizza I ordered rather than the one they brought us by mistake, seeing as I had ordered it the way I wanted it and all, they said no, because I had taken the first slice I had &#34;already started it&#34; and couldn&#39;t have the pizza I ordered instead. So customer service here is apparently &#34;If you trust us to get your order right, you don&#39;t get your food if we screw up.&#34; Now the pizza was still good, and it wasn&#39;t THAT different than what I had actually ordered, but that is still a really bad way to treat your customers, I think. We hadn&#39;t even taken a bit of the first piece, and I wasn&#39;t asking to keep BOTH, I just wanted the one I ordered. They apologized, which was nice, but that didn&#39;t change the fact that I still wasn&#39;t allowed to have what I ordered.

In the end, we&#39;ll probably go back, but it will not be soon, and I will definitely be double checking our orders before they&#39;re touched."

Delicious food, friendly staff, and good ambience. My only complaint is that they say everyone right next to each other instead of spacing people out. Otherwise this is a very good local Italian place and I would come here again."

Walking in i love the ambiance. It&#39;s warm and inviting. The lights were dim which i completely appreciate. I hate bright over head lighting or spot lights on your table that to many places have. Here, The warm glow is relaxing. Food was good. My hubby had the sea bass Mediterranean style. Lots of bones happening though so caution to those who aren&#39;t familiar with being served a full fish. Having The fish prepped in front of you is nice. I had the halibut with the veggies and pesto. Loooved it. Only 2 bones in mine. I&#39;d go back and reorder halibut with the minestrone soup though. It was delicious. Warmed me from my Chicago sub zero chill! I ate so much i didn&#39;t have room for dessert but next time for sure I&#39;ll be sampling it.
I think this would be a fun place to go as a group to. Birthday or just getting the family together for a nice dinner. 
Tried the pizza before from here too. It was really good. Even my kids and their friends loved it. Can&#39;t go wrong with it. Actually, I&#39;m so lazy i don&#39;t want to go to the grocery store today, i might just order pizza for pick up for dinner tonight haha ;)"

Simply put, Antonio&#39;s does almost everything right!  Warm greeting at the front door, service is super accomodating and very polite.  But let&#39;s talk about the food.  They are REALLY generous portions.  If you leave hungry, that&#39;s your own fault.  We were just there tonight and I had the Beef Carpaccio and it was delicious... but remember when I said they do almost everything right, my only complaint is that that dish in particular is a touch expensive, but hey, you pay for what you get and it&#39;s wonderful!  Nice wine selection, nothing that will blow you away, but it&#39;s all wine that is meant to drink with food.  We drive from Winfield to eat here and will continue to do so.  It&#39;s a wonderful alternative for people who want real, fresh Italian food!  Maggiano&#39;s is junk, Olive Garden is crap.  It&#39;s either here, Francesca&#39;s, the city on Taylor street, or Italy for authentic Italian food.  The restaurant is spotless as well!  Go and have a great time!  I&#39;m 34 and would bring a date there or go with family, as it&#39;s perfect for all occasions.  Hats off to you guys over there and thank you for having us as your guests!  So far we have been waited on by Blake (tonight), a younger looking bald guy (I&#39;m bald too, no disrespect) who has a very commanding presence in the dining room ...think Vin Diesel in a restaurant, and a younger woman.  They all do a great job!  See you again soon!"

For a Monday evening, the place was quite busy. Unfortunately, we did not get our server&#39;s name.  We dined last night, and she was absolutely great.  Attentive, but not bothersome.  She recommended the braciole and it was fork tender. And, I am fussy when it comes to soup.  It has to be steaming hot.  The minestrone was just that.  Pasta is al dente, so it&#39;s a bit &#34;firm&#34; rather than mushy.  My son&#39;s chicken dish was excellent.  So, all in all, a wonderful experience.

I&#39;ve been here a couple times now - both for work meetings - and have had great experiences! I had a sweet tooth the first time, so I ordered the apple bread french toast. This was delectably sweet! The perfect combo of diced apples, fresh baked apple bread, powdered sugar, a vanilla bean glaze, and pecans. Yummy!

On the savory side of things I&#39;ve had their steak skillet. Let me tell you, it doesn&#39;t get much hardier than that! This plate full of scrambled eggs, sliced tender steak, mushrooms, onions, and provolone cheese was ah-maze-ing. It also came with a side of toast. Needless to say, it looked like I barely ate anything when I was finished, but that&#39;s only because it&#39;s so filling! Made for great leftovers though.

Brunch Cafe is great for groups, because the staff is like a well oiled machine. Service is speedy and done with a smile. I will continue to keep this delicious spot in my brunch rotation!"

I had a bit of a hard time deciding what to get because of the plentiful options. Everything sounded delicious! But I decided on the berry berry crepe and it was freakin yummy! The crepe was soft and pillowy and the cream inside tasted wonderful. It was a huge portion too. My fiance got the apple french toast which was also very delicious. 

Our server was pleasant, attentive, and prompt. And we were very impressed by how quickly we got our food!! Even with me taking time drinking my coffee, I think we were only there for like half an hour.

Anyways, while my wife got the meat &amp; potatoes skillet, I decided to be a little experimental as usual &amp; try the sweet potatoe skillet, it just sounded good.

We were seated on time (which was nice) and proceeded to order coffee, however, there was no skim milk. This was a bit disappointing but not the end of the world. Decided to order stuffed waffles with a side of fries and signature french toast with sausages. The food was great and fruits were fresh. The service is what determined my rating of a 3/5. The waitress was nice, however forgot to ask if I was finished eating and proceeded to take my plate without my okay. I tend to be very protective of my food and did not take this lightly. Also, when my friend asked for a to-go box, the waitress placed to box right on the food instead of off to the side, which obviously dirtied the box. If the service had been significantly better, I would&#39;ve rated my experience a 4/5 however it wasn&#39;t. 

I would eat here again only because the food is fresh and tasty, however I would only do so in hopes of having better service."

They have a huge selection of things on their menus from pancakes to french toast to bennies to sandwiches and more! The more we looked at the menu, the more we kept changing our minds because everything sounded so good! 

We started off with the strawberry mimosas! (Mimosas for breakfast, why not?! It was 5&#39;o clock somewhere.) I&#39;ve had them in other flavors but not strawberry, I loved these.

I went in with my heart set on french Toast since I have been craving some good french toast for weeks now! I couldn&#39;t decide between which to get, but I ended up choosing the Stuffed French Toast which had fresh sliced strawberries, cream cheese stuffing, and topped with whipped cream. OMG! Let me tell you this one may be top 3 of the BEST french toast I&#39;ve ever had! I pretty much demolished the entire thing! Highly recommended. 

My cousin had the Florentine Bennie. I tried a bite and it was delish! She was highly satisfied with her choice as well.

As far as service, the waitress was nice and checked up onus frequently. And our food came out so fast, which was a plus since I was starving.

Had the carrot cake pancakes...BORING! No carrot cake flavor, a few chopped pecans on top with some shaved carrots. The cream cheese filling was very good, order it on the side.  The side of ham is very good.
My wife had a healthy scrambler, and asked to not include the turkey sausage. When delivered it looked like the turkey had been cooked into the eggs then removed, a grey mess with the fruit put on the hot plate on a Romaine leaf. Picture the presentation.
There is a place down in Bonita Springs, FL called First Watch that serves carrot cake pancakes that are 5 stars, worth the drive.

I was disappointed considering all the amazing review this places has, but I just wasn&#39;t that impressed. We usually stick to our local Bartlett favorite spot, but we were celebrating my sister&#39;s birthday and wanted to venture out. I had their eggsquiste sweet potato skillet and it was pretty tasty. It comes with sweet potato tots, ham, apples, gouda cheese and ham. You get to pick which way you have your eggs so I opted for scrambled egg whites. I was pleased with my selection. My son got the chocolate chip pancakes which was a lot of food for a kid menu item.

I guess the reason why i&#39;m only giving it 3 stars was because my husband kind of got ill right after we left... He got the south of the border and within moments of leaving he was just about sick to his stomach.... He was very vocal that he was NOT a fan... 

All in all, I probably wouldn&#39;t go back because I&#39;ve had better breakfast food, but the service here was outstanding. Our food came out super fast. Some advice - maybe get some flavored coffee creamer... I wasn&#39;t a fan of their coffee... I think it was burnt.."

Sundried tomatoes were used instead of fresh tomatoes. Also, way too much feta on omelette.  Absolutely no excuse for the poor service.  Extremely disappointed!   Will not be coming back!"

I went here after reading reviews. We went in on a friday morning and there wasnt any wait. We were greeted by our server and she brought us coffee right away. I must share that one of the cups she gave us was dirty, had orange lipstick on it, yuck! No big deal though, she brought a clean one right away. 
So we looked over the menu and there were so many yummy things on it. I decided on the stuffed waffle. It was delicious! It was topped with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries. The inside had a pink filling with fresh strawberries and bananas, it was delectable. I was very happy with my meal. It was nice to see that they serve mimosas and bloodies too. I wasnt in the mood for a drink but I will for sure go back and have brunch along with a bloody soon. Check them out, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Their portions are sometimes big enough for two people to share.

I wanted to update my review as my wife and I ordered this weekend. I ordered in a to go order and when I got home I realized my pancakes were missing that came with my skilket!

Richard walkers, Wildberry, Egg Harbor, etc..  This place wasn&#39;t horrible, but, wasn&#39;t great either.

Pros: Awesome service.  Nice large mimosa (twice size of Richard Walkers for same price).

Cons: I ordered eggs over easy.  Although the yolk was nice and runny, the egg whites were very overcooked.  They were dark brown and crunchy; cooked on too high of heat.  If you look through customer photos you will see how many of the eggs are burnt.  You would think a breakfast place would excell at eggs.  The breakfast potatoes were also sub par.

Overall, not a bad spot for breakfast but not a place I will be back to often."

Every time I have gone to Brunch Cafe I have never left disappointed. The loaded potato pancakes are a huge surprise, the mimosas are exactly what you want, and the coffee never ends. 

This has become one of my staple favorites and for very good reasons. If you&#39;re unhappy with anything kindly ask your server for new hash browns if they are cold, as I have done, or take a crew and share different dishes together to sample as much of the menu as possible. 

My recommendations are to go at least 2 hours before they close. If there is a wait, just be patient, you won&#39;t waste away by the time you get a table. Order a mimosa and coffee and if you&#39;re unsure of what you want that day ask a server. I&#39;ve never been guided poorly. Sit back, enjoy the company you&#39;re with, even if you&#39;re alone and just enjoy."

Their menu is huge with unique options. I went with the sweet potato skillet which was unlike anything I&#39;ve had before. The sweet potatoes were these mini dumplings at the bottom of a skillet with ham, apples and Gouda cheese! They top this one off with two eggs. Skillets are served with pancakes or toast, but the skillet was meal enough!

However, the reason they are not getting 5 stars is that they need to change up their menu and come up wth some new dishes.  Maybe they could add Greek pancakes, lentil soup, Greek lemon soup with orzo to their menu.  Pretty much the same menu since they opened.

Their famous potatoes  ( as they refer to them) are not famous in my eyes or taste buds. They appear to be frozen and are not cooked till crisp. I make these at home with fresh potatoes, onion, sweet red pepper and garlic, and trust me mine are not mushy like these.

Their Ruben is very good, and their home made potato chips. They have the best pancakes I have ever tasted. They are not doughy like most restaurants."

It was as rich and delicious as you would expect, without being overly sweet or filling. A cannoli crepe special included one thin vanilla crepe lightly stuffed with cannoli like cream and a few chocolate chips, topped with pistachios, your choice of eggs and bacon. It took me all of .6 seconds to decide on my meal. BOOM. Hubs enjoyed a massive breakfast burrito and the little one was more than happy grabbing handfuls of scrambled egg and diced potatoes.

While I didn&#39;t really get to see too much of the restaurant, I have to tell you why...

We waited for 20 minutes for brunch on a weekend (no surprise there), but once we ordered our food came out in less than 10 minutes. They really, really know how to turn tables here. And they don&#39;t turn &#39;em and burn &#39;em, they just get your food out quickly and with a friendly smile.

We went in on Thursday afternoon around 1:30pm. Place was pretty empty, not surprised because they close at 2:30pm, so I&#39;d guess normally people come to eat in early hours.

I ordered a simple two eggs with bacon and pancakes, served with potato bites. Bacon and eggs were rather cold, it felt like they were pre cooked already, could have got better from a hotel bfast buffet.  Friend&#39;s portella mushroom was nothing better, lots of cheese - which is unneccesary. Fruit was not fresh either, how difficult is it to serve nice and fresh fruit? 

Pancakes was ok in the whole meal. Rest are horrible.

Latte was ok too, but i wouldn&#39;t want to visit this place again. Too bad and I have no idea how it could get 4 stars rating...."

Thick cut bacon, not the crappy kind people use in fast food places. Fresh squeezed orange juice, lots of different kinds of tea to choose from.

Staff is always very friendly, food served pretty fast, place is nice and clean. Over all a great breakfast place."

This establishment is a professional regarding brunch time cuisine. It took us a good while to even make a decision as to what to eat because EVERYTHING looks so darn FABULOUS. Additionally, I found myself flipping through all 117 pictures posted on Yelp of the different entrees while we waited for our booth. The traditional choices were there... but with a fun flare and creative twist.

I finally narrowed things down to the Signature French Toast and the Flourentine Eggs Benedict... because they were so heavily raved about on Yelp. The waitress was super cool and asked if I was interested in playing some brunch roulette. I said, &#34;yes !&#34; The hubs ordered the brunch chicken and the FIL ordered the Reuben. 

A quick 15-20 minutes later  I covered my eyes and POOF a glorious plate of Signature French Toast with strawberries, kiwi, and vanilla infused icing was placed in front of me, ready to be devoured.

Not a bite was spared. 

This place is PERFECT for brunches, delicious food, a family meal, and an opportunity for a good time with great food.  Cannot wait to go back!"

It was not amazing, It definitely was not something I would go out of my way for.   I would have liked the chicken to have some flavor to it and a different cheese, it tasted like cottage cheese on the salad it was very weird.  I have been to this restaurant a few times and everything else was awesome, I will absolutely go back but not for this same salad."

Had I known what I was missing I might not have let it sit idly pending, but the past is the past. I loved it. 

In previous years, I&#39;ve had a personal Quest for the Best challenge, and one of the criteria was Best Eggs Benedict. I mention this, because the BC was the catalyst to resurrect that challenge...however it&#39;s going to be extremely difficult to find a contender to compete the Brunch Cafe&#39;s solid, top spot on the list. The decor is modern, and cozy; It&#39;s got the charming bustle of a diner; and the menu is impressive. Tea drinkers should be pleased with their &#39;tea board&#39; which offers small samples of the blends they offer, so you can interact with the tea before making a blind selection based on the name (it&#39;s a nice touch). I guess the Scrambler plates leave something to be desired, but one cannot help get food envy when a scrambler is delivered side by side with the eggs benedict. 

Needless to say, I&#39;m a fan. I&#39;ve recommended Brunch Cafe to friends and family (and a stranger once which was a little awkward, but oh well) so I&#39;ll certainly be back for more. Honestly though, it&#39;ll be very tough to try something new knowing what I know about the eggs benedict.

[Side note: How many times can I fit &#39;eggs benedict&#39; into a Yelp review? The answer is apparently 4]"

No wait, no crowds. Read great reviews here and wanted to check this place out.  First off, our waitress was very friendly and helpful in answering our questions about what was &#39;popular&#39; and her recommendations.  Service was outstanding also.  Came with 2 friends who ordered the caliente omelet (this was enormous and looked like what an omelet should look like, big and fluffy ). She said it was delicious!  My other friend and I both had the south beach scrambler.  We tried a side of biscuits and gravy, biscuits were very tender and fresh, sausage gravy was tasty and not greasy or heavy.  I enjoyed these!  South beach scrambler has spinach, bacon and avocado with melted montery jack cheese.  This was good, but I assumed the avocado was on the side and not in the scrambler (bad assumption).  I love spinach, and like avocado, but the avocado was a little too overwhelming for me as there was a lot of it in the scrambler, lots of spinach too, but that didn&#39;t bother me.  Avocado can be a bit heavy so I would have preferred less and couldn&#39;t even finish half of my order.  Brunch potatoes were pretty simple and could have been served warmer.  We tried a side of buttermilk pancakes also and these were pretty good!  Everyone commented that they tasted something sweet in the batter...not sure what it is, I&#39;ll have to ask the waitress next time.  They were decent though. Kindof of creamy, but fluffy...these were different.
Next time I would try the omelet or eggs benedict, lots of menu options..  I will be back though.  Our food was served in less than 10 minutes!!  No lie!!  Super fast, attentive service.  Kudos to our waitress, she checked on us constantly!!  Very impressed."

I went to another location, not realizing it was related to this location, and fell in love. When my family came into town, I wanted to try this location again. It did not disappoint!

There was a bit of a wait (they will announce your party over the loudspeaker, but it&#39;s hard to hear inside - you can wait outside and hear it better). There aren&#39;t many places to sit and wait (it&#39;s a pretty small place). Luckily it didn&#39;t take too long and we were seated at a booth within 20 minutes.

The service was great, the atmosphere is cozy and clean, and the menu is my favorite part! So many things to choose from, and many of the items are unique that I have not seen at many other places. We ordered the California crepes, lemon poppy seed crepes, and the Mediterranean omelette (I&#39;m still regretting not getting the stuffed potato pancakes).

The customer service is just subpar. When you&#39;re there for pick up they do not provide you with any extra sauce packets it&#39;s like it&#39;s an expensive additional cost to them.

Not only did they not put any extra in the order, it probably had less than it normally would have had I not said anything. 

Their sweet and sour chicken is truly gross, with mostly dark chicken pieces with a ton of sauce that thoroughly overwhelms the dish. Overall, I&#39;d visit Ye&#39;s Chinese any day over Mr. Wok, a short distance to the west, and continue ordering Chinese food that generally never disappoints."

I had remembered someone talking about this place before, so we decided to try them out, AND they deliver to our house - score!

The Egg Drop Soup and Hot and Sour Soup were awesome. I normally hate hot and sour soup, but there&#39;s something about babybaking that makes me just love the hell out of it. My daughter loved the egg drop soup and scarfed it.

I was really surprised when we ordered the Chicken and Mixed vegetables and the sauce actually tasted like something. That&#39;s how I knew we had ordered from the place right by us for too long. Sauces are actually supposed to TASTE like things, craziness! 

The man got mongolian beef and he dug it, said it reheated well the next day too when he brought it for lunch. I was all about the Chicken Fried Rice and Crab Rangoon. The insides are cream cheesy, but they taste good, and the outside is golden, crispy, and goood.


This place had better food than the place right by our house, and the prices were much better. We&#39;ll definitely be ordering from here again. I&#39;m sure i&#39;ll be craving the hot and sour soup soon enough.

Delivery was nice and speedy, too. Which is good, because I get ravenous and grumpy. You do not want to see a ravenous, angry pregnant irish woman. You just don&#39;t, man."

When you first get there it looks extremely small but once inside its spacious and looks like a very upbeat and cool place to eat at. The menús are on some computer screens so those are easy to read but It took the lady at the counter like 15 minutes to take our order even tho we were the only ones in there. Also a weird and kind of annoying thing was that she wouldn&#39;t let us order one drink to share. We sat down and waited for our food which didn&#39;t take a long time to be brought to us. We ordered the small spicy orange chicken to share for $6.50 ish. Which we were glad we did because it was so much food. Their white rice is very good but the orange chicken was a bit too saucy for my taste. Besides that it was an excellent experience.

I wanted to see if Mr. Wok fit the bill.

The place is clean and relatively new. I scanned the menu for something a little out of the ordinary, and found it in the Panang Curry with Chicken. With an egg roll I spent $6.75, tax included, which is a bargain.

I sat down, and not 2 minutes later, the meal comes out. As can be expected, $6.75 buys you an enormous amount of food - I have more than enough for leftovers tomorrow. Fried rice is standard with the lunch special, which I also appreciated.

The curry was simple but hot... certainly not complex but I&#39;m not complaining either. The veg was tender. The chicken was... uhh... ephemeral. I shouldn&#39;t be able to use that word for chicken, but... it had little flavor and absolutely no bite. I think next time I&#39;ll try the beef, and hopefully in the future the restaurant can use fresh chicken, sauteed properly.

On the brighter side of things the eggroll was very crisp and went well with their sweet and sour sauce.

No fortune cookie served with the food or on the way out, which was a bummer. Overall though I&#39;d come back to Mr. Wok."

Its basically a tiny notch above panda express. The biggest plus about this place is the speed in which they churn out the food. My orders usually take about 4-6 minutes to be ready. That is pretty damn impressive even for chinese take out. Quality is a mixed bag some things are good, some aren&#39;t. 

So far I had the: 

Fried Potstickers (Around 5 bucks): these things are awful and I&#39;m pretty sure they are frozen store bought. 

Small Szechuan Beef($7.00): It tastes like a spicy sweet and sour beef. They should rename it Szechuan vegetables with Beef because its mostly vegetables. 

Beef Chow fun($10.00): Not too bad, but still needs more meat. 

Considering the time it takes to finish an order. I would definitely put this in the fast food category so compared to KFC or McDonalds or BK, this place is pretty darn good. 

Also the atmosphere has a chain restaurant feel. They clearly hired some marketing people to decorate and design the interior. Its a nice touch."

The girl at the front desk was rude and very unpleasant with myself and the guy that came in behind me. Regardless to language barriers that exist in our world, friendly customer service goes a long way. As I waited she called someone who had placed a big order that she was bagging, and suddenly she yells at them saying that if they were going to cancel the order they should have called and she slammed the receiver down. They probably cancelled the order because they found a better spot with better food and better service! No wonder the place is always empty. First visit was over a year ago, this second visit is DEFINATELY my last."

When you step inside there&#39;s a few tables to sit and eat at, a large menu board directly above the counter, and a soda fountain.

In visiting Mr. Wok I decided to try a few different items. General Tso&#39;s chicken, pot stickers, crab rangoon and the fried rice that came with the chicken. My overall opinion is that the food is average. The general tso&#39;s chicken wasn&#39;t very spicy and was more sweet. It had a good flavor and I&#39;d eat it again. The fried rice with the chicken was pretty good though a bit cold. The crab rangoons were mostly cream cheese and weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but were decent. The pot stickers were a bit of a disappointment as they seemed a bit over cooked to where the outside had a harder more rubbery texture than most places.

Overall my food was decent and I would go back since it&#39;s near my office. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to visit, but I give it a recommendation if you&#39;re in the area and looking for Chinese take out."

I stopped there because the reviews said it was very fast! I ordered the panang curry because the reviews said it was excellent .  Well, i have been back for it 2 more times in a week and a half! Its the best ive ever had.  Its spicy but i ordered it extra spicy and WOW! I did try the General Tso chicken also.  It was good. Id give it a 3 1/2 star.

On one hand the service is friendly and quick, and they give you a lot of food for what you pay (lunch specials available even on a Sunday, which is when hubby and I ordered take-out). On the other hand, the white rice is bland (would prefer jasmine), the egg rolls are dry, and my Kung Pao chicken had a fishy flavor to it (too much oyster sauce???).

I&#39;ve been in search for a place close by and stopped in during Sunday for lunch and they had a great priced lunch special.

My husband loved their pork egg fu yung and I enjoyed the kung pao chicken, along with the eggroll + fried rice that came with! Great serving sizes, enough to take home, super fast (literally like 5minute wait after placing an order). And with them using fresh ingredients (no msg ever!), we felt not as guilty eating here.

We have gone back twice already and had delivery for dinner during one of the Hawks finals and no complaints on any items.  Their noodles were great, as was the BBQ pork, plenty of meat and shrimp in their dishes.  Well worth the money for decent Chinese food in the suburbs!"

We picked it up on our way home. Sesame chicken was delicious.  My most recent experience with Mr. Wok will definitely be my last! Despite how good the food is the staff and service was horrible. Taking into consideration cultural differences and all still doesn&#39;t call for treating customers poorly. When I called in a delivery order I asked for a small order of an entrée from the menu. I was told that it only came in large.  I told them that I wanted it in small. The menu says it comes in two sizes. I was told that the menu was wrong and that small wasn&#39;t an option.  After going back and forth about honoring what the menu says, they refused to do so. I know this may not be a big deal to most but if I was kindly told something along the lines of &#34;we&#39;re sorry that we haven&#39;t been able to update the menu so as a courtesy we&#39;ll honor the price but going forward please know that the menu is wrong...&#34; bla bla bla.

Food:
Good food for the price. Lunch Specials are about $6.25 and has enough to make you save leftovers. Some dishes really shine for the price, but you gotta take the time to find them. The Panang Curry Chicken, Pepper Steak, and Honey Chicken are some that I discovered. The Crab Rangoons are da bomb! A much better alternative to Panda Express, but won&#39;t beat Chinatown standards.

Service:
Fast and Friendly. Enough said. If you show up when it&#39;s not busy, you can sometimes get your food made in 3 minutes!  

Atmosphere:
Always clean. Nice color coordination. Easy on the eyes.

Pro Tip: Don&#39;t get the MSG Fried Rice that comes with every lunch special. Ask for White Rice. Your body will Thank You!

There was some meat in the dish, but the egg roll was vegetarian. I would go back if I were starving and nothing else was open. I did want to add some siriachi sauce but they didn&#39;t have any.

I ordered the 2 meat platter consisting of Pulled Pork and Burnt Ends. The entree includes 2 sides and cornbread. My sides were coleslaw and baked beans. The Burnt Ends were excellent, tender and moist. The Pulled Pork was also very tasty. No additional sauce was required. However I did add sauce to the baked beans to kick them up a  bit. The coleslaw was creamy with the right balance of sweet and tart. 

I would definitely return to try the BBQ Ribs and Brisket."

There are too many restaurants out there happy to serve new business- this place apparently doesn&#39;t need new customers.

So, after a long weekend of doing home renovations we decided on bbq. I suggested this place and since it was about a twenty min drive, we decided not to call for takeout but wash up and go dine-in. 

When we arrived it was 7:45pm (just fifteen minutes until the posted close time on the door.) The hostess said it was too late to eat here but we could order takeout. Then she briskly led us through the large restaurant to the back where we were supposed to order takeout.

In my whole life, this has never happened to me. We were tired from working all day, so we placed our order for takeout and sat on a little bench in front of the serving line. A woman behind the register identified herself as the owner&#39;s sister-in -law.

She was personable yet complained to us that a party of 15 just arrived before us with no reservations (the restaurant  was about 3/4 empty.) I explained that yes my husband &amp; I also just arrived too but we were escorted back to her at take out ( I was thinking perhaps maybe she would seat us and apologize for being told we were too late But no. That didn&#39;t happen.)

While we waited for our dinner, I saw two plates that were sent back to the kitchen because we were literally sitting next to the food pass. When our food was ready, we left without fanfare. 

When we arrived home my baked potato was cold and my baby back ribs were warm. I nuked the potato for 3 mins. My baked potato was not fully cooked in the middle. My ribs tasted alright but they were so tough they had to be cut off the bone with a knife. My husband liked the brisket, but we were still mystified at being turned away for seating while there were clearly people (including the party of 15 ) that had just been seated. The cornbread &amp; coleslaw was good, but it&#39;s doubtful we will return."

I had the platter. The Brisket was disappointing. It seemed dry. Slattered it with bbq to make it taste better. Bq chicken was a little better and more moist with smoke flavor. Still wasn&#39;t blown away. I enjoyed the Mac and cheese. It was creamy with out being over powered with salt.

I just felt like she wasn&#39;t as quick and efficient as I would expect from a waitress on a busy Friday night. Maybe it&#39;s just me.

Food was ok. I got the pulled pork plate with baked beans. It also came with cornbread and coleslaw. Nothing on that plate was really phenomenal. The pulled pork was good, seasoned well &amp; not dry. The flavors just didn&#39;t jump out at me. Same with the baked beans. The cornbread was pretty good in my opinion. The coleslaw was nasty. To be fair though, I generally don&#39;t like coleslaw so it takes some phenomenal coleslaw to please me.

I got a banana Pudding to go. They put it in this tight little 4oz container. I wasn&#39;t pleased with the size of it with it costing $5. I can go to like pappadeaux and get a jar full for the same price. Overall, my meal was ok. Nothing to brag about but not terribly horrible."

My three sides were, Mac&amp;cheese, baked beans  and Cole slaw. I arrived around 7pm to this location. 

The cole slaw was good (creamy), the baked beans were good and the Mac &amp; Cheese needed salt. The brisket had absolutely zero flavor, it was moist but with zero flavor. The rib tips were 95% cartledge and the spicy sausage was alright. I had an ice tea for my drink. The three meat plater was $18.99 and I substituted the corn bread for a different item, which was an additional 0.49 cents.

My server / service was almost invisible, I was checked on only once and by that time, I was almost done eating what little I did eat. I stated to her (my server) that the brisket had no flavor at all. She offered to replace it with another meat.

The food can be awesome on one visit and so-so the next.  Ditto the service.  Whether the restaurant is busy or not doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference.

Our most recent visit was on a Sunday evening.  There were few other customers present, which does not explain the less-than-attentive service we experienced.  Our St. Louis ribs, which we enjoyed on a previous visit, were warmed-over, ends as hard as tree bark.  We had to glop on extra BBQ sauce to compensate for the dry, overcooked meat.

About 10 minutes into the meal, our server finally came over to ask how everything was.  We told her in no uncertain terms.  She replied, &#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; and walked away (if you&#39;re not going to fix the problem, then why bother to ask?).

So the next day, I sent a polite email to the restaurant using the link on the &#34;Contact Us&#34; webpage.  The email promptly bounced.  Plan B: I filled out the &#34;Contact Us&#34; form on the same page and then clicked &#34;Send Message.&#34;  That was several weeks ago and I received no response.

We had the pulled pork platter and Texas brisket platter. Each included coleslaw, cornbread, and one side. The pulled pork platter was on point. The meat was tender and had a delicious bbq sauce that was too overpowering. As far as the brisket, I so not recommend this dish. It had very little flavor and looked almost as if it was cooked in the microwave. I had the Mac and cheese for a side, but they were bland.

Now onto the service. My order was takeout and the man taking my order lacked interpersonal skills and customer service. He definitely lacked in customer service skills and was not friendly. But I like to give people the benefit of the doubt so maybe he was having a bad day. Also when I went to pick up my order, the staff sounded confused and were not sure of which order belonged to me.

Putting aside the service, the food was decent and I would return to try some of their other entrees."

I&#39;m not sure if my taste for barbecue has changed since some world-class barbecue restaurants opened in and around Chicago, but I was not as impressed as I&#39;ve been in the past.

Started off with a Bloody Mary - they had a special that day, Bloody Mary&#39;s for $2. They use their barbecue sauce in their mix and the taste is pronounced. It adds a sweetness I&#39;m not used to in this drink. I can&#39;t say I really liked it, and I think I know why it was only $2 - very little vodka and no condiments.

The meal - I had their brisket meal with red beans and rice. The beans and rice was very good. The brisket was dry and flavorless unfortunately. Service sometimes can make up for a meal, but no so much here. I can&#39;t say it was bad, but it wasn&#39;t good either.

I was disappointed in this one. Too bad. I like barbecue and this is still the closest one to our home."

My husband is from Kansas City so he&#39;s tough to please when it comes to barbeque. Prior to trying Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s last year he hadn&#39;t had barbeque in the Chicago area that he really liked. Yet we love this place! We were told that they smoke all of their meats, and that would be the difference. We use the sauce at home...it&#39;s sweet but tangy and goes well with any barbequed, grilled, or smoked meat.

This time we had the jumbo wing appetizer (free, thanks to the Yelp check in) the gumbo, which had just the right amount of kick, the 3-meat platter and brisket platter; each with cole slaw, corn bread, and choice of side. The ribs were delicious, as was the pulled pork and burnt ends, and the beef brisket was the most tender I&#39;ve ever had. I like &#34;Smoque&#34; in the city, but this place is still better!!

After all of this, we were too full for dessert. Service was great too. Definitely worth the trip to Elk Grove Village. Five stars!!"

I got the 2 meat player with baby back ribs and brisket. I agree with one of the reviewers where I would probably give this a 3.5, but I&#39;m rounding up based on the positive service experience.

Ribs were good
brisket was ok
Cornbread was tasty
Coleslaw was meh

Service was great. I see some negative reviews about the service and I&#39;m sure if varies from each experience, but my server was friendly, attentive, and fast. I plan to come back and try something different from the brisket."

We use their BBQ sauce all the time at home and expected more from this place.  We tried five meats - brisket, burnt ends, smoked turkey, smoked wings and ribs.  The ribs were dry.  The rest of them were moist but not much smokey flavor, only doused with sauce. The wings were supposedly fried but were not crispy.  Also, one of the wings had feather still on it - gross!! The brisket was the best out of all the meats.

At the end of the day, we can make almost all at home in the smoker and it tastes at least as good if not better. Disappointed.  We tried because of a groupon but won&#39;t be back."

First time check in got a free appetizer (pulled pork nachos) which was excellent. The Babyback Ribs were very good. The portions are very large. We ordered two meals for three people and brought home 1/2 of what we had brought to the table.  This is not as good as some of the BBQ places I have visited in St. Louis but far better than Famous Dave&#39;s.

Our sides were sweet potato fries (they were like dessert), mashed potatoes (our son loves those), mac and cheese, and coleslaw (my wife&#39;s favorite). When we reheated the ribs they were not as awesome bu they were still good. Their mac and cheese is the BOMB and I would order it every time."

The &#34;manager&#34; Mike Vodin, set the tone for anything named Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s in the future.  

My wife purchased a groupon for this restaurant.  We went this past Friday night. (4-15-16).  When we arrived, there was a couple sitting at the bar that we knew.  They were going to sit at the bar and eat.  I suggested all of us sit at a high top in the bar so we could talk easier.  They paid their bill at the bar and moved to our table.  When the waitress came over, my wife told her that we had a groupon.  The other couple said that they had one too.  The waitress told us that we could only use one groupon per table.  We explained that the other couple was from the bar and they were going to use their groupon and we were here separately going to use ours.  She said she was not allowed to do that.  We asked to see the manager.  A few minutes later the &#34;manager&#34; came to our table.  We explained our story and was told in a &#34;dees dems does&#34; wanna be attitude, &#34;we got rules here&#34;, &#34;I can&#39;t let you do that, I&#39;d have to let everyone else do it&#34;.  All of a sudden I was back in first grade.  This manger also stated that these groupons make us lose money.  Customers take advantage of us.  I looked around and noticed that the place was pretty empty for a Friday night that the Blackhawks were playing in the playoffs on tv.  I remember thinking that the place should of been packed.   But, we all stayed together and had dinner.  

The food part of this review is ok, but nothing to write home about.  The presentation and taste was good. The portions were good sized.  At least they have a good cook.  It&#39;s just that the management staff is horrible.  Getting into a conversation with a customer about the restaurant loosing money is unacceptable in ANY situation.  They seemed to be displeased about us even using one groupon.  Complaining that they weren&#39;t making as much money with &#34;these groupons&#34;.  I&#39;m not a big groupon or coupon guy.  But one thing I do know is that coupons or groupons are supposed to get you in the door.  It&#39;s up to the restaurant to make you want to come back.  This &#34;manager&#39; set the tone for the dinner, even though the waitress and food were ok.  We&#39;ll think long and hard about EVER getting involved with anything named Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s.  It&#39;s really too bad.  The building is beautiful, this food was good, the drinks were good.  Manager Mike, told us that the General Manager (Richard Jurczak) makes the rules.  So, I&#39;m not sure, but maybe the problem here starts at the very top. The management is running this restaurant into the ground, with the attitude that the customers take advantage of us.  The CUSTOMERS ARE EVERYTHING TO YOU!!  EVERYTHING.  THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.  I hope the owners or franchisees or whatever, figure this out quick.  The management in this restaurant is poison."

 The nachos we&#39;re the best I ever had. The meat was heavy you got more than u can bargain for. You really need four at the table. I recommend adding the brisket. And some BBQ sauce. I have never been filled and more satisfied with a BBQ joint. The quality control and level of commitment to there product and brand gives them a 4 out of 5 in my book."

The ribs were so hard and kind of cold that I even left a few bones there and just decided to eat my cornbread instead! The restaurant was very crowded that day so not sure if that was the reason but I was definitely not happy with the ribs. The pulled pork was ok but for a place that is known for their ribs I would expect them to always be stellar! 

The service was also not good that day. Our waitress would go MIA for long periods of time to the point that I had to flag another waitress to send us our waitress since we needed a soda refill!! Hopefully this was just an off scenario since the previous time I remember the ribs were a whole lot better.

Having read many of the other reviews, I tried my best to go in without any preconceptions. I should state that where we live near Bartlett, there are three excellent barbecue places to go to. That said, we like the barbecue sauce, so we figured the food should be OK. First, the brisket. As other people have stated, it was very dry. The only parts of the brisket that tasted great were those that had been well saturated in barbecue sauce. The one piece that had no barbecue sauce on it was dry and virtually tasteless. The chicken was excellent, and by the chicken, I mean the barbecued chicken that came with the three meat platter. The St. Louis ribs were very tasty, mostly because of the aforementioned barbecue sauce. It seems to me that they boil the ribs before they bake them, which some places do in order to make them fall off the bone tender. That said, the ribs were not terribly fatty, they were meaty, and well worth the ordering. The sides weren&#39;t terribly remarkable, and were much the same as you&#39;d get it any other barbecue joint. We went early on a Friday evening, and the place was only about half full. I mention that because the service was a bit on the slow side. It was alright as we were not in any great rush. Would we go back again? Not really. They didn&#39;t prove to be any great competition to the aforementioned three great places that are near our home. As others have said, the food wasn&#39;t terrible, but it wasn&#39;t great either."

And I&#39;d be in town to check it out. Overall it was a very nice experience. Food was great, waitress was attentive, and prices were decent.

I was in town on a business trip by myself and looking for a late night restaurant. They&#39;re not super late, but it worked with my schedule. It was relatively empty by the time I got there but thankfully no funny attitudes from any workers for being one of the last customers of the night.

The menu isn&#39;t huge but it does specialize in BBQ, specifically their wet sweet style. I got a full rack of ribs with cornbread and coleslaw. Pretty good. Half the ribs were a little tougher then usual but it&#39;s always hard to gauge rib quality until you actually bite down into them. Food came out in a decent amount of time and the waitress made sure to check on me several times. Gave me some recommendations as well.

I was at a table near the bar the place was very clean, noise levels pretty decent (not too loud), and several TVs were on with various sports playing. They have outdoor seating as well.

If you&#39;re in town I&#39;d recommend giving it a shot. I&#39;d be surprised if you didn&#39;t enjoy it. The only reason I&#39;m knocking a star off is because it doesn&#39;t offer dry rub ribs and some of the ribs I had were a little tough. If I go back and the ribs are a bit better or they got my favorite dry rub style offered, it&#39;ll probably be a 5 star."

My wife and I decided to use the on-line order to review the menu and then order.  We live about 15 miles away from the restaurant, so when the email back after placing my order said it would be ready in 30 minutes, I figured I had plenty of time and it would be ready when I arrived. I arrived at the restaurant 30 minutes later, walked in to the Take Out Counter, and although I counted 5 Ladies working at the Kitchen counter getting meals for guest, I stood their for 15 minutes and no one said &#34;Hi&#34;, &#34;Be with you in a moment&#34; ... in fact I felt totally ignored. I was just seconds from walking out when a waitress came up and asked what I needed, when I told her I had ordered take out from the web-site she looked at some orders which were still sitting on the Fax Machine in front of me.  MY ORDER WAS NOT EVEN LOOKED AT FOR 45 MINUTES! 
Because I was hungry, and didn&#39;t want to make a scene, and did not see anyone around who even appeared to be Management Material, I waited another 10 minutes to get my food. I will have to give credit to the waitress who finally came over, who simply said &#34;sorry&#34;.   

I&#39;m sorry but I did not see any of what you state on your web-site to be true, Sorry.

Green chili mac and cheese is interesting in a good way.  Brisket was a little dry and lacks some of the smoke I&#39;m used to from the better places.  Ribs were very good.  Slaw is the style I prefer.

What is important to note are the wings.  Fabulous crispness, flavor, and quality.  Come here for the wings!  I did not concentrate enough on how they could be sauced, but they were superb.

The friendly waitress even helped me with the Yelp check-in deal (free appetizer) because it was my first time using it.

The place was not busy when we came in (just before 5pm), and we liked the music selection they played in the background (classic rock with some hair metal thrown it). Service was quick, food was delicious. Did not need to ask for refills on ice tea.

The only issue was that they advertised garlic mashed potatoes with the corn beef/cabbage dinner, but we got baby taters and carrots instead. No problem because they were super tender. Portion was big with lots of the real corn beef."

First issue was walking in and not smelling BBQ I expected real authentic BBQ for the good ole Chicago BBQ sauce. Service was okay took about 5 mins to get a waitress and it wasn&#39;t many people in the place. Got a rib platter with tips , baked potato, smoked turkey and Cole slaw...best thing was the baked potato because everything needed seasoning bad, not even the BBQ sauce saved it from tasting bland. You could taste that the ribs were boiled and not barbecued which was disappointing. My boyfriend had tips as well and it was barely cut up, he also had the pull pork which didn&#39;t have bread with it which was kinda odd but his food also lacked seasoning, thank God for the groupon because I wouldn&#39;t have paid full price for the food, decided we won&#39;t be back here, expected the food to be way better based off reviews and the BBQ sauce it&#39;s self.

The second was it had to be something good! And the last thing I was looking for was something with plenty of options because I was unsure of what they might enjoy.

My boss had suggested some crappy restaurant with bad reviews around the corner from our office and I thought SBR&#39;s would at least be something new they may not have had before and being Chicago based, I thought that might add a little fun to the mix. 

Off we go for lunch around 2 or so. Yes a bit late but I figured we might get some better service if they&#39;re not busy. 

We walked in and no one was there to greet us. Boo SBR&#39;s!  We waited a few moments while they set up a table for 5 in an almost empty restaurant and we took our seats. 

It took a few minutes the be greeted by a server and when we finally were, it was a woman whom made me feel as if we were interrupting her day be eating here. Well let me tell you something, miss grumpy pants, service with a just a little smile can go a long way.

So lets start with getting our drinks...I swear that our server went to another restaurant down the road to get them. It must have taken 8 minutes. What the heck?!

Of the five of us, three of us ordered a side salad or soup. The soup came out almost immediately. The salads about 10 minutes later. The food, before the ladies were even done with their salads...they really need to work on timing. It was a joke. 

The food was good. The quality is there. The portions are excellent. They could actually offer half portions for a discounted price, if they wanted to open up their market to more people. The salads were huge and the two grown men at our table, with strong appetites were not able to finish their salads. A half portion would have been ideal for lunch for someone like myself. 

They do offer a $10 lunch dealio that includes a soft drink or iced tea. Not a bad offer. But cut the potion down and make it a $7.50 deal!

The guests we had with us, are on some sort of diet where they aren&#39;t allowed sugars or carbs. They explained this to our server. Reviewed their menu options and even the server told them specifically that their BBQ sauce has a lot of sugar in it. The ladies split a burger that was topped with pulled pork and onions and to their surprise the pulled pork was covered in BBQ sauce. So they ended up sending back their food to be remade with &#34;sauce-less&#34; pulled pork. After further discussion, it appeared the menu didn&#39;t state the BBQ sauce on the burger and being that the ladies chatted with the server about their dietary restrictions, you would think she would have mentioned the pulled pork had the sauce on it. Kinda disappointing. 

I asked the server to wrap up my leftovers for me and I got the snotty response of &#34;I&#39;ll bring you a box&#34;. Now, let me tell you something, I totally respect and understand company policies but there are better ways to respond to my request such as &#34;I wish I could but were not allowed...could I bring you a box instead?&#34; or &#34;actually we&#39;re not allowed to wrap up food, but I would be happy to bring you a container.&#34; 

It&#39;s all about service, people. If you don&#39;t like being a server, go find something else to do. Servers make money by providing good service and satisfying their tables enough so that the table wants to leave them a huge tip for their hard work during their visit. That&#39;s the hospitality industry. That&#39;s serving. Either you&#39;re in or your out. 

Not sure I&#39;ll be rushing back anytime soon. I&#39;m kinda sad because I am a Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s fan and even discovered during lunch conversation that one of the ladies from Texas uses SBR&#39;s BBQ sauce back at home!"

I don&#39;t know if our server was in the wrong mood that day or overworked from having to cover more tables than usual, but she was definitely not the nicest person.  Moment we were seated by the teenager host, she asked if we were ready to order drinks and food before even having a chance to open up the menu.  Since we didn&#39;t even look at the drink menu, along with my mom not being the drinker and ordered water and I ordered a sprite to start with and we were going to look at the menu for food a bit.  Wrong answer.  She quickly came back with the water and sprite (which really tasted like they were getting low on the syrup in the soda machine), she basically threw them on the table and stomped away.  When we were ready to order food, she was nowhere in sight and when she was, she was very pushy and trying to be quick, not even welcome to answer any questions my mom had (which like every older 60+ mother, she had a few questions).  As I said, food was good, I had the smoked meat loaf with mashed potatoes, onion strings, and grilled veggies (mom had 2 meat platter with a side of fries).  Didn&#39;t see the server until we were done and check was given, that was all she wrote."

Ordered the 3 meat platter - St Louis Ribs, beef brisket and KC style burnt ends...   None of the meat had any flavor at all...  I understand that it&#39;s a restaurant based on their BBQ sauce, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the meat has to be so bland...

Brisket was over cooked and almost to tough.

Burnt ends tasted like they were finished on a BBQ grill, rather than with smoke.

Ribs were just plain as well, nothing to write home about...

Overall - Don&#39;t expect ANY flavor from the meat..   The BBQ is required if you want any taste to your meal...  BBQ in Chicago isn&#39;t good to start with and this place is not even up to par for Chicago BBQ...  Drive on by..."

Had the three meat plate, sausage, brisket and tips. The sausage looked like a hot dog and tasted worse. The brisket was dry and flavorless. The tips were chunks of fat burnt to look like meat. To top off this experience our server (the bartender) made us feel like we were an interruption to her evening. At one point I asked for Tabasco sauce and she said they didn&#39;t have any. On the bar was a bottle in clear sight. She couldn&#39;t be pulled away from her drink she was enjoying from behind the bar. I couldst touch any of my food it was so poor that I had it wrapped up and threw it in the trash when I got home.

The ribs looked good maybe a little less charred than I&#39;ve had before. First bite nice texture but no real smoke flavor as I remembered in the past experiences . The sauce drowned out any bit of smokiness . Also we didn&#39;t taste any seasoning or rub?The same thing with the pork the meat was tender but no flavor what&#39;s so ever. The garlic smashed potatoes and the cole slaw were the highlight of tonight&#39;s dinner , that&#39;s not too good if you specialize in bbq
I was really disappointed this time around . No one came by and asked how our food was So didn&#39;t get the chance to tell anyone."

First time at a sweet baby rays and it did not disappoint. The rib tips were tender with a sweet and smoky sauce and burnt ends were not dry like I have had at some places. The highlight of the night was my soup. On a whim I decided to get a bowl of gumbo and see if it would satisfy these Creole roots I have.  Baby let me tell you, I didn&#39;t have to add anything to this gumbo, deliciously spicy, almost too spicy but not quite. Just enough rice and made with real andouille (I could tell).  So delicious and the cornbread miniloaf that comes with the meal was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. We ended up taking meat home as we got full before we could finish the generous portion that comes with the two meat plates.

Checking in on Yelp scores you a free appetizer so make sure you do. The staff was very friendly and we were seated immediately. For the free appetizer we got the nachos.

The dinner also comes with coleslaw and bread. I thought that the wings were good but the tips had a lot of fat on them. There was barely any meat. I prefer rips tips from Famous Daves because there wouldn&#39;t have been this much fat on them. So I wasn&#39;t really pleased with my tips but the wings were good and fries well fries are basic. My boyfriend has the three meat- burnt ends, ribs, and chicken. He said it was all ok and ate most of the burnt ends while there. I&#39;m not sure if we will be back.

After all, I use the Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s BBQ sauce at home after ditching another brand several years ago.

I did everything backwards the last time I visited SBRBBQ. I had the Texas Brisket Sandwich for $10.99. It really tasted good but made me even hungrier. Have you ever eaten something so good that instead of getting full, you just get more hungrier? My son in law really took advantage of the situation and ordered this plate of food that had no end in sight. So as I sat there watching him pig out on the BBQ Platter I checked in on Yelp and scored a free appetizer.

I decided to get The BBQ Lovers Platter Appetizer. So I started with an entree and ended with an appetizer. And boy was this thing packed with a lot of meat with the BBQ flavor just oozing out everywhere. I can&#39;t believe this plate was an appetizer, and now I can see why it was $10.99. Of course, I did share it with all of my dining companions. This app had KC Burnt Ends but believe me when I tell you that the description &#34;Burnt Ends&#34; does not do justice to the amount of food that there was. And it sure didn&#39;t taste burnt to me.

KC burnt ends are the beef brisket ends - I had not tried before, and they were meaty and drier than beef brisket.  Good to try, but I&#39;ll probably stick with regular beef brisket next time.  The ribs got most of the flavor from the nice tasting sauce, and were on smaller side.  Basically, they could have been better I think.   Still a great place to frequent, but not quite 5 stars on the BBQ.  The sizes of the sides were generous.  Beer selection is decent and I had a Ranger IPA for $5.50."

It started off good because they did not give my boyfriend and me a hard time about having a restaurants.com gift certificate (you just never know sometimes). And we also sat outside on a pretty nice patio. But when the food came, I was rather disappointed. My chicken tortilla soup was only ok. I&#39;ve had better. And the pulled pork sandwich was nothing like the delicious sliders at church. Many of the pieces of pork were so hard that it hurt my teeth to bite down. And the macaroni and cheese was dry and didn&#39;t have much flavor.

If anything I guess the portions were a decent size.  We certainly didn&#39;t leave hungry.  But overall, I was not all that impressed. But it was good enough for me to probably go back to use my free appetizer coupon. And I will for sure still by their sauce at the store."

The restaurant is family friendly but has a separate bar as well. The food is good but not spectacular. We got baby backs and St. Louis ribs. The St. Louis were much better. It didn&#39;t taste like they used there own sauce tho. Sides were unremarkable. I tried the gumbo which was goôd if you like spicy. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth a trip back sadly because I had high hopes for this place.

At the time they had a gift card special if you buy $200 you get a third hundred dollars free. So $300 for $200. I figured why not give it a shot right?

For Sunday I get there and I was told that there quesadillas are really good and really loaded and worth the price. So I get it loaded quesadilla and I can eat a lot but this said so much chicken and bacon and cheese that I could not even finish it. I was like wow this is really good sort of filled me up and they did a great job. Also get the chili cheese fries. I remember think when I got them that they were OK but is something you feel like you get if you&#39;re at all I just school function. You know just White chili sauce and some cheese and fries. Not bad but it was fundraiser type it when I go to a restaurant to pay good money I expect better than fundraiser type food.

Well I never learned my lesson right? So today I went to get a hotdog and another large cheesy fry. The lady told me that the hotdogs are actually two for four dollars instead of one for $3 so figured why not. The hotdogs were pretty good. The pickles were large and I think you took them off because it was to overpowering the hotdog. A term attention to the large cheesy fries and again they are underachieving at best. Not a lot of chili not a lot of cheese and they still taste like I got them at a fundraiser at a high school game. Two hotdogs and a large cheesy friend came out to 850.The price is right the dogs were good and next time I&#39;ll just get a regular basket of fries. I would like to get him at 3 1/2 but if you can&#39;t and the quesadillas last time so good I&#39;ll bump this up to a four-star. Consider this a first review and then a review of this restaurant with my last review being a 3 1/2 star."

Ordered four of the cheeseburger specials, two regular hot dogs, and two fries. Only one order in front of us, two orders after us. After waiting 15 minutes for this pretty basic order, I look over the counter and they haven&#39;t even started on our order! They&#39;ve been pushing orders out the drive though window. I asked for my money back and we left. Ridiculous..and no wonder this place has just two stars. it was great when it was in my hometown in Mt. Prospect back in the day.

I could have gone down the street and gotten the same size sandwich with more meat and with fries for the same price.

Sometimes it&#39;s not such a huge deal, because they know what to do with it. But at Photo&#39;s? It&#39;s exactly why the food is horrible.

It usually doesn&#39;t matter /where/ the burger comes from - it&#39;s a general rule that seasoning it is pretty important! And when you go to bite into a huge bun with more condiments than burger, you&#39;ve already got the mental image of that stack of thin, frozen patties separated by sheets of paper. What you&#39;re probably not expecting is the overpowering taste of *plain*. No salt, no pepper, not even a hint of seasoning salt. Just... /plain/, unseasoned, prepackaged food.

Everybody has their own idea of what good cheese fries are, but I&#39;ve honestly never met anyone who described their own cheese-fry paradise as including Merkt&#39;s cheese. I don&#39;t wonder why. I might occasionally wonder if the stuff ever gets melty, but I can tell you that it&#39;s not appetizing once it returns to its peanut butter-like consistency.

The quesadillas are disgusting. Oily on the outside, and stuffed with way too much cheddar (and some other nonsense). They don&#39;t work. Queso Chihuahua, maybe?"

We all ordered it to go but my friends decided to eat while we waited on my order and they finished before I even got it. My other friend also ordered two milkshakes ($4 each) and even that took half an hour to get.

Then after 10 more minutes we asked again and she said it&#39;ll be a minute.

I wasn&#39;t the only ones frustrated with their service. There was a crowd of 10-15 people just standing around waiting for their food as well and I can tell they were all getting just as impatient as I was over how long the food was taking. 

As for my review of the food... Well at best it&#39;s a 2-star. All that wait and for expensive crappy food. The hotdog was nothing special and the burger was just bad. The patty was completely hidden by the bun and to make up for the small party size they decided to load on the condiments, which in no way can make up for the lack of meat in the burger. 

We should have just gone to the wendys that was right next door.  The food would have been better, faster, and cheaper.  Save yourself the trouble and don&#39;t come here. I&#39;m surprised they&#39;ve been around for so long consider how terrible this place is."

Food is pretty pricey for the quality you receive. We got the jumbo char dog, chicken pita, small beef, cheeseburger, fries, and onion rings for $27.

The char dog was good in size but not anything special. Cheeseburger was fine except it had a slice of kraft American cheese, not really a fan of businesses using cheap cheese like kraft American. 
Chicken pita was dry but my kids liked the chicken with some ketchup. Fries was meh but what really annoyed me was the order of onion rings. We got our onion ring order and inside was half onion rings half fries.... (the other order of just fries was in another bag so this was not an accidental spill of any sort). If I wanted fries, I&#39;d order fries but I ordered onion rings so I&#39;d expect all onion rings. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen that and I was definitely not happy about the discovery. The beef in the small beef was not your typical beef you&#39;d find or expect. It was slices of beef that were bland and very chewy. Not tender by any means.

You would think you could give a hot dog joint at least 4 stars and I would like to because the eating area itself is neat! Cool pictures hanging everywhere, old cameras, old artifacts, etc...  that&#39;s the 3 stars... but I stopped in driving by for a hot dog.

A Chicago dog with everything but too much of it! I got a salad in a bun with dog hidden below. The amount of condiments made the hot dog cool off too fast.

Supposedly they are known for their cheese for fries, (not that this is normal for me,) but it was served on the side... I don&#39;t know, maybe coagulated cheese dip is good for some but I went back to dipping my fries in ketchup if needed.

There are other choices on the menu but for me this is a one-n-done on the dogs!"

Inside the restaurant is heavily decorated with pictures and memorabilia and they have some tvs for sports games. It wasn&#39;t too busy when I went in on a week night. 

After looking over the menu, I decided to go with the veggie burger, fries, and pita chips with humus.  The staff seemed to be pretty friendly.  It did take longer than expected to prepare the food. I would estimate about 10 minutes which seemed like a lot considering it was not busy. 

For the food, the veggie burger was ok, the fries were pretty good, but the pita chips and humus were disappointing. The pita chips were pretty much just crackers.  

On the receipt, I noticed the $5 off for some reason only took off $4.53 and this is before tax was added, so I&#39;m not sure what the deal is with that. All my items were at full price so it seems like it should have taken off the full $5. 

Overall considering the food was just ok, the was a significant wait time, and the fact that the coupon did not give the full $5 off, I personally would not rush back, but if you are looking for a fun place to go for a burger and fries, it is worth checking out."

The food was typical of a burger joint, nothing special about the burgers. No magic buns or seasoning on the party. The fries were nothing to rave about. But on the plus side you get a super small free ice cream cone so that kind of makes up for the disappointment. I had a coupon for a free burger when you buy an order of fries and a drink, so I decided to put that to good use. Other than that I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to dine there."

We catered from here for a work gathering, so I have no idea what the atmosphere or service is like.

That being said, we ordered some plain hot dogs, cheese burgers, and chicken pitas for a work party. We had everything delivered (they do charge a delivery fee). They came on time, everything was hot and individually wrapped (which was nice). The hot dogs were...well...hot dogs. Honestly, I don&#39;t know how anyone could screw up a hot dog. The burgers were ok - they tasted fine, but they seemed like they had been pre-frozen at one point. I like my burgers cooked medium, juicy, seasoned. These were...plain, thin, dry...nothing to brag about. The chicken pitas were really dry...barely tasted like anything. We did order everything plain, so that could be our fault. But it really wasn&#39;t seasoned. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but I definitely wasn&#39;t blown away.

When I looked at the prices (and I wasn&#39;t paying for it...so that helps) I thought it was a little much for what we got. A burger was $2.99...a plain burger. Meh. Not terrible...but not great. Not for the quality.

Overall, it wasn&#39;t the worst, but I&#39;m not compelled to visit the location to eat, or to order from them again."

Tried again today (sign says $1 hotdogs...doesn&#39;t say one per person, so if you&#39;re planning on bringing dogs back for anyone else, beware). Once, again bun tasted stale, and wasn&#39;t steamed. They must have switched to a cheaper brand because they no longer have poppy seeds. Hot dog was so-so...may have switched to a cheaper alternative there as well. Asked for pickles on the side and got 1, where I used to get 2 or 3.

Once you walk inside you&#39;ll notice a large number of vending machines and skill cranes. The decorations extended to photos (that&#39;s why it&#39;s their name I guess) all over the wall, a display of antique cameras and even a movie projector. The place is fairly clean but has a very cluttered atmosphere with something to look at everywhere.  

There was a rather significant line upon walking in and a few minutes later I was able to place my order. I decided to go for a hot dog with everything. I also was urged by a friend of mine to try &#34;funnel cake fries&#34; which is a specialty they serve at Photos. Once I placed the order it was nearly 10 minutes before the order was ready. Service here isn&#39;t exactly speedy, but in all fairness it was fairly busy though not exactly packed with customers.

The hot dog I received came on a very dry bun. The bun was regular without any poppy seeds and while not hard was not exactly soft either. The sausage itself was skinless and not steamed particularly well as it seemed to have had a lot of the flavor sapped out of it. There was a pickle spear on the hot dog easily as thick as the hot dog itself. To make matters worse it lacked the length so that you would get pickle in every bite and was so sour it overpowered the flavor of the hot dog itself. This pickle was a failure in every way possible. In the 1950s you would expect this pickle to sit in the back of the classroom with a dunce cap on. The application of the mustard and relish was a little excessive. There was no sign of celery salt, at least the onion and sport peppers were well applied. 

My friend and I also split a specialty item here called &#34;Funnel Cake Fries&#34;. These are like a funnel cake or french toast but made of potato. Imagine French fries with powdered sugar on them. This wound up making the fries more of a dessert than a traditional appetizer.  These were somewhat thick fries, but if I recall correctly for around 3.00 we only got like 10 or 12 of them. It wasn&#39;t like getting a whole order of regular fries served in the same manner. While this isn&#39;t something I would go out of my way to order again, it&#39;s definitely an unusual way to serve french fries.

Overall I like the aesthetic of the place itself with various vending machines, old pictures and old cameras up everywhere. The food failed to live up to my standards. While the funnel cake fries that I tried were a both unique and good that was a wretched hot dog, and from a place that has the word Hot Dogs in their name,. Because the funnel cake fries were a saving grace and the place has just kitsch enough of an atmosphere to be a draw, I am going to be generous and award Photo&#39;s Hot Dogs with two stars."

We all work hard for our money and it&#39;s a rare treat for me to get to take my kids out for lunch so it&#39;s very upsetting that I wasted my money when I could&#39;ve spent less and gotten more food *even better tasting** at a place like Wendy&#39;s or McDonalds."

When I want a veggie burger on the fly, I usually want one from photos. Their buns are soft, the right size, and they complement the burger very well. When I order it with everything on it, I really get everything. And all the toppings are cut generously and I am pleased. The burger itself is very good--not overcooked or mushy. Just the right texture. It&#39;s probably closest to Gardenburger in composition. It&#39;s quite tasty.

The fries are good--maybe a little on the thinner side, but the flavor and texture is there. I have also had their quesadillas. They&#39;re good if you want a lot of gooey cheese and veggies on a huge tortilla, which, well, heck yes, I do. It comes with a side of sour cream which seems a little on the small side, but is probably an accurate single serving size and I&#39;m just a sour cream glutton. The salsa is homemade and I liked it--could&#39;ve been spicier for my tastes, but again, that&#39;s me.

The only real puzzler about this place for me is the hummus wrap. OK... So I ordered this once, and it was... Strange. I think it was a flour tortilla (trying to remember now) and it was stuffed with lettuce and gobs and gobs of hummus. I mean we&#39;re talking, someone dumped a whole tub of hummus into this thing. Now I really like hummus, but I was taking bites and making faces because I was just getting mouthfuls of the stuff. And frankly, hummus is better in moderation. I just imagine this sandwich would be so much more enjoyable with some carrots, zucchini, or red bell peppers thrown in there.

I&#39;ve had their milkshakes, which are also pretty good. Not amazing, but I&#39;d order another. But the reason they earn their 4-stars from me is the burger. I keep coming back and getting them, so I figured I should give them some love for it!"

It took so long for the food to come out, I actually busted out the book I had been reading. It&#39;s really expensive too.

Claiming to be a Chicago staple means delivering, at a minimum, decent versions of Chicago&#39;s typical foods.

The italian beef is one of the worst I&#39;ve had anywhere, let alone in Chicago. The hot dogs were fine, but bun and condiments tasted stale. French fries (usually an easy win) were also stale and subpar. The one positive thing I can say is that they did craft a fairly delicious milkshake. 

Despite the tasty milkshake I have a hard time believing that I would return to Photos. There are better places for milkshakes and numerous better options for Chicago foods (see Kostas in the Palatine area)."

Fun fact: the &#34;steak&#34; quesadilla uses the exact same disgusting beef.

They apparently do not have a gyro on a spit.

It reminded me of &#34;pre-cooked bacon&#34; you see in the supermarket, which is something not even I would try...and I&#39;ve eat gas station food. 
 
I give them kudos for being good neighbors, they do a lot for the community in the way of team sponsorship, and my kids love going there.

But we quit doing that when you could get a HUGE dog or polish we could SPLIT WITH a refillable drink for $1.50 at Costco. 
So long story long we had never eaten INSIDE, and picked up a GrouponNOW net net for $5 on $20, less 5% for going through Discover, TODAY.

It kind of reminds me of a Schaumburg Portillos for grade school and junior high school kids on Red Bull. And we enjoyed NOT having kids there and the basic fun energy of the place watching really cute little kids run around who are going to grow up never being that cute again.
Our fish tacos were ok but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really a fish taco if it has romaine instead of cabbage on it,  plus cheese? really? and NO tomato; and our greek salad was ok but no peppecinis? I wouldn&#39; t order the veggie humus wrap again, it is basically a LOT of romaine with a little humus, how about some tomatoes, still better than it looked and nice to have some solid veggie choices. The Veggie humus wrap WAS big enough to split.

What I didn&#39;t like was that EVERYTHING that we ordered was 50c to $1.50 more than on the on-line menu. When I mentioned it ...the 13 year old at the window said &#34;yeah they ought to change that.&#34; 
I think $6.49 for a veggie lettuce/humus wrap is kind of Route 14 highway robbery when you were expecting $4.99.  This might sound really cheap, but our bill was 20% more than the on-line menu. Did YOU raise YOUR prices 20% this year or GET a 20% raise? We didn&#39;t.

The tables were clean, the free little ice cream cone was fun, but we are going to stick to Costco for our non-health food and ice cream smoothies. If you do go here, check their website for specials/coupons as this food isn&#39;t that good to not get some kind of deal, and don&#39;t believe their on-line menu prices.

The food is fresh and simple, which is exactly what it tastes like. Most recently I had an excellent milkshake and a chicken pita. The milkshake was great since you have to be trying to mess that up.

When I asked the girl at the window to itemize my order, she told me that the (very) small cheese fry was OVER $3 &amp; the PLAIN hot dog was $3 too!

Even the servers start to remember what you&#39;re drinking if you come around enough, and they are very friendly here.  The atmosphere is pretty chill, there are a bunch of TVs around in the dining area as well as the bar, so you can get your game watching/cheering on!  It can get pretty packed on game days/nights, but the wait is never really all that long.  They are hella high tech here with being able to text your phone directly when your table is ready, so in the meantime, you can grab a drink from the bar and start out with some liquid appetizers.  It tastes soooo good once it touches your lips.

Now let&#39;s get to the food action right here.  Many people go to the Village Tavern for their Chicken fingers.  These are pretty good actually... Their chicken fingers are deep fried in some proper batter.  I prefer these to be a little crunchy over softer ones, but this will fill you up for sure, and you&#39;ll probably need a box if you get it as a meal, because they are really filling.  You&#39;ll feel like a turkey on Thanksgiving after chowing down on these chicken fingers and french fries.  I don&#39;t often order these, but if you are suffering from a massive hangover, these bad boys might do the trick.

Now, where they really shine is on their burger game.  These are definitely on point!  I think at least half of the time I&#39;ve went to the Village Tavern, I ordered the Onion Bacon Cheese Burger.  Now this is a big juicy burger with a nice amount of cheese and they go wild with the bacon.  Big thick pieces piled up on top to go with the grilled onions...just toss on a little ketchup, and you will go into burger bliss. 

 Their fries are nicely seasoned and also have a nice crisp to it.  A lot of burger places have great burgers, but when it comes to their fries, it turns out to be absolute weak sauce.  Here at the VTG, the burgers and fries are top notch.  I usually order, a side Caesar Salad as well.  Even that is done up properly time after time.  It&#39;s pretty affordable too.  It goes great with a cold brew to say the least!

I&#39;ve never had the Nachorama, but that would be the next thing I&#39;d wanna try.  It looks like a mountain of nachos, if you order this be sure to bring a big crew in order to erode that massive pile down to a valley.  There&#39;s various sandwiches and other dinners as well.  I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here yet.  My buddy and I have came here a bunch after work, and it usually turns to be out on the cheaper side tab compared to other surrounding restaurants in the Schaumburg area..   Good food and good service at affordable prices goes a long way."

Kind of quaint if you squint. It seems they never updated since they were established. It&#39;s all good, this place gets packed and they seem like a bunch of locals here. I dig it. 

So I give 4 stars for location (close to my crib), very affordable menu (they have like 10,000 items in their menu), fast and friendly service (although be careful, she gave a couple of suggestions that were totally off), and their batter (they fry everything here and they mastered the art of the batter--- so get everything in the menu that&#39;s deep fried)

Chips con queso: the chips are too hard for my liking and the queso dip was too runny and lacks taste. 

Chicken tortilla soup: sooooo good! Meaty, crunchy (tortilla chips), chunky, fresh taste, and has a sweet aftertaste because of the delicious veggies in it. 

Chicken tenders: wowwww MUST HAVE. The batter makes these tenders tasty, tender, and perfect crunch. Get the original. Although I liked the buffalo, I love the original with the honey mustard. 

Chili soup: it&#39;s ok. It&#39;s not as big of a deal like the server described it. They really pimp their chili though. It comes with green onions, onions, cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips, and of course the chili! 

Chicken parmigiana: I don&#39;t know why I ordered this... but I did so here it is: huge tasty chicken breast on top of fettuccine pasta, this needed more pasta sauce and that may have done the trick. But then again, why did I order this??? Unless you&#39;re feigning for a huge chunk of chicken breast with mozzarella and sauce on top, skip this. They have tons of items in their menu to choose from.  

Dessert: so to wrap up our heart attack dinner we ordered the deep fried sampler platter: deep fried Oreo, deep fried cheesecake, deep fried twinkies, and deep fried snickers topped with two scoops of ice cream and whipped cream. Also followed by an ER visit to get an EKG and a nitro."

But I haven&#39;t really found anything really great in terms of the food. It&#39;s not bad though either. The service seems to turn over a lot, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had the same server, and they&#39;re busy a lot so the service is hit or miss. They do have really good French onion soup, but I think they only have it on Wednesdays or Thursdays. I&#39;ll be returning because I have family members who swear by it but it&#39;s not my favorite.

UPDATE: Owner contacted me and offered suggestions on what to try on the menu: Ribs, burgers, nachorama and fajitas. Also a gift card, so I&#39;ll take his recommendations and update a star. I appreciate great customer service!"

Nice portion size and the chicken fingers were nice and hot. Their honey mustard sauce is amazing too. We also ordered the full plate of nachos and honestly, there is nothing special about the nachos, other than the fact that it&#39;s just really huge. Nachos got soggy after just sitting there for a while, so it was pretty unappealing to eat it. The fries that comes with the chicken fingers are also very good, and I honestly liked it more than the chicken fingers.
Service was ok. It wasn&#39;t busy when I went, so I wish our server was more attentive and quick.
I would probably pay another visit here but will explore their menu more"

After all, it says so on their shirt! ;)

Growing up and going to high school in Schaumburg, everyone knows about the Village Tavern. It&#39;s a staple in the neighborhood. 
I used to visit VTG numerous times a month in my high-school days. I&#39;ve never left hungry and always left happy.

After a few years without visiting, (I moved to Arlington Heights) my friend decided to make tonight a throwback moment. We decided to make the somewhat far drive to check out an old favorite.

We went in around 6:30 and the place was PACKED! This is a normal be used everyone loves it. We put our name in the list and they put us in the app. The app allows you to see from your iPhone your estimated wait and how many parties are ahead of you. Great feature, very much appreciated.

After about ten minutes, we were seated and ordered an ice cold Blue Moon. Keep in mind, Schaumburg police/village require TWO FORMS OF I.D. to purchase and consume. I showed a insurance card and my drivers license with no problem. 

We enjoyed our beer while scanning thru the huge menu. There is something for everyone here. I decided to start with the baked French onion soup. We also each ordered the chicken finger appetizer. 

The soup was served piping hot with a heap of ooey-gooey cheese on top. Perfect, just how I like it. The soup was incredible with plenty of onions. 

Next, on to the world famous chicken fingers. They&#39;re world famous for a reason, nobody makes em&#39; like VTG. Crispy and light breading over juicy and tender chicken inside. They serve it with a super secret honey mustard sauce for dipping. The honey mustard MAKES AND ENHANCES the chicken tenders. No ketchup or ranch, stick to the honey mustard! They melt in your mouth and are best eaten piping hot where you are sure to scar the roof of your mouth. ;) 

The service here is superb. Even when swamped, they provide an excellent dining experience. The noise is a bit loud inside, but it&#39;s a causal, fun neighborhood spot. The owner knows what he&#39;s doing and doesn&#39;t need to change a thing! 

So go ahead, throw your pajama bottoms on and kick back with an ice cold beer and a basket of the best chicken fingers known to man!"

Went thru Yelp to find good restaurants around that area, and I found this place. He loves American food and beers. This is the perfect place for that!

I ordered chicken fingers since the restaurant is well known for those. Boy, it was hellaaaaa good! So unhealthily crunchy! Haha! Even though I&#39;m on healthy diet, I literally finished my food in less than 10 minutes. You gotta try this dish when you swing by here.  My cousin got a burger and blue moon beer. He said his burger was juicy and fulfilled his craving. 

The service was quick too! The waitress (sorry i didn&#39;t catch her name) was too sweet to let us know that the restaurant is not going to serve the food after 11 pm (we arrived at 10:58 pm), and she happily took our orders with no attitude nor rudeness. 

I&#39;m giving five stars and I&#39;m coming back soon for those chicken fingers!"

Everyone raves about their chicken fingers, for good reason.  I get them with 3 sauces - of course the honey Mustard, the Ranch, and the Buffalo.  I also will never pass up their French Onion soup.  But don&#39;t get stuck on those two items.  other things that I&#39;ve had that are awesome are the lasagna (ask for no red sauce unless you like sweet sauce), pork chops, nachos, Mexican pizza, roast beef or beef stew - I can&#39;t remember.  I just know it was all good.  If you are a drinker, they have plenty to choose from.  I always have a good experience with the staff as well.  The only thing I can say that I don&#39;t like is the wait time sometimes can be long, but using the nowait app helps with that.  You will not be sorry at this place."

Yet, chicken fingers will be the only thing I will order at Village Tavern. Ever. And I mean it. 

Yesterday was my second visit to Village Tavern. My first visit was two years ago and their chicken fingers have been in my mind ever since. They are so crispy, tender and so juicy! They&#39;re also beer battered and don&#39;t taste like you&#39;re swallowing tablespoons of oil. Aaaaand they come with their homemade honey mustard that is perfect! 

My friend ordered the chicken burrito, I ordered the chicken finger plate and we had fried mushrooms to share. 

Food came out so quickly! My friend really enjoyed her burrito. I was in loooooove with my chicken finger plate! For about $10, you get a choice of a soup or salad (I chose the Chicken Rotini), vegetables upon request (steamed carrots and broccoli--perfectly seasoned and so fresh!), and a form of carb (fries, mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, or Spanish rice). 

The fried mushrooms ($6) were amazing as well! I never know whether the fried mushrooms I order elsewhere are fresh or frozen...but Village Tavern&#39;s are FOR SURE fresh. They use the same batter as their chicken fingers and they are perfectly seasoned, fresh, crispy, and amazing. I really hate paying money for an appetizer that I barely share with other people at my table. For $6, you can share for sure because they give you huge fried mushrooms and there are plenty to go around. 

My visit last night was superb thanks to our waitress, Caitlin. She was so attentive to our needs. Caitlin noticed that my friend and I were famished. She was so sweet and she put in our order to be rushed and made immediately. What a gem! She was always happy and filled our water/came to check on us at the most opportune times. I most definitely recommend her!

Village Tavern has delicious food, excellent service and seriously so much food for the money you pay. A must try!"

Ordered to go the other day and was left craving more. Their chicken fingers were still good and tasty but extra greasy, not like how it used to be. The wings were completely overcooked and dry, but SUPER spicy. The cucumber bruschetta was tasty but the bread that was served with it was burnt... 

The worst part was the Caesar salad, like how do you mess up a Caesar salad? It was bitter and the dressing was watery. The Parmesan and croutons were soggy and sad. Just disappointing and a waste of money. 

If I go back, I&#39;ll just stick with the classics."

We went here on a Monday, it was very crowded, and pretty loud for a weeknight.  I got a philly cheese beef sandwich, and shared an order of chicken fingers with my date.  The sandwich and side of fries was good, but as you might of guessed, the chicken fingers stole the show.  Very tender and deliciously breaded!  We ordered bbq and honey mustard sauce on the side, and they went great with both.  Seriously, if you go here and don&#39;t get the chicken fingers you are messing up big time.  I definitely plan on going back, but based on the weekday crowd, this might be a place I avoid on the weekends."

My husband had a chicken wrap, he said it was okay.... I don&#39;t believe him, he just have this thing that even when he doesn&#39;t like the food he will eat it, it is just like he doesn&#39;t want the waitress feel bad or something.... and there is also why he took the left overs home, which I throw away the next morning.

They have a nice selection of beers and cocktails.  The food is also great and when I was on a diet, their low-cal options weren&#39;t that bad as well.  Most people come here for the chicken fingers which are outstanding.  The batter on the chicken fingers is what makes it taste great.  There&#39;s a traditional version and a coconut batter, which can be a little crispier in my opinion.

The batter is amazing and it&#39;s an actual cut of chicken tender inside the golden-fried goodness! You have to try it with their &#34;finger sauce&#34; or whatever they call it.  It&#39;s just honey mustard, but it&#39;s definitely good.

The place is very relaxed and the servers don&#39;t rush you, so it&#39;s a great place if you&#39;re trying to watch a game or kill time chatting with a group of good friends--but maybe not if you&#39;re in a hurry. The takeout process is great too!

I haven&#39;t been as regular a patron recently because I feel like the quality and value isn&#39;t as consistent as of late. My friends and I have commented to each other that the last few times we&#39;ve gone it seems like the chicken has been getting smaller, but the price has gone up.

It was totally packed by the time we got there. I think they were saying the wait was 30 minutes for 2 people when we got there- which I wasn&#39;t expecting for a pub in the suburbs. Our group was 45 minutes late... but luckily the place was nice and seated the two of us immediately so we at least got to sit down for 45 minutes (although we felt very bad for taking up such a big table). But the server was nice and didn&#39;t say anything about it. The place was really big and had a ton of tables and seating. It was hard to find close parking.

I got the Parmesan Shoe Strings Cheese Burger with bleu cheese and on Rye Bread. To be honest, it was just O.K. It&#39;s not something I would get again. The fries were also just O.K. But for $8 it was not bad.

My hubby got the Onion Bacon Cheese Burger. He said it was okay. He did like his sweet potato fries though! They looked much more fresh than the regular fries. He also got a lil sumpin sumpin =).

I also suggest you get the chicken fingers platter. They are so good! Especially with the honey mustard sauce. They were both tender, juicy and crispy all at once. And if you get the loaded cheese fries with it you get more cheese then fries!
I finished off my meal with the fried cheesecake egg rolls. Which these were to die for. The mix of cinnamon, vanilla ice cream and cheesecake wrapped in a flaky crust was so yummy.

Got there about 8pm (Friday) and it was busy. We just sat at the bar. We were immediately greeted and given menus.

Now after all the reviews, I already knew what I wanted. I needed a little bit of everything. Cheeseburger, Nachos and Chicken Fingers with their honey mustard sauce. You better believe we ordered all of that and split it.

Okay.. Let&#39;s start with the cheeseburger. WOW! They seasoned this to perfection. The taste was honestly unbelievable. I&#39;d easily gain 50lbs if I lived by here. They came with a side of fries. Usually bars have just regular fries and there&#39;s nothing special, however, these were awesome! Again, seasoned to perfection.. My mouth is watering while I&#39;m typing this; I may have a problem! lol

Nachos - Fully loaded. We only ordered a half order and that was enough for two people and to take some home, which I did ;) and ate them later! Then the lady asked, &#39;don&#39;t you want to try the chicken fingers with our homemade honey mustard&#39;.. Uhh yaa!! (40 lbs later) They were awesome and the honey mustard was excellent!

The dinner came with an ample amount, but the were so good, I asked if I could get a couple of extra. Diana asked the manager, and after a couple of minutes they delivered a basket of 8 !!! 
I would like everyone know we were impressed with the food and service. The restaurant was clean, not too loud, and the entire staff was friendly and inviting. Yes, we will be back.

I stopped in today right at open (11a), I was across the street getting my car detailed at Action Audio and Detail. Saw they were right there so I decided to spend my 2 hours here. BEST. DECISION. EVER. *** for today.

I was greeted and seated immediately when I came in. Awesome. The feel of this place is very home-y and comfortable, you feel very much part of a family when you walk in just because of the way the employees carry themselves. 

My server Lexi came over smiling and asked if she could help me out, I asked for coffee which was delivered immediately. Nice and hot. 

She helped me since it was my first time here with her menu knowledge making suggestions they were known for, but also making suggestions that weren&#39;t advertised all over the place. I ended up picking something I knew I would like but was also special to the house because it had the chicken fingers in it.

DELICIOUS! I loved my food. I didn&#39;t eat it all because the portions are abundant and I never finish a meal anyways; I brought it home for my hubby. I paid 13.03 for a big-ass wrap, and loaded cheese fries with bottomless coffee. I feel like my money went very very far today. 

I have never seen a pub/tavern fill for a Monday lunch, but let me tell you by the time noon rolled around this place was 80% full, even the bar. I bet you need to make reservations for the weekend or be prepared to wait a decent amount of time, but they also have a connection with No Wait which can help you with that. 

I have been in the food service industry for 13 years, I have done it all from serving, cooking, hosting, banquets and I have been managing now for the last 4 years. This place makes me want to come work for them, I truly enjoyed it this much. 

Lexi, you were awesome, friendly, attentive, and I couldn&#39;t have asked for better service. I haven&#39;t found service this good in a long long time (and the strange thing is I feel like I wasn&#39;t treated special, my server did not go above and beyond for me, but it appeared that she wanted to be at work, and that she WANTED to serve me and THAT makes all the difference in the world)

Thanks for the great lunch, though you are way out of my way, when I come back out to Schaumburg, you&#39;ll be the place I come to."

Don&#39;t let the exterior of Village Tavern deter you from stopping in for some good comfort food.  I came with my girlfriend for a late lunch on a Monday afternoon and we were pleasantly surprised.  Village Tavern seems like a cozy, neighborhood bar that would be packed with regulars on a daily basis.  It has an old school charm to it which I loved.  The food is priced well, tastes great, and portions are huge.  

I had the pot roast which comes with a soup or salad (I chose the beef tortilla soup) and sides of veggies and garlic mashed potatoes.  After I had the soup I was already halfway full since the portion was that hefty!  My entree itself could have fed two people and I was able to only eat about a third of it.  The mashed potatoes were garlicy and delicious, pot roast was tender and flavorful, and the veggies were probably from a frozen bag.  My friend ordered the chicken burrito and the description of the burrito did not lie.  They called it ginormous and that it was.  She was only able to eat half of it and was super stuffed afterwards.

We definitely want to come back and check it out for happy hour with friends (mainly so we can try out more food on the menu since there were a TON of yummy sounding things).  Until then Village Tavern!"

Taste was okay.   Sort of bland.  Nachos were soggy and we were there when they were brought out from the kitchen.   The nachos while piled high with stuff but just lacked flavor.  They were skimpy with the cheese and sour cream.  

The Chicken Burrito Grande was good.  It tasted fresh.  I had to add Tobasco Sauce to jazz up the flavor.

The pulled pork&#39;s barbeque sauce was so so but I like Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s the best and my own second.  The pulled pork sandwich was average, nothing special.

Service was good.  People were friendly and efficient.

Food here tends to be priced high compared to the value and taste.  

They do have ordering on line which is nice.

We&#39;ve only been here once so I will update my review if our next visit differs.  There are other places right around us though that are cheaper and better value."

VTG earns a solid rating based largely on the strength of its chicken fingers and generally good service.  (And in full disclosure, I&#39;ve only gotten the chicken fingers here.)  The chicken fingers are covered with a light yet crispy batter that does not overwhelm the chicken meat.  The pieces are pretty big so you&#39;ll definitely get your fill.  Plus, VTG does not mess around with that honey mustard; it&#39;s the perfect dipping sauce for that chicken!

I&#39;ve eaten inside and taken out from VTG, and the service has been good each time. The atmosphere inside is typical of the bar and grill restaurant, and the prices are reasonable."

The food was great as usual, and my two friends I brought with had never been and really enjoyed their meals. What was lacking was service from our server. She was nice, but it was really obvious she was exhausted, which she confirmed when she screwed something up and told us she had been there since 1030 this morning.

So I was in the area today and decided to stop in.  From the name I was expecting a nice and quiet place to eat and have a drink.  First in you are expecting a quiet place, keep driving.  If you want some great food, stop in.

Pulling into the parking lot, I thought we would have a long wait to get a seat, it was packed with cars.  Walked in and got seated right away.  Are server Lexi was there right away and took our orders. And through out the meal she kept tabs on our table and get the glasses full.  We ordered the chicken platters which came with a salad and potatoes.  There was enough food to feed two people from one platter.  The chicken fingers are fairly large and plentiful which included the dipping sauce.  The fingers were hot and nicely breaded.  This place has big screen tv&#39;s all over playing different things.

The negatives.  This place is loud, I forgot how loud bars can be, so if you plan on talking during your visit you must raise up your voice a few notches.  When I went to grab the chair to pull it closer to the table, it was full of some sticky substance which had to be washed off of my hands.  The salad that came with the platter was loaded with dressing, it would of have been better if was served in a little cup or dish."

We are from Wisconsin.  When we walked in, we were immediately seated by a wonderful hostess/ waitress. We sat down and got our menu&#39;s and drinks faster than fast.  I ordered the fish fry, my wife ordered the famous chicken strips. Coming from Wisconsin where there&#39;s a fish fry in every restaurant every Friday, I was anxious to see what Chicago had to offer. To my surprise it was the best all-you-can-eat fish fry I have ever had. The fish was flaky and tender while the batter was a golden brown.  It was, I have to say, the perfect fish. My wife had the chicken tenders. She said they really lived up to the reputation of being the house specialty. The portion sizes was unreal. So much food. The side that came with our meals were also above our expectations . Augratin potatos? Not many restaurants serve this as a side option.

I feel like I&#39;m allowed the townie comment since I grew up in Schaumburg. And they flock to Village Tavern like a moth to a flame. And that&#39;s a good thing. VT is pretty sweet overall with its extensive menu (both food and bar), plenty of space and tons of TVs (if that&#39;s what you seek). 

It&#39;s a place you can certainly bring your kiddos for lunch or an early dinner as there&#39;s plenty of fare for the little ones. And while tons of people love love love their chicken fingers, I have to say they aren&#39;t my favorite thing on the menu. Yes, the are thickly breaded, fat, juicy fingers served with a practically drinkable-it&#39;s-so-good honey mustard sauce. Instead, though, I&#39;m talking about the club sandwich. Piled high with plenty o&#39;meat and fillings, this sandwich is big enough for two meals and comes with a trough sized portion of fries (get the sweet potato variety if you steer that way). 

VT has certainly grown with the times - offering up things like texting you with updates if you&#39;re waiting for a table, diversifying its beer list and generally maintaining the good food and service folks in Schaumburg have come to expect. Two thumbs up for this local staple."

They may not be world famous, but they should be. if you only have one item here order the chicken fingers. The burgers are also good,as are the fish and chips and the nachos are superior. The daily specials pretty much rock as well. The second awesomeness is this is the best place to watch chicago sports. Both the staff at the bar and the other locals are very, shall we say enthusiastically interactive.  If you do not want zestful enthusiasm on game day, avoid the bar. You can still enjoy the game from a booth. This is a family neighborhood  type pub so children of all ages will be present, except at the bar area, which is where you should be if you are serious about drinking.  
Be advised that during peak times-such as friday/saturday nights around dinnertime, this place is super busy. Parking is plentiful but since the parking lot is shared with other businesses parking can be a little tricky. there can be a wait to be seated as well, and the table service especially as regards drinks can be slower then you might like. Outside of the dinner/lunch  rush hours these conditions do not apply. So there&#39;ll be plenty of room when the game starts at 7:00 pm or so.
In summary this is a perfect place to watch sports, or bring the family for a casual dinner or lunch. I&#39;m totally planning to come back."

This is going to be our spot every time we come to Schaumburg. We ordered their chicken fingers( delicious!), chimichanga(delicious!), cheese fries ( meh), and fried cheesecake rolls ( droooooollll). Laura was our server and she was supper nice. She didn&#39;t hover or ask us if we are doing ok every 5 minutes. You can sit down and enjoy a drink with the kids and watch sports on the screens which are located everywhere. This place is great for gatherings too. The prices were reasonable for the size and quality of their food."

We went on a weekday around 4 and the bar was full and although there were plenty of diners there was ample seating. You could smell the charbroiled food from the outside and it was appealing. 

We both ordered burgers and truthfully no big deal in the taste department. The fries were lack luster and were no better than the frozen kind you buy in the store. Server could have been more attentive as we needed to track her down to pay. 

They do what looks to be a great business but unlikely we will go back."

There, I said it.

And now with a cleansed soul, and a renewed vision, I&#39;m able to focus a little clearer, staying a tad sharper while wading through numerous options found in bar menus.

I&#39;m on a mission. A mission, to find that ultimate hot dog and chicken finger joint.

First stop...right here in the suburbs of Chicago, home of the &#34;World Famous&#34; Chicken Fingers. 

We came here because Chicago was having a trifecta of sporting events, The Blackhawks and The Bulls were still in the playoffs and the Cubs were playing the Rockies, all on the same night. It just so happens we stroll into a local tavern boasting about the Chicken Fingers.

As promised, I scanned the menu, for only two options- Chicken Fingers and a Hot Dog.

Now, when the menu, your cute server, the napkins, the T-shirts, the plane pulling a banner, the local crowd, all brag about these incredible Fingers...you order tem. Did I mention the cute server?

Done.

Now, is there a hot dog to sample? Perhaps a fine Chicago Dog, with that crazy fluorescent green relish. Let&#39;s see...Cuban sandwich, Italian Grinder, what a cute server, focus Rick, a Reuben, Philly Chees... whoa! What the hell?

A Fenway Dog, in the heart of Chicago? What would Abe Froman (Ferris Bueller reference) the sausage king of Chicago think about this...right in his own back yard?

Yes, I have to have it. It must be good. 

Perhaps I gather a second opinion. 

Yep, verified by cute server number 1, well sort of, (turns out, she&#39;s a vegetarian), but she brings over cute server number 2.

&#34;What do you think, only a great dog from Boston, would survive this long in a Chicago Sports Bar. Don&#39;t be a knucklehead, get It.&#34;  - Cute Server Number 2

First, the Chicken Fingers are incredible. I mean magical. I can&#39;t describe how delicious they are, the outside golden flakey batter melts in your mouth, the moist and flavorful skin creates this pocket of perfection, like a breezeway locking in the juices and not allowing the humidity or steam to escape, making the white tender chicken breast inside more moist than The Golden Girls on a double dose of estrogen and progesterone therapy. It&#39;s Colonel Sanders meets H. Salt Esquire Fish-n-Chips. A must!

Next up, the Fenway dog. It&#39;s big. A 1/4 pound dog wrapped in a New England Roll, topped with mustard, relish and onions. I say wrapped, because the steam makes the roll encase the hot dog, forming perfectly to your own hand. The snap of the dog is crisp, I love the fact there is no ketchup in sight and the onions add, not detract, from the beefy flavor. The roll is the same as they use in making New England Lobster rolls, with high sides (to keep the dog corralled) and oozing with egg and butter flavors. It&#39;s soft and tender and at first glance, looks like they cheated you with a heel of Wonder Bread. 

Seriously, if you are in Schaumburg, Chicago you have to find this place...if not for the great food, sports, or incredible service...Do it for the cute servers."

Not a food review. Just stopped with a friend for a beer at the bar after work. Typical local pub type place. Didn&#39;t get food but looked like decent super unhealthy type bar food. Think huge portions nachos, chicken fingers, and french fries. Restaurant full of families and kids sports teams. Place is worn, loud, and dark inside. About what you would expect. Very popular with the locals so you are better off doing carry out for food Fri/Sat night. Bar is full of regulars. After work bros and a lot of old men who look like they never leave. A real sausage fest. Bartenders basically ignore you if not a regular and begrudgingly serve you eventually. It is what it is. If your expectations are set correctly going in, it is just ok. If not, you might be disappointed."

Our waiter wasn&#39;t too attentive, but we ended up ordering an entree of more CHICKEN fingers with fries. The fries were okay, nothing special but the chicken fingers are where it&#39;s at!

In fact, the chicken fingers apparently put Village Tavern on the map. The restaurant was featured on a program called &#34;Chicago&#39;s Best&#34; because of them. On a recent Monday afternoon, I decided to investigate the hype. 

My meal began with a half order of the famed Nachorama. As you can see in the photographs, loads of cheese, black olives, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and beans are piled high on the chips. After ordering nachos in other restaurants, I can tell you no other nachos have measured up to Village Tavern&#39;s. The Nachorama contains all the ingredients you want covering your chips, in abundance. The cheese was thick, gooey, and held everything in place. The chips were tucked throughout the dish. 

After consuming the nacho bomb, I was somewhat full. However, I still had to try the chicken finger platter. The platter consists of six huge, tender, chicken pieces in a crispy batter. Hands down these were the best chicken fingers I have ever had. The batter was non-greasy and the chicken pieces were high quality. What added to this amazing dish was the honey mustard dipping sauce. Both the honey and mustard flavors came through strongly. 

In addition to excellent food, I must commend the attentive waitstaff. The waitresses paced our meal perfectly. As soon as we finished the nachos, the entrees came right out--not a moment too soon. At the end of our meal, everyone needed boxes to bring home leftovers. The waitresses promptly brought out boxes and a large bag for us to take our food home. They even brought me an extra cup of that outstanding honey mustard dipping sauce. The waitstaff was pleasant and responded well to our table, without hovering. I assume they must have good management here. 

Visit Village Tavern on an empty stomach so you can fill up on the amazing grub. This is a great neighborhood place."

It&#39;s been around a long time and it was filled with couples, small groups, families with young children and families with several generations.  Because of how packed it was the service wasn&#39;t attentive, but the food came out fast.  It was also pretty noisy in there...but with &#34;tavern&#34; in the name I wouldn&#39;t expect less.

They have an all-you-can-eat fish fry on Fridays.  We had the chicken strip dinner which was an amazing deal - it came with a crock of soup (even French Onion!), 6 HUGE freshly beer-battered chicken strips, a big cup of honey mustard &amp; a mound of French Fries (you have your choice of potato).  It was enough to feed 3 people!  The fries were perfectly cooked and the chicken strips were the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Two of our friends always order the nachos here to share and OH MY GOODNESS - it was a platter ridiculously MOUNDED with nachos.  It was enough to feed 10 people as a snack or 5 as a meal, in my opinion - so consider yourself warned.

I&#39;m not a smoker &amp; don&#39;t endorse smoking, but if you are an e-cig user be aware...the manager came over and asked our friend who was using her e-cig to please stop using it.  I know businesses have the right to decide if they can be used inside or not and this place has chosen to NOT allow them.  The manager told me it&#39;s because they don&#39;t want it to appear someone is actually smoking &amp; also because a lot of families come there, who don&#39;t appreciate it. Duly noted."

It may be known for the chicken fingers but the great homemade daily specials and staff is what makes this place shine! They&#39;re celebrating their 20th anniversary this year too!

I first learned of VTG when I lived in Carol Stream some 14 years ago. I had never been to this location before seeing them featured on Chicago&#39;s Best TV and then attending a fund raiser for Autism Speaks, here in Schaumburg. That was all it took for me to make the journey here time and time again. The chicken finger salad was my first meal here, loved it. I finished it with the fried cheesecake egg roll desert and have tried the daily specials the rest of my visits. 

My latest experience was this past Mandy-tory Monday, for the filming of Nachorama. (for a feature on WGN morning news, by Marcus Leshock for National Nacho Day) I had the chicken pot pie and black bean soup for lunch. Now the soup would have made a great meal all on it&#39;s own, then you top it off with the best pot pie you&#39;ve ever had. The huge chunks of white meat, the fresh potatoes and vegetable and  then a cracker thin flaky crust, set this dish apart from the rest. I took Mandy, the bartender&#39;s advise and splashed a little Cholula on top of the pot pie. The second half of the dish tasted just as good later that evening. I love that they serve fresh brewed tea.

I know I sampled the Nachorama (2#&#39;s of nacho&#39;s covered in their award wining chili) my first visit here, as there was some friends that had eyes bigger than their bellies. I also made it here for Tuesdays Mom&#39;s Meatloaf and it&#39;s exceptional. I so want to make it back out for their Saturday Rib diner special and I have plans to attend their event for &#34;Operation Christmas Child&#34;, the event is on the 17th of this month. Check it out on their facebook page and plan on bringing in a shoe box of gifts for a needy child. 

The owner J.R. does so much for his community and is so treasured by his employees... such a rare find. Free WiFi is also a plus! They have a great blog too, that keeps you up to date on all their drink and meal deals. And when it comes to sports.... they have more TV&#39;s than you would expect.

Here&#39;s the link to their episode on Chicago&#39;s Best TV &#34;viewers choice&#34;.

How do I even begin to tell y&#39;all how nasty this place is. This is my second or third visit and each time I hoped it was an off day. I mean come on, how do you screw up a hot dog joint. Oh wait I know! By selling hot dogs that taste like IKEA hot dogs! Except IKEA has the decency to charge only 50 cents for one. And speaking of 50 cents, these fools have the audacity to charge 50cents for two cups of WATER! I mean come on. Who does that still?

Let me continue. The fries. I ordered aside of fries and the girl insisted  not to get it because it came with the hotdog. Cool. Trying to save some us some money. I mean they already got the .50 out of me. Wait no... the pocket rape continues. Instead of the cheese fries, she insisted on a side of cheese sauce. Sure why not. Until I looked at the receipt. $1.15 for some dank ass gas station cheese in a 2 ounce cup. $1.15??? Seriously??? Worth maybe 50 cents tops. Anyways. As for the greasy limp dick fries, there may have been about 9 fries on the hot dog. This chick thought 9 fries was gunna be enough for both of us. Not gunna lie, we had to drive to McDonald&#39;s to order some more fries to make use of the$1.15 liquid ear wax cheese. 

Assholes. 

The beef. The signs all over boasted of it so I said why not. She asked what kinda peppers,I said hot and sweet. And dipped. You guessed it 0.55 cents for each pepper. My $6 beef is now over $7. Just to put shit in perspective; the best beef in my opinion is at johnnies. They charge around $4 with no side of bullshit. Oh. When I said dipped, these fuckers held it down in the juice and just soaked it to the point where I had to basically eat it with a fork and knife. Idiots. Dipped doesn&#39;t mean soaked.

I&#39;m not sure how this  place has survived. There are so many better hot dog places in the area. Portillos and buona and gharibaldis offer a much better beef. 

Done with this place. 

And for those who think I&#39;m just being cheap, please note that I don&#39;t mind spending $100 for a decent meal. However when there are culinary and business injustices for shit food, I will call it how I see it. 

See you at IKEA."

This review is solely based on their Italian Beef sandwich. I placed my order for an Italian Beef with giardinera.
Now, Italian Beef is one of my favorite things and I have had them from many spots throughout Chicagoland. 
I received my beef sandwich and parked myself at a table. Now eating an Italian Beef sandwich can be almost like a commitment sometimes that once you pick it up, you&#39;re kind of committed to finish it since it can become somewhat fragile due to the beef juice.
Wow. I have to say that this was one tasty sandwich. The beef was very flavorful, the giardinera was spicy. It was also messy. I&#39;m OK with messy as long as the sandwich is worth it and this one definitely was worth it.
If I am in the area, I will stop back for sure to have another one.

Maybe it was the price, but I gotta say, for the quality of the food (which we indulge in now only about once a month or less), it&#39;s worth it.

Did I say it reminded me of Gene and Jude&#39;s? That&#39;s for good reason... I guess it was started by their daughter and the dogs remain the same!

I&#39;m a lover of both the grilled chicken sandwich and the mini-beef -- the perfect size, and nice and juicy!

And my favorites remain the shakes! You can taste that they are made from real ice cream. Topped with whip cream and a wafer cookie -- perfection!

Service is always good -- they always get it right, and it gets delivered quickly!

So a few years after my first review, I&#39;m as big a fan as ever! One more star for Nana&#39;s!"

We also tried the following:
- Hot dog with everything on it = exceptional. I love the fact that they serve it with fries on the dog. Scrumptious. 

- Chili cheese fries = mouth watering delicious

- Onion rings = awesome batter

- Chicken wings = probably the best chicken wings around. I will definitely order MORE of these next time. 

- Chocolate shake = to die for. 

- Slice of pizza = My son enjoyed it.

They both tasted good but thin dog was lost in the bun and the beef was wet the way I like it but nothing special.  Hand cut greasy fries were good.

After the food truck fest turned out to be a joke we were looking for something close that didn&#39;t have a hour line or limited supply of food. I&#39;m a sucker for a good Chicago dog and figured Nana&#39;s was worth trying since I&#39;m never in this neighborhood. 

I ordered the meal deal with the Nana&#39;s hot dog, mini beef, and drink. The dog is pretty small so don&#39;t be fooled by the fries and the mini beef was alright but could have been more flavorful. I upgraded the drink to a root beer float. I was really in the mood for the chili cheese fries even though they already cram fries on all the dogs to look bigger. Sure, I was really full after, but whatever. I would&#39;ve preferred better chili but it wasn&#39;t bad. A proper hot sauce would probably do it some justice."

Decor: There isn&#39;t much to this place - it&#39;s a bit of a &#34;hole-in-the-wall.&#34; But, as any good Yelper knows, these type of places have the best food! And Nana&#39;s is no different. But I digress... there are a handful of tables and not much to look at on the walls. It is a clean place, well taken care of for sure.
Bathroom: It&#39;s in the back, through the kitchen, but it is clean and inviting.

Staff: While everyone was nice, they were a bit slow (from what I remember). We did not have a complicated order but it still seemed to take awhile for them to make - and there was NOT a big crowd at all.

Food/Drink: The food is classic Chicago hot dog joint fare. They have a little bit of everything but we went with what they do best: hot dogs and beef. The dogs come with fries (some of the BEST around) and the beef was extra juicy. The only thing I was a bit disappointed with is a hot dog with &#34;everything&#34; is not a standard Chicago-style dog - it is lacking several key ingredients. I will remember for next time, however.

Value: The food is cheap for what you get. Great quality and great value!

Having had several people recommend I review this place, I finally made the voyage to Nana&#39;s to try it for myself.

First off let&#39;s go over the hot dog. Nana&#39;s serves a natural casing Vienna Beef dog on a very soft bun. The bun does not have poppy seeds like most Chicago style hot dogs. Pickles, peppers and celery salt do not come standard on the Nana&#39;s dog and because I was unaware of this I failed to ask for a pickle on my hot dog, so I can&#39;t comment on that. But the application of condiments on my hot dog was perfect, the bun was soft with some fry grease soaked in as the fries are bundled in the same wrapper as your hot dog. The sport pepper wasn&#39;t too hot. The relish is sweet and flavorful and the onions were perfect. If you make sure to ask for the optional pickle, peppers and celery salt, the only thing missing from this being a near perfect Chicago style hot dog is the poppy seed bun. This hot dog is absolutely fantastic and stands among the best I&#39;ve found anywhere in the city or suburbs.

I also decided to try the cheeseburger, this was a well grilled masterpiece of flavor on a sesame seed bun. The condiments were applied well and this was just a fountain of wonderful flavor. This is possibly the best fast food burger I&#39;ve ever had. It wasn&#39;t too greasy, but maintained that char grilled flavor that makes a fast food burger great.

The fries included are tasty fresh cut fries, very similar to those served by Gene and Jude&#39;s in River Grove. They are mashed into the hot dog in a similar fashion as well. They&#39;re not too greasy, but what grease does reach the hot dog simply soaks into the bun.

Overall Original Nana&#39;s easily exceeded my expectations, this is one of the top five fast food places I&#39;ve found anywhere. I can&#39;t recommend this place enough!"

Went home to find out that the hamburger only consisted of the bun and a pattie. Not only that but when I called to inform them, they wanted me to drive all the way back to get a new one.  Waste my gas when it was their mistake.  And get this.  They deliver yet didn&#39;t offer that option because even they knew how much of a waste of time,  gas and money that would be.  Something I already dealt with.  If you all want better hot dogs,  Italian Beefs,  and burgers, Portillos is down the street and much better.  Not to mention cleaner."

Its not as it once was, frankly its gone through three major changes since the original family first sold it, and none of them have improved the business, service, and the quality has only gone down.

The latest &#34;remodel&#34; which incorporated a drive through window, also eliminated the customer bathroom.

So, if you need to &#34;go&#34; or just wash your hands, you have to navigate through the kitchen, storage,   and food preparation area to do so.

Although they grill in front of you, and re-fry the fries in front of you, the vast majority is just final assembly in the front.  The prep or pre-prep is all done in the back.

One trip through same, and if you&#39;re wearing your glasses (or if you don&#39;t need glasses, you&#39;re paying attention to what you pass by/through, as well as pay attention to what you have traveled to) I&#39;m thinking you, like me, won&#39;t ever be back.

Bit of a regular of their delivery service, never been to the actual location. I&#39;m a Chicago girl, born &amp; raised &amp; one of the things that I loved about the neighborhoods I grew up in were the hot dog joints. Small corner spots, run by a mom &amp; pop or family situation with delicious food, fresh cut fries &amp; incredibly cheap prices. This was back in the 80s &amp; 90s mind you &amp; its hard to find places in the suburbs that mimic the food or the prices, till Nana&#39;s. The prices are crazy low and there&#39;s no minimum order amount required for delivery! Incredible! No one does that out in these parts so I love that about them. The service is super fast &amp; everything is always hot upon arrival. Their hot dogs are delicious, with a lil give to them if that makes any sense. Just like the old days. I like their slices too, melted cheese with a buttery crust &amp; more than like three pepperoni slices on the actual pepperoni slices. It used to bug me that they placed the fries on top of the dog, so I&#39;d request them on the side, but I actually like it now. And they don&#39;t water down their sodas, major plus!

Woke up one Sunday morning hung over as $hit.  Did not feel like leaving house or cooking to cure my need for greasy carbs.

Even better you can order online ( http://theoriginalnanashotdogs.com/ ) so you know your order is right because its in writing.

My in-laws ate here when they first moved to Streamwood 31 years ago.  And Nana&#39;s is still there on Irving Park Rd. serving up some of the quickest and tastiest hot dogs and fries around.

The decor isn&#39;t much to look at; a high counter, a few tables and booths about, all worn and needing a fresh coat of paint.  BUT, you aren&#39;t here for the decor.  You want a dog!  You want it fast!  And you want it cheap!

All the dogs come with fries, literally.  The dog is covered in fries and then wrapped up tightly in deli paper.  This can be a tad messy so don&#39;t even think about trying to eat one of these in the car.  The fries are fresh and you can watch them put the potatoes in the special do-hickey to cut them up.

They have other traditional dog-joint fare on the menu like pizza puffs, beefs and the like.  They even have those yummy Mexican bottled sodas and GREEN RIVER soda at the fountain.  And if you like their fun retro logo you can even buy a t-shirt :-)"

It&#39;s a little dive place on Irving Park Road. 

Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve had there:

1) Double Dog, Easy Mustard: Great snap. Perfectly steamed!!
2) Fries: Typically, I&#39;m not a fan of handcut fries. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the oil here or what, but their fries are great. Not soggy, not burnt tasting.
3) Chili Dog: Husband claims it&#39;s great.
4) Cheese Pizza: Meh. Was great for my kid after football, I&#39;d like to try it with something on it before I give a full evaluation.
5) Onion Rings: TO DIE FOR.
6) Cheese Sticks: Good, nothing special.
7) Chicken Strips: Good. Can tell it&#39;s real chicken breast.
8) Drink Options: GREEN RIVER and other assorted drinks.
9) Double Cheeseburger: Was pleasantly surprised. It was Great! Next time I&#39;m going to see if I can get a Bacon Cheesburger!

Speed of delivery is average. But what stands out are the grill guys. These dudes are workhorses. If there was a lull in walk in traffic -- they were cutting fries. They were constantly working hard. And they make great food!

My husband wanted a triple cheeseburger (which he has gotten there before. We pay a little extra, but it&#39;s what he wants.) The cashier (who I assume was the manager) told us &#34;no, but you can get a double and a single&#34;. Well sir... I don&#39;t want the bun or the condiments. All I want is an extra patty and piece of cheese. That was b.s. I&#39;m also not crazy about the fact that they lump the fries in with the hotdogs. What would be the big deal about putting them in a different bag? Also the fried mushrooms are mushy, and the fries could be a little crispier. All in all... I wouldn&#39;t go back that often. I think I&#39;ll go to Portillo&#39;s instead. (Past review)

(New review) I liked their facebook page and posted the same complaint. A couple hours after posting this and posting on their facebook page,  I received a comment back. They apologized and said on my next visit to ask for the manager and they would fix this. Also they would be happy to make a triple cheeseburger! Now that is what I call customer service. I have changed my review to reflect how happy I am! Now I definitely will be returning to Nana&#39;s! Also about the fries....

The fries are great, they are press cut in front of you, and twice fried for the perfect taste.

I live in Streamwood.  I want to love this place.  Why do they make it so hard for me?

I keep giving them second chances and they keep blowing it.  First off, who sells hot dogs in the greater Chicagoland area and doesn&#39;t make them Chicago style by default???  Why do I have to request Chicago style and why do they still get it wrong?  So I changed my approach and asked for each item individually.  How do grilled onions make their way on a Chicago style dog?  Why can&#39;t I get a pickle and why are there no poppyseeds on the buns?  The cashiers are high school kids who are more interested in doing anything but helping you, which I can live with, but can I just get a hot dog the way I want it?  Chicago style, people.

The fries by themselves are great and clearly freshly cut everyday. 

The hot dog is also as good as a portillos dog I would say. Nice juicy pop when u bite into them.

Easy to find right off Irving Park Rd. I had my first dog from NaNa&#39;s in 1974.

I remember the day well, my father asked what I wanted on my hot Dog and I replied, &#34;I want a hamburger&#34;. Dad ordered me hot dog with mustard, relish and onions - The NaNa&#39;s STD dog. In fact, for a long time that was all that was offered as far as toppings, kind of like Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s. Nowadays, you can get it with ketchup, sport peppers and celery salt if you like. My advice for those who enjoy  ketchup on your dog, order two and try one with mustard, relish, onions (add sport peppers if you like&#39;em). The fries are heavenly, served right on top of the dog. Its o.k., just move the fries off of the dog but make sure to leave a few on top, trust me. French fries are fresh cut and blanched first, which is really the best way to cook fresh cut fries.

 I know everyone in Chicago thinks Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s is the bomb but I have had both. Nana&#39;s dogs have the same snap to the hot dog when you bite into it - essential for the true Chi-town dog! I grew up with NaNa&#39;s and I have been tellin&#39; everyone about it for years. Now I&#39;m yelpin&#39; it - NaNa&#39;s is simple, original, consistent and still there after all these years. My kids love it too! Beefs, gyros and pizza too.

Somewhat small but clean interior. Plenty of seating at 12:30 on a Tuesday.

I got the original dog, which is mustard, onions and relish and comes with fresh cut fries. They put the fries on top of the dog and wrap it all up, which was a bit odd and left a few fries intertwined with the dog.

I wasn&#39;t a fan of the fries. I like natural cut, but these were just a bit too soggy for me (I like crispy fries, but the flavor of these was good, just not crispy enough).

The dog was very good. A bit heavy on the onions, and nowhere close to Burney&#39;s in Auburn, CA, but tasty enough.

They recently started to sell pizza which i have not tried but it looks real good. The place is cheap and nearly as good as it can get, i reserve one star simply because i have had better else where but only downtown Chicago, so please if you are in the are do not hesitate to stop here~Donovan"

First- they stopped serving the giant pizza slices.  Then I ordered a few dogs- and the bun was the weakest of quality as the dog sank right through.  We ate there - so it wasn&#39;t as if the hot dog was steaming in the bun for 15 minutes.  Also- its a million degrees in there! turn on the AC

Well, thankfully I did at Nana&#39;s.  Don&#39;t have to worry about driving an hour plus now to get a great hot dog!  Love the options they give on their value meals and the rest of their menu looks solid.  I can&#39;t attest to the taste though because when I am there, its for one thing:  the dogs!

As a side note, the Gi-nana-mous pizza slice they are advertising are the real deal.  Seriously, I have never seen a slice that big before!"

First up they added pizza to their menus. The slices are huge and cheap! Are the best in the world? Not really but they are pretty good. One slice could probably feed to average adult eaters.

They also started a Facebook page and if you add them you can get a free slice of pizza or a free hot dog!

If your a fan of Gene &amp; Judes, their hotdogs are similar in style and also on how they wrap it up. The dogs are wrapped with fries on top. If you ask they can put the fries on the side for you. The fries are cut fresh from real potatoes not the frozen stuff you may find at some places. The have the potato slicers mounted on their wall and you can see them slice them when they are low on fries. Unlike Gene &amp;Jude you can add ketchup to your dogs here! Sacrilege! 

It appears as if they might have picked up on their customer service and freshness of their food or perhaps they started reading yelp or other review sites and took to heart what people have to say. In any case, it&#39;s good for us and good for them!"

The Nana&#39;s style dog is a Vienna beef dog, steamed bun, onions, sweet relish, mustard, sport peppers, and is topped w/ a whole lot of fries.The dogs themselves had that heavenly snap that no hot dog should be w/out. The combo is pretty close to perfect. The only thing that I wasn&#39;t too impressed w/ was the fries. It&#39;s probably just my preference though. They were fresh cut and hot which is awesome, but for some reason a lot of them were over fried. If you can&#39;t make it to gene and judes, this place isn&#39;t a terrible alternative."

I visited more frequently when I used to live in Streamwood, but now that I have moved and I am a little more conscious about eating junk food, I save Nana&#39;s for special occasions.

Those occasions are when I just need to have the best dogs, burgers, beefs, fries, and malts!

Nana&#39;s is a small place decorated in the traditional yellow and red scheme.  The private parking lot is plenty big in proportion to the tiny amount of seating inside.  They do a lot of takeout business.  I like my stuff hot and fresh, so I tend to eat in.

Walking in the door puts you right in front of the counter where you can order your food.  Be aware of the definitions of &#34;everything&#34; which are posted on the wall for hot dogs and hamburgers.  Nana&#39;s definitions may be different than yours.  It&#39;s no big deal though, because they will do the toppings any way you like, you just may have to say something other than &#34;everything&#34;.  They conveniently accept credit cards too.

After ordering you can mill around in front of the counter waiting for your order or go pick one of the hard surface booth seats.  I think there are about 6 four seaters  and 2 two seaters.
A few minutes after you order someone will announce in a half mumble as they set some food on top of the counter down from where you ordered.  This may or may not be your food depending on how many people were ordering. Also depending on what you ordered, it may not be complete.  This usually happens when I order malts which take longer to make.  So keep an eye and an ear out and eventually you will get everything.  On the way back to your table, be sure to grab ketchup, mustard and napkins from the counter as there are none on the table.

So finally I get to the food.   I love that the hot dogs have that &#34;snap&#34; to them from the old fashioned casings.  I love the fresh cut fries, which they make by pushing a whole potato, skin and all through the cutter and right into the fryer.  What I am not as fond of is that when I order a hotdog, they serve the fries and dog wrapped together.  This tends to make everything a little too soggy.  I also get the Italian beef and the combo occasionally.  Very tasty and soaked and au jus as it should be.  The final belly buster that I can never resist are the malts.  They are big, thick and delicious.  They are topped with whipped cream and a wafer cookie.  Practically a meal in themselves, we always get two just because I cannot decide on what flavor I want.  The banana and chocolate are my two favorites.
They do a lot of promotion around the Gi-Nana-mous pizza slices, but I have never had one.  Having seen them on display, I am not even tempted.  They are huge, but it just looks like standard fast food pizza.

Overall, I like Nana&#39;s for what it is.  There is no service or ambiance to love, but that is not why I come here.  This is the way fast food is supposed to be... the way it was before the corporations refined it into a terrible cookie cutter experience of bland food.
As long as I can still look down and see my shoes, I will be back to Nana&#39;s for my fast food fix."

Portillo&#39;s, sure, but never this little shack on Irving Park. Every couple of months we&#39;d get a flyer for them slapped to our door but it wasn&#39;t until tonight when the boy told us he wanted a hot dog that we decided to stop by. I&#39;m not going to lie, it&#39;s really about as generic a hot dog joint as they come. On a scale of &#34;U Dawg U&#34; to &#34;Hot Doug&#39;s&#34; I would say Nana rates about a... wait, that is a really bad methodology. Nana&#39;s was ok.

The hot dogs were decent, all beef as those are the only kinds I&#39;ll eat. Let the heathens enjoy their pig&#39;s lips and assholes, I&#39;ll stick to moo cow. The fries as reported are fresh and made from real potatoes, then fried and crammed in with the hot dogs which is a nice touch. However, they lacked any seasoning - not even salt - so that was kinda unforgivable. 

My wife ordered a mini Italian Beef. It was laughably small, on par with a Taste Portion™ you&#39;d get at the Taste of Chicago. Given that, it wasn&#39;t awful but it wasn&#39;t too great either. Once again, just ok. 

All in all we&#39;ll probably get Nana&#39;s again when we don&#39;t feel like taking out a line of equity to go to Portillo&#39;s and if you&#39;re looking for a middle of the road hot dog shack for a quick bite, Nana&#39;s is probably make you happy."

My husband and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night, and were greeted by the restaurant owner, who was very friendly. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the wonderful weather.

We started off with some warm fresh bread that was served with some garlic butter and an olive tapenade. It was delicious! We got the fried calamari (off the specialties menu), which was probably one of the best I&#39;ve had. For the main course, I chose the Black Pasta (a popular dish recommended by our waiter), and my husband chose a veal dish that was off the specialties menu. Both were very tasty. The Black Pasta was black angel hair served with sauteed shrimp, scallops, red &amp; green peppers, and mushroom. It was very rich and the shrimp and scallops were cooked to perfection.

Waste of my money. Anyway nothing good restaurant in downtown Arlington heights anyway. There is only good atmosphere.
But waiters were nice so I gave them good tip and 2 stars. Otherwise 1.

Added, they proudly serve squid ink pasta. But please, if you serve this, please learn how to cook this pasta. They cook with cream sauce and squid ink pasta was over cooked angel hair pasta. The restaurant owner or chef doesn&#39;t know how to serve this type of pasta at all. 
Seafood tomato sauce pasta...... it just shows only how it looks good and taste nothing. They put few big clams which is unnecessary to use it for this type of pasta. Pasta was soggy.....

People who give good review about this place, they probably don&#39;t know what is good Italian restaurant about. Well, sometimes restaurant follows customers needs, so they probably serve what is the customers like. And someone said people who give bad review about this restaurant is Olive Garden lovers type of crap. But I am sorry honey, I hate their food and I don&#39;t include Olive Garden is as Italian food.

We wanted great italian dinning experience in the suburbs, and ended up here. So disappointing.

We walk in around 8-8:30 on a Saturday, the place is crowded; we think its a good sign. We get seated in the little nook, service was just okay. The waiter seemed uninterested in us and making small talk, just did his minimal duties - which is fine, I get it. Not every night can be your star performance. We felt like the menu was very limited in selection. 

The pre-dinner bread and butter garlic was a cool start. But I wish the bread was warmed up or toasted or something- but alas I will survive. 

We also had unexpected guests dinning with us... ANTS, ants were crawling all over the wall next to us- disgusting. 

The food was greasy, bland and terrible. I ordered the chicken, and my boyfriend ordered a pasta dish. We both did not finish our food due to how bad it was, this says alot, because we never leave food behind! The side potatoes were discolored and just drenched in oil- unappetizing.

Our meal began with our hosts pushing in our seats for us and pouring our water.  Warm bread with some kind of olive/garlic tapanade as well as garlic butter quickly followed, so we were already off to a good start.

The two of us split &#34;La Bella&#34; salad, featuring arugula, pears, figs, goat cheese and cranberries in a citrus vinaigrette dressing.  It was every bit as good as it sounds!  We then split the mussels and clams appetizer for our entree.  They brought each of these dishes to our table already split into two plates for us, which was greatly appreciated.  Between the salad, seafood, and never-ending bread, by the end of the meal we were full and satisfied.  Everything was excellent; the only criticism I can offer is that the angel hair spaghetti with the seafood seemed overcooked, and I feel like any legit Italian place should be able to get that al dente texture right.  So I can&#39;t vouch for the pasta, but otherwise we were thrilled with our main dishes.

I&#39;m confused by some of the reviews below because the service was SUPER personable and friendly.  You could tell that the owners remembered their regulars and it constantly seemed like a reunion of old friends anytime patrons entered the doorway.  And even though I had never been here before, I had no sense of neglect.  Everyone was super friendly!  Moreover, every single member of the staff was attentive and buzzing about, serving or cleaning or otherwise just providing a great experience for guests.

The atmosphere is very quaint. There is one TV by the bar (they had soccer on when we came in). There are a few platters on the wall honoring VIP/long-time loyal customers. You can also see one of the chefs making the ravioli/pasta by hand. It looks so yummy!

When you first sit down, you will be greeted with fresh, warm bread with garlic herb butter and  an olive tapenade. Eat it. All of it. It&#39;s so good!! I had to stop myself because I didn&#39;t want to ruin my appetite. The menu features a variety of pastas, chicken, veal, and fish. I had the penne farcita and was not disappointed! My friend had the chicken parmesan and it was huge!! Probably the biggest chicken parm I have ever seen. So, it&#39;s worth the money.

We left very full, so we did not get dessert. However, they all looked amazing, and if I were to go back I would order the espresso brulee. Or the tiramisu, because you can&#39;t go wrong with that.

They have a nice wine list as well. They have a house wine in almost every traditional variety for $8.50 that is actually very good. 

Also, they had free butter cookies to eat on your way out! I wish every place gave me a cookie just for coming in. Awesome!"

It started off with bread that was extremely hard, almost like it had been sitting out.  We then were given salads &#34;on the house&#34; that had dressing that tasted like caesar gone wrong.  Almost all you could taste was anchovies.

Finally, the meals came and things got worse.  We ordered spinach raviolI that was very undercooked and super salty.  The spaghetti and meatballs tasted like they were frozen and the pasta was not fresh. Also both entrees were very greasy.

Overall,  I would recommend Maggianos in Schaumburg or Giacomos in Des Planes if you want good Italian food."

I made a reservation online and I got a personal email back saying they couldn&#39;t wait to have us which I thought was so cool!!  and strange haha

Appetizer: fried calamari. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s in here but I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. The fried calamari comes on a bed of salad. The flavoring of the salad is so good.. I could probably eat this dish as my entree but the menu is too delicious to just eat appetizer  

Entree: I&#39;ve had the black pasta and gnocchi di casa. The sauce for the black pasta is SO GOOD. I didn&#39;t really like their gnocchi dish bc the sauce tasted greasy and fatty but I loved the gnocchi. On my 2nd visit, I requested the gnocchi but with the black pasta sauce and they were more than willing to accommodate. 

My friends had the spaghetti and meatball which i thought was also really good. I also tried their penna farcita and did not enjoy that dish at all. :(

Knocking off a star bc on my 2nd visit here everything tasted SUPER salty and my salad was SUPER greasy. Guess the chefs were different. I&#39;ll just assume it was an off day bc I still want to go back some time again. Just request them to go easy on the salt and grease.

We&#39;re talking to a coworker who mentioned how good this place&#39;s ITALIAN food is, and we decided to give it another try.  Well I&#39;ve been there twice and I still can&#39;t get past ordering the spaghetti and meat balls.  It they weren&#39;t so good, I&#39;d try something else. :-)  The first time we went we ordered dessert and they brought around complementary after dinner drinks like brandy, burbon and many others.  This time we skipped dessert and getting the free drink.  Even though I had spaghetti and meatballs, the two other people I was with ordered filets and it looked so good I just had to try it.  I&#39;m a big filet guy and I have to say I&#39;d put that filet up against ANY filet I&#39;ve eaten, including ones at Ruth&#39;s Chris, Mortons, and Gibsons.  With 2 filets, 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers and spaghetti the bill came to around $45 per person without tip."

Then I went to the restroom, my gf asked for the wine menu and was told to wait until I got back. Then after choosing what wine she wanted, was asked for an ID after showing it was told it didn&#39;t look like her and and he needed to see something else to make sure it was her. Then after waiting for about 30-40 minutes was finally able to get the servers attention to order...and I&#39;ve worked in a restaurant for many years mostly back of the house but also front work as well and as we were seated inside there was barely any tables that our server had. Then we made the server aware that my gf had a severe shellfish allergy and after rolling his eyes at her when she said that...even though she ordered a chicken pasta dish with no shellfish in it. The food came to the table and asked the runner if they made sure no shellfish touched or was near it and they said yes it was prepared totally separate...food tasted amazing but about 10 min after my gf starting to eat her food her mouth felt really tingly and swollen...the only plus to this experience was obviously the server could tell we were dissatisfied and brought is free dessert.
After having to go to the emergency room afterwards and be there all night because of the lack of care provided, kinda makes me disgusted to say that I&#39;m a chef, very severe allergy not to be taken lightly and it was just not cared about at all...no manager to talk too at all. I would mention the servers name but never once did he introduce himself or tell us his name during the whole time being there. Service was terrible, never recommend this place to anyone. My gf called the next day to tell them that this had happened and found out our server was actually the manager there...and he was just as rude to her about it as he was at the restaurant ...horrible place"

Our reservations were 100% successful on a busy Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting despite a packed house. Our open table didn&#39;t go to a walk in.  

Service was exceptional. Not too much; not too little.  We had all the water, bread, etc. that we wanted.  Our wine glasses were topped up. When we gals said no more wine (designated drivers), the waiter remembered and only the guys got vino.  We were able to take our time ordering throughout.  No rush to push us out the door after. 

The food was delicious as always.  Of special note was a filet mignon and veal meatball spaghetti topped with exceptional bolognese sauce.   It was on the specials menu and it blew one of our guests away.  The other guest had the mushroom and sausage risotto topped with goat cheese.  She said the layers of flavors and textures were amazing. 

We all loved the bread that came out with house made green olive tapenade and herbed butter.  Yummy!!!!

The only thing that gets me is the wine list is all lower range wines.  $10 wine for $40.  No midrange or better wines."

Bread awesome, wine good.  Shrimp salad was solid, steak was bland but cooked exactly as ordered.  Had sauce on side, it definitely needed it.  Lava cake was the best part of meal. Service was slow, it was friday and they had 50 person wedding party inside."

I even tried to pop in for lunch one day and that was a major fail (they only offer dinner service!). My expectations were met with solid service, an inviting atmosphere and, most importantly, pretty delicious Italian eats. 

Let me preface my review experience by stating that hubs and I made my birthday reservation here on the night of a very important Blackhawks game. We&#39;re not huge Hawks fans, but I knew the (from what I&#39;ve heard) intimate setting of this restaurant would likely be altered significantly because of said game. And while it certainly wasn&#39;t a sports bar feel, I imagine it was brighter, louder, and hosted much more TV attention than the typical Saturday night. 

All that being said, Carlos &amp; Carlos is adorably quaint. We sat practically smack dab in the middle of the restaurant and started by launching ourselves into the delicious fresh (warm) bread and garlicky whipped butter. Please and thank you. 

Our server was swift but friendly, offering his take on a variety of their Italian classics as well as some specials of the evening. We went with the scallop appetizer and since I couldn&#39;t quite make up my mind he offered to let me order halfsies on the two pastas I was mulling over. Here&#39;s a quick rundown of the dishes I tried...

Scallops Pistachio: 4/5: Three small scallops nicely seared with an awesome mango roasted pepper sauce. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the cold cauliflower &#34;hill&#34; in the middle but the main attraction (scallops) were great. 

Risotto Gamberi: 3.5/5: Arborio served w/ prawns, shaved garlic, fresh tomatoes, spinach, and touch of terragon. A solid risotto dish but I felt it could have used a kick - red pepper, heat, something. 

Gnocchi Di Casa: 5/5: Pillowy homemade gnocchi served with small chunks of fillet mignon, broccoli, shaved garlic, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms in a olive oil sauce. Fantastico. 

Veal chop: 5/5: Hubs ordered this as a special and it was pounded thin, and lightly fried to crispy but tender perfection. 

Chocolate cake: 5/5: Decadent mousse-like chocolate cake with a heavy hand (appreciated) of fresh whipped cream on top and a drizzle of raspberry. 

Apple turnover/pastry/pie: 5/5: So much cinnamon, so much apple, so much sugar. Plus ice cream. You cannot go wrong. 

I definitely want to come back to Carlos &amp; Carlos during a non-Chicago sporting event night to get the full experience...and imbibe from their famous drink cart!"

I ordered the spinach ravioli and it really lacked flavor..except for salt. The sauce was terrible, the pasta seemed fresh but had no taste. My friends seafood pasta dish was disappointing as well.

Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

Have I mentioned I like the place? It&#39;s my new favorite. It&#39;s in Downtown Arlington Heights, and it&#39;s amazing. Part of me doesn&#39;t want to share it with you. I should tell you how awful it is, so that I can keep it to myself. But it&#39;s not. Its a delicious party in your mouth that will keep you coming back for more. 

The front of the building and entry are very understated. But the inside of the restaurant is beautiful! It&#39;s very classy, but the dress-code is casual. I&#39;m sure on a  Saturday night it&#39;s probably a little nicer than &#34;casual&#34;, but i&#39;ve been twice on weeknights and we wore  jeans, and didn&#39;t feel out of place. 

They have delicious fresh bread, but that&#39;s not the best part of it. They&#39;ve got this herb/garlic butter spread that is just amazing. YUM YUM YUM. It&#39;s the kind of thing that you crave. It&#39;s the kind of thing that at 3 o&#39;clock on a Thursday you think to yourself &#34;Damn, i could go for some of that bread and butter right now&#34;. 

Rumor has it they make their own pasta on a daily basis, and I have to tell you it is just to die for. There is SUCH a HUGE difference in the pasta we all use to cook, and the fresh pasta that they use here. The texture itself even stands out.  But once you put it in your mouth, you&#39;ll never want standard pasta again. Nor should you, when something this delicious is available to you!

The first time I went, it was suggested to me to try their Spaghetti and Meatballs, even though it&#39;s not on the menu. So I did. And it was so delicious. I&#39;d literally been craving it ever since the first time I went. So I went back a couple nights ago to get it again. It&#39;s phenomenal, and I highly recommend it. 

The place is kind-of small, quaint I should say. So if they take reservations on the weekend - I&#39;d be sure to call ahead. They&#39;ve got a full bar. The service has been great. All the servers there have been very friendly and helpful. They even remembered us when we walked in after having only been there once before! The prices are very fair. 

HIGHLY recommend this place. Can&#39;t say enough good about it. I hope they are very successful and that they are here to stay."

There of course is the food and drink and there is also what I like to call the &#34;experience&#34;. Most people know if they have been served a good meal, but many times the &#34;experience&#34; is what we remember the most.

Our &#34;experience&#34; at Carlos &amp; Carlos was very enjoyable- we were greeted and seated quickly, everyone that we came in contact with smiled, seemed to be enjoying themselves and also made us feel very welcomed. It was almost like being invited to someone&#39;s home for a special occasion.

That having been said- we enjoyed everything that we ordered, but I wanted to mention two things in particular. I ordered the Linguine Pescatore which was served in a wonderful tomato-based sauce. The Linguine was cooked just the way I like it and the seafood was well done as well. Trust me if you enjoy seafood that this is a great dish to order and enjoy.

Second- we don&#39;t often order dessert, but when our server brought out the sample dessert tray, we couldn&#39;t help ourselves. There were at least a dozen lovely choices on the tray plus a number of ice creams and sherbets also. We ordered the Pistachio gelato which was more than enough to share. We both thought it was very tasty and was served with a vanilla wafer cookie.

A small thing to mention- We were seated in the back area away from the bar and the main dining area. I felt that there was more space between the tables in this area and certainly less overall activity than in the main dining space. If you are looking for a more intimate and quiet place to dine, I would suggest that you ask when checking in to be seated in this back area.

Overall we had a great meal before going to our show at the nearby Metropolis theatre; I&#39;d encourage you to give Carlos &amp; Carlos a try the next time you are looking for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience."

But when they are not your typical highly rated foodie destination and still deliver, that&#39;s when you know you&#39;re on to something special.  

We arrived without a reservation and were seated immediately. Although the menus and the wine list seemed a bit tired looking, no matter. The bread was hot and crusty. The butter perfect consistency. The olive spread just right.

The owner came by and suggested the Grigilata di Mare, which is a spectacular seafood dish with sauteed peppers and tomatoes over pasta. It was perfect. 

They provide you with a selection of complementary after dinner drinks and a selection of excellent desserts.

We felt lucky to have stumbled upon this place. The food was fabulous and the prices very reasonable."

My husband loves the spaghetti and meatballs and grigliata di mare. I usually order the chicken ravioli, risotto or penne farcita. Really you can&#39;t go wrong with anything on their menu. They also have a wonderful assortment of desserts to choose from after dinner.

My spinach salad tasted like the dressing was made from chicken stock.

There were two bones in my chicken breasts in my Pollo Piccata (lemon chicken) and overall, the dish was meh.

Instead of a loaf of soft, warm Italian bread, both loaves were crunchy (inside).

Tiramisu was like a Tiramisu-flavored cake. Didn&#39;t appear to have ladyfingers. 

I really can&#39;t stand the way Carlos &amp; Carlos does their checks. 

Most restaurants will print out a white slip with the price of each item...itemized. 

At Carlos &amp; Carlos, you get the actual waiter&#39;s ticket with cash register prices in a column and not the best sense of what each price represents from your meal. 

So, best advice is to never go here if you plan on splitting a check among two or more people. Would have to be separate checks for all payers."

Recently tried this place for the first time.  We came with a party of five for a reservation on a Wednesday night based on the recommendations here on Yelp.

We made reservations early in the day and they were answered fairly promptly by e-mail and phone with responses that were almost a little over the top flowery, but nice.  

Unfortunately, once we arrived that service didn&#39;t quite hold up with a waiter who, while friendly, did not seem particularly knowledgeable or attentive.  He also seemed to have some trouble understanding even basic requests about the wine list or wanting more bread.  In addition, the restaurant was not particularly busy but the food still took quite a while to arrive.

The food itself was quite good, I had the chicken picatta which was delicately balanced without too much acidity or too much oil.  Our table also had the steak, which was perfectly cooked; the minestrone, which was also well balanced with fresh vegetables but not overloaded; and the tilapia special, which while a bit fishy for my taste was perfect for the person who ordered.

The table bread was also notably good with a perfect yeasty taste that smacked of home freshness.

For dessert we had the cannoli which was again well made.  It hit the spot for our whole table who prefer slightly less sweet desserts and a crunchy shell for a cannoli.  The only item that wasn&#39;t up to par was the carrot cake.  It had a nice dense cake body but a bizarre and terribly unappealing frosting which had the addition of garlic that just permeated in through every bite and out your nose.

Aside from the service, which may have just been our experience according to other reviews, the food really was worth the stop if you&#39;re looking for good Italian."

She walked us outside and sat us down at one of the 2 available tables.... Without menus. So my fiancé and I figured the server would just come by or even bus boy with menus immediately. Nope, that&#39;s not the cause. Waited 15 minutes for menus , server came by with them.  Which then we are slowly realizing that the entire patio has only 1 server. We were handed the menus and started overlooking them. Another 10 minutes go by and the server comes back, we order the Beef Carpachio. Thankfully food arrived within the next 10 minutes... But the server? We finished the beef Carpachio and we never saw the server again. While the fiancé and I are discussing if we should even bother staying, the lady (owner/maybe manager/ hostess) grabs a glass of wine and sits with the table directly behind us. How does this woman seriously not noticed that the restaurant is backed up? Instead, she&#39;s drinking with another table. It felt like an episode where Gordon Ramsay comes out with cameras and says &#34;THIS IS WHAT YOU DONT DO&#34;, except.. Gordon never came out. Immediately when we saw this, we knew we were going to go somewhere else because that is plain ridiculous. Waited another 15 minutes for the server to come back, we told him we were done here and we would like the check. We paid the check and left and now we are next door at Magos getting 100x better service. Never again will we step foot in Carlos and Carlos."

The service was fantastic and so was the food. The moment my boyfriend and I got there we were served fresh bread with butter and garlic. I ordered the gnocchi and he ordered the veal- can&#39;t go wrong with those orders!

The owner came to our table multiple times to see if we needed anything else and make sure we were satisfied. He was super nice. 

This will now be a go to Italian restaurant for us!"

Carlos is the perfect host and makes guests feel welcome with attentive and gracious service that is never rushed, making for a relaxing dining experience. It is a place where you are meant to linger over a meal. The food is outstanding, with well-prepared steaks, and fish as well as pasta made on site. Some favorites are the osso bucco, the salmon, the spaghetti Bolognese and the gnocchi with beef tenderloin. The atmosphere is a nice combination of intimate and lively. They&#39;ve recommended some great wines to us and we&#39;ve enjoyed finishing our meal with something from the dessert and aperitif carts."

We shared grilled calamari and the LaBella salad. Both were delicious. The main course was off the special menu that night. Stuffed Veal served with mashed potatoes and broccoli and Ziti with seafood. Bothe dishes tasted excellent. After looking over the tray of 6 or 7 desserts we split the chocolate lava cake. Awesome!

We had a reservation for 5:00 turned out to be opening time.  When we got there we found that they had forgotten to unlock the front door. After waiting about 10 minutes I called the number on the front window and informed them of the situation.  The door was opened a little more slowly than I expected, but we got in and had our pick of tables. 

Once seated drinks and warm bread were provided.  We ordered the Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer.  It was very good.  For my entree I ordered the Black Pasta: black angel hair pasta, shrimp, scallops, red and green bell peppers, mushrooms and a delicious sauce.  She ordered Linguini Pescatore, also with shrimp and scallops, plus mussels and garlic in a marinara sauce.  As a single shared side we ordered the grilled asparagus with hollandaise; a great tasty choice.  Then we finished up with the chocolate lava volcano dessert.  Every dessert on the tray looked so good I wish we could have ordered them all.

Aside from the door hiccup at first, the service was impeccable.  We never had an empty glass or had dirty dishes hanging around the table for long. I think that every employee in the place stopped by the table at least once to take care of us (aside from the chef).  Carlos even stopped over to close the blinds since the sun was coming into my eyes and greeted me with a shoulder rub. Overall it was a great choice for our anniversary dinner, and we will definitely be going back again.

Collateral info:  The restaurant is next to a small park where concerts are hosted on Thursday and Friday nights.  It is just across the street from a free parking garage, and centrally located in downtown Arlington Heights."

They had a huge selection for the specials of the day so that&#39;s what we went with. I couldn&#39;t believe the bill when I saw it, I swear if we were in the city it would have been so much more for the quality of food we had. To top it off, the food was perfect and I&#39;m not normally a fan of Italian so it speaks volumes. If you order cocktails, they have them ready for you ridiculously fast!"

Came here with a friend who lives in the area who suggested dinner at Carlos&amp;Carlos. Typically, I am not a gal who likes Italian restaurants. Perhaps it is my dislike for pasta and heavy tomato sauces? However, this place is the exception. 

The place is quaint and you would probably walk past it since there isn&#39;t a giant sign. The decor is cute and cozy. The menu isn&#39;t extensive nor is it loaded with a crazy amount of different pastas.  The waiters bring some herbed butter and an olive tapenade that is to die for! Seriously, I had to stop my self from eating all of the tapenade....it is that good! The butter you can take a pass on...but eat that tapenade!!!  

I ordered the rack of lamb and my friend ordered the talapia and pasta. The rack of lamb was more of a medium than a medium rare. However, it was delicious and juicy. I had a bite of my friend&#39;s dish, which also was pretty damn good too! The only downside is that you have a million waiters taking your orders or checking up on you. After a while you forget who your waiter is. At least my water glass and drinks were never empty = )"

Called last minute and Carlos fit us in! The bread and butter they have is amazing. We had the fried calamari shrimp and scallop appetizer which unfortunately was just okay. Tasted like frozen seafood. No worries though because our meals were so good that it made up for it! I had the black pasta which was outstanding and my boyfriend has the linguine pescatore. Carlos is by far one of the best owners. He greets every single person that walks in the door and talks to his guest. He even sent us to the bar after dinner for a drink on him!

Quickly ordered a bottle of wine, appetizer and entrees to be considerate of our late arrival. The bread was fresh and warm. Crab cakes were O.K. The rack of lamb was amazing. She got the risotto which was good but a little overly salted. Overall a great experience, the owner is usually there and makes an effort to make sure you have a great experience and did so last night. The service is the star of this place.

Food - ok, spaghetti and meatballs were tasty, so was the veal Carlos. The fritto misto was just ok as was the flan.

Service - not great. We felt rushed from the moment we sat down. The server didn&#39;t seem very happy to be working. They also made us keep the same silverware for our main course after using it for our appetizer. Not a huge deal but one of my pet peeves.

The reason I&#39;m giving 2 stars is due to the terrible service.  I&#39;ve been here 3 times in the last 6 months, with the 3rd time being tonight.   I always come back thinking maybe this time will be different (benefit of the doubt), but tonight solidified in my mind that the service is just going to be bad forever.   Each time I&#39;ve been there there&#39;s a tense feeling in the place, largely in part to it being seemingly overbooked, and long lines of frustrated customers waiting to be seated for past-due reservations.  It is always chaotic inside (loud and overcrowded).  Sometimes when it&#39;s so busy they will try to rush you through a meal in order to get the next group seated, but this time it was unbearably slow.  We were seated for 20 minutes before we got menus (only because I had to ask for them), and we were there for over 2 hours only because it took so long to get our food.  It would have made it more bearable if someone was coming by every once in a while to refill drinks, but any time we needed anything we had to go find our waiter, or sometimes someone else if the waiter was nowhere to be seen after 5 minutes.  My advice to Carlos y Carlos is PLEASE either avoid overbooking, or hire more wait staff!   When the food is good, it&#39;s a shame for a reputation to be ruined because you feel stressed when you arrive, and when you leave."

I and two friends had a 6pm reservation on a Saturday night. My friends had eaten here once before, and had a good experience. This was a new place to me.

Arlington Heights is not exactly terra incognita for me, but it&#39;s not familiar territory either. This downtown area seems to be full of restaurants, including Carlos &amp; Carlos, which is Italian food. I did wonder why it wasn&#39;t called Carlo &amp; Carlo, which sounds more Italian to me, but hey, whatever works, right? It&#39;s not a Mexican restaurant.

The bar is on the left when you enter. It was already half full when we arrived. From the time we came in, we were very well served. They offered to take out coats. We said no, since we were three people sitting at a four-top. Someone hung my coat on the empty chair. I was last to sit down, and then he took the cloth napkin, unfolded it, and placed it on my lap. This could be because I look older than the other members of our party, though, and he wasn&#39;t sure I was capable of doing things for myself.

We had water, hot bread, and an herbed butter and an olive tapenade within 10 seconds of sitting down. The butter was fine; nothing special. I did like the olive tapenade very much. My friends dug into it too. 

The house wines by the glass were all $9. One friend had chardonnay, and I had the pinot noir. We were both very happy with our choices. The third person just ordered a Bud Light. What can I tell you - he&#39;s a nice man, so we let him come with us. 

We had the La Bella, Caprese and Roasted Beet salads. All were good. The Roasted Beet was mine, and I thought it was absolutely delicious. I&#39;d order it again in a heartbeat.

For the entrees, one friend had a special Seafood Risotto; the Bud Light man had Chicken Vesuvio; and I had the Penne Amatriciana. I thought the pasta was good, but it sure didn&#39;t wow me. Frankly, it was a disappointment. The leftovers tasted better to me for lunch the next day. The other two were very happy with their entrees.

All the pastas are made fresh in-house. When the waiter gave us the menus, he told us that everything is cooked to order, so they could accommodate any special requests. That&#39;s very nice. 

We had cappuccinos and coffee afterward. That was just fine, too. No dessert; we were too full.

This is a very popular place on Saturday night. By 6:30pm, there were at least 20 people waiting by the entrance and the bar. At least. We were patting ourselves on the back for making an early reservation.

We parked in the parking structure about a block away. Again, we were happy we&#39;d decided to come early. Three cars were jockeying for our space. Be aware that the later you come, parking might get tight here.

All in all, it was a very good experience. I would go again."

They accept reservations with no concept of if they will have a table.  Had a reservation this evening for Mother&#39;s day.   Waited about 30 minutes past our reservation with no communication from the hostess about when we might get seated.  Finally just left.

(My husband copied me so he wouldn&#39;t be jealous again.) My daughter had the black ink pasta which I can say was also delicious since she had enough leftovers for me to share the next night. My son had the special veal/beef meatballs and spaghetti and they were indeed special. Best meatballs I have ever tasted.

I agree that the warm bread and olive tapenade were very tasty as was the house Chianti. The grilled Calamari very tasty but there were more veggies than calamari in the dish. But still overall enjoyed it.
Now for the Main Course ....
Let me say first that I am a salt lover, and usually don&#39;t complain about it.So if I felt the food was too salty, it really was overpowering. My friend and I ordered the lobster ravioli, always one of our favorites. The presentation was lovely, however, the first bite rendered such a salty taste we both knew it wasn&#39;t an accident. The lobster filling was lost because all we could taste was salt. The other thing I noticed was that instead of a nice big fluffy pillow stuffed with the lobster and ricotta, the ravioli noodle was rather long and flat at one end ( at least three fingers width) and a small pillow at the other end. This indicated to me that they were skimping on the filling and used the extra flat part to fill you up.
My husband who eats everything and rarely complains about food offered to trade his spaghetti and meatballs for my dish, he also said it was over salted. My first taste of spaghetti sauce in comparison was not as salty as my ravioli. However, even tho the meatballs were soft and tender after a few forkfuls the Bolognese sauce (which happens to be one of my favorites) was just as salty. My conclusion?  We should have saved the 142.00."

The lobster ravioli was so rich it was inedible beyond a few bites. I&#39;m not a weakling for butter and cream but I truly couldn&#39;t choke it down. It&#39;s a shame because the ravioli were well made and well cooked and they were generous with the lobster inside. 

My sister had the spaghetti and veal meatballs. She said the meatballs were perfect but the spaghetti was clearly not made in house. We even asked the server to confirm and he doubled down that it was not boxed pasta. He didn&#39;t speak very much English so I don&#39;t know if our questions were receiving accurate answers but he was friendly and attentive for sure.

My boyfriend got the risotto and loved it. So that&#39;s a plus!

We had the calamari which were perfectly cooked and the pistachio scallops which I didn&#39;t see where the pistachio part of the dish was and would have liked 3 instead of 2 small scallops on the appetizer plate. We wouldn&#39;t have minded an up charge for each individual to have their own scallop, so maybe there&#39;s something to keep in mind.

For dessert we had a peach cobbler type thing. It was not very good and I&#39;m pretty sure it was pineapple and not peach and our waiter may have just confused it. Not inedible but I wouldn&#39;t order it again."

It was a Saturday and the house was full, so make reservations. The drinks came right away, as did the delicious bread. Vegetarians and vegans beware, they serve two dips with the bread. One is obviously butter with some sort of green herb. The other looked like garlic oil, which I ate but soon realized there was fish in it. When I asked the server, he had to check (strange) and informed us that it had anchovies in it. This was a huge turn off for me and my vegetarian husband. We didn&#39;t make a huge fuss over it, but did tell the server we are vegetarian. In the future, I hope the servers tell their guests what they are placing in front of them, since it wasn&#39;t clear. 

The food didn&#39;t come out right away, which I appreciated because they were taking their time preparing quality food for us. You can watch one of the chefs making your homemade pasta! The decor is very simple and the lighting is just right. The servers were attentive, but not overly involved. Water glasses were kept full and the owner (I think) checked on us a couple times too. At the end of the meal, he brought a cart of after dinner drinks for us to enjoy on the house. Fabulous! As you walk out the door, there are cookies at the exit for you to take as you go. So many unique touches! I highly recommend this place and can&#39;t wait to return. Had it not been for eating fish on accident, I would have given it a 5+."

We had a lovely dinner on Friday evening! We went early to avoid the crowd. I also made reservation online. The service was excellent! Gave us extra plates to share and change plates without us asking. Food was  delicious. Right from the start, the warm bread came with olive tepenade and garlic herb spread. We instantly perked up. Then we ordered 2 antipasti, 2 salads and 5 entree to share among 7 of us and we couldn&#39;t finish the food!! It was just so much food!! All of them fantastic! I especially like the avocado salad, black pasta, langostino(lobster ravioli). Their homemade meatball spaghetti was also dynamite. My son loved it. Overall, it was satisfying and my friends from Taiwan were very impressed!"

It is an old school Italian place that has delicious food. First off, they have a section in the restaurant where someone is making homemade pasta in front of your own eyes. They also have delicious homemade butter cookies to try by the entrance. Now to the food. The mussels and clams a&#39;olio has great flavor and the sauce with the seafood I would have as soup and soak some bread in it. The lagostino ravioli is very tasty. The sauce is nice and creamy and the filling is very good. The spaghetti with meatballs is also very good. The marinara sauce is the best marinara sauce I&#39;ve ever had and the meatballs are very tender, soft, and melt in your mouth. I have had a special here once which was the shrimp diablo which is the best shrimp diablo I&#39;ve had. It was extremely spicy which I loved and the shrimp were big and perfectly cooked. Staff is very nice and it also has a great atmosphere."

The waiter was terrible and had absolutely no personality.   He could not even recommend a wine as it was obvious he did not know wine at all.  The appetizer and soup came out superfast but the main course took 30 minutes after we got our soup.  This was a common complaint amongst the other patrons.

The food was very good.  We had the escargot and calamari both of which were well done.  The calamari was cooked perfectly with a sauce that had pepperoncini peppers in it.  The black pasta with shrimp and scallops was on the spot, creamy and delicious.

Well worth a try but be prepared to wait for your main course a while."

I decided to stop in for some Italian food and was basically swept off my feet from the moment I walked in the door. Carlos was right in front to greet me. He pulled out my chair for me, placed my napkin in my lap, and started me off with a peach martini. He had a server bring me a stuffed ravioli to try. It was delicious! Freshly baked bread and and some delicious spread was brought out, Then a salad came out and I gobbled that down, Then a scoop of sorbet to clean my pallet. Shortly after my main dish came and I was impressed. Every single dish was delicious and had great presentation. I&#39;m a stickler about presentation. The food was on point.

Upon our timely arrival they were running 1 hour to 1.5 hours behind.  I explained we had theatre tickets and they had set the time for us.  The owner was so rude, denied we had reservations but then found the reservation. We left 45 minutes later since we didn&#39;t have a table, and would miss the theatre if we stayed.

I ordered a Negroni at the bar, which was killer. For appetizers we got the stuffed eggplant and the calamari. Very good. For entrées, we ordered the classic spaghetti and meatballs and the black seafood pasta. The pasta is freshly handmade and the seafood was perfectly cooked. The meatballs melt in your mouth like butta.  Service is wonderfully friendly. We received a complimentary digestif/cordial after our meal.  And the best part? Nothing is really overpriced! Sure you pay for the quality you receive, but it&#39;s a good value.

Must have been a hockey game or something because there was no discernible reason for the light crowd.

Started off with grilled calamari which was tender and flavorful. A unique combination of ingredients and just enough heat to make it interesting.

For salads we did the capresse salad. Tomatoes could have been a bit more flavorful. I guess it&#39;s tough to get good ripe tomatoes this time if year. Liked the presentation and the addition of avocado, nice touch.

Entrees were very try to the Northern Italian style you would expect, flavorful rich and creamy sauce on the veal piccata and the squid ink pasta with shrimp and scallops. Our other companion had the meatballs. I sampled one and found the blend of veal and beef very flavorful. A little rice was added to make the balls a little less dense. 

We were full so cannot comment on dessert."

First of all I love Panda and really like this location. And I feel petty writing this. But I absolutely HATE businesses that use deception and play games with deals like this. That said, the company is absolutely falsifying advertisements. Look at your receipts. They say: &#34;FREE ENTREE ITEM WE VALUE YOUR OPINION&#34; 

Deal is you take a survey and get a free entree with the purchase of any 2-entree item on your next visit. This is clear and unambiguous. There is no other way to construe that.

We&#39;ve been doing this for a year. I&#39;ll grab panda for lunch here and there, and then my wife and I go in and get a 2-entree plate and a free entree. In this scenario, what would you expect to pay for? Just the 2-entree plate, right? The sole entree costs 3.50. So if you add a side or something, you may expect to just pay for that side, right?

If that&#39;s what you think, you would be wrong. I was just told that free actually means 1.49 off. Yup, we paid for a 2-entree item and our solo entree was reduced by 1.49 &#34;BECAUSE THAT&#39;S JUST HOW WE DO IT.&#34; I called corporate and it&#39;s just hold music until voicemail. 

So respectfully go screw yourself Panda Express. And say goodbye to two regular customers at this location. BECAUSE THATS JUST HOW I DO IT."

The last two times I was there they ran out of orange chicken and teriyaki chicken. We had to wait 15 minutes each time for the chicken to be made.

The first time this happened I thought maybe it was just our luck.  After the second time, I was convinced that they wait until someone orders something to have it made.  This isn&#39;t convenient for the customer to have to wait for something to be made.  They should make it as soon as it finishes.

The guy helping me was very friendly and as I said, super fast which is always appreciated when going in a quick place like this! Orange chicken has got to be the shining star at Panda Express with a hint of spice but not too much that it burns my mouth off! Mandarin chicken without the sauce is also a favorite of mine.

All in all, great new location, super clean, great staff, super fast and it must be doing well because it had a surprisingly lot of people seated for a Saturday at 2pm! I&#39;ll be back!"

Almost without fail, they offer the consistently best tasting food for a chain, not to mention it is a steal at only $6 for a plate that is served quickly for those of us on the go.

They just opened this new location and it was clean, with friendly staff members to prepare your food and fortune cookies. I haven&#39;t found one menu item that I didn&#39;t like at Panda. Picking a favorite would be too hard! You can ask the staff for samples before you order too, which is a nice touch. One word of advice, it does have a small parking lot, so you might want to plan on walking a bit, as there are several other retailers competing for spots in the strip mall. 

Also, the location on this place is actually on Barringon Road, just North of Schaumburg Road, but on the east side of Barrington. It can be easy to get the location confused, as the Google Maps shown here on Yelp have it located further west on Schaumburg Road, which it is not."

I had chow mein and beef with broccoli. The chow mein was quite oily and when I finished that was almost a soup of oil at the bottom of the bowl. The beef in the beef with broccoli had a weird taste, something was off. The veg added was fresh, so that was nice and at least one good point.

Their food is delicious (especially the Orange Chicken). However - this specific locations has so many issues. Considering its in a popular, busy mall, why is nothing being done to change the management here? 

- Every single time I go to this location: The tables are dirty. You can&#39;t find anywhere to sit without always having to clean it up yourself. &amp; their garbage cans are always overflowing. I&#39;m not exaggerating the word &#39;always&#39;. I go to Panda for the food but I can already expect a nasty dining area.

- The employees always seem stressed. Probably due to the very long lines. This place needs more employees. &amp; BETTER MANAGEMENT. 

- One time there were a couple of teenagers serving food. They looked very stressed. And on top of that, rude to the customers. And they ran out of food so early. 

-I love my white fresh steamed rice. Stop reheating it in the oven, microwave or whatever you use. It makes it very hard. You cant even chew it. It&#39;s like eating it raw.

If you are gonna eat there you should probably try the pepper chicken and the sweet fire chicken. Both on the &#34;spicy&#34; side, but obviously very different. I always get fried rice, but whenever I go to a fast food place that has noodles or rice....I go rice. 

I just realized my last trip that they have this little sauce holder with like 4 different sauces you can try...I will have to check that out next time and do some taste testing. 

They also have HUGE drink cups, if you need a giant movie size drink. 

And of course, you always get a fortune cookie :)"

The service is pretty good, yet not sincere. You can tell that what they say is scripted or required. The condition of the dining area was pretty bad. There were only 3 other groups of patrons there and yet all the tables needed a good wipe down and sweeping. All in all 3 stars for the fact that I got my food quick this time and it was ok tasting.

Well, this adventure was not only overpriced, but completely ruined our day.
First of all, we should have known something&#39;s wrong when we walked in, since the place had an overall atmosphere of a funeral home. 
We waited for about 15 minutes to be helped, even though there were only two other guests at that moment (and, they looked miserable). 
Now, as far as food goes...It was completely bland (unless you call overused cooking oil flavorful) and didn&#39;t even smell enticing.
The goulash meat was full of those chewy tendons and cartilage...The dumplings tasted like warmed up leftovers - they were hot on the outside while the middle was cold.
This was a disgrace. There was no one even around to ask us how we were doing and if everything was OK, until it was time to pay our check...
It was one of those moments when you realize that whatever feedback you have to give should be kept for yourself, because not only that you won&#39;t get an apology but you&#39;ll probably just end up feeling humiliated. 
I would say, if you want to get rid of someone for good (like, someone you don&#39;t want to date anymore, or a cousin out of town that keeps coming to visit but then messes up your house every time, or such), just take them to Bavaria Hof and your problem will be taken care of.

While I will say that the food itself was very good, we spent almost $100 on dinner for 3 people, and we all left hungry.

I found this restaurant on Groupon. We were really looking forward to a good German meal. 
When we arrived most of the tables were full, usually a good sign, we were told there would be a 15 to 20 minute wait. I asked about the empty booths and the hostess/waitress said there were a few big parties and she would not be able to serve us quite yet. We waited at the bar and looked over the menu. We were not asked if we wanted a drink. We waited 30 minutes before being seated. We talked about leaving but we hung in there. Once we were seated we ordered a beer and hot tea, the restaurant was freezing, we did not take our coats off and the tea got cold quickly due to the frigid temperature in the restaurant. When the waitress came to take our order we were going to get the pig roast special but I did not want the potatoes (I am allergic and told her so), she said no substitutes and they were out of Spaetzel and bread dumplings. She would not even substitute the potatoes for cabbage!! So I ordered an entree so I could get a side dish. We were asked if we wanted soup or their German salad, I wanted the liver dumpling soup but it could not be substituted for the soup of the day, the waitress said she was not allowed to substitute, Tomato Rice. We got the salad which came with a basket of rye bread. The bread was cold and stale. We ate our salad, I had to ask the waitress for more hot water because we were still freezing. And then we waited, and waited, and waited some more for our meal. No one came to the table to explain or apologize for the delay. After waiting an hour for our meal, we got so frustrated and angry, we left. My husband put a $20 in on the check out counter, in front of the waitress (which I feel was much too much for the beer, tea, and meager salad and stale bread) Again, no apology for the most uncomfortable, unacceptable experience.

This place was decent once upon a time like almost 4 years ago but now... 

Have you ever used a Microwave
to heat up Sauerkraut? Neither have I lol... What is this authentic German microwave cooking? The sauerkraut was cold but the plate it was in super hot!! Also the stupid pretzels were microwaved! They ruined pretzels!! Lol Auntie Annes or however you spell it does a great job with pretzels and it doesn&#39;t even claim to be a German place!!This restaurant&#39;s food tastes nothing like German food! Our bill was totalling $88 hahaha $88!!!! Are you serious? For that amount we would have had authentic German food at Beeghoffs not this shit hole! I did leave the lady a hefty tip as I felt bad for her and this restaurant which honestly anyone not having been to Germany could run a lot better!!

When we politely requested separate checks we were brusquely told, &#34;The restaurant rules forbid separate checks and you must obey the rules.&#34;  Maybe military obedience is expected in other cultures, but this is America and we don&#39;t adapt well to obeying orders issued by waitresses.

One of our group members wanted to use a Groupon and the waitress, hostess, cashier, bartender (she was one person doing all four jobs) rudely told our member she could not use the coupon unless she and three other people moved to another table.  Then the hostile owner appeared and told us that since our group had made a single reservation, none of us would be allowed to move.

When we expressed our displeasure she said, &#34;You people have had too much to drink and I&#39;m cutting you off.&#34;  At that point we had consumed perhaps 2 or 3 ounces each.

Fortunately, we knew of a Nigerian restaurant just a few doors away, where on a previous outing we had enjoyed excellent service and outstanding food.  We called for our check at Bavaria Hof, paid it, walked out, and headed for the Bisi restaurant.

While we were having our appetizers, two Schaumburg police officers came in and came over to our table.  They told us the owner of Bavaria Hof had called them and complained that we had been rude, noisy, and disruptive, and had disturbed other customers with our alcohol induced behavior.  We chatted with the officers and presented our version of events, after which they concluded that the complaint was obviously unfounded.  They apologized for interrupting our meal and left.

I counted the negative reviews of Bavaria Hof, and I found 52.  The owner posted a reply to most of these reviews, made snarky personal comments about the reviewers, and called many of then liars.  With a sample size of 52, I think the credibility of the reviewers is unquestionable.  The owner&#39;s replies all seem to be nothing more than school yard denials.  If a reviewer said the waitress was rude, the owner&#39;s response was just, &#34;No she wasn&#39;t.&#34;

Since this is a negative review I expect the owner will write a reply the same way she replies to other negative reviews, and will call me a liar.  My advice is to read all the reviews and decide for yourself who is presenting the truth, the owner or the victims."

I do not think I ever experienced such a mean, cold nasty attitude from both the staff and the owner.  We are a quite group who just wanted to enjoy a quite meal.  Very nasty people who are very confrontational and really have no business in business.  They reason they were so nasty?  Just because we asked for separate checks, and when we complained and asked why we were accused of drinking to much. (We had just received our drinks) and none of us  had hardly sipped them yet!  
Then we left, and they not only charged us for our drinks, but they also added $2.95 for each glass of water!!   Terrible, I would never ever go back!! Please don&#39;t just take my word for it, read the other reviews!!  Many 1 stars for this place.  Owner can try to justify her behavior, but word does get around when they treat many people this way!!  We were told to separate our tables!!!  Unbelievable!!!!!!"

Why only three stars?  We spent at least 50% more than what we would have spent on a comparable meal / drink in a similar restaurant. And even though we had a pleasant and relaxed meal, we did not walk away impressed.

Yes, you always compare food to your mother&#39;s, but this isn&#39;t what anyone who loves German food should go to.

Schnitzel was gristly, too many sweet overtones to pickled things that shouldn&#39;t be sweet.

We found the service to be fine...food came quickly. The bright spot by far was the selection of on tap biers..THAT was a good thing.

We should&#39;ve turned around when we walked in the door to literally only one other table in the place, and they were all packed up and ready to go."

We asked if we could do separate checks and we&#39;re told we could move our group to different tables.  They charged us $2.95 for glass of tap water. Owner didn&#39;t want to work with us but got very defensive and combative and told us to go somewhere else which we did.  Far better experience at other restaurant.  Really wish I would have read the other reviews before.  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone!!!  Not unless you want bad service, overcharged and insulted.  No stars!

Also the owner responded to others in party that sent in their comments and her response back is not accurate and lies.  The reviews speak for themselves!  We are not the only party to receive horrible and rude service and the owner and her wait staff were rude and unwilling to help resolve the situation but compounded it.

We were not offered option of separate checks but told to split our group up to diff tables.  My friend said you want us to fuck up your service by splitting us all up?  She then insinuated the alcohol must be the problem when we were just seated with our one drink that wasn&#39;t finished.  We were also told we could go somewhere else which we were happy to do.  Then she said we didnt know how to read the bill which said water for $2.75.  Again, insulting!  As we left my friend asked who the owner was after being treated so awfully and shared what he thought of her as he was walking out.  He didn&#39;t attack or assault.  Freedom of speech!!  Guess you never heard of that!!"

Me, my husband, and step son bought a Living Social coupon for this place thinking we&#39;d eat some good German food for lunch. Boy was I wrong. We walk in at 1 pm; the place is completely empty. We sit down. Come to find out our coupon  is no good. The waitress tells us it&#39;s not applicable for lunch, however; the fine print doesn&#39;t even mention that. But we decide to stay.  I ordered a beer and was asked to provide two forms of identification. Oooookay. The leek soup tasted like flour water. We had to add a shit ton of salt and pepper to it and even then it had no flavor. The bread basket was slices of stale bread, but unfortunately the bread and butter was the only thing edible. Oh! How can I forget the famous Bavarian pretzel! It came out immediately and looked nothing like a pretzel. Wasn&#39;t even the shape of a pretzel. I&#39;d bet my life on the assumption it was frozen dough microwaved. Now the main entree. Ohhhhh the main entree. I ordered  the Sauerbraten. It was a very small portion of iridescent colored, dry,  old meat of some sort with no flavor. The gravy turned into gel as it cooled. Spaetzl had no flavor but that&#39;s OK because the red cabbage made up for it. The red cabbage was sooooo sweet. Totally inedible. OK, onto my husband&#39;s meal. Again a small portion of what was supposed to be a pork chop turned out to be a fucking ham slice. This place sucks. I got my food to go only to give to my dog. As my husband paid he mentioned to the owner how displeased we were. She argued with him asking why we didn&#39;t return our food. Perfectly logical question. Well the reason we didn&#39;t return our food was why return shit just to get more shit? I suppose we could have returned it and maybe had it taken off our 70$ bill. I don&#39;t know. I feel raped and bullied by the owner. Do not eat here. Just don&#39;t. Read the reviews first."

We purchased a Groupon for Bavaria Hof, even though it was a 45 minute drive from our house, because we like trying new places and saving a little money always helps.  Especially when the menu is overpriced, as it is here.

The only good thing we found about Bavaria Hof was the split pea soup and the red cabbage.  Everything else seemed to be boiled, and had much less flavor than other German food we&#39;ve experienced. 

To top it off, the waitress appeared to only want to hear positive comments and was quite rude when we tried to give our feedback on the food.

We will not return."

Now, we visited again with a Restaurant.com certificate, to meet another friend in town for dinner.

We came and were showed to a good table by a young host, and the restaurant was about 1/3 full at 5:30 on a Friday evening. A fair crowd for the time.

We perused the menu with many great German dishes, many bringing back memories from my childhood (yep, I&#39;m German). The prices, however, held us back from freely choosing. Our server, possibly the owner, was also very direct and gruff - perhaps again, authentic German, though most people are far more hospitable. She was direct and opinionated, starting nice but ending up almost telling us what we would or wouldn&#39;t like. Maybe fitting a direct, German atmosphere, but a little unsettling even for somone who is used to dealing with direct, opinionated Germans - especially in a restaurant setting. ;-)

The food was actually excellent! Moderate serving size, but very good quality and well prepared. I tried the Eisbein (Pork shank) and the meat fell off the bone with a wonderful flavor. This was probably the smallest portion of this dish I&#39;ve received, but it&#39;s still penty for one meal. I was satisfyingly full, but not stuffed.

Now, about that atmosphere...

The place looked fine, and was well kept. When we came before, there was an older man playing all manner of fun music. I had asked about this before coming, and told they did not have music. When we got there and started getting our food, here came that same older gentleman to begin by playing the cowbells! Very loud for a mid-sized restaurant, but kind of fun. He proceeded to play beer bottles, two trumpets at once (actually, pretty good) and even a xylophone. He played traditional music and some contemporary hits. He is quite talented, though not the best singer. Quirky as heck, but fun if you&#39;re not sitting right by the music.

Overall, the food is very good and traditional German! I strongly recommend this as compared to, for example, the more generic (though still decent) fare at Hofbrau Haus in Rosement - see another review for this one. The prices, however, are very high. Maybe not exceptional for the food in an upscale setting, but definitely at the limit for the quirky music and gruff service.

A note to the owner - the food is fantastic, and the chef gets compliments on the menu, quality and preparation! The music is fun, but customers may need to be prepared in case they get seated too close and can&#39;t carry on conversation. Customer service could use some polish! Smile more, and use more that direct German hospitality we saw shining through.

To summarize, come here for the food, and seek out some discounts to offset the prices. The meals are fantastic and authentic, and worth a little quirkyness. Three stars instead of four because of the mediocre service and louder music."

We wanted to share a meal of Wiener Schnitzel with a couple of extra side dishes.  

The waitress informed us there would be a &#34;split plate fee&#34; of $3.50 and we agreed thinking they would bring the meal and sides split on two plates with the food garnished, for two people.  Wrong, the Wiener Schnitzel and bread dumplings came on one plate with the sides in a bowl and she dropped a small salad plate on the table for us to use. Why the $3.50 split plate fee if we were doing the splitting?

The tomato soup was very salty, the Wiener Schnitzel was bland, soggy and not crispy. It looked and tasted like it was cooked ahead and microwaved for us.  The fried potatoes were unseasoned and oily and the bread dumplings tasted like condensed stovetop stuffing. The sauerkraut, at least for me, was inedible.  

The best part of the meal, sadly, was the tap water."

What they have on their menu is all german dishes - no doubt. Only the taste is way off. It&#39;s not authentic german - real german food tastes way better without being that expensive. 
I am german, born and grown up in Germany so I know what I am talking about. 
We started with the salad that came with the meal... This was a small plate with beans, cucumber, tomatoes and beets. Beans and cucumbers were ok but everything had a sweet overtone. The Tomatoes were inedible... They were kind of chewy, comparable to chewing gum and did not taste like tomatoes. A really weird structure that I never experienced with tomatoes before. We could not eat them.
The Wiener Schnitzel was tasteless, besides the greasily taste... It tasted like it was fried in too much oil. Same thing for the fried potatoes. When you take the same pan with the same oil over ond over again you have those small black burnt residues in your pan - that&#39;s basically what my potatoes were covered in. 
My husband had the pig roast and it really was nothing else thn pulled pork. A pig roast like we do it in Germany is a lot different. The Spaetzle were tasteless, the gravy had a strange taste.
The beer was good - it came in a bottle. 

The whole menu is overpriced. The food is expensive for what you get. 
Maybe we came with too high expectations or we simply know the real german food too well. 

Service was ok and the waitress was friendly in her way. Nothing to complain about here.
Maybe just an advice... I ate approximately 3/4 of my schnitzel (I hate wasting food) and very little potatoes. She asked me if I want a box and I said no. I would have expected the question &#34;was anything wrong with the food&#34;. That&#39;s what I would wonder if a nearly full plate goes back."

Food arrived, but appeared to have been warmed up....microwaved artificially hot. Spätzle was tasteless, and entire plate of meats covered in too much thick brown gravy.

Chicken schzitnel was good, bread dumpling was really good. The gravy was really awesome I must say. The red cabbage was good in my opinion ( a little sweet) but good. Then we finished it off with apple strudel. (Too much whipped cream :p). But overall really good. The only thing is its expensive. Was it worth $20 I paid - not really.

Very quiet, not a lot of people but it was on a cold Tuesday evening.

We checked and she did NOT charge us the automatic 18% tip many people said she does. We had our meals, I had a draught beer (.5L) and wife had a Coke.

I find it very telling that the owner of this wreck chooses to argue with the Yelp reviewers and leave snarky comments back to them, rather than see the negative reviews as a chance to improve operating performance.

and now to address some of the things in your reply to me, you DO have a sausage platter with 4 sausages, here it is copied directly from your website: (39) Bayrische Brotzeit   $19.95 1 Bratwurst, 1 Knackwurst, 1 Thüringer &amp; 1 Boneless Kassler.

The roast pig platter: Like i said in my previous review tasted like it was cooked in a pot of water. No idea where the term Roast comes from. The pig is not roasted at all nor does it have a roast flavor to it. 
 Going to a German restaurant i understand that there is no BBQ but THANK YOU for clarifying that for me. If i would&#39;ve wanted BBQ pork i would&#39;ve gone to a BBQ restaurant. The waitress said it was cooked over a pit. Maybe she said cooked in a pot. 

The bus boy did not speak English nor did he not understand what we asked for. we asked for water 3 times until my husband said it in Spanish and then he nodded his head and got the water. 

YOU ARE  100% correct that it is called Maders and not Mathers like i typed. Auto Correct. Thank you SO much for clarifying that for everyone.

I ordered the two rouladen with red cabbage and spätzle. Thank goodness they only served about two table spoons of that totally acrid red cabbage. It was good the last time we ate there. The TWO rouladen was served as ONE cut so obvious in half it made me laugh.
We didn&#39;t complain, but as a rule we will never visit a place like this again."

Great meal selection, however, our waitress was the most unfriendly I&#39;ve ever experienced. She seemed completely offended that we split our meal (Even though there was a three dollar charge which we didn&#39;t mind), and nearly beside herself when we told her that we had a Groupon.

Needless to say I won&#39;t be returning."

I wished I had read the reviews posted on Yelp before buying the Groupon.   This restaurant is NOT German, except for the (there&#39;s only one) waitress (we think she was also the owner).  Nothing in this building will remind you of Germany; no decor and/or background music.  

Looking forward to an outing with another couple, we ended up in this nearby place, none of us had ever been to.   I, too, had to laugh along with other Yelp comments, because at 6:45pm on a Sat.  there was no need for a reservation, which they only take for a party of 5+.  We thought we would be waiting outside for our table.   Ended up the four of us were seated, shortly thereafter, a neighbor showed up.  We requested they be seated at a table next to ours.   We were told that was impossible, as the table next to our was already reserved for a party of two (on the phone I was told &#34;reservations are taken only for parties of 5+).   The place was full of empty tables, yet we could not be accommodated.

We ordered 2 appetizer plates and got 4 potato pancakes for $10.00 and a sausage plate for $10.00 that barely contained enough food for one person.  I must admit that both appetizers were delicious. I ordered sauerbrauten for the main course.  It was watery and tasted like nothing but very strong vinegar.   I do like vinegar, but hoped to taste the meat, too.  The gravy looked good, but was tasteless.    The sauerkraut was good, but a very tiny portion.   All four of us commented on the fact that FOOD WAS NOT GOOD, the PORTIONS WERE VERY SMALL AND THE PRICE WAS WAY TOO MUCH.    Also, read the fine print, you will pay an automatic 18% gratuity, on any bill where a coupon is used.    Two of us at our table have a German heritage, we know what the food should taste like; this was NOT it.

If you want excellent German food, along with an authentic atmosphere and a reasonable price, head over to Fritzl&#39;s, 377 Rand Road, Lake Zurich.   The Lake Zurich address may make you hesitate, but it&#39;s  on the northern border of Palatine and not a bad/far drive at all.   This place is like a cute Alps chalet, with GREAT FOOD, ample portion  and reasonably priced.  Hope this helps!"

I&#39;m a foodie, I&#39;m &#34;picky&#34; and I&#39;m pregnant so hormones/sensitive emotions run wild if you know what I mean. I used a restaurant.com certificate which was welcomed without question. My friend requested the gluten- free menu (graciously provided). We ordered and shared the gluten-free sausage appetizer which was super yummy! I saw some negative reviews about this appetizer...the size was appropriate for an appetizer, a generous taste served with sour kraut and fantastic mustard.  
I ordered schnitzel (veal) with dumplings. My friend ordered Hungarian goulash with spaetzle (ok how do you spell that?!). Both meals were fan-flippin-tastic! Not sure what the table in front of us ordered but it smelled divine as well! This place serves great homemade German cuisine. Dinner prices average $15-19/plate which may sound higher priced to some but folks remember they&#39;re not opening jars or pushing the defrost button on the microwave for a mass-produced, preservative-rich meal. I loved the food &amp; will be back for sure. 
PS - we were not charged a &#34;mandatory gratuity&#34; as per some other reviews I read. We did ok with basic middle school math and were smart enough to tip 20% on the original amount of the bill, not the final discounted amount. Drinks, appetizer, two dinners and plenty of left-overs for our husbands to munch on for around $50-60 prior to using our certificate...that&#39;s not bad for Friday night dinner, all homemade!  :)"

It was great.  Great for a place to serve Schnitzels.  However,  I don&#39;t think i&#39;ll be going back.  To start:  the place was understaffed, with one service (owner) and a bus boy.  I think they are just trying to cut cost as much as possible, however this is hurting them.  

On top of that, NEVER PUT A MANDATORY TIP IN THE CHECK unless its a large party. I brought my father there so it was just the 2 of us. She added 18% tip to the check. Personally, I think she would be lucky to have gotten 10% from me based on the service (empty drinks and had to waive her for refill). The fact she mandated that i tip her 18% it just a slap to my face as a customer.  

The fact is she is owner, so she collects profits and she&#39;s attempting to pocket &#34;Mandatory&#34; tips from people is pathetic.  Maybe she put it in place because people weren&#39;t tipping her, which makes sense. 1 person can not wait an entire restaurant, so i can understand if they weren&#39;t tipping her. 

At the rate they are going, and just judging from reviews you can tell they will not stay afloat for long. 

As i said, I&#39;d love to have a place like this i could go weekly, every other week.  however, i am inclined to avoid this establishment after my experience.  If it was a bad server i could understand but this is all from an owner. so i know what will happen next time (no second chances)"

We sat for literally 15 minutes without acknowledgement from either worker. No water. No drink order. Not even a glance our way. Was it because I unfolded and lay my restaurant.com certificate on the table when we sat down? We left after that without ordering.

I remember the little drink menu specifically because 2 of the wines i wanted to try i pointed to (because i could not pronounce them) you were out of both. After our bill came we noticed the difference in the pricing.  You threw away the little plastic coated drink menu we brought from our table and handed you at the register, you told us it was the old menu and threw it out as i described.

I&#39;ve read multiple reviews &amp; seen comments about the service &amp; the portions of the food. The first time we were there it took a while for us to get greeted but once we did the service was fine.

I&#39;ve eaten at some really good German restaurants before and I&#39;ve eaten at some ok German restaurants before. This doesn&#39;t fit in either category.

The only positive I can say is that the red cabbage and the sauerkraut was good. My son had the chicken cordon bleu, which I didn&#39;t try, so maybe it was ok.
I had the Schweine Schnitzel and my hubby had the Veal Rahm.  The first thing I noticed was that my cutlet was very tough and hard to chew. So was hubby&#39;s veal.  
The dumplings were meh as they had some spice in them that was very strong.
The bread that they give you before the meal tasted dried out and didn&#39;t taste fresh or home-made.  

We even went as far as trying the apple strudel, hoping for some light at the end of the tunnel.  Nope, not even.  It was in the shape of a slice of coffee cake and it tasted closer to an apple pie than a strudel, with no strudel topping to be seen.  It was a layer of doughy pie crust, filled with sliced apples with cinnamon and another layer of doughy pie crust.  I had to struggle with it to cut a piece off because the dough was so chewy and rubbery.  The apples tasted dry, without any good caramelized sauce which I would have thought would have been  enveloping the apples. It was covered by a heavy layer of whipped cream.  It wasn&#39;t horrible, but not exactly what I would expect for german apple strudel.

The service was decent though.  The interior seemed kind of outdated and not very appealing, either.

I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place and I won&#39;t ever be back. I hope family who lives in the area never asks me to go there, because I wouldn&#39;t without putting up a fight."

Food was solid--not equal to the best German certainly, but 3 or 4 stars. I had wiener schnitzel and my wife the hungarian goulash. Both were good quality and prepared well. I found the fried potato and sauerkraut sides to be excellent. The apple strudel was very good also.

Even though the service was super slow as there was just one waitress, I was in high hopes as the lady reminded me of my Grandmother.    My only guess is because I used a groupon on, they only gave me half a meal, I ordered the Wiener  Schnitzel and when the food came it was the smallest meal I ever received, it was seriously tiny.  Normally, the places that I go to in the City or Wisconsin give you such a big portion that you can not finish it.  My plate looked like a child place and it was not cheap, I think $17.95 or $18.95......the first time in my life, I left a restaurant still hungry.

Do not waste your time or your money on this place, even with a groupon, it was not worth it, giving Germans a bad name!!!"

It looks like one of those restaurants in Kitchen Nightmares where Chef Gordon Ramsey must save the day with brand new decor. It&#39;s simply outdated, and just a complete turn-off. As we sat there waiting for our food, I kept hoping that their kitchen wasn&#39;t as dirty or disgusting as the ones I saw in K.N.

Gladly, the food did not give us food poisoning, although I can&#39;t say I was a big fan of the small portions. The food tasted home-made, which is another way of saying, I could cook this shit at home.

We went to this restaurant to celebrate an event for my son. He loves German food. We got there and got a table right away. We sat at the table without even water for over half an hour before the waitress came. There was only one waitress and one busboy for the whole place. We thought they were just short of staff so we didn&#39;t complain. We placed our order and a few minutes later got our one piece of bread each and soup. It tasted Just OK.
We waited another 50 minutes for our food to finally come. My $18 salmon was cold and tasted terrible. The vegetables it came with were the frozen mixed veggies you get in a generic bag. I didn&#39;t complain. I just decided we wouldn&#39;t come back. My kids thought their $18 meals were boring. My husband ordered the &#34;all you can eat pig roast&#34;. He got one plate and asked for more. Fifteen minutes later they came out and said they did not have anymore. I waited for the bill and they charged us the full amount for the food. I went up to the front and asked to speak to the manager. The waitress said I could talk to her. I told her very politely how I was disappointed  with my meal, the service and the shortage of food. She got very rude and went back to speak very loudly with someone in the back about how we wanted to eat for free and how I should have returned my food. They took off my husbands meal and basically yelled at me that I should have returned my food if I didn&#39;t like it. What a horrible experience!"

I am a big supported of small businesses and I certainly do not wish this particular restaurant to fail or close down.  But, I really wanted my opinion to be heard  and I feel that if the owner is aware of how many customers that they are losing due to fixable issues, maybe things will improve and make this restaurant a place to go (selfish reason: need good German restaurant nearby to go to!).

I went with three friends for a Friday night dinner.  We got there around 6pm and the place wasn&#39;t too crowded (about 1/3 full), so seating wasn&#39;t a problem.

There was only one full time waitress and another lady who help out and also acted as cashier.  I believe she was the owner.  I also under the impression that the waitress was related (daughter of) the owner.

Three out of four of us ordered beer and we shared 2 orders of Bavarian Style Pretzel s (not my idea!) for appetizer.  I had a bite of the pretzel, it was okay.  I certainly had better ones.  I say skip it.

Many reviewers already mention the &#34;German style&#34; salad, so I skip ahead to review the main course.

One of us ordered all-you-can-eat pig roast, one ordered SausagePlatte, one ordered Sauerbraten, I ordered Hungarian Goulash from the Gluten Free menu.

I was told that the Pig Roast, SausagePlatte, and the Sauerbraten were good.  
The (all-you-can eat) pig roast kept coming. 

As for my Gluten-free Hungarian Goulash, the meal/Goulash itself actually tasted fine.  The Gluten-free bread was definitely not freshly baked (to be fair, they never claimed that it was). I am 99% sure the bread was previously frozen and then defrosted. 

All our meals came with a choice of sauerkraut or red cabbage.  All of us chose the red cabbage and it was decent (then again, it tasted about the same as the jarred red cabbage I bought at the grocery store).

Overall service was so-so (we had the owner and her daughter serving us; Daughter was nicer than the grumpy mother). 

We had a coupon for BOGO Pig Roast (must also buy 2 drinks).  I was aware that we didn&#39;t have 2 orders of Pig Roast.  But, when it was time to pay, I thought I asked the owner/cashier anyway if she was willing to accept the coupon. She was very rudely declined to take off $14.95 (price of the all-you-can-eat Pig Roast) off our bill.   I think if she had politely declined, I would be okay with it.
The Sampler, Sauerbraten, and Goulash cost well over $15 each.  Along with our meal, our bill included about 7 alcoholic beverages, two orders of appetizer, and two desserts.  

In short, the food was so-so and service was below average. I&#39;ll keep a watch on reviews for this place.  Unless, things improve significantly, I will not return to this place."

This restaurant has long had a problem with nasty service.  No, the food / entertainment / non-existent atmosphere do not make up for it.  I was there yesterday for a birthday dinner.  Party of 8...two kids, two teens, couple and grandparents.  Like many restaurants, this place embraces the practice of automatically adding an 18% tip for a party this size.  Problem here is that thinking they have a guaranteed tip, the server is absent, slow and often downright hostile.  We ordered five all you can eat meals and one would think that actually ordering more food was a crime.  Repeat orders were very heavy on noodles and light on meat.  Even people who didn&#39;t order all you can eat were sneered at and treated contemptuously when they asked for take-home containers.

We had no intention of tipping 18% for such service and told them so at payment time.  They ran through a full charge despite this information and then proceeded to verbally abuse us when we refused to sign the slip.  All sorts of nastiness and personal accusations followed in full view of the entire restaurant.  The people who run and work at this place are unprofessional and mean beyond compare.

I will never, EVER return here."

I should have read the reviews first.  After reading, I was aprehensive but my wife and I decided to try it anyway.  It was Friday night at 7pm and we WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT!!!!  How is this place still open?  

Anyway, the beer selection is minimal as German places go, the food was actually about average, which is better than I expected.  I had the sausage platter, not too bad, but nothing great.   The prices are well above the level of quality and this would have been a much more negative review if I had paid full price.  

Would not recomend.

The owner is your waiter and adds 18% to the bill as her tip which I found humorous."

After waiting for about 20-25 min and not seeing anybody cleaning tables and a waitress  (it looked like they only had one working on a Saturday night) walking by multiple times ignoring us completely (we were the only couple waiting right by the entrance) we decided to leave.

The potato pancakes with sour cream and apple sauce are fantastic.

The drinks are generous and they have authentic German beers on tap and in the bottle. The Friday Night All You Can Eat Pig Roast is both delicious and a great value. Magnificent Mike often plays on weekend evenings. He plays on the bells as well as combining other instruments for an enteraining show.

I decided to come back one day and try some authentic German cuisine like my Mom makes.

When we walked in there was not a customer in the entire place.  That should be a warning for 6:30 on a Tuesday night.  The decor is mediocre and definitely lacks &#34;Deutsche gemütlichkeit&#34;.

The owner/hostess/waitress did not seem to appreciate my joke inquiry of needing a reservation.  We sat down, ordered, and waited.  Amazingly my veal schnitzel, spätzle, and sauerkraut came out in less than 10 minutes.  I swear I even heard the microwave &#39;ding&#39; twice.  The food tasted like it.  The veal was tough and barely had any flavor.  Dropping the food off, not asking if we needed anything else, and not ever returning throughout the meal to check if everything was alright is a big no-no in serving in my eyes (and I did it for many years).

Our waitress also did not seem to be in the mood to drum up extra business or make a regular out of me.  I even dropped a hint that it was my first time there and she seemed to not care or wish me a warm welcome.  Rather than enticing me with a cup of coffee, naming a dessert, or even bringing me a menu, I received a short &#34;Would you like anything else?&#34;.  No, I guess I wouldn&#39;t.

To our true amazement the bored owner/waitress sat at the bar with another employee who read off bad reviews about the restaurant in earshot!  It gave me the idea to write my review here.

While paying at the front diner-style, I noticed the &#34;Reg die net auf&#34; sign on the wall (a dialect German phrase for &#34;Don&#39;t get worked up&#34;).  It&#39;s hard not to, when you pay over $30 a person for mediocre microwave food, sub-par service, and no atmosphere..."

I read the reviews and should have known better but I went anyway. The place is dated which is okay..the table cloth was sticky and gross. I felt dirty just sitting there. The hostess/waitress and possibly owner is exceptionally rude and should not be a server. The potato pancakes were good and dare I say, I would go back just for those. The rest of the food was average to below at best. Pig roast had no flavor, Sauerkraut was more like sour straw, gravy over the pan fried chicken was like curdled milk with no flavor. After a painfully slow dinner service, we had to make a stop next door to Krispy Krunchy Chicken for some real food and as we were sitting there, the people that were sitting near us at Bavaria Hof came in to get some chicken also.. after a short discussion, we learned they did not enjoy their dinner either.  It was difficult to pay the bill because they are way overpriced for the quality of food. Next time I will make the trip to Berwyn and hit Czech Plaza on Cermak (similar style of food..not German/Austrian..but at least it is edible, served with a smile and won&#39;t cost an arm and a leg)"

While it may be too much to compare authentic fare to the country of origin or to a well-established restaurant across the stateline, Hof nontheless could not deliver a well-seasoned, tender or satisfactory meal.

We had the pork roast that&#39;s available every Friday/Saturday night. The roast was not salted and the ubiquitous gravy that seemed to douse every entree is salty. 

I had the sampler, which included the beef roulade, kassler, pork roast and dumpling. That, too, was inadequate. The roulade was and pork roast tough, and dumpling a seemingly gelatinous, bouncy concoction. The kassler was essentially a salty ham, though the one item that I could stomach. My favorite spaetzle was also the same consistency as the dumpling.

And every Friday night, an elderly musician who plays a record-breaking 10 instruments (at least) entertains the crowd with a collection of German and Italian songs. Definitely a draw for family with children. Although it is not conducive for a conversation, his antics which includes cow bells, beer panflute, panflute, xyplophone, 2 trumpets at once, synthetizer etc were entertaining in a gimmicky way."

They have nothing in the way of a green salad and there are many/all meat courses. There is a selection of fish and chicken. I would not suggest the fish - it is not a a seafood restaurant, after all, and the salmon I ordered came out tough as shoe leather. I asked for no meat products except for the fish. When the dish came with potatoes with gravy, the waitress was surprised when I mentioned that it was probably made from beef or pork.... I did ask for butter, but they had none and she offered the oil/make-believe spread...
The service was excellent, aside from the little gravy incident. The waitress elaborated on their new gluten-free dishes, and their future attempt to offer lighter meals. My husband had the sauerbratten (sp?) and said it was fabulous (just like his mother used to make). And, he liked the spaetzle, too. I did not marry him because he likes this dish, thank goodness!

i came here with my bf on a wednesday night around 7 and we were the only people there which worried me A LOT. we had a restaurant.com certificate so we thought we&#39;d try it out. 

that being said, the cream of cauliflower was actually wayyy better than it sounds. the German salad plate was lacking to say the least with some cucumbers, beets, pickled green beans and tomatoes. 

for main courses i had the Jager Schnitzel (white wine sauce with mushrooms, onions and green pepper) which was crispy and tasty and full of flavor. the bf got schnitzel with red peppers and onions and it honestly tasted like sweet and sour schnitzel. not appealing to me! the spaetzle was mushy and covered in a gelatinous goop of a gravy but the German potatoes were pretty delish. 

the shining star of the experience was definitely the blueberry strudel. nuf said on that one. it&#39;s pretty hard to screw up a dessert in my book. 

sorry for the longwinded-ness but i love detailed reviews of whats good and bad so that&#39;s what you get like it or not!!

Its 1:30 still no call..i have hungry coworkers asking whats going on. 
Manager calls the driver says he will be there in 7 min.1:42 get a call from the elevator area saying delivery guy is looking for me so we go out there and the delivery was just left there. We thought maybe he was getting more stuff but no he just left. 
No silverware for salads no bread and no additional cookies that were ordered.
Anyway so the manager said to call him after lunch to see what he can do do my boss calls and he is like he will take an additonal 30 off and give 50 off next time.
My boss is like what incentive is that for me when you didnt even try to fix the situation so finally he comped the whole thing. 
I guess the one catering van was in an accident but no one calls to tell us any of this. I had to call them.

Their desserts are also done in a &#34;mini&#34; size and they&#39;re so delicious. I frequently place orders for large (15+) groups of people and CB is hands down the best food, portion size and the most well received meal that I continue to order.

Absolutely NO parking spots during that time. I had to park by Dick&#39;s. Corner Bakery is connected to Maggiano&#39;s, which could explain the terrible parking situation since they share the same lot. You can valet your car for $$, but I&#39;d rather save my $$ and get the exercise. Gotta burn off those carbs!

My go-to menu item is the half-and-half, chicken tortilla soup and California Grille Panini sandwich. It comes with a pickle and your choice of chips or carrots. I opted for the chips because I felt like pigging out. Both are pretty good for a chain restaurant.

The service seems to be consistently decent at Corner Bakery. Friendly staff, quick to get our food, keeps the restaurant clean.

Be wary if you sit outside at this location! Birds like to hang here and eat the crumbs. On my most recent visit, there was one persistent bird that was determined to get some of my friend&#39;s food (I was already done eating at that time). He was hopping towards us, on the floor, on the chair, on the table. Even with me shooing him away, he kept coming back. We moved to another table, and I left my plate and dish there. The bird ate some of it and then came to our table again! Finally, we just had to sit inside because my friend was freaked out by the bird. In the end, bird - 1, us - 0.

On our monthly trip to Chicago it&#39;ll be a given I need to stop at this Corner Bakery Cafe for my fix.  Because we are in town for work, CBC is the perfect quick, In-N-Out breakfast spot for us. 

&#39;My&#39; breakfast consists of the crave worthy chilled Swiss oatmeal. Without fail, this is what I order every single time. Oats, yoghurt,  fresh banana, apple and raisins all mixed together and served with a crispy slice of sugared bread. Deeeelicious.  To top it off, I order a slice of lemon pound cake to go. Because, obviously!

I usually don&#39;t do sweet breakfasts, you will make me happiest with a plate full of eggs and potatoes. I&#39;ll up you one, CBC has AVOCADO on the breakfast menu and I still order the (non savory) oatmeal. I&#39;ll let you ponder that one...  yup, it&#39;s that&#39;s good. Me saying &#39;no&#39; to avocado is like the Kardashians turning down publicity. It just doesn&#39;t happen.

On the flipside, he orders the commuter croissant; a warm croissant with cheese, scrambled eggs and bacon. Typically this is combined with a hand held pie or a couple of rugelachs and hazelnut coffee.

They are popular in the city of Chicago, but not many locations in the suburbs. This place reminds of another Panera Bread or Potbelly kind of place so you already know my drift. Expect to spend around minimum 10.00 for a meal. I had the cafe size Mac and Cheese which is a big bowl plus drink. I gave it four stars because I think it did not give a lot of choices. But good service and very clean. It&#39;s worth a shot going. I am a Subway/Quiznos guy so this place is not a bad place to go too."

The menu has no prices so we ordered without realizing how tiny the portion for the power flats are (assuming we could have figured out the size based on price). Didn&#39;t like the flavor of the coffee and not sure (1) that my cappuccino was actually one and (2) that it was in fact decaf. Only positive was the chicken apple sausage which was pretty good.

It was years ago and there isn&#39;t really one near us now.  I&#39;ve moved to a new office and there is one right down the street.  On a freezing day we decided we would stop in for lunch to grab soup and salad.  We had no idea it would look like a blizzard outside when we left to go pick up our lunches!

I choose the Trio - Soup &amp; Salad with the Mozzarella Tomato Arugula Salad, the Cavatappi Pasta Salad, and the New England Clam Chowdah.  I must say that I was quite impressed with my choice and Corner&#39;s lunches!  The salads were nicely seasoned and didn&#39;t taste like just salads.  The chowdah had a hint of bacon flavor!  Ok, so it wasn&#39;t classic, but it was so good!

The other girls loved their choices as well and there wasn&#39;t one bit of soup or salad left!"

I was very warmly greeted by the staff member who took my order, and she helped me by explaining some of the menu items.

The food: I got the breakfast panini with eggs/cheese/bacon/avocado. The sourdough bread was great; buttered and toasted perfectly. The whole sandwich was delicious. The only caveat (and this is a pet peeve of mine) is that the amount of avocado was pretty scant. The two small slivers on my sandwich were just above the level of garnish.  But it didn&#39;t matter too much - like I said, it was very tasty. The potatoes and onions were awesome. Coffee - far above average.

I&#39;ve been to this location many a time when I used to live and work in the Schaumburg area. While it&#39;s convenient and fresh, the main reason I grab lunch from here is because of the DC Chicken Salad. It is the bomb dot com. A decent, but not heavy hand, of mayo marries chunks of chicken accompanied by slivers of almonds, apple, currant, a bit of red onion and celery. Plop a scoop of this bangin&#39; chicken salad atop some fresh greens and you&#39;ve got yourself a lovely lunch. 

Also, there&#39;s always some type of baked good sample out and ready for the tasting. Whether you dig the brownie bites or the sour cream coffee cake, you really can&#39;t go wrong in the bakery department. Prices are Panera-esque sized, so expect to pay $10 or so for lunch and a beverage.

I also like their coffee and appreciate that you get free refills on it (and the soft drinks) while you&#39;re there. 

Their lemonade is good but it sits out for a long time in ice in front of the checkout lanes and sometimes is warm by the time you get it- disappointing. No free refills on that.

They have an option for half a sandwich and soup which is really popular.

This location is great- at the far end of Streets of Woodfield attached to Maggianos. You order and pay at a counter and then they bring your food to your table as it&#39;s ready. They have friendly people working and keep the restaurant really clean. 

When the restaurant is crowded you are sitting pretty close to other people but I&#39;ve still managed to have some great conversations with a friend here, over yummy coffee and my chocolate muffin. :)"

Similar to a Panera Bread, Corner Bakery offers a variety of salads, sammies, soups, pastas, and breakfast sammies, scramblers, and oatmeal. And of course, they offer a plethora of combo meals ((Everyone loves options, right?!)) My go-to meal is usually the Trio Salad where you can 2 of their specialty salads with a cup of soup and field greens. Or, you can choose 3 of their specialty salads with field greens. ((The D.C. Chicken Salad and the Caprese Pasta are still my faves after several years!))  As for the sammies, my favorites are the Poblano Fresco, California Grille, or Chicken Apple Sausage Panini for breakfast. Yum.

Service is always fast and friendly. Prices are reasonable. And Corner Bakery is always clean - a big plus in my book. 

The biggest downside is the parking lot they share with Maggiano&#39;s. It can be somewhat of a nightmare finding parking during Maggiano&#39;s lunch or dinner rush. I usually park a little further, avoid the drama, and enjoy a short stroll."

They have enough seats and it isn&#39;t overly crowded like a lot of Paneras I have been to. Parking is a bit scarce so you may need to park in a parking lot next door, which is no big deal.

Anyhoo, he apologized and I told him it wasn&#39;t a big deal, just frustrating. {OBVIOUSLY this is not his fault nor is it the fault of the establishment. It is what it is!!} He left to go get my friend&#39;s lunch and when he returned he asked me for my plate.

Me:Monster Cookie::Scooby Doo:Scooby Snacks
or
Me:Monster Cookie::Popeye:Spinach
or
Me:Monster Cookie::Cookie Monster:All cookies ever

I enjoy the menu so much, and the staff are pretty nice. There is only thing that truly bothers me: location, location, location. I despise driving to this location. To go here during lunch is a pain because I have to fight my way through Woodfield Mall traffic, Streets of Woodfield traffic, and a parking lot that is never empty because Corner Bakery is inexplicably attached to Maggiano&#39;s which ALWAYS seems to be packed. Whatever happened to that whole &#34;recession&#34; thing? Seriously, is that the only place where they could afford the rent?

If they could change locations to a place that is both convenient and part of an area with available parking that doesn&#39;t involve a Frogger-like minigame of trying to make it across one or more well-trafficked streets between Corner Bakery and my car, then that would be absolutely lovely and perfect. Until then, I&#39;ll have to work for it every time i want a Monster Cookie.

The staff is extremely nice and responsive.  Additionally, they&#39;ll bring your food out to your table and pick up your plates when you&#39;re done.

I can&#39;t help but compare this cafe to Panera.  If Panera is a burger , the Corner Bakery is a steak.  The food is that much better at the Corner Bakery.  I will go to Panera and suffer through their mediocre sandwiches so that I can connect to the Internet and get some work done, while I eat.  

In Panera&#39;s defense, I enjoy going there, but they don&#39;t use the highest quality ingredients.  Corner Bakery doesn&#39;t skimp on quality and I think it might be a little cheaper, which is surprising."

If I were to review the food at Corner Bakery, I would give it 4 stars - as I have liked every sandwich, salad, soup and muffin on the menu that I have tried, but their fountain soda is terrible...seriously, there is something wrong with their mix - not enough syrup maybe?  Whatever, it&#39;s bad.  

However, this is not a review of Corner Bakery&#39;s food (or fountain soda) but rather a review of my experience with Corner Bakery catering.  

In mid-December I had a Christmas gathering with my &#34;married friends&#34; and their children out in the suburbs.  We were going to be having our own Christmas dinner and everyone was required to bring a dish.  I was assigned salad and bread.  In an effort to save time and frustration, I elected not to make a salad or bake bread, but rather to purchase these items.  I decided to go with Corner Bakery catering as I have always enjoyed their salads &amp; rolls when I have stopped in for lunch.  

I am giving my experience with Corner Bakery catering 5 stars for the following reasons:

1) Ease of ordering:  I went online, looked up the catering menu available at their Schaumburg location, called to place the order (24 hours in advance) and was finished with the task in about 3 minutes.  

2) Staff:  When I arrived at Corner Bakery to pick up the salad and bread, despite the heavy weekend lunch crowd I was attended to promptly and given my order without any delay.  Everyone was very friendly -the employee who took my phone order, the employee who rang up my purchase, and the manager who greeted me and made sure my order was correct.   

3) Correct order:   Sadly, I have become accustomed to restaurants screwing up orders, and so I always kind of expect that when I receive my order, it will not be 100% correct.  I was therefore pleasantly surprised when I received my order to see everything was exactly as I had wanted it.  

4) Quality of food:  I had chosen the Sante Fe Ranch salad and a basket of assorted rolls.   It was definitely a crowd pleaser.  The presentation was nice and the salad and rolls were delicious.  

I would, without hesitation, use Corner Bakery catering again if the need arose, and recommend it to others."

However, the reason I didn&#39;t give this location five stars is because it&#39;s one of the smaller, more crowded, and less homey Corner Bakeries.

If you don&#39;t know much about Corner Bakery, they&#39;ve got the BEST FOOD.  The prices are about the same as Panera Bread.  They&#39;ve got amazing desserts (there&#39;s almost always samples) and their California Grill panini is out of this world.  They&#39;ve got an awesome salad plate, where you can pick out three different types of salads for $7 (pasta salad, fruit salad, potato salad, tuna salad, etc. with green salad free on the side).  They&#39;ve got breakfast food, huge bowls of delicious soups (especially their cheesy, bacony, hot potato soup)...Corner Bakery ROCKS!"

Every night I have gone in the Hideout whether I go in with a friend, hang out with a regular or hang out with the bartender Dave or the owners Todd &amp; Jen I have a good time.  But I finally got a chance to make a Yelp review and I am astonished that I am not giving my favorite regular bar a 5 star.  I don&#39;t know why Dave left and his gf Kim coming out once in awhile as a regular was pretty cool too.  

It&#39;s ok he left I&#39;m fine with that but I want to give Jen and Todd some advice.  The new bartender AJ is not cool.  He seriously needs bartending skills.  He cannot make Long Island Ice Tea.  Let alone know what a Tokoyo Tea is.  He dosen&#39;t card people he&#39;s never seen before.  He is not friendly.  He&#39;s ranting it&#39;s a dive bar and people are suppose to order beer but there&#39;s a wall of hard liquor ranging from flavored vodka to coconut rum.  He seems lazy and doesn&#39;t want to take the time to learn drinks and increase his speed.  

Other than that I love the Hideout and all the other staff and karaoke.  Either get another bartender or fix AJ&#39;s demeanor and tell him to practice at home."

This is the third place. When you need a place to hang out or a night of fun this is a great spot to go to. A typical experience depends on the day but it ranges from free drinks and ignorant comments from the regulars that will have you laughing durring the day. Spectacular singers on karaoke nights mixed with some brave singers. The beer is cold the liqour is well poured, good memories are made bad ones are forgotten, this is truly a place to call your own."

The service was on par with their quality of food. AWFUL!!! I mean I&#39;m not even sure that the orange chicken came from an actual chicken. Unless you enjoy suffering from an aggresive food borne illness for a couple of days then this is the restaurant for you.  Otherwise, eat at your own risk. 

The customer service was terrible. I understand if English isn&#39;t your first language and some people struggle with languages that are not native to their tongue but being a rude inconsiderate jerk is a quality that&#39;s universal and it has nothing to do with your learning curve. 

Having said that I will no longer do business where I do not feel appreciated and respected.

Any older Asian restaurant that Candice has not reviewed in the NW burbs is likely not worth going out of your way for. I like hot, the menu description for the MaPo Tofu says hot, I asked for hot, not hot.

Not a fan of their &#34;spicy hot&#34; MaPo ToFu but if you like it milder their&#39;s is not spicy although the menu says it is. Good newz is it&#39;s not a salt bomb, also a spice. 
Not a lot of pork or much of anything else in there other than tofu cubes. 
Actually probably a good choice if your partner likes their Chinese mildly seasoned, and you can nuke it up with chili oil if you want or whatever.

Darkish dated interior is seldom crowded and you could have a fairly private &#34;it&#39;s not you it&#39;s ME&#34; dinner here.

He barked at me telling me I was too early. I was about 90 seconds early. Then when I asked for the red hot sauce, that all places give for free, he grunted and pointed to a 25 cent sign drawn in crayon. When I asked for some hot mustard he gave me ONE packet. Anyways, the food sucked. Worst sesame chicken I ever had. It was yellow. All sesame chicken I have ever had in life has been brown to red. The batter tasted raw. Perhaps that was due to the 90 seconds I was early. The meat itself was rubbery. I don&#39;t get it. I should have gone by the poor reviews.

I mean... I guess the fried rice was good. That shouldn&#39;t be the highlight of my meal, by any stretch of the imagination.

We had a sesame chicken, along with some sort of an egg thing that&#39;s covered in brown gravy. 

Now, call me crazy, but of all the palettes of flavor for sesame chicken I was thinking of... &#34;sour&#34; was not one of them. But that&#39;s what it was... sweet and sour chicken, minus the pineapples, plus sesame seeds. Very strange. Not altogether offensive. Just... strange.

The Egg Foo Young was all right. I couldn&#39;t taste the egg, and the brown gravy was also tasteless. The tastelessness obscured whatever other ingredients were in it. Is that really how it&#39;s supposed to taste?

Tried their Dinner Menu with wife on a Saturday night.
We ordered the Egg Rolls as an appetizer and the were terrific. Loved their homemade sweet and sour sauce.Way better than the junk that comes in those packets. Their Hot Mustard was also made from scratch and has one heck of a kick.

We ordered the General Tao&#39;s chicken and their combination Egg Fu Young. Both dishes were plentiful. We couldn&#39;t eat it all and had to take a doggie bag home.

Loved the sweet/sour/hot flavors in the General Tao&#39;s and my wife loved the gravy laden Egg Fu Youngs (She always tries Chinese Restaurants Egg Fu Youngs First). 

Our waiter was &#34;Aden&#34;? His English wasn&#39;t perfect but he was attentive enough and there when we needed him. Kept our water glasses filled.

The decor was old Chinese style, my wife likes this old style and find&#39;s it &#34;quaint&#34;, I prefer a more updated look so I took a star off for the decor.

Noticed a lot of carryout even though they had a dining room. People seemed to be locals, 

Room was conversation friendly. Quiet.

The drinks were cheap. A friend of mines sometimes goes in just for a drink. I also noticed people ordering carry out were also ordering drinks while they waited for their orders.

The food was generally around $9 or less per Entree.

Like another reviewer said, it was tough to find. In the mall across street from Mazda dealership on Golf, next to the UPS store.

Good Food, Cheap Prices, Cheap Drinks...Nice place for that Chinese Food Fix."

I really wanted to love this place, as it&#39;s just within walking distance of our house, but we will never be eating from here again.

It looks like a crappy strip mall place on the inside, but I wanted to be won over, especially considering how cheap the sooner specials are. It took over two minutes from the time we were sitting at a table for someone to come out to acknowledge us- I timed it. The water that was brought out was not cold, and the glasses only half filled. They were unwilling to substitute steamed rice for fried, even for an extra charge, or allow me to order beef &amp; broccoli, even though they had chicken &amp; broccoli and beef &amp; green pepper/peapods- first time I&#39;ve ever heard someone at a Chinese place tell me no! (This leads me to believe their specials are frozen and reheated.)

They screwed up my husband&#39;s order, then asked him if he&#39;d eat it anyway. There were no knives on the table. They brought our food out at different times. I had the orange chicken, the it didn&#39;t have the right flavor: WAY too much sauce, and the only place I&#39;ve ever seen serve with celery and green pepper, not broccoli. My husband had the Mongolian chicken, which was mostly green onions with some v overcooked chicken. The egg rolls and crab Rangoons were so fried as to be uncomfortable to eat.

Maybe if we&#39;d ordered this place takeout I&#39;d be more forgiving, but the food is bland, the ambiance is nonexistent, and the service wasn&#39;t good at all, though it was quick."

The first time it was a 5-star visit with the best Peking noodles I&#39;ve had since Yu&#39;s Mandarin. For those not in the know, these are a Chinese Korean noodle dish with a pork-based black bean sauce. The sauce was rich and the noodles were cooked just right.

The most recent visit the same dish was not quite the same. The sauce was not as rich, a bit watery actually. We also had the Korean version of sweet and sour which was too sweet and the pieces of battered and fried pork were very small. My son also ordered his favorite - orange chicken - and said the chicken was over-fried.

The seating area is small, but most of the business seems to run on carry out. Several folks came in to pick up their orders during both of my visits keeping the very friendly, efficient waitress busy between making sure our group of 7 was doing alright and getting carry out orders ready.

If you eat in, they offer free hot tea with the meal as well as a small cup of coffee
afterwards. Nice touch to stave off food coma!

I&#39;ll be back, confident the watery sauce was a fluke."

Hands down, best Jajangmyun in Chicagoland! The owners went on a brief vacation a few months ago, and my husband and I went through withdrawal. It was pretty bad on our end, but I&#39;m glad they were able to get some rest to make some more kickin&#39; entrees. 

They also have great tangsooyook, a fried battered beef lathered in sweet and tangy sauce with cooked veggies. We often order for pick up - one Jajangmyun and one Tangsooyuk to share. The portions are pretty generous, so we always have a great meal."

We ordered hot and sour soup which had barely any taste and no spice at all.  It was almost an egg drop soup with some tofu, no mushrooms, no bamboo shoots or anything.

+ sweet, friendly woman working.
+ reasonably priced lunch specials: $5.95 for soup, egg roll, rice, and entree.
+ egg rolls were surprisingly good!
+ good somethingandLemon tea.
+ perfect portions!
+ small and quiet.
+ orange slices and fortune cookies after meal.

Cons: 

- cannot substitute tofu for chicken lunch specials.
- vegetables delight is the only vegetarian lunch special option and it was absolutely tasteless. I was confused and disappointed.
- egg rolls have meat in them (is this common? I didn&#39;t know that). how ironic that they give me a meaty egg roll with a vegetarian dish.
- the oranges didn&#39;t have flavor either. 

The meal probably makes or breaks your experience -- my coworkers/friends/fellow Yelpers enjoyed their meals. I did not. I also have a bit of a cold so perhaps that affected my taste buds. I would consider coming back only for my lunch break, but the the non-lunch specials were kind of pricey and I prefer other places."

They have lunch specials at a great price but their Korean style Chinese food is really where it&#39;s it. Problem is the menu is ALL in Korean for this section, no translation. So you have to be Korean or be with someone Korean to decipher what&#39;s on the menu. I was telling my friend today at lunch that it&#39;s a shame they don&#39;t have English translations. I&#39;m sure they would have more business if they did because their Korean style stuff is fantastic!

I shared the Beef Tang Soo Yok (Korean style sweet &amp; sour) with my friend for lunch today...the portion is just the right size for two people to share. The sauce is much lighter in flavor and density than the standard sweet and sour you&#39;re used to from Chinese restaurants. It douses all of the meat completely, no skimping on sauce here. The meat is soft and perfectly cooked with perfect breading. The breading is ever so slightly less dense than the normal which makes it feel slightly less fattening. To top it all off, this dish has sliced, soft apples soaked in the sauce. Such a nice surprise and a great way to spice the dish up!

Bring someone Korean and go to China House! Or bring some cool translator that can snap a photo of text and then translate, bam!"

There is a list of common dishes written in Korean that typically aren&#39;t listed on the normal English menu. The dishes can be described as Chinese with a Korean influence.  

We ordered the sweet and spicy fried shrimp (kan poong seh woo) and the black bean/peking noodles (jja jjang myun). The shrimp were large and crispy. There was more breading in comparison to other places but it was still good. The noodles were okay but for only $6.95, I wasn&#39;t complaining.

Even though Yu&#39;s Mandarin and Chef Ping are my favorite places for Chinese Korean cuisine in the area, it was great to enjoy a quiet dinner without the long wait, fancy interior, and added costs. For the two of us, the total bill was only $21.  I&#39;ll be back for takeout.

It came with egg drop soup (which was a bit tasteless), and egg roll (yummy and I don&#39;t usually like egg rolls!), rice, entree, and a lemon tea (a great way to warm up on a chilly winter day).  We decided to dine in since the lunch special does not come with soup or tea if you do carry out and as I mentioned before these were necessary to warm up!

I ordered the Kung Pao Beef with no peanuts on top.  It was yummy and spicy, but they put a lot of celery and water chestnuts in it so I had to pick some out.  As I mentioned before the soup was lacking so I had to add some salt and pepper to the mix!  I did like that you could order the food without MSG since I get horrible migraines from it!

The interior of the restaurant is definitely a take out place.  It is plain and cold looking.  But as I mentioned before you have to dine in for the soup!  I also was turned off by the fact that there was no bathroom.  Luckily, I didn&#39;t have to go... but with tea you never know!

Very good jja jang myun (black bean noodes) and probably one of the best places I&#39;ve been to for beef tang soo yok (Korean style sweet &amp; sour beef - they don&#39;t serve it with pork).  The pieces of beef in the tang soo yok are very crispy and the sauce is really good.  The sauce also has thinly sliced apples in it, which I&#39;ve never seen before.

At the end of the meal they also serve complimentary korean tea or milk coffee.  Prices are reasonable and the Korean/Chinese style food is awesome.

The most basic thing one can order - fried rice - was just awful and was very dark. Maybe they burned it a bit? 

The crab rangoons were tiny and lacked crab, cream cheese, and &#34;rangoon&#34;...whatever that is. 

Ordered a few entrees: General Tso&#39;s chicken and chicken and shrimp w/water chestnuts. The Tso&#39;s was okay - sweet and spicy, and the shrimp in the other meal was doable.

Ever since we moved into the Schaumburg area, this has been our go-to Chinese restaurant ever since we were referred there by a friend. It&#39;s in a little strip mall behind Village Tavern, since it&#39;s kind of set back we never really knew it was there. The food is generally phenomenal. My favorite is the Mongolian Chicken. It is literally the best I&#39;ve ever had. My boyfriend always orders the orange chicken and he&#39;s a pretty big fan of that too. The fried rice is yummy as well. I also love that in addition to the fortune cookies, they also tuck a few almond cookies (my fave!!) and a few veggie potstickers in with your carry out. We have also eaten at the restaurant and they bring you a tiny bowl of fruit after your meal which I think is charming.

I ordered from China House today expecting to come on yelp right after and write a glowing review, but I was somewhat disappointed. The orange chicken was good as usual, but I also ordered kung pao chicken, which was just OK. A little on the bland side and definitely not spicy at all as it should be. I also ordered the egg drop soup which was TERRIBLE. Honestly it had absolutely zero flavor and actually was a little greasy. Just gross. Tonight was the night to impress China House.... you missed the mark and it cost you a star. I have to assume that it was just because I ordered 30 minutes before closing time, because they have never let me down before. I will definitely continue to go to China House, just no more egg drop."

First night, I had Pepper Steak-aka Beef with peppers---but :( no tomatoes.
Delicious, reminded me of Yu&#39;s...
But...that night-there was an issue with my leg-asked and learned that they use Oyster Sauce. Now, I have never been &#34;officially&#34; diagnosed as being allergic to any type of seafood...I just have never liked it. And NEVER EVER will!
(had to get that out-for all those who have told me that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m missing or that I&#39;d grow out of it).

We were VERY disappointed.  We ordered the shrimp fried rice and orange chicken.  The rice was a major letdown.  It looked and tasted like it had been burnt.  It was dry and too starchy.  The shrimp were also dry, too big, and seemed too chunky when paired with the rice.  

The orange chicken was decent, but the appetizers that came with it, the crab rangoon and the vegetable egg rolls, tasted old and rubbery.  We actually ended up throwing away a lot of our order!  I don&#39;t know why the quality of food was so awful.  Maybe we caught them at a bad time?  It&#39;s not like we ordered during the lunch or dinner rush.  Maybe they&#39;re under new management, different from the one that got all the praise .....

I give this place two stars, a star more than what they deserve, for the &#34;extras&#34; they packed into our order, like vegetable pot stickers and cookies.  They were free and not as bad as the other food, so that&#39;s a plus.

When I went to eat the egg roll, I noticed all of the grease/oil that had dripped off of it. Upon further inspection, the garlic sauce for the main entrée was pretty greasy too.

So after doing some mapquesting and googling, we found out the name and address.  

This place is awesome.  We will definitely be ordering from here again.  He had their Mongolian beef and he loved it.  It was seated on top of those crunchy white noodles, delish.  I ordered their sesame chicken--which is also spectacular.  That was also on top of those crunchy noodles ( i don&#39;t know the name, but they are sooo good!!)  They were so kind to give us 3 cartons of white rice also!

For appetizers, we had their fried potstickers and crab rangoon.  Their crab rangoon is delicious!  Perfect portion of filling to wrapper.  I usually like to dip it in sweet and sour sauce, didn&#39;t even need it.  Now for their potstickers, they offer you steamed or fried.  I like mine fried.

Sauces (sweet and sour, soy, mustard) were full of preservatives and other chemicals. Even the fortune cookie was horrible and tasted bad! I never knew that&#39;s even possible! Probably because it was made of stuff hard to pronounce, and yes-preservatives! When I read the menu I found out they can leave the msg out per request. That gave me the shivers, eek!

When you come to a restaurant like this, you should not expect full authenticity. There are reviews here citing the fried rice as lacking or less than good. Whether or not thats true is the worst litmus test for a Chinese restaurant. I won&#39;t really get into why, but believe me, try something else and you will enjoy it.

The General Tso&#39;s chicken is so good here. I know; it&#39;s not authentic, its covered in sauce and deep fried! How could that be good? Could you just be a little less pretentious you darn foodies and just eat something delicious? It&#39;s crispy, tasty, tender, always hot and they give quite generous portions. 

They also have a sweet and sour chicken or pork with a white sauce instead of orange. It&#39;s tangier and a bit more interesting. I really enjoyed it. I believe it is the Korean-Chinese style sweet and sour pork. 

One more deep fried goody thats better here than anywhere else. Crab rangoon. Dear God, the crab rangoon is always fried perfectly. Crispy and creamy, not too salty and of course great with sweet and sour sauce. 

I know, I get it, you&#39;re thinking this Chinese guy has some vendetta against his own kind. That he doesn&#39;t love roast duck, salt and pepper pork, cow liver or chicken feet. But hear me out a little longer.

The noodles. THE NOODLES. I&#39;m telling you man, you want the noodles. If you don&#39;t want any of those entrees I said before, you want the freaking noodles. Get anything with noodles. Seriously. Anything. You will love it. You&#39;ll think, why would I order fried rice when I can have noodles? Why order anything else? The jajang mein, the hot seafood soup, chow mein. I don&#39;t know what else. Just eat it okay? And when you&#39;re full and happy and the cute Asian server comes by to clean up give her a smile and a nice tip cause darn it they put good effort in the food and want you to enjoy it.

Also if you really don&#39;t know what you want to order just ask! It can&#39;t hurt."

I went through the drive through and ordered 2 orders of sweet potato tots, a milkshake, and some onion rings. The cashier asked me if I wanted ketchup and of course I said yes.

I get home, open my order, and to my surprise, only white tots!!! And no ketchup! ahhh!

I call them up  , and they tell me they dont even have sweet potatoes anymore. Wow. Why did I not know about this sooner?"

Especially since they have a drive-thru, yes.  Which is nice.  But they don&#39;t ever have drive-thru times.  For example, I just stopped during their &#34;happy hour&#34; to get three milkshakes--one for me and two for the kids, and I was in the line for 15 minutes.  What?!  I would have just canceled my order and left if I hadn&#39;t been stuck between the cars.

First, this particular drive in appears to be well run. They are extremely efficient (we always go to the drive in stations), pleasant, and have always gotten our order right. We enjoy being able to listen to music or read out loud to one another while we eat- and a drive in offers a perfect opportunity for that as you are not going to disturb any other patrons. I also love the Sonic Drive-In because they have more than one sugar free option for soda- I love their Diet Lime Limeade. The burgers are delicious, they have great fries and sweet potato tots- and my husband loves their Ice Cream/icee dessert. We will continue to go to this restaurant when we are looking for a good burger and a quiet meal together alone :) However, it is a fast food joint so your healthy options are limited!"

Plus, they were out of fudge so I had to settle for chocolate syrup and they barely gave me any.

I used to remember going to Sonic as a kid and loving every bite... either my palette has evolved or the chain is just not up to par anymore.

Sonic is like the chupacabra of all fast food restaurants! I always saw commercials but never knew where I could find one (other than aurora, and I used to live NW chicago).

I&#39;m a sucker for corndogs, which I always get. I can pair this with a jr. cheeseburger which lets me try a little bit of everything, since these items are on the cheaper side of the menu.  While the food is okay (as is most fast food) the real stars are the drinks

Their drinks are just delish (I love the blue coconut cream slush). They have some really good milkshakes too! I opted for the banana shake with hot fudge mixed in.  Love that they can flavor any soda- green apple sprite? yes please!! This place is perfect for those hot summer days where u just need some refreshments to stay hydrated

Saving the best for last, they open at 6am but serve the full menu ALL DAY LONG! This is so great since I work night shift and sometimes want a hearty meal at 7-8 am."

Drive thru check! Personally I have had great experience at Sonic in the past especially with the groupon package deal. We ended up getting the bacon cheese burger which was significantly better than McD, tater tots, mozzarella sticks, drinks, and even a banana split. Service is quick and all you have to do is press the button to order more. One piece of advice would be come during the summer months, I can&#39;t imagine eating here now that it is starting to get cold.

Pro- Unique dining experience, average price

Con- No dine in seating which makes it difficult in winter months

Hidden deal-
Combo meal deal
Daily happy hour drink specials in the afternoon"

My friend and I just wanted a cool treat as a last hurrah to the summer...it was super late and Sonic was open....

I have never been to Sonic in my entire life and had no interest in ever going but they had ice cream! So on we went....our treats were so/so...

But the 4 stars go to the really nice gentlemen who worked the drive thru! He was funny and awkwardly (when I say awkwardly polite he was like textbook polite but maybe a little socially awkward-like his momma taught him right but he needs a little more time to make the manners his...made it more confusing? Well he was a very nice young gentleman)...he looked like he was fresh out of high school or in high school, he was even more polite when we changed our order when we got to the window to pay...he let us change our order with no issue, no attitude and no problem....


Would I go there all the time, no since I am not generally a fast food junkee...but in a pinch for a quick treat...YES....

Once I got my croissant dog it wasn&#39;t even in a croissant it was a wannabe croissant bread it didn&#39;t even taste like one and they put way too much mustard on the croissant. My nephew had a hamburger and they put too much mustard which is ridiculous how much mustard they put on the burger.

I had tried the Sonic brand of food fare at the Sonic in Bartlett and was like &#34;meh&#34; could be better.

Tonight, I decided to try one of their foot long coneys.....mostly for the novelty. :)  Plus, I had tried one of their burgers and wasn&#39;t impressed.  I also tossed in a side of their famous cheese tots to see what all the hubbub was about.  Complete my meal with one of their equally famous cherry limeades and that was my meal this cool Sunday night in Streamwood.

Well, the foot long, was....okay.  A bit messy to eat, but thank God for the tray they put it in cause I&#39;d have had it all over my lap if I tried to eat it without the tray!  I&#39;d rather go to Portillo&#39;s down the street to get a &#34;great hot dog&#34;.  It may not be a FOOT LONG, but at least it will taste awesome! Sorry, Sonic.

The cheese tots tasted like your regular ol Ore Ida tater tots with a slice or two of Kraft American Cheese melted on them.    I kid you not!  Nothing special.....with or without cheese...sorry the power of cheese did not save you little tots. :( Sorry again, Sonic.

When I was all let down I tasted the cherry limeade.....maybe it would lift my already meh experience.....YAY! It did!  Cherry Limeade ROCKS!  I&#39;d totally get it again, though easy on the ice though, half of my cup was filled with their little pellety ice cubes....I was sad there was no more cherry limeade left. :( *sob*

Anyway, it seems like Sonic is &#34;just another fast food restaurant&#34; except their drinks are awesome and they have skating carhops! :)  I will go back, but probably only for the drinks...maybe a malt or a slushie next time?"

Hot dogs aren&#39;t all that, nor are their burgers.  There are better fast food burgers out there.  At the same time, I like that you can take your time in your car in deciding what you want before you order it.  They have some desert items and like other fast food chains, a value menu.

What a great cute little neighborhood place - loved it from start to finish. It is an interesting mix of classy dining and sports bar. Our waitress was really good - friendly, knowledgeable and attentive without being overly so. We had a nice table by a window and were happy that the music wasn&#39;t too loud so we could talk. My husband was happy that he could watch a game on t.v. from our table. The bread was warm and delicious with the olive oil and parmesan cheese for dipping. We started with the special appetizer - deep fried smelts - and they were awesome! Perfectly cooked with a nice marinara sauce on the side. Huge portion - glad the 2 of us were sharing. My husband had the caesar salad and I had the house salad. Both good, although I think I would get the caesar next time. I was a little disappointed that they didn&#39;t have risotto, but the entrees we picked were delicious! I had the portobello stuffed ravioli with sun dried tomatoes in a cream sauce and my husband had the spicy sausage rigatoni. We were so stuffed from the appetizer, bread and salads that we took a bunch of our main course home to enjoy later. Wish we lived in the neighborhood so we could come here more often."

I came by for lunch and there were not that many people here.  In fact, we may have been the only table being served at the time.  Cucina Casale has a nice clean interior with white table linings and all the traditional Italian settings.  Bread is served with olive oil and cheese.  The woman serving us took our orders and may have been the only person working at the time.  The traffic may have been slow but the place was kept neat and attention was paid to every detail.  

From what I can remember I believe I had a Ahi Tuna style sandwich.  It was amazing.  I have never had Ahi Tuna served that way.  I wish I had captured the menu as they don&#39;t have any formal listings online.  They have a large offering of Italian dishes from pastas to sandwiches to pizza.  Others with me had pasta entrees and they came with a salad and your choice of dressing.  

There is a bar area and the décor is focused on golf with some loose connections to Chicago sports.  There is one television.

Warm bread and a house salad were delivered well in advance of the main dish, which was good because we never felt rushed.  Risotto with chicken, mushrooms &amp; red peppers was immensely satisfying.  Quantities of everything were more than enough...no one at our table was able to quite finish their whole serving.  The only thing we needed at the end of our meal was a nap!!!

I did feel sorry for the cute waitress who was working solo...looks like she would have welcomed another waitstaff person on the floor because it took us about 10 minutes to get our check taken care of because she was busy taking orders from new customers that had just walked in.

It&#39;s a shame that this place does not have a web presence or even lists their menu on their facebook page. Thus, I cannot cite the individual dish names that we ordered below.
The starter was a fresh bread dipped in the cheese &amp; olive oil. The cheese wasn&#39;t that great but the bread was.
Next we had an appetizer that was similar to a bruschetta but had goat cheese and kalamata olives on a softer bread. Very good choice and very well prepared.
The soup and salad course brought a very large caesar salad for her and a beef tortellini for me. Her salad dressing was a bit too skimpy on the anchovies for my taste but she loved it. My soup could have had a few more actual tortellini and less vegetables but overall was above average.
We both had a mozzarella-rich baked rigatoni. Hers had spinach and diced tomatoes, while mine had sliced filet (which was a the special of the day). I can&#39;t believe, nor could the waitress, that I ate my whole plate. This dish was the clincher for me to return to this eatery. The waitstaffs&#39; attentiveness was noted as well, as during conversation she learned of our date night, and brought a baggie of ice with my mrs&#39;s leftover dish so it would keep in the car."

I agree with another reviewer that it&#39;s not very private.  It&#39;s a place you go with 4 people and everyone gets full.  

I ordered the roasted red pepper gnocchi.  It was a little richer than I would have liked, but still good.  I can&#39;t say too much on the food b/c I had one entree there.  

I&#39;m looking forward to trying more of their food.  I&#39;ll definitely be back.  I live in Elk Grove, so this mom-n-pop Italian place appeals to me.  We usually do Schaumburg and it&#39;s mainly corporate restaurants.  This is a nice change of pace."

The polenta was flavorless.
My entree was the asparagus ravioli.  It was covered in the same marinara sauce as the appetizer.  I was very disappointed in the ravioli as they did not taste homemade at all.  I left a third of my dish and decided not to take it home.  My wife ordered bow tie pasta with shrimp which was one of their regular menu items.  She wasn&#39;t impressed either.  The pasta and sauce had an odd flavor.
Although there were only 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant and 2 outside on the patio, the food was VERY slow coming out of the kitchen.  I can&#39;t fault the servers for the slow service, I think the backup was in the kitchen.  Additionally, they have &#34;changed their wine service&#34; so they had no wine list.  When I inquired as to whether they had a California red Zinfandel, she said they had one.  When she brought it over, I&#39;m thankful that she said it was $67.  Uhh, no thanks.  So we ordered their house Pinot Noir which is out of a jug and not very good.
I&#39;m not enjoying writing this review but last night was a $93 disappointment for a restaurant that we used to enjoy dining at."

The food was great, but we were apparently misinformed about what the restaurant actually is. Or something.

See, we&#39;ve gotten pizza from Cucina Pizza plenty of times. It&#39;s great. Their take-out menu is full of delicious-sounding pasta, sandwiches, appetizers, salads, etc. And the Itasca dining website makes it sound like you can just wander on into the restaurant and order any of their delicious food.

So we stopped in for dinner, expecting it to be a sit-down version of the takeout counter. Apparently, it&#39;s not.

We were given fancy menus full of $18 pasta dishes and specials like risotto with filet mignon. There&#39;s a place for that sort of dining, but it wasn&#39;t what we wanted or expected. So I asked if they had a pizza menu -- the kitchen is the same, after all. We were given a sheet of paper apparently from last year&#39;s Octoberfest, with a few sizes of pizza, a list of toppings, and a few appetizers. Not, mind you, the same appetizers as on the pizza side takeout, but fancier things like crostini with goat cheese, calamari and oysters. 

So we went with a large half sausage, half cheese pizza, expecting to get some bread and make it a simple dinner. I don&#39;t know if the waitress was too busy yapping with the patrons at the bar -- the only other customers in the place -- or if we just were not apparently worth her time, but it took quite a while to get refills and I had to ask for bread. The bread itself was just fine, good fruity olive oil and a nice garlic-herb butter on the side.

And the pizza is delicious, in my opinion, at the top of my thin crust list. (Oddly, they cut it pie style and not party style like they would at the carryout counter. Whatever.)

But we were sort of disappointed by the highfalutin&#39; atmosphere and the somewhat indifferent waitress who just didn&#39;t seem to care about our piddly little order. I was hoping for a place to be able to dine in with their delicious pizza and appetizers, but apparently we&#39;ll have to stick with carry out."

The drinks are generously poured, the meals are piping hot, and the service is not to be beat!

Good points: Pretty much everything!!
Risotto of the day: Always delicious--always what my husband has gotten
Chicken: Tender and juicy
Farfalle w/ shrimp-HA-MA-ZING.  Might even be better the next day!
Minestrone Soup: Flavorful with big chunks of potatoes and veggies. A+++
Bread and whipped butter comes with every meal
Calamari: To die for!!
Bruchetta: Seriously amazing.  It comes HEAPING with ingredients, and the bread is nice and crispy.  Plus, it&#39;s only $3.95!!  I could eat it as my meal, it&#39;s that amazing!
Mixed drinks: VERY generous with the alcohol, so be careful if you&#39;re the driver!
Ambiance:  Awesome!  They had a live performer yesterday, Vito, who is this funny little Italian guy.  Non-obtrusive and hilarious.  Overall feel of the restaurant is laid-back-romantic :)

Bad Points: Not too many
The parking lot is kinda small
The prices can look high at first, but let me just be honest--I no longer want to go back to Olive Garden after my real Italian experience here!!"

My sister and I were here for lunch last Thursday during her work-day.  She had been there before and service had always been quick and the food decent.  Our experience was a complete disaster this time however.  We arrived by 1215 and there were probably a total of 10 tables seated with various sized groups.  There was ONE waitress for the entire dining room, the bar, and answering the phone.  We sat ourselves and waited 15 minutes for water and bread.  The waitress dropped the bread off so quickly that we had no time to tell her that we were ready to order.  My sister got the cheese ravioli, so that she could use it to also feed her 17-month old son that was with us, with marinara and I got the &#34;special&#34; chicken risotto.  Both meals came with soup or salad and we both choose salads.  The salad was wilted and had brown pieces throughout that I had to pick off.  There was also only enough dressing for a few pieces of lettuce.  I had to wait another 10 minutes to get the waitress&#39;s attention to get more dressing.  People from other tables were getting up from their tables to chase her down for condiments.  My sister had to get back to work by 110PM.  By 1250 we still had no meals.  We asked the waitress for our food and she proceeded to ask what we ordered.  Then said &#34;Oh that&#39;s right&#34; as if she didn&#39;t even place our order yet.  Twice she tried to give us another tables food.  Three tables sat after us got their food before us.  Finally, we asked her to just box the food because we needed to leave.  However, it was still not ready even though it was already 1PM.  By 115, with my sister now late to work, we got up from our table to get the waitress&#39;s attention and just pay for the side salads we had eaten.  My 17-month old nephew is luckily a very good boy and was only fusing a little even though he must have been starving as we had been giving him animal crackers and bread to keep him appeased.  When we got up to pay for the salads, our waitress plopped our food down in front of us all bagged up and ready to go and handed us a bill for the full cost of the food.  Not having time to fight with her, we paid the bill and took the food and left.  I dropped my sister off at work and took her 17-month son and I back to my home in Mt. Prospect.  We were both starving when we got home.  I opened my $13.00 risotto to find that it was over-cooked, mushy, much much to garlicky and had barely ANY of the ingredients described on the menu.  It was supposed to have roasted red peppers, mushrooms, chicken, and peas.  There were minimal of each and the mushrooms that were there were cut so thin you truly couldn&#39;t taste them.  I had to dig for chicken to feed my nephew and I something other than the mushy risotto drenched in garlic.  I ended up eating very little and giving my nephew yogurt instead and throwing out the entire lunch.  The fact that they charged us full price for this experience in which we did not even get to enjoy our lunch in the place we had ordered it is ridiculous!  That is just terrible customer service and the food was gross anyways!  It is obvious that our waitress placed our order much after we had ordered it.  When someone makes a mistake, it would be nice for them to admit it and maybe understand that charging the customers for their mistake is completely unfair.  My sister was barely able to eat her food throughout the rest of her busy day at work.  We paid for a lunch we didn&#39;t even get as ordered!"

However, when we ordered our pizza we were told we would have to wait 45 minutes because the cook had too many to go orders.   We had already been sitting there close to an hour.  I cant imagine that you&#39;d tell a diner they had to wait because there were too many to go orders.  Had they offered to buy us a drink, we might have waited - but instead we left."

The bar was filled with locals...that I know and love!  We literally walked in to find three Itasca-an&#39;s that I&#39;ve know since I was a kid. It&#39;s a great place for the locals. 

At 6pm on a Saturday night, we were the only ones eating dinner. Presented again with the delicious, warm bread but this time with a garlic and herb butter. My girlfriend had a Restaurant.com certificate. My hubby realizing that we should really give this local, independently owned restaurant a little more cash told me to order a couple appetizers. Good thinking, hunny!  They were the real highlight of the meal. 

The food:
Calamari was a nice portion with a chunky marinara sauce. Crispy. Really good. 
The prosciutto with roasted red peppers, capers, olive oil and cheese was enjoyed by the guys. I didn&#39;t try it, but it was suggested by the waitress and according to the guys, it was very tasty. 
The soup was worth going back for...large chunks of veggies, not mushy, perfect pasta and a smooth broth. 
My hubby went with the penne, a spicy tomato sauce and a side of meatballs. He thoroughly enjoyed it. 
My girlfriend ordered a mushroom and chicken dish. This included potato wedges. The chicken was a hit with the sauce...the potatoes were a flop.    
Finally, my buddy and me both ordered chicken Parmesan (not on the menu). I ordered mine well done. Mine did not arrive well done. The waitress did take it back with my request to throw it under the broiler. When everyone was done eating, my food returned. Well done cheese as requested, mushy breading on the chicken and unappetizing penne with tomato sauce. Truth be told, I took two bites and I was done. It was a disappointment. 

Drink refills were ignored until requested. It was just a rough meal. 

I will likely go back for lunch again and probably pizza. It seems to be what they do best."

The dinner came with beans and rice which were decent, and also tortillas.  The menu did not say it came with tortillas but it makes sense that it would.  Since I didn&#39;t know it was included they gave me corn tortillas so if you prefer flour you will want to specify.  The nachos and gordita were also good.

Prices were in line with other local Mexican take-out places.

For many years we&#39;ve passed this diner at the crossroads of Arlington Heights Road and Higgins Road in Schaumburg. In all of those years, we&#39;ve looked at it, passed it by, wondered if we should go but never did - that is until today.

After stopping at a local market in the same parking lot, we decided to give Rose Garden a try. The reviews looked good, so we went in. When you first enter, you are greeting by their refrigerated display cases showing their wonderful looking cakes and pies. It reminded me of living in Connecticut many years ago where this was standard for all diners. The hostess seated us right away - the place is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside.

The menu is also huge. Pages upon pages of items from breakfast to full several course meals. Daily specials are listed and extra daily specials are given to you on a separate laminated card. Prices were very reasonable and everything looked good. But I remembered in the reviews I read about how large the portions are. Well, the reports are true. If you order a full meal, be sure to ask for a doggie bag ahead of time.

They serve warm freshly baked rolls first. A la carte at this place means it comes with a cup of soup. (What they refer to as a cup, I call a large bowl.) It also comes with cole slaw and another side - in my case fries. My choice was a small turkey club. The turkey was hand carved, fresh, tasty. The lettuce and tomato were plentiful and fresh. All in all - the food was excellent.

But, food is not all that makes for a good experience. The service was also outstanding. From the hostess to the server to the bussers, all were friendly, helpful and extremely capable.

I don&#39;t know what it would be like here on a Sunday for brunch. I imagine it would be crazy with a long line. This is certainly somewhere I am sorry we have not tried in the past, but will certainly go to again."

We love it.  We have never had bad service and everyone is always so pleasant.  Even though the Rose Garden Café is like &#34;any other Greek restaurant&#34; it&#39;s not.  Any Greek restaurant always takes longer for greek chicken and it&#39;s worth it here. 

We always get our bread basket and iced tea right away.  That ties us over while we read the specials of the day and the large menu.  You name it they have it!  Soup always comes with my meals and I always order the Cream of Chicken.  It&#39;s so good and you can buy it by the quart, pint, and gallon.

Last year is the first time I spent holidays without family.  I spent Thanksgiving here with 2 friends and you couldn&#39;t ask for anything better.  We had the whole Turkey Dinner without the clean up.

We love the big portions we get here.  We look forward to taking leftovers home.  I ordered pork chops once and was shocked to see 3 huge pork chops on my plate.  I ate 1 and took 2 home.  My friend orders salmon all the time and it practically hangs over her plate.  That gives her 2 more dinners during the week.

Whenever we&#39;re back in Chicago it&#39;s a given that if at all possible that it must include a stop at the Rose Garden.
The warm and friendly owners and staff, always consistently great and always what I expect. Many of the staff have been there for years contributing to this no doubt.
They also have a party room for events and meetings up to about a 100-150 guests. My wife and I actually had our wedding and reception here. Food and plated service for our guests was smooth, well coordinated, and delicious.

It should have been a sign when the waitress was quick to take away our bread basket when we ordered breakfast (it was evening time). Tip: I&#39;m fine with not having bread when ordering bfast but  wait to see what customer is ordering, THEN decide whether they are  bread-worthy!

Food was mediocre and on the greasy side. I will agree serving size was pretty decent but think I&#39;d rather have a small portion of something delicious than a large portion of something that&#39;s just &#34;eh.&#34;

People were nice. Room is your typical family style restaurant with outdated naugahyde seats. Unfortunately food was a disappointment."

We have been patronizing Rose Garden for 20 years. My daughter has had graduation parties there for my grand children! I loved the service and food.
Tonight my daughter and I had dinner there for my birthday. She ordered &#34;from the kids menu&#34; the chicken and fries because she didn&#39;t want to eat much.  This is something she always does. Well when it was time for us to leave the waitress came over and said &#34;He (the owner) said next time you cannot order from the kids menu&#34;! She was so embarrassed to tell my daughter what he said! My daughter said then tell him to put it on the &#34;adult menu&#34; I HAVE NEVER GONE TO A RESTAURANT AND BEEN TOLD WHERE WE COULD ORDER FROM ON THE MENU!! I&#39;m angry and very upset over this. The waitress and my daughter were embarrassed! As we paid he stood there by the cash register watching us!! My family has been a customer there too many years to be treated like that just because my daughter ordered from the &#34;kiddie menu&#34;  Well I won&#39;t be going back there again and my daughter is taking her business else where for our family parties!! 

What kind of owner would treat his customers like that?! You don&#39;t have your waitress/server tell your customers &#34;don&#39;t order from kid&#39;s menu again!&#34; Where is your class? Take that up discreetly with your servers what your policy is!"

Place is clean and service was top notch. Had an omelet with the only positive being its  sheer size. Fairly bland and it really tasted of liquid eggs, so I might have saved on my cholesterol numbers since my taste buds didn&#39;t get much. The potatoes were basic hash browns without even a hint of home made which I believe the menu claimed. Basic diner coffee. Five stars for service, 2.5 for environment (a bit warm) and one star for food = 2 stars."

I don&#39;t really like the one free refill policy. That&#39;s a little stingy.

As has been mentioned in other reviews, the serving sizes are ridiculously big.  The prices are reasonable and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had BAD service.  Some of the servers aren&#39;t as friendly as others, but that doesn&#39;t bother me and I don&#39;t consider that bad service.  The food makes up for any server issues.

If you get an omelette, be prepared for the size of it.  It takes up more than half the platter. It&#39;s actually funny how big it is.  I&#39;ve never met one of their omelettes that I didn&#39;t like.

As far as the one review about the servers talking about hating kids, I&#39;m not to fond of them either.  Especially when you are trying to enjoy your meal and chat with the people you&#39;re with and people don&#39;t watch their kids and let them run around or let them just sit and scream.  That&#39;s not a server problem, it&#39;s a parental problem. Sorry.

I&#39;m happy there are still a few restaurants like this around.  They are getting fewer and farther between.  You can get great soup or salad, an entree that&#39;s too big, and side for a good price. Don&#39;t hesitate to give it a try!"

I feel like the salad portion looks big, but it&#39;s a lot of lettuce, I would like a little more topping and a little more gyro meat.  If it wasn&#39;t for the dressing, I would probably try something else. A definite pro is a bread basket. Garlic bread, rolls, breadsticks. Holla.

I liked that they play Sinatra. Can&#39;t beat that with a big stick. The décor is rather odd. There are lots of statues, figurines and pictures of pudgy chefs in the tall chef hats. Well, it is a restaurant, so ok, I guess.

The food was ok, but nothing special. I had the soup and 1/2 sandwich combo. The soup was shrimp bisque. It was very thick. I added a bit of cream to try and thin it out. The tuna sandwich was ok, but I felt the tuna needed a tad more mayo to tone it down a little. Christopher had a patty melt with chicken noodle soup. The soup was good and the sandwich was large. He said the flavor was ok. 

The women&#39;s bathroom was a hoot and a half. It is a large, single stall bathroom, and the entry to the stall is framed by huge gold and white columns. Talk about a throne room .......

I wasn&#39;t overwhelmed by Rose Garden Café, but not for any specific reason. It isn&#39;t bad, but I doubt we will ever be back again. If one lives in the area however, it might be interesting to try the breakfast menu."

Their breakfast prices are great for the portions you get!  I always take home leftovers, which is enough for me and sometimes the hubby to eat the next day!

I usually order the feta and spinach omelet (which is delish), but this last time I ordered the Portabella, Cheddar and Onion Omelet (which was the size of my head), and it was so yummy!!!  It came with hash browns and pancakes! So good!  My husband ordered the two eggs with bacon, toast and hashbrown...he somehow got double the bacon he ordered, which was okay with him! (He has a rule: LNBB (leave no bacon behind), so there were no leftovers from his plate!

The service has always been good for us, and it seems like a genuinely nice, family owned restaurant.  There is plenty of parking as well!

FOOD: Decent food. Portions are extremely generous and generously priced as well. Although nothing out of the ordinary, its not bad food either. Menu is LARGE, they had everything from Italian to Greek to American comfort foods. This made it confusing what to order since I didn&#39;t know what would have been their &#39;specialty&#39;. I ordered baked chicken and the rest of my party ordered various things which I took a few bites out of. They might have been all homemade but they didn&#39;t taste homemade from scratch. It was all very &#39;satisfactory&#39; to the point where I feel like you could get the same flavors from a pouch or can. 

SERVICE: Really good service. Friendly and speedy. Our waiter remembered everything by heart... extremely impressive for our party of 10! He even went out of his way to make sure we had a specific flavor of creamer for our coffees. 

ATMOSPHERE: This was rather confusing too. I couldn&#39;t figure out if I was at Grandma&#39;s house or in an Italian home or what. Probably didn&#39;t help with the Halloween decorations. Although I do give them props for being festive for Holidays. Slightly stuffy feeling inside but it was okay. 

OVERALL: Almost felt like this place needed to be on Restaurant Impossible on Food Network or something which is why I am a little bit indecisive about this place."

Breakfast is excellent!  Lunch....meh.  for $10 I got a tuna on croissant with soup and fries and a pickle.  I opted out of the coleslaw.  The fries were cold and the croissant tasted days old.  For a $10 lunch I expected more. I could have gone to Jersey Mike&#39;s and spent less. I did see that they have kids eat free on Sundays for dinner after 3pm though.  I&#39;ll be back as I love their soups I just think they are expensive for lunch and I wasn&#39;t impressed.  I&#39;m so longing for a good family restaurant or some new in Elk Grove Village.  Sigh...

We got seated right away but the server seem like she was too busy and had to wait for 15 minutes before she greeted us just to let us know that she wasn&#39;t ready to take our order. The meat lovers skillet I ordered said on the menu that it came with cheese but what i ended up getting was mostly cheese and it was pretty horrible. Not only did it have too much cheese but also the cook had inserted the core of an onion in the skillet. I pointed this out to the server and she said she would mention it to the manager. Well after leaving my skillet uneaten due to the core of onions it had and all the nasty cheese I approached the manager and she said that I am supposed to eat the core and that everyone loves cheese. She told me that she had been in the business 16 years as the owners and that she did not care if I did not return since she has plenty of people that do. She also threatened me to call the cops if i did not leave because the restaurant was busy and she did not have time for me. This is the worst dining experience i have ever had. Needless to say i will never go back!

I was looking for a local family friendly restaurant and found this place through Yelp, where they have decent reviews.  

During the heatwave of 2012 we stop in and there is little AC in the place.  The manager or owner says the compressors on the roof are shutting down from the excessive heat.  They offered us a seat in the basement where they have a small banquet area.  Very nice of them to do and it was /so/ much cooler down there.  

The service was okay, I don&#39;t think the staff was crazy about walking up and down the stairs so much.  

I had Grecian Pork chops which were tender and taste okay, though I have had better Grecian flavor other restaurants.  My wife had the a chop steak with grilled onions.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but there was not a lot of seasoning in the meat.  She says the outside was pretty good.  My son had the fish fry.  The batter was so-so, though the fish inside tasted pretty good.  My younger son ate kids ravioli which he really didn&#39;t care for much at all.  He did eat all his shrimp bisque soup and bread before, so perhaps he just wasn&#39;t that hungry any longer.

All and all, a decent place, we will be back to try new things out and perhaps find a new place to frequent.  The cost of the food was around $13 bucks a meal for al&#39;acarte, add a buck or two for a full dinner."

From breakfast served all day to hamburgers and club sandwiches to steaks and seafood. 

Everything is just kind of alright. The bread service is nice but nothing special. The soups and salads are fine, but nothing you&#39;ll rave to your friends about. 

I stick with either a hamburger and fries or some pancakes and bacon. Prices are decent and you get a good amount of food. If you&#39;re in Elk Grove Village and you want to sit down and have a decent meal in a nice atmosphere this would be the place to go."

I had the grilled chicken kabob with fries and it was good although the inside of some of the chicken seemed borderline done.

The side salad was good and when I requested a vinaigrette I got bottles of oil and vinegar.

I didn&#39;t try the dessert. Pretty standard/average but better than fast food.  I was in town for business and it was not bad."

The portions are mammoth, and if you are here with the kiddies, you can serve their little pancake appetites with your sides alone.  The skillets could use a little more seasoning, but that is the only real complaint we had at our table for five.

Sever seemed apprehensive to even take the meal back. I got dessert with mine. Paid the extra $1 to get a slice of Caramel Pumpkin Cheesecake. It caught my eye as soon as we walked in the door. The piece of pie I got was old and dried out. The caramel wasn&#39;t even a caramel consistency, it was dried and crusty. When we went to pay, I showed the cashier the slice and she offered to swap it out. Tall, thin middle aged woman with long dark wavy hair who usually runs the register refused to swap out the pie and bc the newer one had yet to be served. I old her the slice I got was old and crusty yet she still refused to swap it out. I told her to keep her extra $$ I paid for the upgrade and that I would NEVER be returning. Horrible Experience!!!!

My wife and I came to check it out a couple weeks back and had great service.  Today, not so much.  Everyone can have an off day.  But it was more than that.

First, the good news: food was very good for this sort of place.  But t was evident early on that our waitress was perturbed and short on patience.  She just gave off a bad vibe.  Immediately we all felt like we were walking on eggshells with her.  She was terse in her demeanor and made us all edgy.  She rushed us to order, about 10 mins after we arrived, and we went with it.

Salads and soup came out, but they&#39;d seated us too close to the table behind.  She broke cardinal rules #1 and #2 of good waiting by first asking who ordered what, and then handing us plates and asking us to pass food around.  Again, we went with it.

So out come our meals a short while later.  We really didn&#39;t want to be rushed, but the serving pace was like diner speed. OK.  Again, we took a &#34;let&#39;s get thru this&#34; attitude.  Here&#39;s where things take yet another turn.

Two of us ordered NY strips.  I ordered mine charred.  Well the waitress wasn&#39;t keeping track of the orders, she was just CLEARLY disinterested in the bothersome details. She was still asking &#34;OK, so who ordered this, who ordered that...  So she gave my steak to the other person who ordered a strip.  Of course, I didn&#39;t know I was going to get the wrong order until she handed me a plate (YES, she&#39;s still passing around plates, only this time they&#39;re dinner plates - I nearly dumped a plate of hot juices on my lap).  The mix-up (due to her indifference, not honest error) quickly became apparent.  I sent my steak back and waited about 10 mins to get it back.

The check came so fast, we barely had an hour at our table.  The final insult was when the waitress told me &#34;oh no hurry, I&#39;m not rushing you&#34; BUT THEY WERE STRIPPING THE TABLE AS WE SAT THERE!  Taking all the plates, silverware, etc.  That&#39;s a good tipoff that they want you out.  Awful.

Lastly,as if that&#39;s not enough, my cousin and her husband had stopped by during dinner just to say hello on their way to their own engagement.  They sat for a minute at an empty booth next to the bus station with my sister in law, and the BUS BOY (I kid you not, the friggin&#39; BUS BOY) gave them real attitude about it.  He was grabbing things off that table, glaring at them.  It&#39;s not even like HE was sitting there.  He wasn&#39;t.  He was just, well, being a jerk.

I don&#39;t think we&#39;d give Rose Garden another shot.  I CERTAINLY would never go for another holiday.  I&#39;ll go back to the other restaurants we like, where we can sit for a while without being given the bum&#39;s rush out the door or made to feel like you&#39;re at the counter at Mel&#39;s Diner.

They added a $25 tip.  I would have left it be, but my brother from out of town wanted to give her more.  He hadn&#39;t been paying attention to all that was happening.  Later when we clued him in he regretted the extra $15.  So our waitress got $40 for a little more than an hour of some of the most aloof, coarse service I&#39;ve had at a rstrt in a long time.  Late in the meal her attitude improved, she seemed a little more congenial, but it was too late as far as I am concerned."

I had the Angus beef stroganoff which was the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The beef was tender enough to cut with just a fork, and bursting with flavor.  Huge portions I might add too.  

My dining companions had a variety of things ranging from salads to sandwiches. The salads were huge and beautiful.  The bread basket also had garlic bread in it which was awesome, they even brought us more when we asked.  The cream of chicken rice soup was fantastic.

To top it all of the service was great too.  It really was a great dining experience."

I came here this past week to catch a quick bite with family. We all ordered breakfast food, and I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered, drinks were served, and then the most shocking thing of all...

A bread basket. Yes, folks, they are masters in the lost art of the bread basket. I used to love when a restaurant would bring that basket over, with the little packets of butter, and you could enjoy some tasty bread before your meal. I have suffered greatly with the disappearance of the bread basket. Thank you, Rose Garden Cafe, for renewing my faith in dining!

Anyway, I ordered the ham and cheese omelet, and let me just say... It. Was. Amazing. I was totally put off of omelets thanks to IHOP and their nasty tasting eggs, but this was very tasty. Lots of ham in there, not too much cheese, and it was served with hash browns on the side and two pancakes. I was so full after the omelet and hash browns, I couldn&#39;t even touch my pancakes, but they went home in the typical styrofoam carrying case to nom on later.

The waitress was polite, not too chatty, but not rude. The service was fast, too! We had our food in record time, and it was the perfect temperature. This place is a little out of my way, but I will definitely try to make my way back here soon!"

Whenever I am in the area I stop by and grab a meal. Soups are always delicious and are the gold standard by which I judge a restaurant. So far I&#39;m still searching for one up here in Lake County that comes close. They make a great turkey club too, one of my other favorites. Portions are huge, Menu is very large, they have great daily specials and always at least two delicious soups to choose from.

However, if you are cheap as my guess Annette was and expect things for free when you hardly pay anything for the entire party at all you probably won&#39;t get much unless you specify it.

Get the soups even if you aren&#39;t full. The split pea soup is hearty, and my husband likes the cream of chicken as well. 

Their portions are huge. We&#39;ve not been disappointed in too many dishes.

Recommended: Reuben; gyros (sliced really thin and oh, so crispy); split pea soup. Their hash brown is the bomb! Extra golden crispy on the inside, flavorful and tender on the inside.

Neither of us had ever been here. Right off, I feel like the coffee could&#39;ve come a little quicker. That&#39;s just what I&#39;m used to over at the Egg Basket on Barrington Rd, but after awhile, our server came. I ordered my staple breakfast of 2 eggs over easy with sausage and hash browns and went with the pancakes instead of toast. My friend got one of those skillet-cheezy-platters. Food was definitely excellent! Sausage - awesome! It was definitely on par with what I usually get at Egg Basket (which is closer to where I live). Coffee was getting low and I was a little worried I&#39;d have to flag down our waitress, but she came just in the knick of time. A private party began in the room we were sitting in and I think after awhile, our waitress forgot that we were in there. So, we had to go to the cashier without our bill bcuz we&#39;d been waiting and waiting, but then again, we were in no hurry to leave and who really wants to demand a bill where you have to pay money! ha ha! But, no, the front desk woman was very kind and apologetic for our wait on the bill. I would definitely come back here again when I&#39;m in the area, but I live closer to Barrington Road, so most likely won&#39;t be back soon, unless I am with my friend again who lives in EGV! =)"

Superior Egg breakfasts including gigantic Omelets.  Try the spinich &amp; Feta it&#39;s great!
Wonderful and huge turkey club sandwiches and great crunchy fries.
Like the other review said; cream of anything soup here is awesome.  Just add a little pepper (remember they cater to folks my Dad&#39;s age) and a dash o&#39;salt and dip that garlic bread (that come iun the bread basket!) in there and you&#39;ll be a happy camper.

No 5th star because of it&#39;s location.  Although this place is less than 5 miles from my house, there&#39;s just nothing else in that location that I frequently visit.  Besides the construction on Bode rd is a killer obnoxious waste of time!  Anywho....

Let&#39;s talk taco!  The pastor taco is super tasty, I highly recommend.  I also had the steak taco and that was good too but just like all steak taco, it&#39;s dependent on it&#39;s marinate.  I would skip the steak.  I also got the chicken quesadilla and that was a home run.  It was hearty and full of flavor!  Corn in a cup was delish although it&#39;s not enough to share...  don&#39;t forget the spicy powder!

I did not dine-in which was a great decision because the ambiance of this place is totally old school.  It can really use a renovation, but I didn&#39;t really care because I came in, paid and got back to my house to enjoy this authentic delicious food.  I will most definitely return.

Meat is entirely unseasoned, so it&#39;s riding on whether the meat itself can drive it home.  Of the three tacos I had (ground beef, chicken, and chorizo) only the chorizo tried to play, and it was a limp attempt at best to arouse satisfaction.  Chunks of cheese heaved on these vessels, as only their corn shells reminded me of the idea of a taqueria.

If I had to pick a word to describe the food here, forgettable would be one.  Passionless would be another.  And disappointment would be a third.  Nice people working here, but the food is a distant second here, and I didn&#39;t come for the nice people."
taqueria-los-juanes-schaumburg,Chris M.,T8UQb589USyQqyr_t9rOrA,"Hoffman Estates, IL",1,1,0,69,629,zX78uSYD8RfjVJ9o-bF5Sg,5.0,2015-01-02,"It&#39;s been 3 years since finding this fantastic Mexican restaurant and I am so happy to say that absolutely nothing has changed in regards to the quality of food or the incredible prices. It&#39;s my favorite place to eat anywhere in the area, including the expensive restaurants!  My family has been eating here on a weekly basis since we found it and I&#39;ve treated many friends to lunch here as well.  We even had them cater our son&#39;s birthday party and every single parent asked where the food was from, parents and kids alike devoured the steak and chicken tacos we had!

After all that time we&#39;ve definitely settled on our favorite dishes.  I love the steak tacos, $2 a piece (10 cents extra for cheese). The meat is delicious and tender with no gristle whatsoever. If I&#39;m extra hungry or want a small change of pace I&#39;ll order the steak quesadilla, which is $6 and comes with tomatoes, sour cream, and guacamole. This is more like a mini-burrito than a traditional quesadilla but the flavor is out of this world.

My wife is a slave to the $6 ham torta, which is a huge sandwich. My two young boys prefer the chicken and tongue (!) tacos, which we get on flour tortillas at no extra cost because their grubby little hands tend to make a mess of the corn.

I&#39;ve tried a few other things on this menu and I&#39;ve never had anything that wasn&#39;t great, nor have I heard anyone say anything negative about their food in the years I&#39;ve been bringing people here. Best of all, the thing that really excites me, is that this didn&#39;t start out great and slowly decline in quality or increase their prices as so many new mom &amp; pop restaurants do. The only price increase I know of is the additional 10 cents for cheese on a taco, which is not a problem at all for me since the prices are already so reasonable. In fact, there is literally not another place, including the worst fast food, that my family can eat for less money, and certainly not for this quality.

They are also very fast and attentive for takeout. I regularly call my order in and it is ready when I arrive 10 minutes later. 

Recently the restaurant finally hung a new lit sign to be more easily found, and made small updates to the small dining area which include a big juke box. They also updated their credit card system which now allows a tip to be written in as most places do. No more accidentally stiffing the waitress!

One small warning if you are planning to dine in: there are only four-person booths and one or two small tables.  You can make do and cram in about 8 people by pushing tables together but it&#39;s pretty tight, so I&#39;d recommend coming with no more than 4 people unless you&#39;re willing to split up.

I cannot praise this place enough and I&#39;m so glad that my original review has been so helpful in directing people to my favorite Mexican restaurant."

Upon arrival, the girls working here were very friendly and told me my order would be ready in like five minutes. I like that, fast and nice service. The place is small and a few small booths so it&#39;s really not a shameful place to come and have a dinner for a party of one. But since I was in a rush I decided to do the to go. Their prices are decent and comparable to what&#39;s around so I was excited to try their &#34;street style tacos&#34; people had recommended on here.

Okay, so what&#39;s nice is they included a little bag of chips for me with a green and red salsa. That&#39;s nice for a to go. However, the chips were nothing special and a little cold. So I passed up on those. I have to say they get another star for a very delicious steak taco in which they melted some of their cheese on top, I should have gotten more of those since the steak was juicy but not chewy and full of flavor but not leaking all over the taco. Then I decided to try my go to el pastor tacos and got a few of those since those are usually my taco winners and I was definitely not impressed. They were over salted to the point that I couldn&#39;t wait to get home and drink a gallon of water, the sauce they were cooked in was a little overwhelming and kind of poured down my hands as I was eating them. I mean I don&#39;t want dry pork pieces but somewhere in between moist and not dripping would have been great. 

Overall, I think the service was fast and nice and the steak taco (as well as the steak quesadilla) both are awesome. However, the al pastor was a little too much for me and I would pass that up. Not sure if I&#39;d be back as it didn&#39;t wow me but if you live in the area, it&#39;s worth a definite try. But get the steak tacos!!!"

Waitresses were very nice but the food was a let down. I asked for a suggestion on what the cook does best and eventually ordered chicken enchiladas with green sauce. We were given a small basket of chips and salsa.( I could have made better salsa at home and there hottest salsa was mild at best.) These were taken away and not replaced or refilled. 

The meal arrived quickly but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good thing. I was excited to see real corn tortillas but that&#39;s where authenticity ended. I&#39;m not sure where this restaurant gets its chicken but it looked like out of a can and the seasoning was no where to be found. Rice was not fresh and beans were meh. I&#39;m glad I ordered a smaller portion because afterwards my stomach felt like it had a rock in it. Prices are decently cheap but if you want good food... I suggest hunting for another place."

I hail from that part of Chicago where Taco Burrito King is the place to go for authentic Mexican food, and Taqueria Los Juanes is just like it! We ordered take-out from here and it was pretty delish. I had a Taco Dinner which included Steak Tacos (I chose the cilantro/onion option and added cheese), rice, and beans. My husband had a Steak Burrito Suizo. Both were what we expected and just what we were hoping for. Greasy, but definitely not sopping, with the right amount of flavor. The menu is pretty large, as well as reasonably priced. They do give you a little bag of chips with some salsa on the side for free, too. The chips weren&#39;t too amazing on their own, but they tasted just fine covered in some beans and salsa. The best part about my meal is that I didn&#39;t feel crazy bloated like I usually do from such a hearty ( or do I mean salty, greasy?) meal. A win all the way around. I will definitely order from here again the next time I am craving Mexican food (which is always)."

Food- The biggest reason this place doesn&#39;t deserve a fourth star is because of their chips and salsa.  The chips were decent, but the salsa was awful.  It had no texture, a puddle of juice with a hunk of tomato in it.  From there it gets better though.  For dinner I had one pastor taco and one steak taco.  The pastor taco was flavorful and really good with the sauce they bring for it, same with the steak taco.  I also tried the shrimp quesadilla which was delicious with loads of fresh pico.

Well food, I had some tacos--lengua(tongue), asada(steak), camarón(Shrimp), puerco(pork), and chorizo(chorizo). Those were my choices for the tacos, but, they came with a double tortilla--not really a fan of that and the tortilla was a bit; errrm, like it tasted a bit over cooked. That goes for the chips that come at the start, a bit over cooked. The food was good, as I mentioned, but the tortillas was eh. 

The service was at top notch, mostly because it wasn&#39;t to busy, but she attended us with a smile and a pleasant tone.

Unless you happen to be walking right past it or know it&#39;s there, you won&#39;t notice it. Not at all a fancy store front and the strip mall it&#39;s located in might make one think it&#39;d be better to bypass and look elsewhere... DON&#39;T! This may&#39;ve been some of the best Mexican food I have had outside of a Mexican home. The flavors were delicious, the presentation appealing, the prices unbelievable (seriously, all of the meals ordered by my party were under $7 I believe), and the restaurant clean.
    I got the steak quesadilla. When I think quesadilla, I think that flat bready thing with some cheese stuffed in the middle and stuff piled on top of it. This creation was far from it (see picture). It was packed with meat and cheese and rolled up into a mouthful of deliciousness with a side of guacamole and sour cream to top it off. It was a perfect portion and even a little too much for me to finish, priced around $6 and some change. My boyfriend got a large chicken burrito: also good; his brother got a dessert: great!
    The service was fine, our waitress didn&#39;t really check on us at any point during our meal and almost forgot to get us more chips and salsa, but she was ok. The restaurant, as I mention, seemed clean and orderly though my boys were offended by the &#34;brick&#34; paneling (they&#39;re brick snobs, lol, weird I know). There is a TV, of course playing Spanish channels, which is appropriate because this place seems seriously authentic. 
    I&#39;d definitely give Taqueria Los Juanes a try, it is worthy of your business. It&#39;s located on Bode near the intersection with Salem. Found in the same strip mall as 7-Eleven, the liquor store, the day care, etc., so there is lot parking (or very walkable from the local apartments/neighborhoods). They do takeout and fyi, there is a $5 minimum on credit cards/debit cards."

Whenever I travel, I always try to find great Mexican food. I found this place on Yelp (thank you, Yelp!). Just as others described, the restaurant is small and simple but very clean and the waitress very friendly. 
The salsa that came with the chips was great, lots of cilantro, just how I like it but not too spicy for those with a sensitive mouth.
I ordered a chicken quesadilla with everything. It was absolutely delicious!!! Simple ingredients but well made and fresh. There were two bottles of sauce left with our lunch. One was a spicy verde and the other looked like a mole sauce but I didn&#39;t try it. The verde sauce was very flavorful and nice and spicy. 
The total bill for three lunch dishes and a soda was $24. 
I would go to this restaurant again, without a doubt. It rivals and surpasses my favorite Mexican joints in San Diego and Imperial Beach!"

The place appears pretty clean, but the booths are getting run down - no cushion left, small tears...
Decorated nicely...
Service was slow...  Sat for almost 5 minutes before I was brought a menu...
Ordered a chorizo taco, pastor taco &amp; pork carnita taco.
All 3 tacos lacked flavor!  Pastor &amp; chorizo appeared to have lots of seasoning on them, but those 2 tacos, along with the carnita taco had NO flavor at all!!!
Meat was tender and cooked perfectly, but again it was all SO bland....
For a Mexican restaurant in a largely Hispanic neighborhood, I expected much, much better!
Will not be coming back.

Have to add on - they didn&#39;t skimp on serving size...  Meat filled!"

Our waitress seated us and she was cute as a button and explained things as best she could. She was attentive and checked on us often.
I ordered the skirt steak special  called Carne Poblano and my wife had a three way of enchiladas.  Both Fantastic. 

Let me tell you, there is nothing fancy about this little mexican diner, BUT, the food is authentic, fresh, and as tasty a meal as I&#39;ve had . This is mexican done simple and RIGHT. It&#39;s probably a good thing I don&#39;t  close or I&#39;d be in trouble.  Everything from the fresh warm tortillas to the cold beer was delicious.  We then spent the next 2 days in downtown Chicago and didn&#39;t eat anything as good as this place.

It is a hole in the wall but for the price (3 enchiladas, a kid&#39;s cheese quesadilla with fries, 2 horchatas, 4 steak tacos, 1 huevos rancheros and a bottled Mexican Coke...$34 plus tip). They seem to have specials everyday such as tostado de ceviche and a mushroom/spinach quesadilla.

The little restaurant is small but super clean, including the bathrooms. Our server asked to clarify if we wanted the dinner or ala carte on the enchiladas because her uncle in kitchen wanted to make sure. When she brought our dishes I thought I accidentally still got the dinner portion with rice, beans and everything else included.

You can&#39;t beat the prices and the food is better than a lot of other Mexican restaurants in the Schaumburg area. Afterwards my fiance walked next door to get a $12 haircut. The whole little strip mall has a lot of life and everything you could need (dinner, haircut, liquor store and more)."

- Carne Asada Burrito (5/10)
- Chorizo Quesadilla (4/10)
- Horchata (7/10)

When I was little, I used to spend my entire summers and winters with my cousins, who moved here in the Salem area not long after they immigrated from Korea. They were the only Asians in the neighborhood, but the majority of the demographic was Mexican and Indian. So it&#39;s really surprising to me that it&#39;s taken this long for a taqueria to open up in this area. While there&#39;s competition on Golf Road, and then on Schaumburg Road, by the library, this is a pretty ideal spot!

If you&#39;re looking for it, just go into the plaza with 7-11 in it, and look at the windows, because there is no lit sign outside, just some posterboard in the windows. The place is pretty tiny, there&#39;re about 7-10 tables or so - think Pancho&#39;s Burritos before the expansion. I have eaten in before, and there&#39;s a halfway decent lunch crowd, lot of takeout orders, I notice, though. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve had their other stuff, but for my recent pickup order, I decided to get something new from here.

CARNE ASADA BURRITO
Ever since rediscovering Burrito House, I&#39;ve been wanting to try getting burritos closer to home instead of having to only get&#39;em in Glenview. So, on this particular day, I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito. It&#39;s filled with beans, lettuce, rice, and asada steak. 

The key ingredient, steak unfortunately didn&#39;t deliver. I think TBK and/or Burrito House use higher heat on their stoves, because they&#39;re able to almost get a crisp on their steaks, while not making them leathery. They add a small char to it too for texture and that extra smoky flavor...but not here. The steaks are probably medium well, because they weren&#39;t dry, but still a little leathery, and worse, they lacked flavor. The rice didn&#39;t really help anything, and the beans sort of collected to the bottom of the burrito and made those bites a bit unpleasant. Certainly not a failure, but not something I&#39;ll be trying again.

CHORIZO QUESADILLA
I&#39;ve been on the lookout for these lately too. Again, Burrito House was able to get crisp and char on the chorizo, but not here. Again, it was just soft, and boring, in terms of texture. The flavors and seasoning were average on the chorizo, but something about the way they wrapped this really hurt the quesadilla. 

I&#39;m used to quesadillas having a fairly even dispersion of meat and cheese around the whole thing. This one, though... imagine taking a tortila (circle) and then folding it in half...like normal quesadillas. Now, put all the meat at the bottom, so it almost forms a purse, and then use the cheese to melt the top of the quesadilla together. So essentially, your bite is going to be EITHER chorizo OR cheese....unless you roll the whole thing up and take one monstrous bite. The problem with this is, no matter how I rolled it, folded it, or even separated and refolded it, every bite was just chock full of tortilla, and way too much of it. Because of the high concentration of tortilla, it sort of dried out the bite, and overwhelmed the flavors with that floury, doughy taste. Chorizo is pretty strong, so you obviously tasted that, but it was hard to tell there was even cheese there. If this is how they fold quesadillas, I&#39;m not getting another one here again.

ABURRIDO (boring)
I really want to like this place, because it&#39;s a tiny place, and obviously someone&#39;s working hard to keep this place open, but it just doesn&#39;t match my style, so I don&#39;t know if I will be revisiting anytime soon. Tacos - Los Fernandez, Burritos - TBK or Burrito House, Chorizo Quesadilla - America&#39;s Bar or Burrito House."

I stumbled on the restaurant entirely by accident and decided to try some tacos instead of a pizza slice from next door Old Town Pizza.

The inside is small, with 5 or 6 booths and a few tables, and it seemed like everyone was there waiting for takeout, which I decided as well.  I ordered a chorizo taco and an al pastor taco to go and it only took about 5 minutes.  The tacos both came on two corn tortillas and you had your choice of onion &amp; cilantro or lettuce &amp; tomato as toppings (I recommend the onion &amp; cilantro).  The chorizo was delicious, some of the better spiced pork sausage I&#39;ve had in the Chicago suburbs, but the al pastor was surprisingly disappointing; it was dry and really lacking in flavor.

The meal also came with chips &amp; salsa, even for carryout, which was a nice surprise.  The corn chips are thin and crunchy, but the salsa was a little overwhelmed by the cilantro.  I ended up dipping a lot of them in the salsa verde and the other red salsa that came with the tacos instead.  Considering the other reviewers have mentioned some really interesting menu items, and that overall the meal was quite cheap and good (especially for Schaumburg Mexican food), I would recommend this little place to anyone in the general area tired of Taco Bell or expensive sit-down Mexican places."

They have some very authentic menu items that you rarely see outside of Mexico City. Try the &#34;huaraches&#34; which are thick, football sized  corn masa tortillas topped with any meat or veggies you like. One of them will fill you up for hours. $5.95 to $6.95 depending on the toppings.

I was really impressed with the asada (steak) which I ordered as a topping on my huarache. Normally at these places the steak is tough or fatty. This place is using really tender skirt steak. It was excellent and tender. 

You don&#39;t get hand made tamales everywhere. Mostly you get a mass produced version. But this place makes their own and believe me you can tell the difference. They have two different kinds: stuffed with chicken and green sauce or rajas con queso. Rajas are slices of flavorful poblano peppers, sweet not spicy. Oh and the price? An unbelievable $1.75.


Try the horchata to drink. It is a delicious sweet rice milk beverage laced with cinnamon.

I had 3 tacos: two shrimp and one chorizo. It was authentic and delicious. The kind of tacos you crave. Service was great and our food came quickly. Enjoyed the salsa and guacamole as well.

I finally noticed the new location when I was driving by on Rt 12. I&#39;ve been there twice in the past few weeks.  The first time I ordered a hot dog with everything and fries.  The fries are still perfect (when cooked fresh).  The first time they were soggy, the second time they were just as i recalled.  The skinny crisp type that goes well with a hot dog. 

The dog itself was good, but when you order a hot dog with everything you should never ever have to ask for sport peppers on the dog in Chicago.  That&#39;s just wrong.  Also, not celery salt?  Are we in Wisconsin?  I was wise to their antics the second visit, but forgot to ask for celery salt.  

I also had a half beef.  The beef itself was flavorless.  I ate about half of the beef and that&#39;s it.  It was lunch time on a Friday and about 10 or less cutomers went through the drive through and into the dining area total.  I don&#39;t see how they stay in business for much longer without more people coming through.  

Also, their hot dog/fry/.5 beef combo was 7.50.  My order came to 10.70 or so with tax.  I did not add anything to the beef, so the small drink must have been $2.50.  Seems steep for a small pop.  Unless they charged me for sport peppers on the dog?  If that&#39;s the case please move to Indiana.  

At least the fries are good!"

The food was great and my friends would always comment on the great food.

I haven&#39;t eaten there in 15 years so I decided to check it out as I am now working back in the area. Oh how the mighty have seem to have fallen!

I got there just before noon. Walked into a nearly empty place that was void of any life. No music playing and the TVs I saw were either in sleep mode or had Hispanic news playing. The customers were all middle class Americans. Doubt they were watching. The dining room was warm and stuffy. Found their Thermostat by bathroom doors. It was on AC with temp set to 68 but actual temp was 79. Fans are all over dining room but all of them were off. Bathroom was dirty. Slippery floor and ceiling vent had a layer of grime and dust on it.

Staff was 3 line workers, 1 taking drive-thru orders and filling in and the other 2 were taking inside orders and traded off making food and taking orders. I did notice another employee tending to dining room. Took about 10 minutes to get my order. Italian Sausage meal with cheese for the fries.

The food was awful! What happened Torey? The It. Sausage was over cooked and had a taste of chemicals or melted plastic. The inside had a reddish/maroon color. Very strange looking. Would never order again.bBread was nice and chewy but on the dry stale side. Got a side of juice for dipping sandwich. It was so damn hot the container it was in was almost melting. It was also so shallow there was maybe an ounce of juice. Good enough for about 1-2 dips of my sandwich. They did give me a second one with no fuss. If the juice came from their homemade beef, it was sad. It tasted like beef broth at best. Cheese for fries came in same type of container. Same thing, scalding hot and not very much. Standard cheese sauce. Nothing good or great. Wouldn&#39;t get it again. Fries were exactly the same as I remember. Good and a lot of them. However, I got mostly runt ends with very little having substantial &#34;meatiness&#34; to them.

In all fairness, I probably could have returned the sandwich for something else but at this point of dissatisfaction and the uncomfortable temperature of the dining room I just wanted to leave. What a complete let down! Gone is the king. Sad to say I would rather eat at Portillo&#39;s.

I remember lines out the door and a drive-thru line that never ended. This place truly doesn&#39;t care anymore."

The &#34;little beef&#34; sandwich was the perfect amount for me. I opted for cheese with sweet and hot peppers, which were well-matched accompaniments to the beef and bread. I also ordered fries, which was a sizable portion, hot and crisp.

The sandwich will automatically be dipped in broth on one side, allowing you to grasp it with the drier side without it falling apart. The broth with the beef made for a juicy, tender, flavorful sandwich.

Service wasn&#39;t the most cheery, but the order itself only took a short time to make.

Overall a good place to dine."

Currently, it&#39;s $9.99 for an Italian beef, large &#34;bag o&#39; fries&#34; and large drink. Peppers are an extra $0.49 and cheese sauce for the fries is $0.65. The soft drinks are Pepsi products.

This place makes a solid Italian beef. Big, juicy, and flavorful. Not the best in the whole wide world, but in my opinion one of the best in the area.

The fries are hot and plentiful. Typically could use a splash more of salt.

Today, my spouse got the Jimbo Mow the Lawn salad. It was terrible. It&#39;s like cucumber that tasted like pickles, tomatoes, pepperoncini, cappicola, cheese, green and black olives, iceberg lettuce, and onions. The cappicola was slimy. The whole salad came in huge hunks and you had to cut it yourself. The salad dressing was Ken&#39;s Italian salad dressing packets. Granted, you shouldn&#39;t go to an Italian beef place for a salad, but if you got one it shouldn&#39;t be disgusting. I need something at these places to get my health-conscious spouse to go.

Also, service tends to be slow. Especially through the drive-thru. 

Based upon the roast beef because that&#39;s the claim to fame, four stars"

I ordered a combo so I got to try it with the italian sausage and that was pretty decent, but nothing spectacular also.  

On the good side, the peppers they put on the sandwich was super hot, much spicier than Portillo&#39;s.  The fries here were also awesome, I couldn&#39;t stop eating them and they give you so much!

So this is the 2nd time I&#39;ve had the beef and have been quite let down by it both times despite the great reviews.  They do claim to be a pizza place, so maybe I&#39;ll have to try that out next, but I think I will avoid the Italian beef the next time around."

Tore &amp; Luke&#39;s caught my attention, being so close to Knupper&#39;s on the other side of the road. It looked more enticing than most of the chain places out that way. We came inside to cool off and give them a try.

The place is big inside - cavernous huge - with a high ceiling and plenty of floor space. Overhead, there&#39;s a large model of a WW II era fighter plane. There&#39;s also a giant deer head, a trophy swordfish and plenty of kitsch from yesteryear in the form of signs, old black &amp; white photos and cars. There&#39;s even a multi-shelf glass cabinet with rows of miniature Model T Fords my kids stopped to admire while we waited for our food. 

I&#39;d compare this place to Portillo&#39;s in terms of its range of menu items. It&#39;s both a hot dog/burger joint and an Italian place with pasta and pizza. After trying things from both sides of their menu, I think they execute both very well. My wife and I both ordered grilled Maxwell Polish while my kids got cheese pizza and a size of pasta. We also got a side of fries. 

Serving sizes are huge. For starters, the side order of fries alone would have been enough for all 4 of us - probably equal to 4 packets of small fries served by a well-known chain with Mc in its name. The Polish sausages were served on thick Gonnella Italian bread rolls, with what I think may have been a bit of butter inside for an even better taste. The Polish was as long as the bread it was served on and quite filling.

The cheese pizza was great too and both my kids enjoyed their slices. The pizza is a medium-thin crust, soft - not crisp, with cheese right up to the edges and a little carmelized on the outer perimeter. The slices are slender but long, which also makes them a generous serving size too. I&#39;d definitely go for their pizza in a future visit if I&#39;m out there again.

In all, it was a pleasant lunch in a spacious and cozy place. Tore &amp; Luke&#39;s is definitely worth a visit if you&#39;re out in Palatine looking for a good meal."

Two hot dogs, fries and a drink for $10 is just a little steep for me. I can do the same at Frannie&#39;s on River Road for about half as much. Now, part of the reason for the price is certainly due to the humongous bag of fries that comes with the order, which were very good. But I just don&#39;t need that many fries. Would have been more satisfied had they given me 1/2 or 1/3 of the order of fries and charged $8. 

The hot dogs were fine - came with the neon type relish which is cool. But in my opinion, it&#39;s hard to botch up a hot dog, so I&#39;m not making any Iron Chef declarations here. 

The relatively new location is nice - much better facility though they did sacrifice some visibility from the corner they used to be on. I&#39;ll be back and maybe try a beef or combo when I return. That will be more telling of whether or not my star count goes up or down."

The Italian Beef is one of the best I have ever had.  The hot peppers on the side are some of the best as well.  They have a lot of other great food as well.  The hot dogs &amp; pizza are a few of my other favorites.  


Not only is the facility state of the art but the drive thru is easy to get in &amp; out of &amp; the parking lot is big &amp; easy to get a parking spot.  


Overall this is one of my favorite places to go for an Italian Beef &amp; I look forward to eating here again."

I&#39;ve been going here since it was a tiny little shack of a restaurant. The burgers, fries and shakes are the best things on the menu by far. The bag of fries are gigantic and the burgers are perfect. But a warning on the fries, they can easily be shared between 2-3 people. First time I ate here, I was shocked when I got my fries and there was no way I was able to finish them and also my burger. So it&#39;s best if you can bring someone to share the fries with. The only bad thing is that the food is not very healthy. Get ready to spend the rest of next week working it off. But it&#39;s totally worth it. The interior and ambiance is laid back and casual. They also have a nice outdoor patio as well."

Yes the new building is nice and large with a lot of seating. (very nice outdoor patio as well) Yes there are several flat screen TVs.. however all of that can not make up for the food and the high prices.

We both ordered the Italian beef. 2 Italian beefs, one large fry and 2 large drinks cost $19.38.

Gonella bread.. so that&#39;s a good thing. I was surprised at the small serving of beef and how tough it was. Not to mention stringy and bland. Really you are from Chicago how can you not season your Italian beef. At least put some salt and pepper in the gravy. The sweet peppers were mushy and flavorless.  I was surprised that my bread was tearing apart from the juice yet the beef itself was dry, don&#39;t know how they figured out how to do that and not add seasoning to anything.  

The fries are good and I would go back for them, if McDonald&#39;s was closed and I had to have for face certain death.

Next time I&#39;ll drive down Dundee to Portillo&#39;s and get the beef there.

Sorry folks, I need to take a pass on this place."

The location of this place has much potential, but it is best to leave it alone and let it fail. These owners haven&#39;t much business in the food industry... I know the menu prices are low, and I understand you get what you pay for, but c&#39;mon. 

Note to owners: When you make a beef sandwich... 1. using bread that is incredibly chewy is a bad idea.. try toasting the bread. 2. using beef that is dry and tasteless is a bad idea 3. hardly putting &#39;juice&#39; on the sandwich is a no-no. 4. try shredded cheese (melts easier) instead of low quality sliced cheese. 5. when someone orders chicken fingers, try not to include pieces of  fries mixed in the chicken fingers bag.. it leaves the customer wondering how in the world they ended up with pieces of fries mixed with their chicken fingers (are things sanitary? were the employees paying attention? and so on)."

We ordered the cheeseburgers, fries and a slice of pizza.  The burgers were very good, and the french fries were just like McDonald&#39;s, only slightly better tasting and a whole lot more of them.  The pizza was just so-so, and I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again, but I&#39;d come back for the burgers sometime.  When we were there, it wasn&#39;t very busy (around 2pm on a Saturday), but it still took a while to get the food.

While walking in I noticed the patio layout, half under cover, other half open air with a nice looking fireplace for warmth during cooler summer evenings, very impressive.  The interior was a lot bigger, open &amp; more modern than the old location, but what confused me was why there were only 3 tables of people at 1pm during the week, which usually isn&#39;t a good sign.  As I checked out the menu, I realized why the place was so empty, their prices.  A hot dog, bag o fries &amp; drink meal was $6.85 which is pretty high.  So I opted for the hot dog, small fries &amp; slice of pizza deal with no drink (I got a cup of water instead) which was around $7.75.  The hot dog was a typical Vienna, nothing to write home about, the pizza was decent, didn&#39;t taste like it was sitting around, and the fries were alright &amp; plentiful.  I felt I got a good amount of food for the price I paid compared to some of the other combinations they offer.

Next my wife ordered the turkey croissant.  The croissant was freezer burned served with one very thin slice of turkey dry and they forgot the mayo even after reminding them twice.  Instead she got a freezer burnt lettuce and tomatoe croissant, very appetizing.  When we tried to take hers back for something else, the guy rolled his eyes at us, grabbed the sandwich out of my hands slammed the window in our face and let us sit there not knowing if he was remaking it, giving us a refund or what.  At this point we were so disgusted with the way they treated their customers  and the quality of the food, we just left.  Yes, out the money and out the lunches.  Do you really think we would have trusted these people to give us something else?  They probably would have spit in our food, no thanks see ya never to go back again.

I NEED an Italian beef!  Today was such a day and I&#39;m left to ask myself once again, why did I pick this place again?

OK, for whatever reason, I&#39;ve gotten the #3 lunch special here a bunch of times over the last few months and always leave disappointed.  I&#39;ll say the pizza slices look good, but since I always end up here with a beef craving, that&#39;s how I base my review- on the Beef/Fries/medium drink combo.

The beef itself is pretty dry.  And not well seasoned either- very plain and cooked almost to death.  I order mine hot &amp; juicy.  The hot part they get right- a nice amount of peppers and veggies, chopped small and spread evenly across the beef.  But the juicy part is totally not good.  First- I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s not actual beef juice and probably never had anything to do with the beef until it hit my sandwich!  It&#39;s incredibly oily, like they squeezed the giardiniera oil all over the bun, but with no flavor- ewh.  So since the &#34;juice&#34; lacks any real seasoning or beef flavor, it just makes your sandwich a gross greasy mess.  Ok, today there was a faint flavor to the oil.  Are you ready for this?  FISH!  Yup, somehow, my juicy beef had a faint flavor of fishiness.  I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s grosser- that or the fact that I was so hungry I ate it anyway!?!

So the icing on the cake is always the price- $7.99 for a beef combo!?!  Yeah- I&#39;m the fool who spent $9.20 w/tax on a fishy, greasy, oily beef today.  At least the beef is really big, so it&#39;s not a total rip.  Will I fall for this place&#39;s beef lunch again?  No!  But I&#39;ll give &#39;em another shot for a slice of Pizza sometime."

This place is fantastic. I&#39;m enjoying my first taste now - traditional chicken with veggies and vindaloo with garlic naan and samosas.  The vindaloo is great - plenty of heat but not overwhelming. I can get the heat but also taste plenty of the other flavors. The veggies might be my favorite part - peppers and onions. The chicken is excellent as well.

The naan is great. I like it a LITTLE bit crispier and fresh out of a clay oven, but I&#39;m not complaining. The samosa is crispy and flaky and the tamarind nicely works with the heat of the vindaloo.

Excellent place and fast. In and out in minutes. I&#39;ll be coming back again."

At last they have opened and it is exactly what I had hoped for and anticipated.  This place is basically the Chipotle of Indian food.  You order at the counter and move along the sequential menu.  First you select the &#34;style&#34; of your meal.  Your choices are naan on the side, rice/biryani, or pieces of naan just thrown in the bowl.  It looks like they will be adding further options beyond these eventually.  After you choose the style of the dish you then pick the bulk of your meal, either a meat or paneer or tofu.  Next you choose a topping - I don&#39;t remember all the choices, but I did veggies and hubby did potatoes.  Finally, you choose the curry sauce, bearing in mind whether you like things spicy or not.  If you are a newbie to this sort of food, or just want to try something out first before committing, the staff is very willing to let you sample whatever you need to.

I ordered the lamb biryani, tikka style, with garlic naan.  My husband got paneer in whatever they call their cream sauce and also got garlic naan.  We were both super satisfied with our food.  HOWEVER, remember I said this is the Chipotle of Indian food, not the Alinea of Indian food.  That means, yes, I have had better naan elsewhere, blah blah, but I feel that Tandoori Indian Grill has successfully executed the concept they set out to and I hope they are around for a long time.  Moreover, this place is especially great for folks who may not usually do Indian food, or who are afraid of spicy, such as my husband.  The food is customizable, the place is easygoing and casual, and the staff is friendly and approachable.

In addition to the above named menu items, they also have an Indo-Chinese menu including hakka noodles and some other stuff, if that&#39;s more your style.  We&#39;ll definitely be back soon to sample the other things they have to offer.

Obviously this place is still super new and not everything on the menu is available yet, but so far we are impressed with the overall concept for the restaurant, the food (in view of the concept), and especially the friendly staff!  Here&#39;s hoping that our subsequent visits will continue to build on our great first impression.  Best wishes for success to all involved.  :)"

I got a chicken tikka rice bowl and it was superb. I was pretty skeptical at first that they would be able to blend everything together perfectly but it worked out well. The tikka curry is bomb, very flavorful with not much heat. I only got the rice bowl and it cost a little over $7 and it filled me up.

My friend got the biryani rice w/ lamb but no curry and a garlic naan on the side, and she loved it. I stole a few bites and the lamb was tender with a lot of flavor. The garlic naan stole the show too, so I might have to mix it up next time and get the traditional bowl instead of the rice bowl. The biryani rice had bits of vegetables like cut peppers and onions and was very flavorful. It costs $1 extra but I think it&#39;s well worth the extra flavor. I&#39;m very surprised that their prices are similar to Chipotle, seems like a Lamb bowl will run you around $9 with tax. I can&#39;t wait to try more curries eeeeeekk!

The food is EXCELLENT and I love the convenience of being able to carry out what usually would be an hour lunch at a sit down restaurant. The garlic naan is incredible and the samosas are on point (the filling is wonderful)! I had the naan pieces with lamb vindaloo and the potatoes - I am not big on rice so the naan pieces were a wonderful addition to the menu!

One chooses the rice, then meat, the topping, finally the curry.  The curry&#39;s tend to be a bit sweet and most are all tomatoey based.  Fortunately the salt level are low unlike most Indian places which was good.  We had both chose lamb.  The lamb is tender, and intended for those who are not really into lamb, as the lamb taste was weak.

Price is good we spent $21 including soda.

I gave it two stars as the food is Indian like, in the same way Chipotle is not Mexican.   So if one is expecting traditional Indian food this is not the place and you most likely will be disappointed."

Good food but I have serious doubts that the business model can sustain at the current price levels. They need to cut the prices in their current menu by at least $2 to make sense.

Rice, protein, side and a samosas or naan for $9-$10 before tax is too much in current economy where I can get w good meal at chipotle for $6.50. It&#39;s a fast food place charging more than buffet prices."

The food has been a bit inconsistent our last few visits.  The naan which we enjoyed so much  has often been less fresh and a bit dried out.  The sauces have become a bit spicier - we preferred the slightly milder versions.  There is also too much sauce in proportion to meat.  It would be nice if there was a divider for the veggies too so they do not get inundated by the sauce.  Just a bit of tweaking and more consistency is all that is needed.  The concept is great.

I met two friends here for brunch on a Saturday morning.  It was packed, and the service was lacking, but my problem was with the food.  My skillet was the greasiest, grossest soaking pile of potatoes and eggs that I&#39;d ever had!  I literally felt ill afterwards.  Some of the potatoes were so shiny and soggy that I couldn&#39;t even pick them up with a fork.  Also, their upcharge pricing for substitutions is ridiculous for the suburbs -- $4 to make my two pancakes gluten free?  Really?  For $15 before tip, I had a more expensive and worse-tasting brunch than I&#39;d had anywhere else in the area.

My friend seemed to like her potato pancakes, so maybe the skillets are just not their best item? But I sure won&#39;t come here again.  Head on over to Billy&#39;s or Wildberry instead if you want a good brunch option for your money."

I&#39;m not too much of a fan of sweet but based on a sampling of their signature pumpkin pancakes... agree they are good... and relieved to note they had swapped out the BAD coffee they were experimenting with the previous visit... so no negatives to note in this review.

They listen to the customers... it wasn&#39;t just our table of four that was noting how awful and weak the coffee was... yay.

Service is good and I recommend sharing if you are getting an omelet... otherwise expect leftovers. Not convenient if you are heading out for the day."

Sure, I&#39;ll occasionally drag myself out of bed to meet up with overly perky, energetic &amp; highly annoying &#34;morning&#34; people from time to time....Why? cause I do LOVE breakfast foods (and people)...
More savory than sweet to be honest and Red Apple delivers to ALL who crave BOTH.

I&#39;m a huge fan of this place for so many reasons...they serve an extensive variety of breakfast &amp; lunch items that just tastes fresh and home made..I&#39;ve
dined in &amp; ordered carry-out countless times..

The restaurant is located on Plum Grove, and you enter via parking lot (located in front of entrance), which can fill up really quick, especially on weekends.  I wouldn&#39;t have noticed this place, had other&#39;s who worked in the area not mentioned it... I imagine its easy to miss, as I&#39;ve drove past it many times in the past.

Some favorites -   The oven baked omelets.  DELICIOUS.  Cooked to perfection..I usually get
&#34;My Big Fat Greek Omelet&#34; (sans tomato &amp; onion) w/hashbrowns and it&#39;s enormous...fluffy...full of fresh spinach &amp; good amount of feta you can taste...I can never finish this and end up bringing the rest home.  I&#39;ve also had them substitute egg beaters or egg whites and it&#39;s just as delicious and fluffy...I love the hash browns too...crispy and tender.  Not all restaurants can perfect a crispy, shredded hash brown....

Of all the sweet breakfast options here, I have only had the Buttermilk pancakes and they were pretty yummy.   Really tender and soft; not &#39;cakey&#39;.  I&#39;m picky with pancakes, and these cooks know how to make them.... They have 13 pancake varieties...and they all sound amazing...not to mention a great selection of Waffles, French toasts, Crepes, Skillets, Biscuits &amp; Gravy, Eggs Benedict....(I need to try ALL of these and make up for lost breakfast time...).

Salads and soups are some of my menu favorites &amp; are excellent.  &#34;The Popeye&#34; (fresh spinach, sliced mushrooms, hard boiled egg &amp; crisp bacon) w/a cup of soup...has been my &#39;go to&#39; many a time...always fresh..THE SOUPS?
Omg, they make wonderful HOME MADE soups here, offering 2-3 choices which vary daily,  Sometimes, I just order the soup.  They&#39;ll include 2-3 of their house made rolls in bag, &amp; I&#39;m set..  Cream of chicken w/wild rice is a must get (or Lentil or Split pea...all fantastic, and not &#34;heavy&#34;). Egg Lemon soup is offered on Sundays &amp; is VERY popular, LOVE THIS... The corned beef Rueben is excellent too and the portion is huge...

I haven&#39;t eaten anything I didn&#39;t like here. It is always consistently good.  They have daily menu board specials that are unique for a coffee shop/cafe...Salmon, Wraps, Paninis&#39; &amp; homemade chili!.
Red Apple keeps it interesting. Offering traditional breakfast &amp; lunch items with out-of-the ordinary eats, you wouldn&#39;t expect in a homey, casual diner...

Prices are reasonable, staff is super friendly and accommodating, portions are generous...Food is tasty &amp; fresh and reminds me of home cooking...You could probably walk in with your PJ&#39;s on and feel right at home....it&#39;s definitely &#34;laxed&#34; here....

Only thing I don&#39;t like about Red Apple?  THEY CLOSE AT 3:00...They are popular people... Greek owners &amp; Sam is delightful!....OPEN EVERYDAY..  I recommend stopping in EARLY on weekends cause they can pack in a crowd.....

**Free coffee BEFORE 11AM on weekdays, w/purchase of $5.99 meal**

Waitress said she&#39;d be back with the coffee, but she never did come back with it! Our food came out quickly by another waitress and we told her we never got our coffee. She immediately sprang into action and got it for us. Our original waitress did apologize for that. She then checked on us several times throughout the meal and also refilled our coffee.

We both had the Denver omelette, hash browns, and pancakes. The food was delicious - one of the best omelettes I&#39;ve ever had; just oozing with cheese. Not greasy. Hash browns were perfect, being crisp on the outside but not burnt. Pancakes were good, but nothing outstanding. Coffee was mediocre.

I wasn&#39;t sure that I felt like the usual standbys so we ventured a little further north to stop in at the Red Apple. 

This is a pretty large restaurant which meant that even though the parking lot was just about full, we didn&#39;t have to wait for our table. Score!  My husband was thrilled that he could watch college football with a choice view right from his seat. 

I really was leaning toward some crunchy almond French toast served with bananas and caramel, but I really am counting my calories and I think that would have put me at the limit until about Tuesday. Instead, I opted for a chicken salad sandwich on sourdough toast. He chose corned beef hash, two poached eggs, hash browns and a side of pancakes instead of toast. My sandwich was really good. I stuck to half and that was plenty. I was surprised to find the toast was buttered, so while it tasted great, the menu didn&#39;t provide a heads up on that one. The French fries were very good, but most of those came home for someone else to enjoy. His poached eggs were just right!  

The service was very attentive. The whole visit really was a pleasant surprise. I am confident that we will head in again."

I took a gander around to see what everyone was having.  Everything looked great and in good portions.   Everyone walking out the door had leftover tins.

With those customer service skills I am not interested giving you my business because clearly they don&#39;t care about the customer.

When you figure that, most days, my training diet doesn&#39;t allow food until 11 or 12, it takes on a whole new meaning. 
So when we finally found a weekend day to visit Red Apple Pancake house, we were ecstatic. Finally an opportunity to nosh on all the goodness my Yelp compadres have gushed about.
We were seated almost immediately, at a 4 seater table next to the fireplace. The interior is decorated with a country kitchen feel, but tastefully. You get a warm sense of being home, minus the cooking and cleanup.
Before us was a menu loaded with every combination possible, of fresher cooked goodies. It took us some time to land a decision, what with all the incredible combinations and choices. Skirt steak and eggs, with blueberry pancakes for me, the BF got a Mediterranean omelet with avocado, fruit on the side, and a fresh baked blueberry muffin. (Which was still warm from the oven) 
Food came flying out to the table in a matter of minutes and we dove into the perfectly prepped plates before us. Our waiter was super personable, had us laughing and kept our coffee cups full.
This is how you do breakfast. 
Upon leaving, there was a small line. The hostess apologized and chatted with us before Sam, (an owner) rang us out. Both of them were so polite and happy to have us- it just made the experience that much better. 
Everything about this place will keep me coming back. It has that family feel that other breakfast chains truly can&#39;t compete  with. It&#39;s how a breakfast deprived girl (me) wants all of her binge breakfasts to be."

Breakfast items are consistently well done. Soups are homemade. Overall very happy with the quality of the food. Service usually acceptable and I have been back several times. We have never been here for lunch so I cannot speak to the lunch items. Omelets are large and fluffy, hash browns are crisp, coffee is diner coffee nothing special there. Overall its an old school breakfast place that churns out consistently good food. Other breakfast places in the area are either unacceptable or overpriced."

My friends and I have been going to their other location for years, and I haven&#39;t been since we moved an hour North.  I was super excited when I realized that Red Apple has another location which is much closer to us.

There is only 1 thing I get when I go to Red Apple.  In fact, I dream about it.  Their strawberry crepes are out of this world!  I don&#39;t get the glaze or anything, just 2 simple crepes stuffed with fresh strawberries.  I&#39;m not sure if they changed the crepe batter across the board, if it&#39;s a specialty reserved for the other location, or if maybe the chef was having a bad day, but what I got was an awful eggy mess.  It seriously tasted like I was eating a sweet egg omelet with a few pieces of strawberries strewn about.  It didn&#39;t come with whipped cream or powdered sugar this time, and it sort of reminded me of a lunch cafeteria&#39;s Monday &#34;mystery meat&#34; special.  I choked down 1 crepe, and boxed up the other one out of respect for what I&#39;ve had in the past.

Nothing else that we ate was that spectacular either, and with several other winning breakfast places, in the area, Red Apple will be a skip for us (unless we can get to their other location)."

Their Bacon has the best flavor and I always order extra side order. We never had a bad soup here either as all their soups are delicious. One item they have had lately for breakfast is the Lemon Pancakes ... excellent!! For lunch the Super Grilled Cheese is our favorite. The one item that I wish they would add to the Lunch Menu is a nice Chopped Steak with grilled onions. They make a great Patty Melt so it could not be much more to make Chopped Steaks too.

Our servers cared more about a table of screaming out-of-town soccer kids than us.  We never got coffee refilled, our order was wrong and cold, and took forever to place our order (even though we were there well before the screaming brats with badly behaved parents).  Management did nothing to correct the problem other than taking the coffee off our bill (big deal, we each only got about 4 ounces to begin with).  

I hate it when people complain here but never complain in person about a bad experience.  But we politely complained and didn&#39;t get any resolution.  So now I&#39;m telling you about it here.

I am SO GLAD I stopped going to this overrated pit because we have found so many superior restaurants including Gus&#39; Diner and Mr. Allison&#39;s to dine at instead.

Not as good as a place such as Wildberry but when Wildberry has a wait time that is too long at times,  where we don&#39;t have the 40 minutes to wait every time, we default go here as a first alternative as it is also close to Wildberry in terms of location for us.

The only thing they need to improve breakfast-wise is there toast, it&#39;s terrible.  That is a huge disappointment when i go to a restaurant and the toast sucks.  They need good bread, such as the kind you get at places like Whole Foods, Fresh Market, Antonio&#39;s market in Arlington heights, etc.  you get the point, it&#39;s low-end bread they are using so the toast here has no substance or flavor.  It&#39;s the kind of toast you find at cheap establishments and these guys are better than that.  So do not know why they skimp on getting a little more expensive bread, especially good multigrain.  When i say better i mean that it needs to be thicker more hearty whole grain bred with either stuff like oats, sunflower seeds, etc on top that you find in higher end supermarkets if that makes sense.  More density."

I&#39;ve had great experiences here and I&#39;ve had &#34;meh&#34; experiences here. 
The last adventure was more meh. 

Everything felt rushed but also took awhile. It was an odd feeling, especially for breakfast. 

My wife ordered gluten-free pancakes. Their fluffiness made her woeful that maybe they weren&#39;t gluten-free but kudos to RAPH if they were :)

It&#39;s standard breakfast fare on a pretty big breakfast menu.

I&#39;ve tried a lot of restaurants including Mr Allisons, Billy&#39;s Pancake House, Dunton House, Egg Harbor Cafe, Cafe Fourteen, Maxfield&#39;s Restaurant, Jason&#39;s Deli, Wildberry Cafe, Ritzy&#39;s Cafe, Walker Brothers, Egglectic Cafe, Denny&#39;s, Bakers Square, etc.

Criteria that I look for include food, service, parking, prices, variety, freshness, decor, and method of handling the long lines. Red Apple manages to excel in pretty much all these categories. Food is always in large portions, fresh, consistent, and well planned in execution (although Egg Harbor Cafe wins here). Service is quick and friendly. They try to offer new menu items from time to time and have a decently large menu. Decor is a bit above average although not as nice as Wildberry Cafe. All in all, it&#39;s pretty hard not to have a good experience here.

In fact, I was debating whether I should write another review for Red Apple. It&#39;s already quite popular and if more people find out about this hidden gem, I&#39;ll have a harder time getting a seat on the weekends =p. I&#39;m very impressed though with how well they brace the Yelp community and listen to customer suggestions. They have better coffee now and cut back on how sugary or salty some items were. This makes it pretty safe to order nearly anything off the menu now and be impressed. The one area that could still be improved are the soups since the standards are done well but sometimes some of the new flavors (like pumpkin or yolk with lemon) aren&#39;t always that great. If they can make soups as good as Maxfield&#39;s Restaurant, then there&#39;s really no weakness at all in their cooking.

Once again, for specific items that stood out in my mind:

Philly Steak Sandwich, Strip Steak Sandwich: Delicious, flavorful beef without really being salty. The fries here are great although a cup of fruit goes well also.

Huevos Rancheros: Normally I&#39;m not a big fan of this dish but this is really well done.

Banana Pecan Crepes: Delicious with a great texture and plenty of nuts. Sometimes the crepe is crispy as well, which puts this over the top.

Tiramisu crepes: Not on the menu but I think it&#39;s even better than the pancake version. It&#39;s a tough one to debate but I&#39;d be happy with either one.

White chocolate pancakes: A surprise for people who don&#39;t usually eat white chocolate. A bit better to ask them to go light on the raspberries so that the white chocolate flavor is more prominent.

All omelettes are light and fluffy with a great mix of cheese as well as skillets. Butcher Block and Mile High Denver are my choices with omelettes and red apple special  and vegetarian for skillets.

I liked all 6 benedicts. This is probably the one category of breakfast food that Red Apple wins hands down. Most other places have a hollandaise sauce with an unusual consistency or strange flavor. Red Apple also gets the best texture from their poached eggs of any of the nearby restaurants.

Apple orchard chicken, strawberry fields (if it&#39;s strawberry season), and popeye would be my favorite salads.

California and triple decker would be my favorite deli sandwiches.

The muffins they sell in the front are quite good too. It&#39;s not as soft as Costco&#39;s or as fragrant as Mariano&#39;s but it&#39;s quite crunchy with nice fresh ingredients inside.

I&#39;ll keep looking around to see if any other restaurants can change my mind. I see lots of new construction happening recently so we&#39;ll see."

Red Apple Pancake House is good, don&#39;t get me wrong (if I could I would give it 3 1/2 stars), but I wasn&#39;t wowed. We came here on a Saturday morning. From the looks of the parking lot, it looked like there would be a wait. There wasn&#39;t. The parking lot is just awful. We were seated right away and were asked if we wanted anything to drink by 2 people (I have to say, the service was probably the best part about this place). 

The menu is pretty big - they have your standard breakfast and American lunch foods. Pancakes, waffles, omelettes, crepes, sandwiches, soups, salads, skillets, etc.  I decided on an omelette, and my friend got a waffle. We both said it wasn&#39;t bad, just not great. The food was a little bland, his egg whites had some yolks in it, and my omelette was a little dry. It just wasn&#39;t the wow factor I was looking for.

My friends and I came here on a Sunday around 10 after Wildberry down the street had a 45 minute wait.  Turns out, if we wanted better service and better food, we just should have stayed at the tried and true Wildberry.

Our

Waitress

Was

Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad.    Abhorrent, abominable, appalling, beastly, detestable, disagreeable, disgusting, dreadful, lousy, *obnoxious*.

Shall I continue?

Good points:
Being seated right away
The Dum Dum lollipop I scored while paying.

Bad points:
Everything else.

I don&#39;t know what happened since my first review.  What the WHAT?!  I have been back a few times since then, and it has all gone downhill.  

Last time was the worst, though.  We were seated right away, like I said, and about 4 seconds after we sat down, our surly waitress (an older lady who should REALLY understand that waitressing is NOT FOR EVERYONE) slumps over and asks if we&#39;re ready.  We were there for less than thirty seconds at this point.

So, no.

We perused the menu for less than thirty seconds, and she comes back AGAIN (so TWICE in less than a minute) and says &#34;So what will it be&#34;.

IT&#39;LL *BE* ANOTHER FEW MINUTES.  Chill, woman.

The rest of the meal went exactly like this.  When ordering, we were barked at, snapped at, when I asked for egg whites, it was met with a sigh, and when I asked for the pancakes instead of the toast (which is an option and not a special order or anything), she rolled her eyes and acted like it was this huge inconvenience.  

Then our food took a reeeeeeeeally long time.  Which was fine because we were busy chatting, but other tables who were even seated after we were and ordered well after us got their food earlier.  Oh well!

So then we finally get our food, and she drops off the check with it.  Well, we weren&#39;t even near ready to leave (we hadn&#39;t even taken a bite of the food), and after that, she just kept coming back and rushing us to leave.  She asked me if I wanted a box while I was MID BITE.  Um...I don&#39;t know...why don&#39;t you actually let me *finish* my food and then decide??

I don&#39;t know about you, but the more someone wants me out, the loooooonger I dwindle.  So my friends and I sat there for a good half an hour after eating, shooting the sh*t, talking about whatever, getting refills on coffee from the busboy, etc.

Our waitress would come by, roll her eyes, and she even said at one point &#34;I DID give you the check, right??&#34;.  Yup, we&#39;ve got it right here, thanks.  We&#39;re still not leaving.

My favorite part was when she started taking things off of our table to give to other tables (our ketchup, hot sauce, etc).  

We finally left when she and the manager (I assume) stood right next to our table and said VERY loudly that they needed this room for a small party so let&#39;s start moving people out (which seems like bad business to me in the first place--why even seat people in that little room, then??)  So they uprooted people and their meals and drinks just to move to different locations.  SO STRANGE.

Our bill was expensive $38 for the three of us for just breakfast.  And my friend said our waitress didn&#39;t even earn the tip I did give her.  

So here is my note to management: GET WAITRESSES WITH BETTER ATTITUDES.  It was not a very good dining experience..."

This is the best classic breakfast restaurant! We love the service from all the staff every time we go. French toast is perfect, not mushy, not the neon orange, just perfect. Pancakes are great, we get them every time. My husband loves the skillets and corn beef hash. I usually get a Benedict or omelette... The coffee is always fresh and they keep it coming throughout breakfast! Sunday&#39;s they have Greek lemon rice soup that is delicious! Highly recommend for a standard, dependable and consistent breakfast place. We usually go 2-3 times a month with our one year old and they are very accommodating with him!"

Pros: Great egg white omelet and fluffy pancakes 

Cons: Average/slow service and not the server&#39;s fault she was covering ten tables on busy Saturday morning. Server was rushing every time she came to our table. She was like a super woman, taking orders refiling coffee, and bringing orders out. We had to tell her what we needed like hot sauce or ketchup in two tries. If she had just taken 30 seconds to finish our sentence we could of told her everything at once. 

Please hire more help at least on a weekend. 

Coffee although hot it was under par, not to mention no fresh cream is just ridiculous.  

My wife had a skillet with scrambled eggs and it was worse skillet she had to the date. Eggs were dry/ skillet lacked flavor and not to mention potatoes were greasy. 

I will give another try to this place may be it was just bad day. Let you know when i return here with updated review. 

Enjoy

I ordered the blackberry banana pancakes, and asked for a half order (2 instead of 4). Apparently they don&#39;t do half orders except on some of their pancakes. ?? Seriously? I can&#39;t just order 2 pancakes? Nope. So I get four. I was excited about these pancakes, because they sound amazing. Not so much. I ate 1 and gave the rest to my husband.

He ordered a &#34;3-egg omelette&#34;... what came out looked like 8 eggs. OK, so I know this is America, and people like to eat their weight in food, and most people would probably be excited about the epic portion sizes. But I think it&#39;s gross, and nobody needs to eat that much. Anyway, the omelette wasn&#39;t great either. 

I had high hopes for this place... They do have a really large menu, so maybe we&#39;ll give it another chance and try something different. Overall, though, it was a disappointing experience."

red-apple-pancake-house-and-cafe-palatine,Andrew G.,f3ccR72Y75lLAP88VLd8Tw,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,0,7,28,ciXy2OyaLk8sMEp5MTBqEQ,2.0,2013-04-22,"Shambling into the Red Apple, my then-fiance and I had hoped to try something a bit different and mix it up from our usual weekend flair. Unfortunately, a majority of what we found left us more than a bit wishful that we&#39;d gone to our local Denny&#39;s.

The underlying issue with the Red Apple appears to be simply that they&#39;ve been around long enough to warrant resting on their laurels. Granted the wait to be seated was a mere 15 minutes, but that alone left us feeling like canned tuna amidst an all-too-small, claustrophobia inducing waiting area before being led back to a table swarmed by noise. It seemed off-putting, but would ultimately prove preferable to actually being seated.

Upon sitting down, it wasn&#39;t more than a full minute before our server Margaret came to the table. When taking our drink order, she seemed to assume that we&#39;d been one of the many to wait our way into the place before because she made clear an expectation that we order immediately. When we asked for a few minutes to peruse the menu, she actually scoffed at us and walked away. This further added to my chagrin about picking the place.

Seemingly heading to the orange grove out back to pick and squeeze the juice herself, when she finally did bring our drinks, her attitude seemed unaltered. Not wishing to upset our server further, heaven forbid, we placed our order. My fiance placed an order for eggs benedict and I for something mostly akin to a Denny&#39;s Lumberjack Slam, complete with waffles and an arrangement of sundries such as hash browns, sausage, etc.

Then we waited. And waited. And continued to wait for a bit. I watched multiple tables that had been seated after us that had ordered less receive their orders faster than us. I felt very much like Margaret was either punishing us for deliberating on our breakfast or the Red Army had suddenly rolled into the Red Apple for brunch. One eternity later, our food arrived.

I looked over my meal and was moderately satisfied that it had been cooked with a degree of competence. As Margaret turned to leave, I asked for additional butter and had her call over her shoulder as she walked away that it was on the table. Silly me. Sorry to have offended you with the inconvenience of being a patron, Margaret. After putting syrup and butter on my waffle, it was palatable, but little more than something I could have crafted with my iron at home. Honestly, I was starting to wish I had.

Disappointingly adding insult to injury, my fiance sampled her eggs benedict. After grimacing, she asked me to try them. The Hollendaise sauce tasted as though it had been simmering for most of the morning, lacking any remote freshness, the poached eggs we solid on the inside, and the English muffin halves was stale. She asked for a bit of my waffle and I happily obliged, of course.

After finishing the waffle and the mediocre sides, we were once again approached by our waitress. She didn&#39;t bother to ask if we wanted more juice or water, both of which had been empty for some time, but was more than happy to drop the check on the table. As she walked away, my fiance called out that we actually wanted to order something else. Margaret walked back with the belabored enthusiasm of a scolded child as my fiance wanted a waffle for us to, again, split. 

Finishing the second between us, we didn&#39;t bother to have anything wrapped up and took the amended check to the front. As we made our way, it was then that Margaret opted then to try and make friendly small talk, but at that point we just wanted to get out of the place. We settled with the woman at the front and silently exchanged glances as we left.

We haven&#39;t since gone back and I sincerely doubt that anytime in the future will see us making a repeat trip to the Red Apple. I understand that everyone and every place is capable of a bad day, but we must have caught both our waitress and the eatery at the same time given the poor first and last impression we had as we left. 

We should&#39;ve gone to Denny&#39;s."

We made a reservation as there were 10 of us and they cramped us into a table in a side room when there was a bigger table in the main room.  

The server was very good, very attentive.  Quickly got us drinks and coffee and gave us the perfect amount of time to look over the sizable menu.  We made our order and waited a very short time (for a party of 10) for the food to come out.

Eight of us got our order on the first wave from the server.  Everyone liked what they had.  It was the last two that were a disaster.  We both had omelettes and neither was cooked all the way through.  How do you serve someone a ham and cheese omelette where you can clearly see the cheese wasn&#39;t even melted and the eggs were creating a puddle from not being cooked?

I cut into mine and was repulsed to the point of I was off food for the rest of the day.  Add in that the toast I was served had no color what so ever.  It could have just been stale for all I knew.

While they tried to offer me another item, I didn&#39;t bother.  They did take it off the bill, but they made no apologies and basically said &#34;Oh well&#34;.

I won&#39;t be going back."

But this past visit was really good. My friend had a HUGE greek omelet that was loaded with feta chunks. I had something off the specials menu called the nutella delight. OH MY GOD! It was amazing on french toast. Basically globs of nutella and a sweet cream. Also drizzles of chocolate and whipped cream. TALK about a calorie bomb but CRAP was it good!!!

Have to agree with most everyone on here, the service was quick and the portions are indeed MASSIVE.

I ordered a fairly basic breakfast of two scrambled eggs with hash browns, bacon and an english muffin.

There weren&#39;t two scrambled eggs on my plate...there had to have been at least SIX! No lie. The eggs were quite tasty, too. 

Wish I could say the same for the hash browns. They were more of your small potato slices than your usual shredded fare. While they weren&#39;t terrible, they didn&#39;t taste as good as they looked. The bacon pieces were hefty strips that wrapped around the mound of eggs.

Overall, satisfied and very, very full when finished.

There&#39;s nothing crazy, fancy, or unique about it. Their menu is comprised of just your good old, standard, breakfast and lunch favorites. ((Pancakes, French toast, crepes, omelettes, skillets, etc. You get the idea)) 

The portions are huge. Actually, they&#39;re massive. So I recommend keeping that in mind when ordering. And for the price, it&#39;s even better. I also love the fact that they have several healthy dishes with egg whites and veggies, and sides of granola and fruit. My fave is Slim Sarah&#39;s Omelette with egg whites, mushrooms, and spinach - served with a fruit cup and dry English muffin. My egg whites were cooked perfectly. Light, fluffy, and not over-cooked. 

For parents out there, I caution you if your kiddos order the chocolate chip pancakes. They are beyond loaded with chocolate chips. And although us adults enjoy such a treat once in a while, my 5 year old nephew who ate them was bouncing off the walls afterwards. ((Hilarious for me, painful for my sister!!))

Cranberry pancakes should have cranberries cooked in them, instead they over-cooked regular pancakes and but some cranberries on top. Lame.

You could have made an old Wendy&#39;s commercial out of it but instead of &#34;Where&#39;s the beef?&#34; it would be &#34;Where&#39;s the apples?&#34; Flat, tasteless, and keep digging to try to find any apple slices.  My son had the egg white veggie omelet and he only ate half of it, saying it tasted like scrambled eggs. 

The restaurant is PACKED so I expect the food is outstanding but every plate served at our table was below par. Did the regular cook take the day off?

My husbands benedict wasn&#39;t a traditional benedict. The yolk was soft and not runny and the hollandaise sauce tasted like it was from a packet. Both of our dishes were just not very good. 

Our waitress however was awesome. She constantly made sure our coffee mugs were filled and was always checking to see if we were ok. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, (and there&#39;s alot on their menu) but messing up on the benedict and omelet is reason enough for us not to come back."

It came with two large eggs, mushroom/onion/spinach sauté and salsa, with a cup of three kinds of fresh fruits and hash-brown.

I laughed, I even noticed 2 of the waitresses from PI came over to Red Apple, I spoke with one and she said things just werent the same anymore.  Anyway I digress.

They also do potatoes not hash browns for their sides and skillets. This is key because hash browns just look and taste incredibly greasy and inedible. 

Their potatoes are fantastic ... I think they use Lawry&#39;s seasoning on them, but am not too sure. 

The waitress was great and the food came out fast. They did mess up one order out of 6 but quickly mended the problem. 

The only negative I can give this place is that the dining room is kinda of tightly packed. I hate having to watch out whenever I walk or have to push my chair back for fear of hitting someone. 

We went on a Sunday morning, 11AM, no wait time. Prices are reasonable and the coffee is good. I will definitely be back when I am in the neighborhood for breakfast. 

Also a big negative ... they need to get faster more efficient, powerful hand dryers in the washroom. It takes a good 5 minutes to dry your hands."

Had driven past it for years and never had the opportunity to stop.  I was really missing out!  Ate there for the first time with my Mom and boyfriend this past weekend.  Cute interior with an apple theme and a bucket of apples for patrons to take when leaving.
1.  The staff is kind and welcoming.  When my Mom comes on her own, the staff walks her to her car, as she uses a cane.  Now that is service!
2.  The omelets were fantastic!  I had the veggie and my boyfriend had the portabella.  My Mom had the Popeye crepes, which were big enough to serve two.  I opted for the yummy thick toast and fresh fruit; and a side of crisp bacon.  My boyfriend had the out of this world pumpkin pancakes topped with a big dollop of cinnamon butter.  The bite I had was heavenly!
3.  We chatted for a long time and were never rushed or hurried.  When we paid, my Mom was given a bag containing an ample serving of soup and a cranberry muffin - as the restaurant was closing for the day.  

It has several flat screen TV&#39;s which honestly I could do without.  Many tables contained kids, so this is a good option for families.  Plates are delicious and bountiful and was trying hard to please every patron.

I had the a burger (choice of 3 different types of buns). It was cooked to perfection and had great flavor. The fries were tasty and my friend had the Mozzarella sticks and the bang bang shrimp. We both enjoyed our food.

I had the Hawaiian chicken sandwich and it tasted like it was cooked in a cremator. It was just a chicken breast on a bad bun with a slice of cheese. No pineapple or teriyaki flavor.

I&#39;ve had a burger on both occasions and they were OK, but nothing to write home about.  I just stick with the regular, fresh-cut fries and they are quite good.  &#34;Specialty&#34; burgers have almost become a commodity in the past 10 years.  Where once I would rate Crossroads&#39; burger as very good, in comparison to other pub burgers, they are now just middle of the pack.        
On this most recent visit, my wife ordered the Cobb salad.  When asked, she said it was &#34;OK&#34;.

The bartender on this past Monday was very friendly and told us the beer and food specials without asking.  She was very nice.

This would have been a two-star review but I have bumped up another star because A) the bartender was so nice and B) they still have Church Street Beer on tap (Heavenly Helles).  Those factors alone might keep me coming back."

After 45 minutes, my husband had to walk up to the bar and ask for another round of beers and ask about our food. (The waitress never came back after our initial order) my frustration really heightened when I saw people who were sat in the restaurant section much later then us, enjoying their wings...At this point, my husband was told that the reason for the delay in receiving our order was because we ordered pizza...Now I was really confused...we ordered 2 appetizers first?  After all is said and done, over an hour after ordering, we got all of our food at once and we&#39;re told we were upgraded to a 14 inch instead of the 12 inch we ordered, because of the long wait.

I started off the night with the $3 chocolate cherry martinis.  I chased that with the Blue Strawberry, which basically tastes like college.  If you didn&#39;t go to college, it tastes like high school.

We didn&#39;t get as many weird looks from the Blackhawks fans as I had expected.  In fact, some congratulated my friend on getting married, another friend got a guy&#39;s number, and when I screeched &#34;sports! points! hooray! BALLS!&#34; repeatedly, that was OK too.  When I screamed aloud a personal announcement, the bar gave me a round of applause.  A few even stood.  I checked - the Blackhawks hadn&#39;t scored a goal.  They were cheering for me.  That&#39;s a first.

Along with the great energy at Crossroads is great food.  Our group devoured the Parmesan garlic fries (waffle style, of course).  The boneless wings were enormous, more like chicken tenders, so don&#39;t be like me and overestimate your appetite.  Six were plenty.  The Sweet Dynomite was mildly spicy with a raspberry jam flavor; the parmesan garlic were just as good as those fries.  After the fries and wings though I was in desperate need of a mint.

Service was a little bit slow, but our waitress was friendly and appeared frazzled as she handled many tables - I&#39;m not sure I saw any other waitresses in my line of vision the whole night.  It wasn&#39;t her fault, it appeared that Crossroads was really understaffed, especially for a Saturday night and ESPECIALLY during an apparently very important sporting event.

Crossroads isn&#39;t a trendy gastropub, but it is a nice neighborhood spot with good drinks and great food."

The food and specials are usually good.  It&#39;s an oddly shaped building.  You walk in to a hallway, which if you turn left you&#39;re in the bar, straight ahead you&#39;re in the dining room that had a stage/elevated platform part to it.  There&#39;s an indoor-outdoor area and then an actual outdoor area.  I suppose it&#39;s nice to have plenty of places to choose your own adventure where you sit.

We&#39;ve sat in every room at some point.  If you choose the bar be ready for a bar environment.  Bartender joking around and shooting the shit with you, video game poker has come so expect to hear the noise from that behind you.  But hey that&#39;s okay, if you don&#39;t want that there are 3 other types of rooms to sit in.  We watched the bulls playoffs game in the dining room area one night.  It was good, lots of tvs to view it on, but you could tell the regular karaoke crew was antsy for karaoke to start so we left at half time, not knowing what was going to go on with the karaoke vs bulls.

The outdoor area last time we sat there (which was over a year ago now) seemed oddly set up with what was sort of like a bar that a bunch of guys were at and then we were at a high top table.  The weird set up may have been people moving tables around themselves.  It was nice, nice to have an outdoor area.

I&#39;ve ate a few different things there, but my favorite is the lightning lou pizza, which is a buffalo ranch pizza.  They were so nice to let me order it as a smaller size than it comes in.  My boyfriend doesn&#39;t like ranch but he tried and really liked the pizza.  The ranch kind of just melts into the pizza giving it a really good flavor.  I definitely will be back for that.

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back.  It&#39;s great when the other local watering holes are already packed for sports that you can always find a seat at crossroads."

Saw the new sign so I thought I would check it out for the first time.  I have been reading other mixed reviews, so I thought I would come in an form my own opinion.

At first glance, definitely more of a dive bar feeling...one of those places you would see on Bar Rescues.  There is a very distinct smell in the bar around the tap area (could have been from the kitchen which is pretty close by)...so I opted for a $2.50 miller lite bottle special.  The customers are a bit &#34;passionate&#34; about their opinions and loyal to this bar.  Some might call them &#34;trailer trash&#34; and I don&#39;t believe in that.  Actually one customer struck up a conversation with me explaining the rewards program, which was pretty cool.  Speaking about reward program, I explained that I was new to the area and was offered to be part of their rewards program which can is actually a shared program and is pretty cool.  Then a couple of other regulars come in...good genuine people.  

Overall, I had a pretty good experience.  Cheese quesadilla was tasty, shaved prime rib was good (a bit of fat on it, but nicely flavored) and $7.50 for 3 beers.  Waitress staff is a bit older, but extremely attentive and super nice.  I also saw other waitress&#39; taking time to clean off their menus...which is a nice behind the scenes.  Then the GM Paul walked out of the kitchen and had a bite to eat...seems like a good guy.  The waitress actually introduced me. I will definitely come again, although the the jury is still out on whether I will be going for the 750 points needed to get a free appetizer, 2 entrees and a desert (which is a pretty good reward for spending a couple of bucks)."

The food was good but the service was a bit shabby. The staff is friendly but not very good at informing the customer of pricing  changes. We ordered 24 wings but were not told we couldn&#39;t mix the flavors so we were charged separately for each flavor. We ordered the pizza because it was buy one get one free. We ordered the veggie pizza,one with minus one ingredient and the second with 2 plus ingredients. We were charged for each individual ingredient they put on both pizzas. We ordered ground beef because we cannot eat  pork and they put sausage on the pizza without informing us. Drinks were sparse, we had to ask if we could find someone, not offered. So for 24 wings ,&#34;buy one get one free? &#34;Pizza, and 3 sodas,and 3 beers for $83.00 was a bit much to me. It wasn&#39;t like we had fine dining or food with actual substance. So for me, I  may not give them a second chance. It wasn&#39;t actually a buy one get one if you have to pay for all the ingredients on the free pizza. Either that or they just didn&#39;t ring it up right. Best way to lose customers!"

First the tables on the patio are to tall giving the impression you are a little boy. Very uncomfortable but probably a good idea to have those tables to make the shady customers inside the dark bar feel like the children they are. Food was bland and when I got home got me sick. The waitress was extremely awkward and served people who sat after us before. Plus, they serve food on outside patio while allowing people to smoke. Which in Illinois I&#39;m pretty sure is illegal. This place needs to be out of buisness but won&#39;t because of the trailer trash clientele who probably spend their entire government check on booze their.  Steer clear. You have been warned"

Jun 2014 - Sorry Crossroads, but I had to knock the rating down to three stars. My wife and I have been coming here for 3 years, and it seems like the food is just not what it used to be.

My friend ordered 24 wings, different 4 different flavors and each flavor was billed as as four separate orders. The wings where smaller then you would typically get at BWW.  Their brosted chicken(that they are supposedly known for) was way over broasted, ribs had no meat(kinda more like a bat wing).  Their cream of mushroom soup was neither creamy nor did it have any mushrooms in it.  They find an excuse to up-charge you for everything. To top it off they serve RC cola.

Ordered wings, part medium and part lemon pepper. Not bad, but nothing to bring me back.

The staff seemed more interested in shouting at their friends across the bar and sharing a shot, so I had to wait longer than normal for another beer.

There was an unpleasant odor; maybe grease, dirty carpet and a hint of mold. Along with the video poker games along the wall, it didn&#39;t impress me. Maybe sitting outside in the summer with friends is a better experience, but I can get that anywhere. Not sure I&#39;ll return."

We sat at the bar and ordered a couple Blue Moons. I have to admit I felt kinda out of place but after a few swigs of that moon, I was ok.

Ang wanted to try out some sauces so we ordered some chicken strips and six different sauces. The bartender was happy to help us even though she kept spitting out sly remarks, whateves, just get me another Blue Moon. The sauces were flavorful, my favorites were the hot and the dyno-mite, which was made with some raspberry jam. I would definitely go back to try out some different items on the menu.

We signed up for the Cross Roads VIP card which earns you points for food and drinks. We received a free burger voucher just for signing up!! The bartender told us they have a DJ on Thursday nights.

We tried the mild, BBQ, Sweet &amp; Sour, hot, Wow hot, lemon pepper, &amp; cajun flavored wings. I hear the Wow are killer! My coworkers kept feeling the burn and I did not dare try them. They were pretty hyped up so they weren&#39;t quite as hot as they expected but still killed their tastebuds.

I tried the BBQ wings and the Sweet and Sour. I loved the flavoring on both. And neither was spicy at all which I greatly appreciated...I love being able to try different flavors without killing my mouth on spice.  The BBQ were very good but I think Villa Rosa has a bit better sauce. Also, Villa Rosa&#39;s wings have a bit more meat on them. However, I really enjoy their more unique flavors like the Sweet &amp; Sour Flavor as well as the Lemon Pepper.

We also got their cheesesticks which I liked better then most other places. I loved how they were soft &amp; gooey still, not overcooked.

All in all, a good place for wings. I&#39;ve even had the owners come and deliver us our food themselves and they seemed very nice!"

I live in the area and used to go to Crossroads a lot. Over the past few years, prices have continued to get higher and every time I go now, there seems to be something new and irritating that is on the border of price gouging. The latest was last week when I went and ordered wings. It wasn&#39;t a special price wing night or anything so i ordered 18 wings and wanted 3 different flavors. I think this is a reasonable request, it&#39;s what Bdubs does, but nope. I was told that they have to charge me for 3 separate orders of 6. Come on. I asked if that was the same if I ordered 24 wings or 36 wings. Yep, you only get the cheaper price if you order all of one flavor. WTF? It costs them no extra time or money to give me a different flavor.I know this sounds silly and nitpicky, but this was my last straw after years of one new cheapskate thing after another.

It&#39;s your standard divey restaurant/bar where all the locals come and hang out. Their beer selection isn&#39;t all that spectacular. They do have a few choices for seating: the bar area where it&#39;s always busy and bumpin&#39; with locals, the dining area with a stage off to the side (the bar hosts music nights on occasion), and an outdoor patio overlooking Irving Park Road. The outdoor area has two parts to it: an enclosed area with those zipper windows and an actual outdoor seating area. 

The food is okay. I was pretty excited that they had a juicy lucy burger, which consists of putting the cheese INSIDE the meat so that you get gooey cheese with every bite. Unfortunately, my burger was sorely lacking on cheese. I asked for it cooked medium well, which it was, but apparently, the cheese doesn&#39;t hold so well when it&#39;s cooked that well, so you get less of it. I wish they would have told me that. My bf&#39;s burger was dripping cheese. I was so jealous.

Another complaint: I&#39;ve sat in the dining area a few times and each time it&#39;s clearly obvious that they&#39;re overstaffed. I&#39;ll be sitting there, eating my food, and they&#39;ll be two servers watching me, waiting for me to finish so they can have something to do. Really? Sure, it&#39;s a guarantee that you&#39;ll get what you want when you want it, but it&#39;s pretty uncomfortable.

They have a rewards program if you remember to bring in the coupons they send in the mail. They also have food and drink specials every day, so check that out before you go. It was nice coming here a few times since it was so close to my apartment, but it&#39;s not a place I would go out of my way for."

We knew this would be from a local bar but some reviews seemed to suggest the food was good. Looking at the menu, and the high prices of their items (Turkey Club Sandwich $9.97, Mozzarella Sticks 8.99..) we were hoping their food was above pub food quality, especially after spending over $77.00 for our groups delivery order. We were sadly wrong and let down.

To start with we ordered their Surf and Turf (1/2 slab of ribs and 6 beer battered shrimp) which came with two sides. The ribs are advertised as &#34;Slow cooked bbq ribs, hand selected baby back ribs, show cooked then char-grilled &amp; topped with their secret bbq sauce&#34;. These ribs, while sorta tasty, were never grilled at all, simply cooked and then sauce put on them. The flavor of the sauce was a bit tangy and tasting like store bought hickory, nothing special. The ribs themselves were semi-ok but would have been much better had they actually been char-grilled as they claimed it would be. As for the sides, the salad is simpy a bag type lettuce you would by in a grocery store and not even rinsed off at that it seems. The cole slaw, deadly, smells like paint and tastes worse...stay away!!! This combo dish also came with was was supposed to be 6 beer batter shrimp. What we ended up with were about 8 very small shrimp, like shrimp you would put in a salad, the ones in the 45-60ct/lb bags in the store, and probably pre-battered. They sell just these shrimp alone in a 16ct as an appetizer for $10.79. Even being a part of this rib order, and only being 6, the $20.00 paid for this combo was not worth the money at all. We didn&#39;t even get shrimp sauce, not that there were enough shrimp meat to worry about it for.

Now for a bar, you would expect something like mozzarella sticks to be a staple and something you should easily be able to master and make very well, not here though. These appear to be something you would buy at your grocery store, like Farm Rich brand, and don&#39;t really appear to be fried, maybe oven cooked, as they are not crispy or melty at all, very soggy in texture and horrible in taste. Definitely not worth $9.00 for an order.

They seem to only have one crust style for their pizza, pre-made frozen from a food vendor, not fresh made. The cheese was good, the sauce was almost the flavor of bad ketchup, and forget the sausage, just plain pork sausage, not Italian. For a bar, this pizza would pass for bar food for those drinking, but you better have a few in you to truly enjoy it.

The only thing we had no complaints on was the Turkey Club Sandwich, except for the price. The sandwich was well made, nothing special, white bread, turkey, lettuce, tomato and mayo. An average good club, but not worth $9.79, especially that it came with no sides.

I will say that the quality of the food is fitting a lower end bar, and this bar seemed a higher grade bar from what we found online and expected a higher quality food. We were sadly wrong. If you are into a good time drinking, this looks like a great bar to visit for drinks, and after a few drinks the food may taste better, but you&#39;ll wake up with a hangover from the price you paid for that food for sure. 

If your looking for good food delivered, keep looking, way overpriced and very poor food quality."

2) The beer has improved!! There was a small but good list of craft beers that certainly had not been there in the past. The past two times I&#39;ve gone they had Hop Stoopid and a Tighthead IPA on tap. Yuuuuuuuum. 
3) The rest of it is still meh. Sometimes service is awesome, sometimes it&#39;s terrible. The food is also hit or miss (with all the non wing entrees I&#39;ve tried). 
4) But one more positive? I&#39;m not big on atmosphere, but that does seem to be improving if you care about that sort of thing. The patio is nice, the place seems cleaner and less divey, even the exterior got a facelift. Keep up the good work, Crossroads!"

So we walk back and fourth down this hallway for awhile than the bartender looks at us and mutters something and I say &#34;here for dinner&#34; so he sits us in the dining room with menus and all. We look through them trying to decide because the four of us were extremely hungry while the waitress takes our drink order. A few minutes later another lady comes over and tell us their kitchen is closed and it&#39;s only 8:30! She hands us this late night menu, which is basically all bar food, everything fried besides the mini burgers and pizza.

Okay fine we stayed because we already got our drinks and it was getting late. Our waitress was extremely slow. We had to constantly look for her. Our food took a quite awhile and we had asked for the giardiniera on the side for our pizza, but they messed that up and put it on the pizza what if someone was allergic and didn&#39;t realize it was on the pizza?! Yes, we could of complained, but it was already 9:15ish and by the time they take the pizza back and make a new one it&#39;ll be 9:45. No thanks.

There food wasn&#39;t bad, but the service wasn&#39;t great. To try and make it up they gave us a card for a free appetizer on our next visit, if there is one.

I had lunch here one day, a burger and salad, nothing to rave about but no complaints either. Prices were okay, food was okay, service was okay. Better than fast food choices in the area. 

And then...

I came across a restaurant.com certificate for them and thought, why not? They are close to me and savings are savings. So I purchased one. 

Now, I&#39;ve said it before in other reviews, I really feel that restaurants that participate in discount offers who stipulate &#34;must present prior to ordering&#34; on the offer make me suspicious as to WHY one must present prior to ordering. My suspicions have been validated before (see my review on Bait Cafe and The Shanty, for example) and once again they have been validated dining here at Crossroads.  

Service went out the window as soon as I presented the certificate. Which was fine, really. I go to a restaurant mainly to eat. Rarely do I go for ambiance and never do I go for service. 

What absolutely DID NOT sit well with me is the way my entire meal suffered because I chose to present the certificate. 

The $4.95 House Soup. for example. The bowl is a joke - wide but extremely shallow. I seriously doubt more than a cup-sized portion fits into it. But then to have said shallow bowl only filled about half-way? For 5 bucks? Seriously?

The UP Reuben, for another example. The menu advertises it as &#34;home roasted corned beef, piled high with saurkraut and swiss cheese on dark rye, 1000 island dressing on the side&#34;. There was NOTHING piled high on this here sammich. It was pitifully flat with extremely sparse ingredients. You could see the melted cheese on the bread and it looked like there was 1/2 a slice for the whole thing. Half a VERY THIN slice. And the dressing came in a tiny little crock on the side, not really enough for HALF a sammich, let alone the whole thing. I asked for another, and was not told there would be an up-charge for it, but there was. 

The reuben was accompanied by seven, SEVEN, waffle-cut fries. I mean, could they spare them? 

My companion&#39;s meal fared no better. The chicken tortilla soup portion was similar, and tasted like something out of a can. The triple decker turkey club was also extremely sparse with the ingredients. Nine waffle-cut fries meant they left only slightly less hungry than I did. 

Would not return here, despite the location being pretty convenient."

The pizza is good, the wings are good, and the garlic waffle fries are good. The daily specials will keep you coming back despite suspect service on occasion.

I had Long John Silvers shrimp a month ago and they were quite big and very good.  I was amazed.  These were small and tasteless with no sauce and they were cold.  The turf was the ribs.  Very small. Average in meat but they never saw a grill. Cole slaw smelled so bad I tossed it.  Salad was bagged and warm. But ok.  I ate someone else&#39;s chicken tenders and they are just like IHOPs.  Hard breading, but real chicken meat.  I felt gypped and won&#39;t order again. So the search goes on :("

We were so bummed when we tried to meet at the old North Ave. locale only to find they had closed and so so happy to refind them at the new digs, complete with outside deck for summertime fun!

The service was super friendly, especially considering we were crab chowing hounds, and the libations were fast flowing as well.

The wings are also delicious, as are the burgers.  The Funion Onion burger is my favorite so far, but I haven&#39;t tried &#34;The No Makin&#39; Out With You&#34; Burger yet: onions, garlic, and horseradish, sounds awesome though.

Live music on Saturdays (same night as the crab legs special).  Looks like they have a wings special on Tuesday nights, so I&#39;ll have to check that out sometime this summer."

Crossroads is not big on atmosphere. It&#39;s a little dark inside, the enclosed patio can be chilly, and, well, it&#39;s a bar. (Excuse me, a &#34;tavern and eatery.&#34;) 

But the food is good, and so is the service -- usually. The wings are fantastic, nicely crispy-fried with a great variety of sauces. Want something a little sweet and a little spicy? Try the new Dyn-o-mite sauce. I think it had strawberry jam in it. But oooh, that kick added up. Other appetizers (PLEASE, can we ban the word &#34;appe-teezers&#34;?) are tasty but skip the nachos, they&#39;re mediocre.

The burgers and sandwiches are by and large very good, and the pot roast sandwich is pretty dang awesome -- their pot roast is almost as good as mine. Pizza is thin crust pub style, tasty but not outstanding. Ribs are good but not quite up to Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s down the street. (Sorry, guys.) And their homemade chips and waffle fries are quite good.

The service has always been pretty good, but a little scattered -- our waiter most recently was very friendly, but spaced out on the ranch we requested, and we never got silverware. (Thankfully, we did get napkins.)

Prices are very reasonable, they have some great specials -- including drinks -- and it&#39;s a good place to bring a rowdy crowd.

In short, a good neighborhood bar/grill, low on atmosphere but high on service and food."

That&#39;s what you get if you sit on the deck here. The deck is situated right off Irving Park Road and with the trains nearby and Ohare not far off you get all sort of traffic noise. The weather was so nice out we couldn&#39;t bear to sit inside that dark dingy tavern. 

I came specifically for the wings. My wife had a burger. The wings were a big disappointment. Menu tauted these as the perfect wings after 15 years of experimenting in the kitchen. All they tasted like to me was some soggy (not crispy at all) breaded wing doused in Franks Red Hot sauce and vinegar. Did not even bother to take the leftover wings home with us. Waffle fries tasted like they were cooked in with the tortillas and were way too salty. They had a distinct taste of corn chips. My wife said the burger was good but not unlike others we had had closer to home. 

Service was a bit on the slow side. Waitress did not seem to care that we did not like the meal. We had to chase down our waitress to pay our bill so that we could leave to pick up our daughter.

Beer selection is above average and the burgers are good, but not amazing.

Come here after work to watch the game, or for some of their live music, they have &#34;Reggae night Thursdays&#34; which is pretty sweet.

I&#39;ve never tried any of their other food and I can&#39;t imagine it being great. The WINGS however - amazing! Spicy Garlic is our staple. Just the right amount of spicy with lots of flavor as well. I can&#39;t really say it tastes too garlic-y and that&#39;s probably why I like it. Not that I don&#39;t like garlic ( i do!! ), but spicy garlic has never been my favorite wing type  - just not a good mix for me. Something about these wings make them perfect and make my mouth water! 

Nothing amazing with the beer, except for the cheap prices. They always have a special and the pitchers are always ridiculously cheap. This is a nice place to go, relax, and have some wings. 

One word of warning though: If you are a spicy fanatic (like i am) and see the crazy hot wings that have one all sorts of rewards and come with your waitress telling you that you absolutely do not get a refund - only do it if you are prepared to not exactly enjoy these wings. You can SEE the pepper seeds ALL OVER the wings and can&#39;t feel your lips for the rest of the night. They have a delish flavor and definitely get your adrenaline (and sweat glands) pumping, but this is something that I will never attempt again. Glad I did it once though!!"

I was expecting the worst for Crossroads. Tucked away on Irving Park Road, with a Margaritaville themed patio, late on a Saturday night = high potential of douchebaggery. Boy, I was pleasantly surprised! 

Crossroads had some great drink specials, including a raspberry vodka lemonade for $3.50 that night that was awesome. While we sat inside, the band out on the patio actually sounded pretty good. It wasn&#39;t packed, but it also wasn&#39;t too empty either.

We ordered some sliders and hot wings off of the late-night menu. The BF loved the sliders, noting that they were actually made to order and were not pre-formed/pre-packaged sliders. The wings were all that they were cracked up to be. They were definately hot, and definately tasty!

We will definately be back!"

I had wings and fries for lunch as well. Fries nothing special and the wings were terrible. I don&#39;t consider myself a negative person when it comes to bashing something as simple as a wing, but these were awful. Anyways came back at a later date to drink and only that. Again good cheap can beer but nothing else. They use monster for their bombs which is gross.

Between Sweet Baby Rays and Crossroads, if you want a good fattening piece of meat, Wood Dale&#39;s your town.

But let&#39;s focus on Crossroads.  Its claim to fame is its award winning wings and it is easy to see why they win awards.  From the traditional buffalo style (close to perfect blend of heat and flavor) to the whacked-out (a super spicy sweet concoction that appeared to be made from some sort of berry jam), the wings are always cooked and flavored just right.  I can only think of one other place that has wings nearly this good, and it&#39;s all the way in Valparaiso... and apparently also closed.

The rest of the food is pretty standard bar fare, just done really well.  Lots of excellent sandwiches, including a truly delicious pot roast sandwich on an onion bun.  They also do really good pizza in the thin, crispy pub style, which is a nice change of pace from all the uber-Italian choices.

Service is usually consistently good here too.  Our waiter was particularly friendly on our most recent trip.  And not in a &#34;here&#39;s a list of friendly statements sent down from corporate&#34; kind of way.

There are Applebee&#39;s and Friday&#39;s and all those sorts of places in the area, but when I want that kind of food I&#39;d much rather go to a place like this.  Who doesn&#39;t want a little bit of comfort food made a little better, at a better price in a much more authentic feeling setting?"

The new location started out fairly strong, although the parking lot is smaller.   The menu is different, the atmosphere is pubby.

They pitch their ribs - but they&#39;re a bit below average, usually, but not always.

Their nachos range from mediocre to good to great, but not always.

Their burgers are usually something less, but not always.

You like soup? You must try the tomato artichoke soup. The best soup I have ever tasted. The burgers are great and filling. The beer is always cold and the drinks are strong like they should be. (all you tea toddling yuppies be warned).
Dessert. Chocolate cake. Make sure you got somebody to split it with you. It is a whole friggin cake!!! And delicious too! 
My only bitch it the wait staff. My bill was a little over 50 bucks. I laid down a c-note. The waiter asks if I want my change. A 15.00 tip quickly changed to a 5 dollar tip.  That comment, which has happened every time I have been there is my only bitch about this place."

Potstickers - these were super tiny, but there were a decent number and had good flavor. I prefer larger potstickers with chewier dough that is still has a bit of the crunchy fried texture on the outside.

Beef fried rice - The beef in this was really nice, very tender, and there was a good amount of kick to it.  The veg included were carrots and sprouts.  I would have preferred green onion to carrots, the sweetness is a bit odd to me. 

Egg rolls - these were good.  Crunchy, flavorful.  

Waitstaff were fantastic. 

Everything tasted fresh and was high quality. I&#39;ll ask next time if I can have onions instead of carrots in the fried rice, might be my go to chinese spot."

The food is delicious and reasonably priced and I&#39;m pretty particular about both. The chow main and fried rice had the great wok flavoring and the wonton soup had large wontons and tons of veggies in it. The downside is that a friend once asked to use the restroom there and was escorted to the restroom behind the counter so it was safe to assume that it is the same one the employees use.

I love their crab Rangoon. Its made with real crab meat, and served with and orange dipping sauce. Plus you don&#39;t get ripped off when it comes to the size. I hate it when you order crab Rangoon and it can be eaten in one bite. This is definitely not the case.

The proportions are huge. You could split a regular order between two people, but I like to order just for me and have left-overs.

Here I am doing just that.  Shows what I think about the validity of the writers at Huffington Post!  I was talking about Egg Foo Young with a fellow Chicago ex-pat here In LA.  It started me thinking about this restaurant, which was my favorite little hole-in-the-wall.  This and Yu&#39;s Mandarin are my favorites!  It only has a small handful of tables, but they do their best to provide you with good service.  It takes a while to get your food ready, as they prepare your food fresh for you.  None of that sitting in a warming tray crap.  Remember the old Chinese saying &#34;better a man wait for his meal, than the meal wait for the man&#34;.  This place had the best in old school Chinese food.  Sure they got Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken (shifts uncomfortably in chair) if you&#39;re so inclined (I guess some people still think Panda Express is real Chinese food). It would be wise to order something GOOD though.  Here, let me guide you.  Thanks to &#34;themenudrawer.com&#34; I found a menu to help find the good things I&#39;ve had there.  
531 Lets start with the egg foo young.  IMO is the best I&#39;ve had, anywhere.  Its not on the menu, but I ask them to make it combination with all the meats.  Pay the extra money for it.  Its not much, but its worth it. Also, order the large sizes as you get a huge bonus for the price.

 332 Two Delights in Garlic Sauce.  Shrimp &amp; Scallops.  Need I say more?  I ask for it hot.  I pay extra for more seafood.  Its nice that you can tell them how much you want.  Like a dollar more for a few more pieces or three dollars more for a handful more.

Their lunch specials are a great deal at less than $6.  There are things that are not on the menu.  They have a board up with their extra specials.  Chicken with black bean sauce is awesome.  The beef, tomato &amp; green pepper is so good also.  I&#39;ve had a lot of other things, but I consider these the things I listed as the best.  Now for the piece de resistance.  GET THE EGG ROLL!! Make sure you get the apricot sauce to go with eat.  Eat it and tell me that&#39;s not the best egg roll (and sauce) you&#39;ve ever had.  Go ahead.  I dare you.  The egg rolls themselves are worth the ride out there."

In this case - pictures appear deceiving...

I&#39;ve been wanting to try Oh My Pita for some time since they recently opened...
It&#39;s a new spot in the area, located near the industrial section of town and not really easy to find..In fact, its super easy to miss.  There isn&#39;t large signage and its located right next to Mexico 2000 (in a connected bldg.) off of Fullerton...They specialize in Gyros, Shawarmas and Greek sides...A mix of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern...

Walking in, there is ample room to eat-in with many tables &amp; even a flat screen.  You can instantly see the various Spits behind the counter and everything is prepared in front of you behind the glass...Place is cute and looked brand spanking new &amp; spotless...
Owner was friendly and engaging.....

I wanted to try a few things. They offer a few types of Gyros meat: regular, Chicken &amp; Pork.
Shawarma:  Beef &amp; Chicken.  I went with the Beef Shawarma plate (comes w/2 sides).
I&#39;ve had Shawarma at various Middle Eastern restaurants and always enjoyed it..
Sides:  Greek French fries (thin cut fries topped with feta &amp; oregano and slice of lemon) and
Falafel.  Plus gyros...Friend had the Gyros plate, side of potato salad and falafel.  Ordered a side of Hummus also.  I asked for tahini and tzatziki on the side...

4 cut pieces of pita were included w/my hummus.  All plates came with one fresh pita. Meat portion was generous. .

I dove into my beef Shawarma first....

First bite - very tender, flavor &amp; marinade was different, not like anything I&#39;ve tasted in the past.  Meat texture was off-putting - odd texture.

Second bite was a mouthful of very fatty and tough meat - total opposite of first bite..
I discretely put a napkin over my mouth and disposed of it..
And that&#39;s pretty much how the *bites* went...I either had a forkful of oddly textured tender meat -  OR fatty, tough, inedible meat.  I couldn&#39;t eat another bite.  I was done.  The Fat Lady sang...

The Falafel presented itself as such, but texturally dense and uninspired in flavor.
Hummus tasted just like Tahini to me...no lemon or garlic to be found...The Greek fries were ok...crispy w/feta.  Tzatziki was very thin.
Moving on to the Gyro....pretty good, not bad - let&#39;s just say it SAVED the meal.  

My friend thought the Gyro was ok.  Said the potato salad was bland.  I had him taste my Shawarma and said it left a strange taste in his mouth - he agreed, the quality of the meat was more than inferior.  This place closes at 6pm.  Had they still been open, I would have brought my shawarma back - it was simply unacceptable.

The last thing I&#39;d want to see is a local business owner struggling...
I can only hope some improvements will be made in the near future...

I&#39;ll stick with Stav&#39;s gyros in the meantime. .."

The location is among factory and warehouses on Fullerton Ave. I am hoping that they will be successful here because the location does not have the best visibility since the location is kind of like an oasis in a desert. Could be a tough go.
Anyway, on to the food. Ordered a Gyros and a Chicken Shawarma sandwich to go. I talked about the place with the fellow who was making the sandwiches about the business and how they were doing, the biz, the location, blah, blah, blah.
The sandwiches themselves were very good. Fresh ingredients and they were not skimpy on them either. The place is nicely decorated and very clean inside. Service was friendly and efficient. Give them a try.

The Greek fries are fresh cut fries cooked golden brown, lightly crispy, and topped with a generous amount of feta and oregano, served with a lemon wedge. I got a second one cuz I like extra lemon. The Greek salad is big served with any veggies you want. I had mine topped with gyros which is probably the best gyros meat I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s also served it with a pita, so even better you can make a sandwich with your salad. Remember to order a side of tzatziki sauce if you go that route. The falafel sandwich is a must try.

I had a turkey and cheese sub. They bake their bread in house. It was one of the better subs I&#39;ve ever had. I like Subway, but this restaurant is definitely better. You get what you pay for in this case. They don&#39;t know how to prepare a bad meal. My friend felt exactly the same as I did. Give this place a try. It&#39;s not fancy inside, but the food more than makes up for the décor. Also, there isn&#39;t a waiter or waitress to tip which will keep your total cost down!"

Of course I went here because of all the fuss and they were on Chicago&#39;s best. However I have gone two times and haven&#39;t been that impressed either time. 

The first time me and my girlfriend both got the Capri special sub, and one chicken noodle soup, all together was like 25$, it was okay nothing great. It was mostly mortadella which to me tastes like cheap bologna. Kind of surprised their is no sauce just a kind of deli oil on the subs. They took about ten minutes to make everything which is kind of slow because their was NOBODY there and it&#39;s literally the simplest thing to make. The whole place kind of seemed chaotic and the back end was just bickering at each other. I saw a guy who called ahead waiting for a pizza after he already called it in, that&#39;s pretty lousy to make somewhat wait after they made an effort to call ahead.

The second time I went I got a combo Italian beef for my girlfriend and a meatball sub for me. Both the sandwiches were good aside from the Italian sausage being pretty dry, and both the sandwiches were falling apart, I guess was bread couldn&#39;t hold them or they just made them sloppy.

The second time, My problem was I called like 30 mins ahead and I had to wait another 10 for when I arrived for a really simple order. The owner and workers were all kind of yelling at each other and cussing which was also kind of unpleasant. I guess I&#39;m not the only one who thinks the owner is kind of a grouch, I belief he may he muttered something rude about me. I can&#39;t stand businesses who act like THEIR DOING YOUR A FAVOR  by doing their jobs when your the customer.

I&#39;m not sure maybe I&#39;ve gone on bad days but they need to get better organized and be more professional. So I probably won&#39;t come back."

This place rocks. It&#39;s consistently good and seriously the focaccia bread sandwiches are soooo good. I feel comfortable saying this is the best deli in the area. 

I also tried the italian beef and the italian sausage. both are good, but not the best in all of chicago. they don&#39;t put peppers on the beef or at least were out of them. I like mr. beefs for that anyhow. 

The service has never been overly friendly but it&#39;s never been straight up rude.

I was like how are you out but ok... Now to Nov 25th, I go in and ask if he has pizza today, and he said yes, I said good, cause the last 2 times i was in he didnt have any, so this was his last chance, ( kinda joking voice) he said, what do you want me to do when I get busy and cant make pizzas, ( he had an attitude when he said it) I responded with, well maybe hire more staff, He replied with who the fu*k do you think you are to tell me how to run my business... i was thinking, are you kidding with me, is this how you talk to a customer.. Then he told me to get the fu*k out of his business, his quote was &#34; get the fu*k out of my business you fat a$$.. He said that as i was turning to walk out, then I stopped, he jumped back, thinking I was going to beat him up, then I told him to look in the mirror before you make a comment like that.

We dine here at least 2-3 times a week.  We travel from Bloomingdale!! When we have large home parties, Capri is our &#34;Go-To&#34; for catering and has been for years!  

The pizza is scrumptious &amp; Italian beef sandwiches are awesome.  The meat is sliced perfectly thin and sits on freshly baked bread.  A really, really good aujus with just the right amount of herbs &amp; spices flavors the lean beef.  It&#39;s always a big hit for our home parties.  In addition to the pizza &amp; beef, the sub sandwiches are fantastic, each one using precision cut deli meats &amp; cheeses--- all on top of freshly baked bread &amp; a drizzle of dressing to finish it off-- so good!
Meatball sandwich is outstanding!  Just the right amount of spice flavors the light meatball &amp; of course the red sauce is a perfect match made in heaven!
The salads are phenomenal &amp; if you want to add ingredients or take some off, they have no problems with special orders, they aim to please.
The homemade vinaigrette used on salads is absolutely the BEST tasting one ever! 

I gave Capri Deli 5-stars because the food is fresh &amp; delicious!  Also, because Tony the owner makes us feel at home with his welcoming smile!

There are a few tables outside, and plenty inside to sit at. And it is very clean! They have a variety of salads, sandwiches, pastas, pizzas, and soups to choose from, and a few desserts. I decided on the Caprese salad - it was awesome! Light but filling and full of flavor. My friend ordered the corned beef sandwich - I took a bite and thought it was great.

The food is pretty good but the owner Anthony is a prick. He has been rude to me on multiple occasions in the store. Which is bothersome because I&#39;m spending my money at his place. Anthony lost my business for ever recently when I called to order a pizza for a work party. He rudely answered the phone telling me to hold. He the proceeded to put me on hold for 15 minutes. After waiting for that long the phone got disconnected. This forced me to call back where Anthony screamed into the phone, &#34;what do you want.&#34;  I was shocked at this and told him never mind I will order from another place.

Well, I did!  I ordered a 9&#34; Italian sub sandwich and decided to opt for a combo with chips and a can of soda for $9.75 instead of just the sandwich at $7.95. Now, their prices are a touch higher than most chain sandwich stores, but I can tell you that the size of the sandwich and the high quality bread is where the difference is at. This sandwich was packed with meat and the bread was outstanding. It&#39;s been about 6 hours since I ate there and I&#39;m still full.  

Now, frankly the place could use a little sprucing up - it&#39;s kind of plain and the prep / cashier area is somewhat &#34;industrial&#34; looking if there is such a thing. But overall, the sandwich was good and I plan to return for more of them."

I&#39;ve had Capri Deli &amp; Pizza in my &#39;to try&#39; bookmark pile for quite some time now but got around to giving them a go only just this weekend. I guess I was worried there wouldn&#39;t be much beyond pizza for a vegetarian like myself so it was easy for me to skip over Capri time and time again as my hunger pangs called. 

Walking in this past Sunday I was surprised how large the inside was. From the outside, I was thinking it&#39;d just be a small order and go operation with maybe a few 2-tops for people to sit and wait. Pleasantly surprised = me. The dining area (still just counter service but nice to have the option to sit and enjoy with crushed red pepper flakes table side et al.) fits approximately 40 people and judging from the size of their back kitchen, they&#39;re equipped to handle large catering orders as well. One thing that wasn&#39;t such a pleasant surprise, however, was looking around and seeing that even though there was no one in there dining at the time, every table had table had more than a few crumbs on it. I know there&#39;s no dedicated bus service but a wipe down in between diners made the difference in us taking just a few things to go or staying and ordering more. 

As far as the menu goes, it was very tempting to not go back to my old meaty ways. All the spicy Italian slices and deli chat just like I remember hearing when I was younger and my Grandma would take me to pick up her ravioli order from the local Italian market made for a nostalgic visit. For veggie options, you&#39;re certainly very limited but luckily, that doesn&#39;t mean you have to sacrifice taste. I went with their special caprese salad and the 6&#34; veggie sandwich with all the fixins, as the deli man would put it. I really only ordered the salad because I splitting the meal with another and I was looking for a little more variety than just a pasta or pizza. I was skeptical since I&#39;m not the biggest fan of a lot of oil, or even tomatoes for that matter, but something about Capri told me I was going to leave satisfied with that sucker. And I did. 

The Caprese salad was large and beyond delicious with copious amount of basil (the way to my heart) and Italian spices served with a half loaf of fresh bread and butter for dipping in the pesto remnants. #Win. 

The veggie sub was a decent one as well, but certainly not best I&#39;ve ever had. I was somewhat disappointed in the veggie factor here as I was hoping when the man at the counter asked me if I wanted to keep the tomatoes, lettuce, oil, and mayo on the veggie sub that it meant those were just the extra little topping options, like on the meat subs, and that there would still be some base veggies that came on the veggie sub. Not the case... unless you count cheese as a vegetable, which my Italian friend told me is the correct way to do it. At least they don&#39;t skimp on the cheese with several different kinds all packed together for a not so healthy but pretty darn tasty sub. I just couldn&#39;t help but think that if I hadn&#39;t opted to keep the lettuce and tomato toppings on my sammie that there would literally be no veggies on my veggie sub. I would suggest calling it a cheese sub unless some base veggies go into it- just seems kind of bunk otherwise.

I would go back again with my meaty Italian friends and family as I know they&#39;d fall head over heals for these hoagies but for me, I just prefer a few more hearty options for my grinder. I&#39;ll head back around lent and see if they can do me up a nice pepper and egg or something."

The Italian sub was good but nothing better than those made at dozens of other area sub shops and Italian delis. 

There were no fountain drinks and all beverages came in cans or bottles without cups, ice, or straws. Napkins were rationed out by staff at one per person.

The place reminds me of the first place I ever worked.  It was a small storefront deli/pizza joint and that&#39;s where I cut my teeth, literally and figuratively on Italian deli food.
Their &#34;Capri&#34; sandwich is the classic Italian sub/grinder I remember growing up as a kid.  Mortadella, Capicolla, Salami, italian dressing, lettuce, tomato, onion and provolone on fresh made bread.. Fantastic!
Their meatball sandwiches are hearty and drenched in their own red sauce.
They offer a 6&#34; / 9&#34; and 12&#34; sandwich and they are generous with the cut.

One of my most pleasant surprises was picking up a fresh uncooked pizza for $7.  Take it home, pop it in the oven at 450 and in about 20min you&#39;re good to go.. For $7!!!.. I even deconstructed the pizza bit and slapped additional ingredients on it at home.  Good stuff.

It&#39;s not fancy, but it is inexpensive and excellent food.

More bark than bite. The place gets absolutely packed during peak lunch hours and everything is made to order so it can get a little hairy at times.

They serve subs, pizza, pasta, and their famous focaccia sandwiches. I fell in love with the focaccia sandwiches and have yet to venture to venture to their other offerings for fear of not being able to have my focaccia and eat it too. If you opt for the full cut then you better bring an extra pair of baggy pants because this sandwich is a two pound intestine demolisher. It&#39;s better to share it with a buddy or that random chick you came across on Baldwin on the way in from fiddythree.

It&#39;s a smaller family owned business that cranks out quality food as fast as their poor overworked employees can put out and they do an excellent job. Just remember the owner guy is probably not going to be very nice to you. Borderline soup nazi style at times so you better know what you want before you step up to the plate. He hates people on phones and people who ask too many questions.

The place has character from the barking owner to the random faux red terra cotta roof inside the dining area to the name &#34;TONY&#34; spelled out in linoleum tiles in the hallway to the restroom. You can&#39;t get more family style than that!

Get the focaccia sandwich. You won&#39;t be sorry!"

Today, Friday April 13th was the first time I tried this place. I picked it out because of all the nice reviews on Yelp. Here are the items that were wrong with my pizza:

1)  My order was wrong
2)  The pizza was not hot but more or less warm
3)  No condiments came with the pizza (no cheese or crushed red peppers)
4)  When I called to inform the business of the issue the man said he would have to wait for his driver to come back because the driver was the only one who had the ORIGINAL ORDER TICKET?

I can tell you the pizza was nothing special..."

My first time at Capri Deli we got the veggie sub and the caprese salad.  I think both of them had the same, amazing, dressing!  An Italian oil based dressing which alone was enough to have me back.  The sub was layered with cheese and some veggies - it was very cheesy but how can that be a bad thing?  The caprese salad - a classic tomato, mozzarella, basil, and dressing salad was incredible.  There were tons of juices at the bottom and  the people at Capri Deli know it so they throw in half a loaf of what appears to be home made bread to get all the juices.  Yum!  Yum!  Yum!

A few weeks later I was a family party and the food was picked up from Capri.  I was in shocked how fantastic the eggplant parm was.  Normally it is not something I order out because there is a good chance that the eggplant will be breaded and fired.  Capri Deli&#39;s was perfect, the right amount of layers, fresh eggplant (un-fried), a nice layer of cheese on top, all with a fantastic taste!  There was also some garlic bread from Capri - now this is not your butter and garlic powder bread - it is buttery, gooey, garlic-loaded, and amazing!

Inside Capri Deli is a fair large amount of space however there was no one eating in but it was close to closing time.  The staff was very friendly and it appeared to be family owned the way the staff talked to each other.  A few other people stopped in while we were waiting for our food (at 5 min wait) and the staff seemed very friendly to everyone making it a very pleasant place to eat the delicious food they make!  Next on the list, pizza!"

I normally don&#39;t believe the yelp percentage, but reading everyone else&#39;s reviews I figured I&#39;d give it a shot.

I&#39;ve tried every little Italian deli that I&#39;ve come across and this place is a gem.  I hold my standards high for Italian subs having an off the boat Italian father.

simply put, it&#39;s Italian subs done right. Ample meat without 20lbs of toppings bloating your sandwich and killing the flavor of the meat like most places do and the toppings they DO put on are fresh and delicious, perfectly shredded lettuce and finely chopped tomato in the middle of January was a treat! (not frozen old and tasteless)

I had a soprasatta sub and the #2 focaccia (wanted leftovers), w/ fresh as hell basil &amp; what tasted like homemade mozzarella and roasted red peppers... Let&#39;s just say it is so good you don&#39;t want to finish it cuz that would mean there&#39;s no more...

Really. 

My wife, kid and I come here most weekends to indulge in the best subs we have found anywhere. I credit the baked-on-site bread which is both crusty and doughy and wonderful smelling, and the great Italian dressing Capri uses.

The Italian ice is a fun summer treat, to boot.

Though I will say I have taken many people there, and everyone has said how good it is, not a single complaint.

I really enjoyed my pav bhaji and mango lassi though! My mom really enjoyed her dosa and the sambhar was incredible. They make everything mild, medium, spicy so there really is an option for any palette. Service was faster than you&#39;d expect for Indian food and the cashier was knowledgeable on the menu items (that&#39;s not the case everywhere!). Very convenient location within an all Indian plaza in Schaumburg. Open until 10 which is just long enough post closing of the other stores in the strip. 

Opportunities for improvement would be table turnaround. It was quite crowded during my visit so we had to claim a table as we saw patrons bundling up and subsequently we had to sit at a dirty table momentarily. My dad called the busboy over shortly thereafter but I feel they should be more attentive to the turn around and arrive prior to our settling in. I noticed the same with other patrons&#39; tables. The bathroom was untidy, smelled and was out of soap. 

The food triumphed and I look forward to trying Honest in the homeland later this year after my pleasant experience here in Chicago."

Typically we order a plate of Pav Bhaji and some extra Pav since the Bhaji quantity is sizeable. I love that they also use cashew bits in the bhaji to amp up the richness quotient. A MUST TRY if you are here. Recently we also had the Bhel Puri which was equally spot on in terms of taste.

The food was outstanding, and reminded me of the quality of street food served in india. I had the dhai puri and pav bhaji, which were delicious. I would highly recommend that appetizer/entrée combo. 

The service was only very prompt for such a busy establishment, as we received our orders in less than 15 minutes. The man manning the front was super helpful in recommendations, giving us our food and garnishings, and dealing with our large group. 

The restaurant is actually very clean with a very modern look. Most indian street food restaurants aren&#39;t as clean in my experience.

We tried the uthappam, plain dosa, masala dosa, curry puri, dhahi puri and pulav. The dosas were just right in terms of batter fermentation. The masala was not authentic. But the chutneys &amp; sambhar made up for it. The chutneys are always a good litmus test of freshness, and the ones served to us tasted relatively fresh, although still cold indicating early prep and store.

The pav baji (no idea about spelling) was one of the best I&#39;ve tasted in the US. Almost taste like you were at a roadside stand in Bombay. We also had Pani Puri and dahi Pani and the Pan, also all were fresh and flavorful. 

As far as service, it was quick, friendly and helpful. They provided the meals in a rapid fashion and they were helpful in picking what to order.

When asked about the other order which was masala pav they say 15 mins more which is ridiculous. 
The lady at the counter says the chefs are making fresh mix which I just can&#39;t believe..
They take orders after orders both for dine in and takeaways and we did see takeaway guests get their orders well before the dine in guests.

You get buttered garlic Texas toast (I didn&#39;t see any grill marks).

Tucked in the corner of a struggling corner strip mall on Euclid and Quentin road that used to have a Dominick and a Blockbuster. LOTS of parking. Leaning diveish for Palatine, avoid the bathrooms.

I like their sauce and smoke in general, not overly sweet, some citrus notes, so you into burnt sugar will be disappointed. Was more like a diced up baby back rib though, pieces too large and more bone vs cartilage than I want, although I enjoy trying to gnaw the marrow out.  Marrows in but...Bone to meat ratio no bueno.

I gave the place an extra star for its other qualities.  It&#39;s a small restaurant that&#39;s cozy to dine in.  There are signs, even one in neon lights (so you know they are serious), proclaiming world ribs champions.  If you are ordering these champion ribs, I would recommend calling ahead so you don&#39;t have to wait 20 minutes for it to come out.  That&#39;s what we did and we didn&#39;t have to wait long for the food.  The people working there are really nice and friendly.  Now back to these award winning ribs, they are not the fall off the bones type, which I&#39;m fine with.  They weren&#39;t super fatty, A plus.  The sauce was good.  Overall, good ribs, but nothing impressive.  Maybe I was expecting more from the winner of 43 National Rib &amp; Sauce Competitions.  

I also tried the smothered fries (loaded with cheese, pork and bbq sauce) and thought they were a strange combination.  I mean, it&#39;s just potatoes and pork after all, but not really my thing.

Here&#39;s a fun fact from their website:  They noticed that pigs always rolled over on their left side to play in the mud. This made the left rack of ribs tougher then the ribs from the right side and that little known fact is still true today.  That&#39;s why Brothers Ribs only cook the ribs from the right side of the pig.

Someone should mythbuster that.

We were the second customers to walk in the door when they opened at 1pm on a Sunday. The place was very dirty. The checkered tile floors were not washed, walls were scummy and dirty, tables were sticky and still had crumbs on it from the previous night. The bathrooms were really in bad shape, dirty and it looked like something was growing around the faucet in the men&#39;s restroom. The doors had scum and scuff marks over a foot off the ground, it was bad. The food was alright. I ordered the tips with a hot link side, the daughter had a burger and the wife a steak sand. The medium cooked steak sand came out beyond rare the first time, but was corrected after notifying the one employee running everything ( he even had to turn down customers because he was too far behind on orders. He told people it would be at least a half hour to get their food)I felt bad for him. I wanted to jump in the kitchen and help.The kids burger was paper thin and nothing worthy to write about.  The pop tasted really weird and moldy like, probably because the spouts have never been taken off and soaked as they should every night. The tips had a good flavor and were really not meaty at all. The hot link tasted like a microwaved Italian sausage. The fries were pretty good and tasted like the fryer oil was fresh. The award winning bbq sauce was ok to say the best. It had hints of clove and was more on the vinegar side and runny. I&#39;m sure it would taste good caramelized on some meat. I can&#39;t say I will be back,  but at least I tried it.

I haven&#39;t been here in awhile and I had a craving for some rib tips so I headed to Brothers. The tips were as good as they were last time, actually better since there were no dried up burnt bits BUT the brisket was a different story.

I had to ask if the brisket was brisket and not pulled pork. Why? It was pulled brisket and looked just like pulled pork. Stringy and soggy, it lacked flavor and tasted like it had been sitting in a vat of warm water. I&#39;m accustomed to either sliced brisket with a smoke ring or chopped brisket. This allows for the meat to be cut against the grain yielding a soft, flavorful texture. But their brisket was a stringy mess and just ended up stuck between my teeth. Even a ton of BBQ sauce didn&#39;t help the limp brisket (ha).

So tips are good but avoid the brisket at all costs. Yeck."

I want to go back to try the rib tips because those are a rare find in the area, but...
While i was waiting for my food, i took a gander at the bottle of sauce sitting on the counter.  the first ingredient was high-fructose corn syrup.  Not a good sign for a BBQ joint to have to rely on that stuff in making their sauce.  
Maybe i had eschewed my expectations by looking at what i was going to be eating, but the sandwich was WAY too sweet; not my style of BBQ. No real smokiness to speak of at all.
Fries &amp; beans were nothing special either.  Beans coulda been out of a can, and were also way too sweet.

The full slab portion of ribs was quite ample. The ribs were meaty if a bit on the fatty side. They were quite tasty but in my opinion oversauced. The sauce itself was good, quite sweet and tangy. However I feel they overdid it a bit. Too much sauce overwhelms the taste of the meat itself. This of course is a personal preference. I can&#39;t see anybody that would want to order extra sauce here.

A negative is the ribs were not warm enough. This varied within the slab, that is some portions tasted warmer than others. The meat was soft. This is definitely fall off the bone style.

As for the sides, I had the slightly seasoned potato wedges and they were excellent. Definitely made to order, nicely crispy on the outside with a good potato flavor.Their coleslaw was so so. I did not care for the baked beans as I feel the sauce to bean ratio was too high. What they call garlic bread is one piece of white toast with a mild garlic flavor. It was tasty but why not give two pieces?

This is not a full service restaurant. You can dine in but it seems they are oriented towards carry out (and my order was handled well). Once inside the smoky barbecue aromas grab you in a pleasing way. However the interior decor is not appealing. When I walked in at dinnertime there were several dirty dishes laying around. They have a small television which looks like vintage 1975.

Still for the food itself, recommended."

Put it in my mental notes to check it out and when the chance came up on a Thursday afternoon, I gave it a shot.

Good sized menu of many BBQ items, some custom named without descriptions, so one would have to ask to find out more. I looked and decided to order the Pulled Pork dinner special - $1.50 off the regular price on Thursdays. Brothers offers two types of potatoes and my knee-jerk was to get fries, but I asked the guy working the counter what his recommendation was and he said to go with the potato wedges. Glad I did as they were a little different - nice small potato wedges (a lot of them) with a crispy outside and a fairly fresh taste to them. Texas toast was good - I&#39;ve seen larger sizes, but given the size of the whole meal I received, I had no issues with the portion.

Also came with decent sized cups of beans and cole slaw. Neither of those really stood out - both were just OK. There&#39;s room for improvement on both and it would really pick up the quality of their offering.

Now for the pork...  it was served in one of those rectangular paper deli dishes that often hold sandwiches or a very large order of fries. The portion I received was quite large and in my opinion a good value. The BBQ sauce was also pretty good too - I poured a little more on from the bottle that was at the table. But the downside was that there was a little bit of water in the bottom of the dish and overall, the pork was lukewarm at best. Seemed like it might have been in a fridge or freezer and recently defrosted or lightly heated. I also didn&#39;t detect much of a smoky or BBQ flavor within the pork itself.

The other thing that was slightly unsettling was that the guy behind the counter (who was very nice and helpful) clearly had a head cold. I know it&#39;s hard to find someone to work for someone else when they&#39;re sick, but his cold in a foodservice operation makes one wonder if they&#39;ll catch it. So far, nothing yet here!!!

I want to give this place another try as they&#39;ve apparently been here for years and they do have some good elements to their offerings. Wish I could go higher than 3 stars, but that will be determined after visit number two."

First thing that caught my eye, was the website--nicely done-very welcoming, gave off that bbq picnic feeling.  Pricing..a bit over priced..but I thought I&#39;d give it the benefit of doubt. Called in my order, went to pick up--uh-oh, completely empty inside..especially on a Friday night (the place should be hoppin) .again gave benefit of doubt..the bagging was terrible, in brown paper bags rolled up.  Had to ask for shopping bag, something to carry out my 5 bags.  Got home, opened up everything, I was starving hadn&#39;t eaten all day anticipating some good bbq...the sauce was god-awful! It was extremely acidic..Louisiana hot sauce mixed with a little bit of molasses(maybe). The ribs were dry--not fresh. the.coleslaw--dry must have taken straight out of a bag and spooned into containers. The beans same thing, straight out of a can into container. NO FLAVOR.  The smoked bbq beef had been frozen and had that waterlogged taste. Chicken did fall off bone, but had no flavor,the French fries were seasoned nicely but old tasting. The Texas toast was the best of what we ate, can&#39;t mess up bread. This restaurant has a lot of potiental but needs a taste overhaul. I cannot believe any of these reviews as being valid, did they eat what I ate? I am a long bbq fan and have eaten in many,many bbq eateries...I think the owners need to take a road trip and see what real bbq is all about.  As far as their so called :AWARD WINNING SAUCE--No way.  Kentucky BBQ-NO WAY! Take that road trip fellas...straight east on Golf to Emerson in Evanston...follow the smell!"

On a recent lunch visit this week on a cold winter day- the temperature inside the restaurant was FREEZING and we made a comment about how cold it was and instead of being apologetic, explaining why it was so cold or offering to turn the heat up he respond with- &#34;Yeah its about 50 degrees in here&#34; In a sarcastic tone. - Um OK HAHA very funny...

It is automatically served on a Kaiser roll. You can ask to replace it with Texas toast at no additional charge. You can upgrade from the fries to a baked potato for $.50 after 4p.

I really like to dip my fries in their BBQ sauce. I enjoy Lemonade with my ribs.

The staff and owners here are really kind, told me they had been there for twenty some years.

THE RIBS are above average, but not great. I didn&#39;t expect much coming to a rib place like this, so I think they satisfied me. But it didn&#39;t give me that feeling of wanting to come back for more. The GOOD part of these ribs is they are prepared and cooked really well. They fall off the bones just like many other reviewers state. However, that&#39;s where the goodness stops. The sauce itself isn&#39;t strong enough (in my opinion). After awhile, it doesn&#39;t taste like much and it&#39;s just &#34;ribs&#34;. They aren&#39;t bad... but they aren&#39;t great. 3 stars

THE GARLIC BREAD is really good. It tastes light and the texture is just right. It comes out crunchy and has a good balance of flavor on there. Having eaten this prior to eating the rest of the meal, it was a good start to the meal. 3.5 stars

THE FRIES are fantastic. They are crunchy and crispy, just the way I like them. There&#39;s not much chewiness to them but it&#39;s not like it tastes dry. They don&#39;t oversalt it and it makes a great balance to the ribs. 3.5 stars

THE BEANS are baked and don&#39;t have much of a flavor to them. They seem to be just baked beans. They are better than the baked beans you&#39;d have in your school cafeteria, but they definitely aren&#39;t better than ones I&#39;ve had from other places. They taste just a notch above bland.  3 stars.

THE COLE SLAW is chopped really small and tastes clean and light. I like it for that reason. 3.5 stars.

I paid about $22 including tax for all of the above. For that price, I might come here on occasion, but I wish they had a little bit stronger of a taste to it."

We ordered a pulled pork sandwich, grilled chicken (and a corndog for our son). The food was delish! Good sized pulled pork, decent size chicken (although putting a little sauce on during grilling would be nice instead of just pouring it on after cooking), fries were tasty and the sauce was really good. Sweet and flavorful. Glad to see RC as a beverage choice - one of my fave&#39;s! 

I would have given this place 4 or maybe even 5 stars BUT... the seating area was, frankly, gross. Layers of dust on shelves, walls dusty, chairs that looked like they hadn&#39;t been cleaned in a long time (caked on food, sauce on seats, spindles AND legs, crumbs), floor just gross (needs a good scrubbing, and maybe a coat of wax), the sauce bottles, ketchup bottles and salt an pepper shakers a little crusty. The whole place just felt - dirty. And all this in a nice mall/city. This is NOT some dive location in a crappy neighborhood!!! But it seems like it.

Brothers Ribs has them all. The place is very small and every time I&#39;ve gone only one person is working behind the counter, but the other constant is that the food is phenomenal. The half slab combo is an excellent deal. The ribs are tender and the sauce is just sweet enough. The fries are good too. Definitely stop by here if your in the area."

The ribs were ok not falling off the bone tender. I was not digging the sauce. It was sweet and had a sweet spice like nutmeg I didn&#39;t care for.  The beef brisket tasted like roast beef (no smoke) with the icky sauce. Baked beans were too vinegary. Baked potato was eh. I don&#39;t eat cole slaw but it looked dry.  Can I just say , No one likes Diet RC. Yuck.  Service was ok but brought sauce when my 6 year old ordered dry ribs.  Too much $$ for not enough food.  I won&#39;t be back."

We were a party of 4.
Started with the local brewery draft and one member had a Riesling that she really enjoyed( 2 choices available, rare to have more than one )
The cheese curds were very good with a 
Nice complimentary sauce.
Here&#39;s our choices:
Pulled pork sliders with fries
French onion grilled cheese with gruyere
Smash potato burger with fries
Toasted apple chicken Brie sandwich
All agreed they made the right choices and would all return.
The staff is very young but so incredibly polite and genuine. They worked as a team and we felt so comfortable. The owner (manager) came by to see how everything was. It was an easy conversation since we were all so pleased.
The dining room is small but so beautiful 
with tall tin ceilings and old time lighting.
Boy I wish those old walls could talk.
As we left we received several thank yous from the staff. Again genuine.
Delightful!

Only word of caution:
Not wheel chair accessible. Very tall old time steps."

The interior of the restaurant is like a hybrid of a 1930s farmhouse kitchen and a diner.  The menu is soda fountain meets gastropub.

This restaurant is small, so be prepared for a wait on Friday nights.  I waited about 20 minutes for a party of 2.  There isn&#39;t much standing room to wait, so I felt like I was hovering over other diners.  When I walked in, I didn&#39;t know where to go, and I certainly didn&#39;t appreciate the one employee look at me at least five times without saying something.  If someone walks in with a blank look on their face, especially into a brand new establishment, say something!  I finally noticed that there is a counter with a register and walked over where someone helped me.

Their beers are mostly local, including options from Noon Whistle which is only a stone&#39;s throw from Babcock&#39;s.  I had the &#34;Fuel Cafe,&#34; a coffee stout from Lakefront, a brewery still local to the midwest. 

The food is mostly burgers and sandwiches, but that didn&#39;t make it any easier to choose.  I had the French Onion Grilled Cheese with fries.  Honestly, the sandwich didn&#39;t &#34;wow&#34; me.  The cheese wasn&#39;t melted all the way and the onions were clumped in the middle of the sandwich.  The fries were really good though.  My friend had the smashed potato burger which looked really good.  We also shared the cheese curds which were lightly battered and done really well.  The spicy mustard dipping sauce was an interesting twist too.

So I didn&#39;t love Babcock&#39;s, but I really did like it enough to consider going back to try the chicken apple brie sandwich, macaroni and cheese, or something else.  The location is a nice halfway point between myself and many friends, so I can see myself going back to try again."

We were greeted right away with a big smile. We were there for a late lunch. We ordered at the counter and took a seat. They brought our drinks and food out to us. The menu is wonderful, varied, and casual made with good ingredients. 

We shared a Sweet Potato burger and the smashed potato burger. The sweet potato burger was my favorite... just wish it had a tiny bit more avocado. The fries were awesome! Crispy and perfectly salted. Beer and wine list had a nice variety too. 

We went on a nice fall day and chose to sit outside. The chairs are very comfortable for outdoor furniture. However the inside looks comfortable as well. If you haven&#39;t tried this spot, don&#39;t put it off any longer... just go."

I was totally nerding out over the rustic and classy decor. So much so that I took a panoramic video of the place, because I wish my house looked exactly like this.

I met Kate S for lunch and had a great experience here. Located in downtown Lombard on a busy corner, Babcock&#39;s has outdoor seating and inside seating. During the day you order up at the counter and they&#39;ll bring out your food; at night it&#39;s a full service restaurant. 

Their fall lunch menu offers a lot of great options. I decided to go with the french onion grilled cheese with a side of organic mixed greens. This sandwich cost $8.50 and had swiss cheese, gruyere, caramelized onions, and parsley. It was so delicious and tasted exactly like French onion soup! Perfect for a cool fall day. The other option for a side is their Belgium style fries, but I definitely suggest the greens with this sandwich. It&#39;s a nice light balance to a very cheesy lunch.

I will definitely be coming back to Babcock&#39;s Grove House and can&#39;t wait to try out their dinner menu. They also offer beer on tap and in bottles and wine too. Sounds like a relaxing evening to me!"
babcocks-grove-house-lombard,Kate S.,XBomRKII_TfQbKkL8QH9rQ,"Elk Grove Village, IL",1,1,1,47,174,aAGafcVb0xySSTZMRdROwg,5.0,2016-10-13,"Let me start off my saying I&#39;m sadly unfamiliar with the city of Lombard and all the businesses within it but if it&#39;s anything like Babcock&#39;s Grove House then Lombard will definitely be seeing a lot more of me. What an adorable restaurant. I fell in love with this establishment even before I had visited for the first time. Viewing the photos and reading the reviews here on Yelp was enough for me to decide that there was a very likely chance of me loving this place - I was right!

Like several other Yelpers and visitors of Babcock&#39;s have mentioned, this place is damn cute. The decor is a sort of woodsy chic and I&#39;m obsessed. Before I had ordered my lunch with Jacqueline B. I looked around the space as if I was a kid in a candy shop. The Babcock employees were very friendly and pretty attentive from my experience.

Now enough about the cute space, the food was good too! I had ordered a chicken, apple and brie sandwich with a side of fries. It was pretty satisfying and very nicely plated! Because it had been just a casual lunch (and they didn&#39;t have their dinner menus out yet) I didn&#39;t dive into their drink menu or anything of that nature. They had a pretty good selection to choose from for just lunchtime though.

One thing that was different for me was the fact that you order/pay at the front counter before you get your meal. I learned later on by an employee that they have a regular &#34;dinner&#34; style menu and serving. I think that means a waiter/waitress takes your order at your table and you pay after you&#39;re done eating like most restaurants? I&#39;m not sure. It didn&#39;t bother me either way.

I would absolutely love to bring the boyfriend here to grab dinner and drinks in the future. I can see this place being nice for a date night! It&#39;s small, cozy and the price range is not bad at all."

Steampunk diner?  Farm fresh speakeasy? While they do have a few outdoor tables, I think the decor inside is much more interesting. And I am not one to turn down al fresco dining!  So,  arrive early and dine in!  Plenty of stools at the bar too! 

As for the food,  I had the sweet potato burger and already went back for another!  Thank you from all of us vegetarians for having some serious non meat options!  We also had the carrot soup with side salad which is super light, but also somehow hearty.  Carrot soup sounds like a winter food but it&#39;s actually perfect for summer too.  The turkey burger and chicken schnitzel are also solid choices.  

Our little guy had the mac and cheese.  He was pretty happy about it.  Nice and creamy.  I will caution you to arrive at senior citizen/toddler dinner time (5pm)  if you want to snag a high chair.

Now,  let&#39;s talk about the drinks.  Craft sodas like birthday cake flavor (perfect for cream soda lovers),  lemonade and the craft beers!  We had some kind of delicious double IPA on draft.  They also have a special local Lilicia beer named for Lombards beloved lilacs.  It&#39;s on the light side. 

And lastly, a note to the genius designer that created and hung the lighting. We love those single bulbs that are hung like octopus arms in the middle of the ceiling.  The cage lights are fantastic too. 

Room to Improve :
1) add a side of fruit or veggies to the kids meals
2) add a high chair or two to the fleet
3) where is the dessert menu?! Dessert please!"

I came here with my family tonight and was thoroughly impressed.  It&#39;s a relatively small restaurant and a bit loud when crowded, but the decor is cute, the service is kind, and the food is amazing!  

Our waitress was efficient and friendly, and the manager stopped by our table several times to check in and chat.  The food was truly excellent.  We split the Bell&#39;s IPA Battered Wisconsin Cheese Curds, and then I couldn&#39;t make a decision, so I ordered both the Roasted Butternut Squash Hummus and Mrs. Peck&#39;s Savory Skillet Mac N Cheese.  My family members also really enjoyed the food they had, and my Autumn Cider Palmer to drink was tasty as well.

Every time I drive by the restaurant is busy with people, dining inside and outside. I had read reviews and I was excited to check them out. 
Last night on my way home from work I decided to stop there for a very late dinner and a glass of wine. I walked in a little past 8 pm and there were a few people sitting at the bar and a few tables were occupied. That late there was no wait. 
I got seated and was given a menu. I was dining alone, something I enjoy quite a bit, and my server must have found that strange since he asked me if I ordering to go. 
I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and he brought it over right away alone with some water. 
I looked over the menu and everything sounded amazing. I ended up going with the turkey shallot burger that comes on a wheat bun I believe it was. I refused the fries and went with the mixed greens salad that came with a fantastic vinaigrette type dressing. 
My burger was unlike any other burger. It was not greasy at all, it was full of flavor, cooked perfectly and simply delicious. I don&#39;t even know how to explain it other than perfect deliciousness. I pretty much devoured my meal. 
The server checked on me a few times, there was also a gentleman with glasses that was walking around and he came over to ask me how everything tasted. He caught me mid bite so all I could go is give him a thumbs up. 
The food was good, the restaurant is trendy and inviting. 
It&#39;s been a while since I  enjoyed a simple meal as much as I enjoyed my late dinner here. 
I enjoyed my glass of wine and my meal after a stressful day at the job. 
I can&#39;t wait to go back and enjoy more deliciousness."

I believe it opened about two weeks ago. My fiancé and I were looking for new places to eat in Lombard, and we were ecstatic that this new restaurant is a 5-minute walk from our house. We&#39;ve only frequented Babcock&#39;s once so far. However, after one visit, we are certain to become regulars. Babcock&#39;s has a warm, inviting atmosphere and is located in the heart of Lombard by the Metra station. 

The staff is friendly, courteous, and prompt. I can tell they actually enjoy working for this new restaurant. One of the owners came over to our table and talked to us for quite a while. It felt like home - she seemed to know everyone in the restaurant, and she seemed to know every family and business in the area! 

They had a vast selection of sodas and beers, and their food menu had some unique and delicious offerings. I had the Smashed Potato Burger. It was a 1/3lb burger with cheddar cheese and mashed potatoes on the burger. This burger was fresh, filling, and satisfying! The taste of mashed potatoes, cheese, and the burger together was a mixture I hadn&#39;t considered before. 

I asked one of the owners about a breakfast/brunch menu, because Babcock&#39;s would be an absolutely perfect Sunday Funday brunch location! She said they had plans to roll one out, and they are still ramping up their employees since they are so new. I am very excited to try that new menu when it comes out!

Overall, Babcock&#39;s is a fantastic new restaurant and it will surely become a Lombard staple before too long!"

There are so many options for all kinds of people. Vegan, vegetarian and omni. 
I had the sweet potato burger. The avocado was a perfect amount. The garlic sauce was good. My mom had a beef burger and loved it. You get to pick a side salad or fries. The fries are a bigger portion but the home made balsamic dressing was really delicious with the salad. 
The only thing different was that you order inside and they bring your food to your table, kind of like noodles and company does.
Overall everything was really fresh. I will definitely be back for the soups and the caramelized onion grilled cheese! Oh and beer of course :)"

The place is lovely and authentic vintage. Seems like they take great pride in what they do.  I appreciate a non-styro take out container (well done).   

No issues except that ...

I wish desperately that they had at least 1 or 2 real comfort food dinner options on the menu.  Example: stuffed peppers,  or beef stew, pork chops, roasted potatoes, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, roasted veggies, salisbury steak, stuffed cabbage rolls. 

I am just not a burger person, and can only eat so many salads.  With Shannon&#39;s Deli right across the street, I feel they have more options for me.  There is so little in the way of food in downtown Lombard, and some affordable comfort food would be very welcome."

It has a friendly, welcoming atmosphere with a mix of modern and historical decor (it&#39;s located in the old Babcock&#39;s Grove House hotel).

Everything I&#39;ve tried has been delicious - no joke.  They offer a seasonal food menu with &#34;mostly local&#34; beers. Their salads are nice and fresh, the burgers are nice and juicy, and their beer and wine selection is great. For first-timers, I&#39;d recommend the pretzel and beer cheese appetizer, the green goddess salad, the turkey shallot burger, or the stout pulled pork sliders with chipotle cheese.

We arrived at 5:40 or so on a Friday, and 45 minutes later the place was full with people waiting. We were seated immediately, back in a corner. I know a historic building has its challenges, but I will say the acoustics back there were a little rough, voices echoed back toward our table. The tables are also quite close together. But who can blame them wanting to fit as many people as possible in?

The menu is not big but this is a good thing. Everything sounds very good. We started with cheese curds. They are clearly homemade and all different shapes. And delicious! The dipping sauce was tasty too.

My husband ordered the beer cheese burger and a fancy grape soda; I had the chicken schnitzel sandwich and a peach tea palmer (with lemonade). My husband said his burger was perfect, and devoured it before I got a taste. My sandwich was also very delicious, and the fries were quite good as well.

Service was a little tentative at times (I think the young woman serving us is new, but she was friendly and competent) but overall good. It&#39;s a new restaurant so no harm there.

Ate there with three people...had the pretzel and beer cheese app, pretzel was huge...cheese was solid with a little horseradish kick.

As far as entrees, had a smash potato burger which was reportedly very good and then split both the chicken, apple brie sandwich and the chicken schnitzel sandwich with someone. Both were good but extremely bland and grandparent-ly safe in flavor. Definitely could use some kind of contrasting flavor...both of them were satisfying but forgetful.

Main problem was, even though it was admittedly a warm day...it was stuffier than hell in there...could use some more air moving around. There&#39;s a back corner that&#39;s like a sauna. 

Also, no fault of the restaurant, but there were also a couple of blow hards that apparently had mistaken it for the corner bar. Older locals monopolizing a table and the poor server over several beers and loudly regaling her with tales of Lombard past and how many beers they drank and tracked in their phone app over the years. Literally seizing her for 5 minute stretches while they explained how they were drinking &#34;x&#34; beer before it was even available in stores like anyone cared. Don&#39;t be that person."

If you don&#39;t like local brews, they also have Schlitz in a bottle!  Have passed by  Babcock&#39;s since they opened a month ago and have wanted to give them a try.  Stopped in tonight and had a Ferdinand&#39;s salad and a Founders porter.   Everything was top notch from the food to the service.  Decor and ambience is great for everyone from couples out on a date to families looking for a reasonably priced meal.  This is now one of my go to local restaurants."

My fiance and I are committed to becoming regulars. We&#39;re obsessed and want to try everything on the menu. I&#39;ve been here with him, my parents, and even my grandmother.  Getting my grandmother in was somewhat of a challenge because it&#39;s not handicap accessible (however, the owner says they&#39;re working on that).  Some other patrons were nice and helped me get her up the steps so it worked out just fine! 

Some food highlights: the Sweet Potato Burger and the Turkey Shallot Burger.  I&#39;m shedding for the wedding, so it&#39;s nice that they have some healthy options. The mixed organic greens they have as a side option are also very good. Through other people I&#39;ve tried almost every other dish on the menu, and noting disappointed me! 

Downtown Lombard needed something like this.... we recently moved from the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago (land of amazing restaurants on every corner) and this is so cute and hip that I almost think I&#39;m back in the city and not in Lombard. I grew up in Lombard, and am pleasantly surprised with new restaurants and bars popping up. Babcock&#39;s Grove embraces its downtown Lombard location and the decorations center around the history of Lombard. 

The owners hit one of the park with this one. Definitely try it if you haven&#39;t yet!"

We started out with delicious craft beef and glass of Cabernet and the roasted beet humus. The burgers are handcrafted from Allen Brothers ground chuck perfectly done. The fries are hand cut and of a large portion. 
Looking forward to going back. Extensive wine and craft beef offering. 
Too bad we did not have room for their signature ice cream floats with there fountain crafted cane sodas. Next time for sure!"

They&#39;re still learning to improve their service.  (Weird to ask you to pay beforehand).  But, their niceness makes up for a few inconsistencies.

was generally how I reacted so won&#39;t rehash what everyone said.

Nevertheless, I do have one comment that might matter to some people. I had their classic burger and it was good, no real complaints. Except the burger was slathered with mustard. I&#39;ve never had a burger at a restaurant that had mustard on it. It may be a personal thing but I hate mustard on a burger. Possibly my fault if that ingredient was mentioned on the menu - I didn&#39;t check."

babcocks-grove-house-lombard,Rebecca C.,Vv921iDdazUHJqPCBzJnUQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,82,14,BiuB-KIu4ts4YT3QaQG62A,5.0,2016-06-01,"While nothing holds a candle to Chicago, there are huge nuisances such as parking and tiny annoyances such as crowding. So, when wanting a slight break from the gritty city, but rather not come face to face with an obtrusive strip mall, Babcock&#39;s Grove House is brand spanking new to downtown Lombard and their induction to town is FABULOUS! The talented owners took the old Cafe 101 and brought it up to the standards of super cozy cafe with charm out the wazoo! It probably doesn&#39;t hurt that the lilac village has been hungry for someone just like the new owners to dust off the pre-civil war limestone and polish the wood. Every inch is charming and it&#39;s so nice to have several months to bask outside, European cafe style, in the middle of the Lilac Village. Lots of seating outside, decent amount of seating inside. This locale is just so darling it deserves a big hug! 

Like European cafes, there&#39;s a huge wine list and a lot of local beers available. We weren&#39;t in the mood for alcohol, but I will definitely try one of their wines the next time I&#39;m in (which will be very, very soon). 

Food - after all, that&#39;s the main reason to come here, and Babcock&#39;s has very yummy organic, locally sourced, healthy yet delicious comfort foods. To begin with, on a warm Spring weekday, the best drink is unsweetened iced tea which they have down to a science, for a measly $2.25. One can drown themselves in a sea of refreshing, pure tea, and it&#39;ll still cost less than $.10 per ounce. Don&#39;t need to go back to Brussels, folks, if that&#39;s all you&#39;re going for are the fries. Babcock&#39;s Belgian fries are to die for and then to return for another order, or 2 or 3. The beer battered cheese curds - my oh my oh my. Wisconsin, step right up in Lombard &#39;cuz there&#39;s a new contest and Babcock&#39;s might win. These addicting little critters are wonderful and from the ooh&#39;s and ah&#39;s from other tables, I think they agree. Amazing, in that everything appears to be under $10, and that includes all the entrees. Portions are more than ample, plated beautifully and there&#39;s more than enough on everyone&#39;s plate to share.  

The chicken Caesar Salad was delightful and delicious, with a mixture of the tastiest romaine (not bitter); kale (yay!), croutons &amp; lime Caesar to add a scrumptious fresh flavor that&#39;s also sneaking in those healthy nutrients. This isn&#39;t a typical Caesar salad, yet it hits normal where needed while adding something different that forces me to want to order it again and again. I had a taste of the Smokey Sweet potato burger that is just wonderful, especially for a veggie burger. With bean puree, roasted garlic yogurt, avocado on a sprouted wheat bun that brings all the deliciousness together - that was one amazing &#34;burger.&#34; Good for Lombard, since this new gem is gonna make Lombard proud. In fact, I think they already have!"

babcocks-grove-house-lombard,Dave S.,viNNiVtWSSBCbNPwuNV65A,"Lombard, IL",0,1,0,30,17,VqlfLxXYfEM1qIwK9itBSw,4.0,2016-05-27,"It&#39;s too early for me to give a full review of Babcock&#39;s Grove House right now. The menu is in its &#34;training&#34; phase, according to Dana, the manager/owner. Of the two entrees my wife and I ordered, we were pretty pleased with one (the pork sliders) while finding the other one lacking (grilled cheese). The fries were standard, and I found the birthday cake soda to be way too sweet for my middle-aged palate.

But I&#39;m giving BGH four stars. Why? Ally Sheedy in &#34;The Breakfast Club,&#34; that&#39;s why. Sheedy&#39;s character spends most of the movie under a dark cloud; unfriendly, off-putting, rude and crude. Molly Ringwald sees something in her, and suddenly, at the end of the movie, the ugly duckling has become the swan, still a little unsure of herself, but so much more inviting and full of promise. 

On the front door of BGH, it says &#34;Welcome. We&#39;re happy to have you.&#34; (Or something like that. I didn&#39;t take notes.) But it&#39;s a complete reversal from the hand-written &#34;closed today&#34; sign that hung here far too often. The terrible (and well-deserved) reputation of Cafe 101 put such a dark cloud here - ground zero of downtown Lombard - that it was hard for me to imagine anything better coming along.

And it took until late May of 2016, but somehow, the sun is poking through. Behold the swan! Watch in amazement as she learns to fly with grace! 

Okay, I&#39;m waxing too poetic, and I&#39;m no poet. But my meal came with a smile. In fact, when I first peeked in the previous day, I saw more smiles at that one moment than I had seen in five prior years of Cafe 101. The dark cloud has lifted. Here comes the sun. Hallelujah!"

good to see some serious vegetarian options - i tried the

the butternut squash humus is really good.

Judging from our frequenting this place, we are in good company because we have run into the same people over and over. The owners seem to know everyone in town and even the mayor was there!

I had the grilled cheese with tomato sandwich which wasn&#39;t anything spectacular or fancy - just cheddar on sourdough, though it was grilled to perfection. I&#39;d like to see Babcock&#39;s &#34;kick it up a notch&#34; by using two different types of cheeses, such as provolone with the cheddar. The side of greens was plentiful, but again, no imagination. Just a small pile of green and purple greens (same variety). It&#39;d be nice to have at least a little bit of cucumber and tomato. The balsamic dressing on the side was very good; nice and tangy. My husband had the evening special: chicken salad on whole wheat. The waiter told us this was the first time having chicken salad on the menu and came back later to ask my husband how he liked it. Hubby gave it a thumbs up. I had tasted a bite too, and it was good. Not saturated with mayo and had a little bit of tarragon. My son had the basic burger and we were impressed to see it was free-formed, not machine-pressed and &#34;perfect&#34;. He said it wasn&#39;t greasy at all and had great flavor. I tasted his fries and they were amazing - some of the freshest fries I&#39;ve ever had.

Our waiter was a young man (looking around, I noticed all the waitstaff was very young) who was very courteous and friendly, checked on us just the right amount of times, and refilled our drinks just as they were empty. You could tell he was inexperienced and a little awkward, but that was OK.

As for the restaurant itself...when we first walked in, we were confused as to what to do. You literally walk right into the restaurant. There is no host and no sign that says &#34;seat yourself&#34;. There was waitstaff buzzing around, but no one greeted us or showed us to a table. So we took it upon ourselves to find a table in the back of the restaurant. By the time we left around 6:30, the place was mobbed and there were people waiting for tables. This was a Thursday night, so I can imagine it gets very crowded on weekends. The place is small with not many tables. In fact, you have to really squeeze by some of them to get to the back of the restaurant. And, in the back, some of the tables are so tightly packed that the servers were having a tough go with trying to wait on the tightly packed tables and with the customers going to and from the bathrooms, which are right by the kitchen in back of the restaurant, too. Speaking of the bathrooms - meticulously clean, which is greatly appreciated and also a good sign of a clean restaurant! I will be recommending this place to friends and family who live in the area - the positives definitely outweigh the piddly negatives. Food and waitstaff are fantastic!"

First thing we ordered were the cheese curds. Hands down, the best I&#39;ve ever had and that&#39;s counting what I&#39;ve considered to be the &#34;best I&#39;ve had&#34; up in Wisconsin.

Booze: Good list of local beer. They have the BEST gluten-free beer, Lakefront New Grist...which made me immediately love this place.  Most restaurants don&#39;t stock New Grist and they really should. Wine list was perfect too!

Food: 
Excellent options. Excellent ingredients. There are far too few places in the burbs with a menu focusing on local, organic, quality ingredients. High-five. And prices were perfect. 

Service: you can tell it&#39;s a newer place. Our server didn&#39;t seem to have lots of experience. Would have like a quicker check-in with us after our food came because we realized we wanted a few more items. But this was nothing major.

Babcock&#39;s Grove House offers a unique, tasty, fresh (no freezer except for the ice cream!), inspired menu with plenty of options for all.  Thus far my family has tried and highly recommend the following:
   * the turkey burger - so moist and flavorful with shallots and portobello mushrooms in the mix - the best turkey burger my husband has ever had
   * my potato loving daughter raved about the smashed potato burger
   * my other daughter can&#39;t stop talking about the Babcock&#39;s Classic burger 
   * chicken apple salad - yum
   * sweet potato burger - great vegetarian option; huge - didn&#39;t need to eat it all, but couldn&#39;t put it down!
   * the Green Goddess sandwich has such a fresh unique flavor
   * as tasty as the raved-about fries are, I opted for the organic greens served with an incredible balsamic dressing on the side (and was still able to steal a few fries from my family&#39;s plates!)
 
Drinks (all &#34;made in the USA!&#34;): 
   * a very comprehensive beer menu which offers something for everyone on tap or bottled
   * The wine list has a nice selection of varietals all offered by the glass or by the bottle. 
   * unsweetened peach tea is to die for!
   * craft sodas are fun for the kids and sweet-toothed adults (you have to try the Babcock&#39;s Birthday cake soda)

Lastly, the staff is plentiful and eager to attend to diner&#39;s needs.

It&#39;s so nice for Lombard to have another restaurant that not only locals can enjoy, but one that will surely be a destination for people from neighboring communities and beyond. We can&#39;t wait to watch Babcock&#39;s evolve over time as we taste our way through the menu. Bravo for a job well done!"

It is a well decorated, relaxed inside with elements of Lombard History throughout and the only thing that is better than the decor is the wonderful, flavorful food and drinks! 

The smashed potato burger is seriously the best tasting burger I have had in years! The homemade  balsamic salad dressing that comes on the side salad is AMAZING. The chicken schnitzel sandwich is fantastic as well. The banana split sandwich is a fun dinner for the kids. Everything is loaded with flavor and you can tell it is made with fresh, local ingredients. The wine selection and local beers on tap are the perfect compliment to the food. There is even a wide selection of Illinois-made soda choices, which is a fun retro addition. 

Everything is reasonably priced and worth every penny. 

We are so excited that this caliber of dinning is offered in Lombard.  There is some outdoor seating and the overall quant size keeps the feeling &#34;small town&#34; and local. The staff is so friendly and knowledgable about the menu items, which only adds to the perfection of this little gem!  We will be eating here often. :)"

This restaurant has a great ambiance with fun historic photos of Lombard and famous Lombard residents and politicians. There is also a cute bar serving a nice variety of local craft beers. The waitstaff was plentiful and eager to help. I had the smashed potato burger with buttermilk mashed potatoes. It was cooked perfectly and those mashed potatoes were a quirky, tasty addition under the moist and buttery brioche bun. I also tried the buffalo chicken wedge salad ordered by my dining companion. It was spicy with a great twist on the traditional wedge. I really like this place, and will return again soon! I&#39;m happy to see more great places moving into downtown Lombard."

They&#39;re still working out a few kinks, being fairly new, and the servers are young and learning, so be patient. But I Love every item I&#39;ve ever tried! My top favorites are the cheese curds, smashed potato and shepherds pie burgers, and the green goddess sandwich. Hoping their expanded seating gets here before the cold weather, I could eat here every day! My only major complaint is the side of mixed greens. They could REALLY use something more than just leaves. Something as simple as a tomato, cucumber, or shredded carrots would make it feel more substantial."

Four of us came, and we had the turkey burger, mashed burger, schnitzel sandwich, and blue cheese burger. We all loved our choices; so good! Everything was fresh and seasoned to perfection. I personally had the turkey burger, and it was, by far, one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Our waiter was Nile and he was friendly, accommodating, and efficient. I do wish they had a full bar; at least some mixed drinks. Overall, awesome location, cool concept, and great food. We will be back!"

I wonder if people will agree that the comments left by the owner were a little condescending. I also feel as if my review wasn&#39;t read at all..

A. I do not work at Drytini, Sorry that you assumed that and tried to throw a little sarcastic remark as if you know who I am now.. attempt failed. 

B. I did request the dressing on the side. I said that I was trying to lose weight and my choice is to dip my fork in the dressing. That has zero relevance to anything I already said.

C. I clearly watched the person take it from me and walk toward someone else to hand it to them. Don&#39;t lie to try and come back from this. Your silence would have made much more of an impact. Word of mouth, and my mouth especially, is so much more powerful!

Such a Shame."

Great job by the new owners who have clearly put so much heart and soul into creating a special place with a fantastic locally sourced menu.  We went with a group of 8, so we had a lot of feedback and different plates. The good news is that everyone really enjoyed their meals and there were definitely a few standouts including the Turkey Burger and the Green Goddess sandwich. The kids all ordered floats made with various soda flavors and the adults sampled some of the beer selection.  Really unique!    Can&#39;t wait to come back and try some more soon!"

The reason for the two star rating is for the dilapidated condition of the restaurant. It has been quite a while since I have been in the store. Somebody else in the family has usually been the person picking up and bringing the food home. Tonight, my wife and I decided to have our ice cream in the store.

That was a mistake. The floor of the customer section was absolutely filthy and needs replacement.  The cushions and vinyl covering for the chairs were ripped and in terrible condition. The White painted frames for the chairs were filthy and grimy. Finally, the tabletops are well past the need for replacement.

This the sign of an owner that has no pride in ownership and fine with a sucky customer experience.

I have to wonder when the last time Dairy Queen came by to inspect this franchisee. We will continue to order for carry out, but I will not eat inside this store again."

Sushi sampler - good for a split appetizer or single entree for lunch. Odd with the orange slice as garnish.

Miso soup - bit on the salty side

Seared tuna salad - salad greens are way over dressed, used red delicious, tuna a tad on the salty side but cooked perfectly when asked. A Fuji would really pair well with the flavors

Happy hour has awesome deals here, so I plan on coming back to check that out. The fish is pretty good quality-wise.

At this particular visit, I ordered the crazy roll and inky roll. A glass of white Zinfandel went well with these rolls. Though there were lots of sauce on top of the rolls, they tasted excellent with the sauce wiped off from the top. The cuts of fish are pretty fat and fresh too.

It even looked pretty awesome with the nice decor. But, to my disappointment, it was meh. I picked this place because my boyfriend loves sushi, but I&#39;m not a big fan; I went for the wok. The sushi he said was OK; nothing fantastic or anything to rave about. I had sesame crispy chicken and it was REALLY boring. It was not crispy in the slightest and the flavor was pretty bland. I have had better from a hole in the wall Chinese take out place for $6. It was literally chicken with some random celery shavings on top and white rice. The rice was not even sticky; chopsticks were absolutely useless. My meal was definitely no where near worth $15+. Also, the drink I ordered, one of their specialty martinis that was a twist on a lemon drop (my favorite), was pretty terrible as well. It tasted like nothing but vodka. I get that is the point of a martini, but at least a lemon drop has a flavor to it other then rubbing alcohol. It was extremely hard to finish. You may be wondering, &#34;Why didn&#39;t you say something and get a new one or something else?&#34;. Well, I would have loved to, but we only saw our waiter maybe twice. He was running around to several tables and I never had a chance. I would have given this review 1 star, but considering my boyfriend was not completely dissatisfied, I gave it 2. In my opinion, Wok &#39;n Fire is overpriced and was not worth it. I will not be returning, sadly."

Made a reservation for last weekend, but when we got there they could not find our name, not a problem that happens sometimes but we were told the wait would be a little while. We went to sit by the bar and have a drink. When we finally got our table though we asked to speak to a manager, she came by the table but was very rude and had an attitude that seemed like she did not care a mistake was even made. We were not asking for anything free or even being nasty we just wanted to make her aware of the situation so it did not happen to someone else!! Apparently they don&#39;t care if it happens again. This is enough to keep me from coming back. You are supposed to feel welcome in a restaurant not like you are a problem child!!"

Sushi - Stir Fry - Bar
South Barrington, Il - 2/15/2016

Although slightly below the normal star rating which is my cut off for restaurants, this restaurant was highly recommended by friends so we decided to go. Initially I tried to book the reservation for 11 people however the cut off online for this evening was seven... When we arrived we were able to move to the bar area and put together three large tables to accommodate our group... Problem solved I thought.

I&#39;m not quite sure this restaurant is able to accommodate large groups as it took forever for the food to come out, and when it did, some of our dishes were cold... Dishes that were supposed to be served hot...

I ordered my dish very light on the onions and scallions but it came out with the same amount as the another dish that wasn&#39;t ordered that way. The flavor was just OK and although our server offered to replace the meal with a hot one, I&#39;m always leery about sending food back at a restaurant... Especially out of town restaurants where I&#39;ve never eaten before...

I did enjoy the hot and sour soup. In the end the restaurant was nice enough to take my entrée off the bill but I would&#39;ve rather paid twice as much money for an enjoyable meal then get a not-so-good meal at no charge.  

It&#39;s quite possible that I caught them on a bad night... Perhaps you&#39;ll try it yourself and find that you like it... But for me I can cross it off my list as having been there, done that, no need to go back..."

The decor is great and gives a lively feeling. Our server was very kind and made his &#34;best&#34; recommendations. My favorite items were the chicken lettuce wraps and the Tom yum soup. Everything else went down hills. 
We ordered 4 sushi rolls, one wok dish and one noodle dish, and it&#39;s disappointing to say none were good. 
The sushi was not fresh, and rice was too sticky. The Noodle dish lacked flavor and the wok dish was so spicy you couldn&#39;t taste anything else. Major disappointment!"

We had started with two soups and some edamame, which was very fresh. We had ordered several rolls, one of which was the Wok n Roll. It was absolutely amazing! Highly recommended.

The food was good - we had the Crab Rangoons appetizer, the St Charles Roll, and the Inky Roll - and our waitress was really nice.  Some other aspects, however, I would change.  For one, I was FREEZING.  So much so that I had to leave my button-down, long winter coat on the entire time.  And it wasn&#39;t just me - at all the tables surrounding ours, patrons had their coats on too.  Our table was directly down from the entrance hallway and every time the door opened, a frigid gust of wind would hit our table.  Every time.  They tried to remedy this with a small space heater, but it didn&#39;t work.  It was really hard for me to enjoy my meal with my coat and scarf on.  

Wok &#39;n Fire also offered a few drink specials on Friday.  At first I ordered their white sangria, but, unfortunately, it just tasted like cheap wine.  I switched it out for a mango margarita that was better - but way too much sweet and sour mix.

Overall, I would love to return - I would just do it during the warmer months."

They have a wide variety of traditional maki rolls and also specialty maki rolls, which are kinda pricey, but the sushi is phenomenal and super creative too. Most of the staff is very friendly and attentive, I&#39;ve only had 2-3 bad servers, but out of dozens of times coming here, 2-3 is not bad at all. Not just the sushi is good though, the wok dishes and even the appetizers are some of the best meals that I&#39;ve ever had.

I found this place on the Find Me Gluten Free app and was psyched to see I had another option in the area. I mean, they even had fried rice! But I picked up food on a Saturday night and was super disappointed. The ginger chicken stir fry was alright but the fried rice was flavorless and gross; it didn&#39;t even taste like fried rice. I paid just as much as I would have at PF Changs, yet the variety of options was substantially less and the quality of the food was significantly lower. The decor seemed modern, but just stepping up to the hostess stand to get my takeout order I could barely hear anything over the music. Located in the Arboretum, it seemed like this place was trying to be cool and hip but with different food than the traditional American or Italian nearby. Identity crisis? Maybe. Because it sure wasn&#39;t Asian. 

Wok &#39;n Fire, I appreciate the effort, but let&#39;s have more follow through now please. Gluten free options are only great if they&#39;re edible. I would highly doubt the regular dishes as well given how simple the items were that I ordered, so just in general, steer clear."

The food was good for the most part, however, I felt like the variety of sushi wasn&#39;t great. 99% of the sushi special rolls have something fried in them, whether it be tempura, completely deep fried, or tempura flakes in them. I wanted to stay away from fried foods and the server said they only have 2 special rolls that don&#39;t have anything fried in or on them. Also, mostly everything has jalapeños too. If you&#39;re not a fan of spicy food, this may not be the place for you for sushi. It&#39;s too expensive for sushi that was mediocre, in my opinion. Also, the server I had came over WAY too often during the meal. He even came over to ask if we wanted anything wrapped up to take home before we finished eating. I might try this place again but not for the sushi."

The service was great and both the sushi and stir fry were excellent!  My only complaint would be that it&#39;s a little on the pricey side, but you are eating quality food in a a very upscale area, so I think it&#39;s justified.

I&#39;ve also tried the grilled wasabi salmon which I&#39;d highly recommend. It was a thin filet cooked perfectly with a slightly crispy crust. It&#39;s accompanied with a small portion of lightly sautéed garlic spinach. It&#39;s a perfect meal if you want to eat light and healthy.

This last visit left a bad taste in my mouth.  The waiter was pretty terrible.  We ordered drinks.  I ordered a Drunken Pomegranate Ginger Ale and it was pretty bad.  It was overly sweet and tasted flat.  When the waiter finally came back, I told him.  He offered to add soda water to give it carbonation, but I was afraid that would just make it taste watered down.  He then offered to make me a different, so I ordered a Dragon&#39;s Milk.  It was much better!

For appetizers, we ordered soups.  I enjoyed my Hot and Sour Soup.  I was disappointed in my boyfriend&#39;s Spinach Egg Drop Soup that for some reason has no spinach in it.  I asked the wiater about the missing spinach and he told me there is no spinach in Egg Drop Soup.  I then asked when it is called &#34;SPINACH Egg Drop Soup&#34; then.  That was our whole reason for trying it.  It sounded different.

Our noodle entree the first time was out of this world.  The Signature Sushi Roll we ordered was just okay.  The second time we returned, all the dishes were lacking.  I had to add the red chili paste to all the dishes and I never add spice to my dishes.  Even those that had the &#34;spicy&#34; sign next to them in the menu.  Everything was lacking in flavor this time around.  The Pad See Ewe was bland, so I added soy sauce.  The Curry Wok Dish was bland and definitely not spicy.  The Korean BBQ Dish was also bland.  It did not come with much meat and the chunks of meat were cut huge.  Too big to use with chopsticks.  I had to first cut the chunk into three pieces before they could be eaten with chopsticks.

I asked my waiter about a green bean dish, which was amazing our first time here.  It was our major factor in us returning.  He didn&#39;t know what we were talking about.  Finally we found &#34;Wrinkled Green Beans&#34; under sides.  They were okay this time, but not as amazing as I remembered them.

The service took forever and our waiter was missing most the time.  We kept having to ask bus boys and other wait staff when we wanted something, including the check.  Overall, our dinner service took about two hours (and 2 people were an hour late, so I was there 3 hours).

So why didn&#39;t I complain more when the manager stopped by?  We were celebrating my grandma&#39;s birthday and I didn&#39;t want to cause a scene.  Although, I did respond that the food was &#34;okay...&#34; instead of my usual &#34;great&#34; which I think should have tipped her off.  That is why I gave them two stars instead of one.  Well that and because no one got food poisoning and it is a cute atmosphere.  And the birthday banana fritters they give you were pretty good!

It is always disappointing when restaurants start out great and go downhill so quickly."

Spicy Shanghai noodles- The veggies are fresh, chicken is tender and it wasn&#39;t too spicy. I really like it but one thing they could do improve on is not to go overboard with the sauce. Overall, the dish was too saucy and it was overpowering the dish, all the noodles was drench in that stuff. My advice would be to go less on that since the whole dish since it was very well flavored. 

The Spicy Tuna- my favorite maki of the night with big chunk of fish and nice mayo saucing on top. 

The Fantasy- this roll is drier with no sauce so depends on your preference to sushi which one you will like. 

Lunch combo of these two maki are  $13. They also gave us one bowl of  complimentary hot and sour soup. The soup could be more sour. It was too sweet and salty and did not have enough eggs and ingredients. It didn&#39;t taste as authentic but it was free after all so we went with it. 

Over all, service is great here. They are very courteous and friendly, will check in often and refilled your glasses. I would recommend it here as a nice place for dinner for date night. There&#39;s low lighting with hanging paper lanterns that kind of create a romantic atmosphere (almost). Oh, and check on Groupon, they sometimes have deals here that you can buy. Last time I saw, there was a $15 for $30 deal."

The service was very attentive and offered helpful suggestions. Food was delivered promptly and every dish was to our liking. 

We started with the lettuce chicken wrap appetizer. This was almost a meal in itself. Appropriate portions of chicken, fried rice noodles and julienned scallions and carrots allowed us to make 5 wraps. Yum!

I had the lunch sushi sampler. The miso soup was well balanced with tofu and seaweed. All elements of the sushi sampler were excellent: California roll, spicy tuna roll and nigiri: salmon, tuna, shrimp. All very fresh. 

My girlfriend had the orange chicken with brown rice. The chicken was moist and tender and fried to a sweet and mildly crunchy finish with a hint of spice and not too much orange. I would probably go with the white rice or veggie fried option instead of the brown rice. 

Overall,  a great experience. We will definitely go again.

Four stars instead of five due to the fact that it is a fast-casual chain restaurant."

I used to go at least once a week for lunch or dinner. However, over the last six months or so their quality overall had gone down significantly. The quality of their sushi, drinks, and service has declined to the point that I don&#39;t think I will visit again in the future. Also the last three times I have been the bar and the kitchen area you walk past to use the restrooms had an overpowering stench of bleach, not appetizing.

Secondly, the sushi is pretty good.  I like the Thai Kick and the Mexican rolls.  They use the ingredients that you would most likely associate with those respective cuisines.  It&#39;s not the best, and it&#39;s not the worst, but it gets the job done if you have a sushi craving and you&#39;re in the area.

Thirdly, the parking is horrible.  The whole parking lot for the Arboretum is horrible.  Whoever designed the parking lot there must have had quite the sense of humor."

This is also a very family-friendly spot, despite its more upscale ambience. I&#39;ve also been very happy with the service here.

The manager I think has black hair and she&#39;s amazing always checking on us and making sure everything is perfect. I would defiantly recommend this place. Things to know most sushi rolls are made with &#34;crab mix&#34; but for a small up charge you can get real crab.

My BF and I joined my friend and her husband for midweek dinner. Given the miles between the two of us, we chose this a the meetup spot. Before arriving, I decided to check out the website to have a general idea of what was in store. Lots of sushi along with noodles and rice dishes. I also noticed there were happy hour specials offered in the lounge/bar area. 

When we arrived, they were already seated in the lounge having drinks. Bingo! This opened up the opportunity for 50% maki rolls and $5 cocktails. Our waiter, Evan, was attentive and upbeat. 

Hamachi Roll - 4 stars 

Tequila Jalepeno Roll - 4.5 stars 

Inky Roll - 5 stars!! *** The star of the night. Sounds like way too much going on but it is amazing. 

Las Vegas Roll - 3.5 stars ** not as good as most LV rolls 

Wok Tossed dish/Steak Basil - 3 stars  ** rice, peppers and meat. Basic.  I was underwhelmed and would not order it again."

Tofu Pad Thai was too dry and not enough fish sauce. Chef needs to decide which version of Pad Thai to go with....either with a sticky fish sauce or a tomato base sauce.  Tofu pieces were the right size but not crispy enough. 

My coworker had the ahi tuna salad that had a store bought dressing.   The tuna looked good with seared edges.

Restaurant made ginger ale but needed more sharp ginger notes."

I came here with a couple of work buddies for food and gossip.  Being a trendy Asian-inspired restaurant in South Barrington, I expected some high prices.  I wasn&#39;t starving, but wanted a nibble.  So I ordered a $7 shrimp tempura roll.  The roll was decent, but it was far from the best that I&#39;ve had.  It was smaller than the rolls that I&#39;m used to, especially for $7.  And the rice was not wrapped tightly.  It was just okay.

In the end, I enjoyed the company of my friends more than the food.  The atmosphere is gorgeous, though.  Lots of twinkling paper lanterns on the ceiling, and a cool dragon bas-relief on the wall.  I&#39;d probably come here again for company and drinks, but not for a significant meal."

Any way, parking spaces around the restaurant were very limited so we parked far. There was no wait so we were seated right away, but it took about 5-7 minutes before our server stopped by our table and said &#34;sorry, I&#39;ll be right with you.&#34; She wasn&#39;t as attentive as you would like your server to be throughout our stay. We told her we would be ordering an entrée to go and she said &#34;tell me later, it will take about 5-7 minutes to prepare...&#34; She wasn&#39;t even attentive with filling our glasses of water.

Then, I think he was a manager? Evan? He attended to our table a lot due to the matter that I had an allergy to seafood. Jodie, our server, said she would check out the ingredients in our appetizers and entrées, but nothing appeared out of the blue.. until 30 minutes after we ordered and Evan came back and told me that there was fish sauce already mixed into my mango sauce in my entrée. He did discount my entrée. But we waited another 15 minutes for our entrées to come. The food looked amazing in color and smelled great. It was all delicious, but the time it took, when the restaurant was not packed was apparently not worth it. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is modern and I love the hanging lanterns, but it&#39;s super cold in the building! Every time someone opens the door, a huge gush of cold air flows in and even if there door isn&#39;t open, there is a breeze!


Not sure if I will be recommending nor coming back any time soon. Very displeased this time around."

A group of us girls came here for some Sushi and Drinks and we were all more than pleased.  Ambiance is really neat and pretty... low lighting, tons of Chinese lanterns on the ceiling.  The place isn&#39;t overly huge either, but they definitely laid out the room well to get as many people in there as possible without overcrowding the place.

Waiter was attentive and had fun joking around with us when it came to shots (I was being a baby).  He also offered separate checks from the beginning which is super nice cause I hate to ask.

Food was GREAT, as well as the drinks.  Typical sushi prices.. My Spicy Crunch Roll had about 10 pieces for $13.00 and they were the BIG pieces so I left pretty full.  My miso soup ran around $3.95 and it was a really big cup and had plenty of tofu in it, they do not skimp on that at all.  He also asked us what kind of soy sauce we prefer, less sodium or regular.  

We never had to wait long for refills, food, etc.  It was an all-around great experience.

Side note for Yelp though... this is definitely not located in Schaumburg, it is South Barrington.  I have no idea why its listed in the Burg...."

The place was pretty empty for a Friday night at 8pm, but maybe everyone was at that i-pik theater or something? Either way, we were sat right away and had a nice waiter. He was pretty knowledgeable of the menu, we&#39;d never been here before. We ended up getting a gyoza/fried dumpling appetizer, it was good but only five pieces? I think six would be better for people to share but oh well. I ended up getting the chicken teriyaki with fried rice, boyfriend has the Korean BBQ with the kimichi rice, and I also got a crunchy roll thing for us to share. The best was the sushi roll, it was some kind of crab salad, avocado, and cream cheese and some shrimp. It did have a weird all mushy consistency, but taste wise it was good. Would def get again. BF said the Korean BBQ was good, and I liked the teriyaki sauce and the chicken was good. BUT the fried rice...meh far from fried rice. Tasted more like weakly browned rice. Would NOT pay again for the up charge to get the fried rice. And it was a measly little scoop. We also shared the ginger apple crisp thing with ice cream. DEF big enough to share. It was pretty good. All in all, the total was around 80 bucks, and 100 with tip. I think I would pass next time, the sushi was good but totally not a good value for the cost. The other food I could get at a Korean BBQ place or Chinese food restaurant and be more satisfied. Quality vs quantity and I&#39;d give this place a solid 2/5."

Walking into the restaurant was pretty cool, there were lots of decorative statues and other elements in the restaurant.  In the main dining area there are a bunch of small lanterns that sway as the air moves.  The ambiance for this place is very nice.

We were seated quickly and the waitress was nice.  Ordered Szechuan Tilapia and a Salmon Maki.  Szechuan Tilapia came with large sides as well and was very filling.  However I felt that the flavors of the food was very Americanized.  The garlic spinach was good, however the Tilapia tasted like they just put teriyaki sauce on it and called it a day. 

The Salmon make had extremely thin cuts of fish. I&#39;ve been to many other sushi places before and never had a cut of fish this thin.  The avocado in the roll was not good.

Being served them, being charged $7 apiece for them, no apology for the miscue on the server&#39;s part, or the fact that we were each given a refill (make that 2 drunken ginger ales apiece) and none of us felt anything from said alcohol. 

And then there is the music. Oh, the music. Last two times in here there has been this atrocious 80s music playing. Loudly. Sounds like the Time Life CDs you buy on TV when you have insomnia. Doesn&#39;t fit the vibe of the place at all and makes it really challenging to carry on a serious conversation with a colleague. 

My trips have always been at lunchtime. Perhaps dinner is better. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll find out."

This was our first dinner out that my wife could enjoy an adult beverage (just had our second daughter), so we were pretty excited.  We are avid sushi lovers and have tried many places in the area. 

First, let me state that the decor in this place is pretty awesome. I like how the bar/dining area is separated by a big abacus...pretty creative design move.  The huge Buddha when you walk in is pretty impressive as is the gold dragon in the dining area.

We started off with two saki bombs, which took us by surprise as we&#39;re used to cold saki....they use warm.  Different but good!  I tried a bottle of their pear infused saki, which was pretty decent, while my wife had a beer.  For apps, we went with what I would call tuna nachos....good stuff.  We also tried the calamari which was crisp, but the sauce it came with tasted more like ketchup with a little bit of spice, rather than a legit cocktail sauce. Still decent nonetheless.  We then order the 10pc sashimi, red spider and a spicy tuna roll. They were good...not bad, but not really memorable. Just standard rolls, but seemed to be smaller than our regular sushi place. We felt the presentation was pretty substandard and the cuts of sashimi to be a tad conservative with prices how they are. However, it was very fresh. Since we were still hungry, we ordered two bowls of miso and a yum yun roll.   Miso was ok...lots of tofu which I like, but it seemed to be only warm, not really hot which would have been nice. The yum yun roll was very tasty...definitely my favorite roll.  We didn&#39;t stay for dessert, so I can&#39;t comment on that. 

So why 3 stars?  While the food was good, and the ambiance was pretty awesome, we felt the overall experience for the price didn&#39;t line up. Our bill after tip was $150, for what I felt should have been a $100 meal. We weren&#39;t &#34;wowed&#34; by the food though it was enjoyable. Would I recommend this place.....maybe, but we likely won&#39;t be coming back."

I have a little Polish in my heritage, but am not fluent in the language, so I find myself guessing at some of the food offerings. Most are delicious, from take home soups; to prepared salads; to the deli meats. They are probably known for the hot food they serve during certain hours.
They need to replace styrofoam containers with plastic that seals since so many food offerings have sauces and no matter how careful I drive home, inevitably there is leaking if not spillage. It would also be nice if they would translate food labeling into English."

However this match box packs a powerful punch concentrating on homemade soups, a variety of handmade kielbasa and a carry out hot lunch counter. This is not your everyday lunchtime destination...tender baked chicken, kielbasa swimming in a savory kapusta, hand made cabbage rolls, breaded pork chops, crusty on the outside/tender on the inside potato pancakes, cheese and fruit blintzes...I can go on.

AJB needs to get rid of the small grocery isle of canned goods and such and open up the floor plan to accommodate what customers really want, homemade polish food, a focus on specialty deli items and some breathing room to enjoy it! A few small tables to eat your lunch would be a welcome addition to the atmosphere.

As is, the footprint of AJB is a tight fit for customers.The cashier area is tell tale...2 is company, 3 is a crowd!"

It&#39;s tiny, but jam packed with all kinds of goodies.  They make their own pierogies &amp; you can buy them frozen (they have potato, potato &amp; cheese, potato &amp; bacon, meat, mushroom, sauerkraut, blueberry &amp; strawberry - I can&#39;t remember if the fruit ones come with cheese, but I think they do) - we&#39;ve tried them all and love &#39;em!  The fruit pierogies are great for breakfast.  There&#39;s many homemade soups packaged to go, red cabbage, sauerkraut, etc...They also have all kinds of desserts, both in the refrigerated section &amp; with the bakery items.  Yes, the canned goods may have a bit of dust on them, but they aren&#39;t expired or anything. ;-)  Plus there are teas, candies, Polish greeting cards &amp; even some beauty &amp; pharmacy items.

Last, but not least, is the meat counter.  I think they have 6 kinds of kielbasa alone!  Plus a variety of other meats.  We recently purchased 4 huge Country Kielbasa links (each about 15&#34; long and at least 1.5&#34; in diameter) for $12.81!  And they are sooooo good!

Any staff working there speak both Polish &amp; English so don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions - they are all very helpful &amp; knowledgeable.  Oh, and the last time we were there I saw their sign that they offer a &#34;Hot Lunch&#34; to go...can&#39;t wait to try that!"

If you have already tried and grown tired of everything else in the area for lunch, you should definitely try AJB&#39;s authentic Polish hot lunch for carry out. You basically assemble your lunch (i.e., cafeteria style) from the daily offerings and pay by weight, and the result is always a high quality, affordable lunch that tastes like it could have been served in an expensive European restaurant.

Did not get the can of pop that&#39;s advertised. Man at the register seemed more interested in what was on his iPhone at the time then assisting me with my order.

The fried rice was disappointing: Lots of rice with a few drops of soy sauce and a half teaspoon of green onions and half a dozen bean sprouts. Slightly chewy, maybe undercooked.

The Kung Pao chicken was also disappointing. While there was a good mix of chicken and vegetables, and the chicken was not overcooked, the sauce was very lacking and not spicy. It really just tasted like it was stir-fried in soy sauce and very little else. There wasn&#39;t any sauce to speak of. Two dried chili peppers looked out of place as the entire dish did not have any heat whatsoever.

The egg roll was pretty good. Pork, shrimp and vegetables, no overpowering spice, and not greasy. Only reason this review has two stars instead of one.

I remembered reading Chopstix was a favorite for some in the area, so I drove over to give it a shot.

I walked in to what seemed to be an argument, yet I continued in to browse the menu.  They had many dishes to choose from and it appeared lunch dishes were a great deal.  I noticed a section of steamed options, with sauces on side, for healthy alternative, which was nice to see.  I ended up ordering enough for a small family and was out the door, food in hand, fairly quickly.

Once home, I dug right in.  To my dismay, I was searching flavor in each dish.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed.  I&#39;d say all the proteins themselves were fine, but the flavors of everything were simply lacking for me.  The Ma Po Tofu was in a spicy, yet overly soupy, red sauce with peppers and chunks of pork, rather than a grounded pork.  Probably the worst I&#39;ve had.  The best of the three entree dishes I ordered was the Scallops and Garlic Sauce.  For the appetizers, the steamed potstickers were tasty enough.

Maybe I&#39;ll try some different dishes in the future, in hopes that I just ordered the wrong things, but I won&#39;t be running back any time soon to do so.  Not because I don&#39;t run, which is true, but because nothing was worth going back for seconds."

I ordered the classic General Tso&#39;s chicken while my friends got the Mongolian Three Delight and Lucky 7.  The General Tso&#39;s could have been good, the sauce was really nice, but the chicken was really overcooked and almost jerky-like.  

It&#39;s hard to describe what this is like, unless you&#39;ve kept Chinese delivery in your fridge uncovered for a few days and re-heated it in the microwave.  That is what this chicken was like.  It was tough, stringy, and half of it was really inedible.  My friends enjoyed their meals (that&#39;s why the get the 2 stars), but they had to eat around the shrimp (also heavily over cooked).

I&#39;ve had much better chinese in the AH area, I&#39;d suggest Canton House if you want delivery, I&#39;ve found their food is better prepared and cheaper, while their delivery is free (compared to a $3 fee here).

TL;DR Bad chicken, bad shrimp, over-priced.  You can do better."

I ordered a whole bunch of stuff for 4 of us and they said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes, score, so fast. We did pick up and had to wait a few minutes when we got there. No problem. We were given all our food in a box for easy carrying since there was a lot.

-Orange Chicken- Was great, prob the best I have ever had

-General Tso Chicken- So I thought it was just ok as did my husband, my 2 friends said it was really good. I ended up eating the leftovers and they were not good,  I had to throw them away.

-Sesame Chicken- This was really good, one of the best I have had very succulent chicken 

-Honey pecan shrimp chicken(not positive that name is right)- I didn&#39;t try this but my friend got it and really liked it. It looked weird, like a bed of chicken with mashed potatoes on top(there weren&#39;t potatoes on it just looked like it) 

-Fried Rice- I got plain fried rice and it was pretty good, I would def get it again

-Egg Rolls- Super good, I was only sad that they didn&#39;t pack enough sweet and sour for our big order 

-Crab Rangoon- I didn&#39;t try any cause of the sweet and sour shortage but the friends seemed to like it. 

-Egg Drop Soup-Super good, on par with any other good egg drop soup I have had at other places

Overall, very good. I will be going back! :)

Well my boys wanted food from a place two doors down yesterday and I stopped in here for some vegetable fried rice.  A solid fried rice with really fresh ingredients and not buried in soy sauce.  

Today the family decided to get take-out from Chopstix and it was mixed reviews, though all positive.  We ordered egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, steamed pot stickers, beef and broccoli, and sweet and sour chicken.  

I don&#39;t eat sweet and sour chicken, though the family really liked it.  The boys and I really liked the beef an broccoli, though my wife didn&#39;t care for the beef so much.  Again nice fresh broccoli in the dish, really nice.  The steamed pot stickers are the best we have gotten from any Asian restaurant in the area. The sauce they served with it had fresh garlic in it, nice flavor.  

I had the hot and sour soup, it was okay.  Again fresh ingredients, but it was over thickened (imo) which gave it to much of a gelatin texture, I think the egg drop may have been the same from what I could see.  The boys enjoyed that and said they liked it.  

All and all a good dinner, we surely will be back and I have already told some people at work about it.  It will be interesting on how the food matures as the business grows.  I hope they keep up the good work."

Best service we&#39;ve ever had for take out, anywhere.  Chopstix was superior today and with very reasonable prices.  Excellent, friendly service which made me feel extremely welcome and that they really appreciated my business. 

I haven&#39;t had Egg Foo Young in years and it was delicious.

My wife enjoyed the Pad Thai and their shrimp egg rolls were fantastic!

When I ordered egg rolls they volunteered that there are 2 in our lunch special and did I think that would be enough - that was perfect. Most places would rather take the extra revenue but I love that Chopstix would much rather have my repeat business!  They also surprised me by saying they owed me a couple sodas with the lunch special...  I hadn&#39;t noticed that on the take out menu but it sure was appreciated when offered.  The little things in life really do matter.

My favorite sales and service training guru, Jeffrey Gitomer has the best phrase for Chopstix:  &#34;People hate to be sold, but they love to buy!&#34;  I can&#39;t wait to go back. 

On an NPS scale of 0 to 10, Chopstix gets a very enthusiastic 10!!"

We ordered a variety of dinners. Prices are reasonable, but the flavor was ehh. Nothing we had was amazing, but nothing was disgusting. Well.. The egg rolls were a little odd tasting and basically all cabbage. The most disappointing meal we had from here was the orange beef. It had such a strong citrus flavor that it overpowered the dish. I can&#39;t say i&#39;d recommend it to anyone, but I also couldn&#39;t give it less than 2 stars because some stuff was good. 

Best dishes: General Tso&#39;s and Mongolian beef

Liked that they offer many selections in half portion size. The sweet and sour chicken was lacking vegetables in the sauce and only had 5 pieces of pineapple. The sauce was bland and the chicken was not crispy. The egg roll filling was under seasoned. The cashew chicken had a good variety of vegetables and a tasty sauce I wish there was more cashews to balance the dish. The chicken fried rice lacked flavor and a variety of vegetables.

The fried rice was greasy but that&#39;s fine. It is expected of Chinese fried rice to be greasy. Kids really love it. Could you a little more soy sauce but that&#39;s ok. 

The Kung Pao chicken was really good. Very flavorful and the meat was nice and tender. 

The bbq pork was delicious. It reminded me of a Thai bbq pork with rice and red sauce dish. One complaint, leave out the lettuce. The smell of wet soggy lettuce is not that great.

Staff are great. I didn&#39;t have to repeat myself gazillion times like some other chinese restaurant. Quick delivery and friendly delivery person. They said half an hour to 40 minutes but they arrived at my house in 15 minutes. Granted I live 2 blocks from them but I was still impress.

I have been coming here since it opened, and have never had a bad experience. Today I came here with my family for my Moms birthday.

First off, our waiter was amazing. He was so welcoming and attentive. He picked up that it was my Mom&#39;s birthday from our conversation, and brought her a surprise dessert on the house.

Secondly, I ordered the chefs special: seared duck breast with roasted Brussels sprouts, caramelized onions and candied walnuts tossed in an unagi sauce. When all of my family&#39;s food came out and mine didn&#39;t, our waiter came right over to tell me there was a bit of a delay, and my food would be out shortly. After some time, the manager came over and notified me that they were remaking my food because it was not up to their high standard, and told me he would pay for my drinks! 

I was so thankful that the staff was taking extra steps to make sure that my meal was as good as it could be. This restaurant always tries to make their dining experience to be spectacular for every customer, and I was reaffirmed of this today."

They were obviously understaffed by a lot. Many tables sat uncleared and others empty but set while we waited nearly 30 minutes for our 7:15 pm reservation to be filled. 

The front door set up allows freezing cold air to enter the waiting and bar area - this was on Nov 19 - imagine how horribly cold that will be in Jan/Feb! They need to fix that soon...

If you make a reservation ask for the room to the north of the hostess station. That is a much warmer room without the breeze and feels like a dining room. The area in front and to the right of the bar has larger tables that are spread out and it just doesn&#39;t feel like a dining area. 

We ordered the chicken wings with Buddha dust (amazing as always, crispy, perfectly balanced sweet and spicy sauce), the popcorn shrimp (not too crunchy, not too soft with candied walnuts and a frisee salad), a true crab California roll which was very fresh, our three entrées were the margarita pizza, the bulgogi flank steak with kimchi fried rice, and the pork milanese cutlet. All were delicious, a tie between the crispy breaded pork and the flank steak. For me the pizza crust was a little too soft although it was tasty. A side order of pork belly fried rice came after we were finished with the rest of the meal and it needed salt.

A red velvet lava cake was good but not quite fluid enough and the apple bread pudding was tasty but should have had a crunchier crumble topping on it.

All in all I would say better to go here during the week when they are not quite as busy since the kitchen obviously puts out very good food but the service is lacking on busy weekends.

On a beautiful Saturday, the outdoor seating area was a really nice addition- but so many bees! Obviously that can&#39;t be helped, but it definitely made our experience more tense and less relaxed, so maybe opt for sitting inside. 

The brunch menu was available during this time, but the sushi menu was also so naturally that&#39;s what I ordered. The earth no ocean roll was very fresh and light- just what I needed this particular morning. We had a little appetizer also- some type of corn fried shrimp dish. This was pretty salty but other than that pretty good. 

The service was slow but very accommodating. I would like to try more sushi rolls at this place soon! E+o provides a great atmosphere for modern dining in this suburban area."

The decor is very nice, clean and modern and the party room was not too noisy so I was able to hear the speaker of the dinner speak clearly. 

The dinner started out with a popcorn shrimp appetizer that was perfectly done and not to overpowering in the breading department. 
Next we had the fried cauliflower with smoked pea hummous that had great flavoring and not too oily.
The Caesar salad and the crispy brussels and kale salad were the best appetizers. 

I chose a ribeye for the main entree topped with a fried egg that was perfectly cooked sunny side up and the steak was done medium rare even though it was a thin slice of beef so this was enjoyed! 

the desserts were a tad on the small side for us to share and we had to request more desserts at the end but between the carrot cake and chocolate tres leches, I definitely enjoyed the carrot cake the best and I prefer chocolate usually. 

I will definitely come back and try this place at dinner time with my hubby."

There were plenty of seating inside and outside. I really like the high ceilings because it makes the place seem very open and spacious.  I started out with a delicious cocktail. My friends were very excited about the $1 glass of champagne off the happy hour menu. We then moved on to consume a mass amount of food all of which was delicious and made with very fresh ingredients.  Some of the key dishes that I thought were exceptional was the beet salad and the poutine fries. The beets were really fresh and well balanced with the arugula, almonds, and balsamic dressing. And who doesn&#39;t love fries smothered in cheese and gravy? I would eat this everyday if I wasn&#39;t concerned about my arteries.

This is definitely a great place for happy hour with your friends or dinner with a date. Oh skip the dessert. It was not that great or memorable. Just have another cocktail instead!"

I came here for lunch with my friend on a Saturday late afternoon, and it was pretty much dead. To me, that&#39;s perfect timing.

I love the decor. Beautiful ocean blues and modern lighting that is really unique. However...the booths...which look appealing from afar, are stained. Real bad. They need to clean those babies. We sat there because they looked comfortable, but later we realized that the stains were not actually part of the fabric pattern...it was just dirty. Turn off.

So out waitress was the hostess...and the bartender...problem. She was obviously not happy about it and voiced it. I get it. I&#39;ve worked these jobs, it&#39;s frustrating. At the same time, if I acted like that at a job now, I would get fired. Her attitude was not great, from a customer prospective. I understand the frustration, but you are letting it out on the wrong person. Needless to say, had the service been better my review would also be better. But her attitude and treatment towards us ruined it.

The food was great. We shared the beet salad and the mac and cheese. The food is downright fabulous. I don&#39;t know who is in that kitchen but i&#39;ll marry them. That&#39;s how serious this food is. I ordered a ginger cocktail and I was not a fan, but I believe that&#39;s my fault because I&#39;m not the biggest ginger lover. I was feeling adventurous, so that&#39;s my bad.

Their dinner menu is VERY different from their lunch menu. To be honest their dinner menu is more appealing to me. I would come back to try that, just because the food is so good. But the service needs to be stepped up a notch, as well as the cleanliness of those booths."

I went here last night and of course I had to order my favorite thing on the menu, the Brussels sprouts and kale salad. It was as amazing as I remembered it and the portion was even bigger!! Tried the popcorn shrimp for the first time. It was another generous portion and the sweet and spicy sauce was delicious.

Service:
We were greeted wonderfully by the host, and our server Caitlyn was attentive, knowledgable about the menu and a pleasure to be served by.

Menu: 
Fussy! There&#39;s a lot to work through before you find the right dish. An overly eclectic menu -- it&#39;s all over the place! American, Asian contemporary, sushi, European ... What goes with what? .. Gravy fries &amp; sushi? Brussels &amp; pizza? Huh? I&#39;m hungry !

Taste:
Overall 3.5 .. For the price! $15-22 a dish

// Crispy brussels sprouts and kale - 14 - THIS IS A MUST. so delicious, they mix it for you at the table and has this delicious dressing on it.

I ordered some phenomenal popcorn shrimp with a great sweat and sour glaze.  My date got a Brussels sprout and kale salad.  Both dishes were huge portions, and both were excellent.  
     For dinner I ordered a rib eye with egg, spinach, and baked potatoes.  She got the salmon with mash potatoes and broccoli.  For desert, we ordered the red velvet cake with vanilla ice cream.

I brought a friend last night to visit since I kept bragging about the cuisine. The food was luke warm. But that wasn&#39;t the worst part. We asked for a split bill. The total was $126. The receipts we received were for $63 each. This morning I got an alert from my bank that I was charged $113 on my card. My friend was charged another $63 . I have heard of waiters using your card and doing fraud, before but I never thought it would happen in Mount Prospect. When I called the manager to have the amount reversed . He was very unhelpful, and told me he couldn&#39;t do anything at the time, because the receipt he had on file showed I was only charged $63. So I offered to show him proof, and he didn&#39;t care. I guess he thought I was lying. So if the server made a mistake he should have told me he charged my card in error and gave me a receipt for a reversal . Instead the manager refused to cancel the transaction and could not explain to me how the $113 was charged since my total bill was $126. I guess I paid for someone else&#39;s dinner. The lack of customer service and incompetence is terrible. So now I&#39;m be charged an over draft fee. I have to report my card stolen. Do not go there so your credit card information can be stolen. Then waste your entire day on the phone with your bank and when the establishment does not take responsibility for their employees mistake. 


Well instead of justifying what your establishment did and overdraft an account. You should teach you waiters to inform their customers of such mistakes. Yes there is such thing as human error but clearly you guys don&#39;t believe in taking responsibility or the customer is always right. I would have been less livid if I was informed at the table instead of getting an alert from my bank the next day.  Hope you all get some training on customer service because this place surely lacks that from upper management to the waiters."

From walking in I was pretty amazed at the space. This is located in a suburban mall and being accustomed to Chicago dining I was pleasantly surprised. 

The menu also surprised me as I saw a lot of Filipino inspired dishes. Just coming back from a month long trip to the Philippines I was a bit fatigued of the flavors so I ordered other menu items. (Next time I am in the area I will definitely try the asian dishes).

The ribeye was cooked a perfect medium rare and served w/ an egg and potatoes. A very good executed take on a comfort dish of mine. 

What stole the show for me was the bone marrow tacos. My first bone marrow experience and I must saw I was impressed. I like to think I am a taco freak but I have never seen it served like this. Very primitive. Just a fat bone stuffed with meet and tortillas on the side. Assemble your own. Absolutely loved the presentation, taste, and picking up the bone to make sure I cleared it. Excellent.

Wine program was good as well. Ordered 2 bottles as the atmosphere calls to have a little wine on your lips. 

This restaurant really took me aback. I have a somewhat snob complex when I think about $$-$$$ dining in the suburbs but I was overly impressed with my dinner here. Will I make the trip all the way out to dine here? Probably not to be honest but if I am in the area bet I will be here for the tacos."

A little expensive but I think it&#39;s worth it. Menu&#39;s great, unusual items but creative combinations. Not consistent but not something to cry about. Husband wasn&#39;t all that impressed but I&#39;m the opposite. I loved everything we ordered although there are a couple of dishes that I think were absolutely terrific. 

- crispy kale and brussel sprout salad - Like most of the people here, I absolutely recommend this dish. Husband doesn&#39;t like veggies but he single-handedly finished this. It&#39;s an explosion of flavors and textures, it&#39;s unbelievable how they created this. I haven&#39;t enjoyed eating salad until I tried this one.

- kalbi and pork fried rice - OMG I can eat this pairing everyday! They complemented each other so well! 

- carrot cake - I loved all the desserts here but this was my favorite. It&#39;s not as sweet as you would think and I like that.

With app+main+dessert, it set us back by $100 or $50 per person. It&#39;s slightly expensive than I initially thought but like I said, worth it. I look forward to returning again soon!"

The room is gorgeous. Has a city feel to it. Great colors, tvs present in the bar but not the least bit intrusive or out of place. The food, while slow to get to our table in an empty room, was good and creative. Eggs cooked perfectly. Waffle chewy and sweet. The chilaquiles were the disappointment. Very little of the advertised pork belly. The menu does not offer typically traditional dishes although all the ingredients are present.

My lower than expected rating is predominately based on price. For what you get, very costly. My southern hospitality item, one egg over a biscuit on top of a small pork tenderloin was $14. No toast. I ordered a side of tomatoes, $3. Don&#39;t think beefsteak. See photo. Very costly. We will try dinner as that seems like the play. There is a traditional breakfast joint in the same strip center. Go there for your giant omelette, this is not the place. Breakfast for four, each with a drink was over $100."

This is where you need to sit to enjoy their 50% off weekday specials on specialty drinks (10-$12) and appetizers from 4:00-7:30pm.  Overall, I&#39;d go with a 4.5 stars rating.  Every one of the numerous servings we had were of excellent quality and taste.  We found the appetizers to be quite generously sized, and much more so than the main entrees ($22-$25) and desserts ($8) which were pricy for the smallish portion sizes.  The main entrees&#39; value and maybe the required hightop seating were my only knock-backs from a 5 star dinner rating.  Depending on tastes, one could easily make a dinner of the appetizers.   The specials more than made up for the entree sizes.  The hightop seats have no backs, so in wintertime you will need to check your coats in.  A high top can accommodate a group of eight.  The main dining area was packed.  They had live music (popular mello, like U2) on Friday night and the sound level was thankfully tolerable for dinnertime.  The courses we tried were as follows and are shown in the photos.

Appetizers:
-  Beet salad
-  Wedge salad
-  Pizza romana
-  Mussels
-  Crab toast
-  Disco fries

Entrees:
-  Pappardelle with beef hash
-  Ribeye steak
-  Pork belly
-  Black squid ink pasta with prawns

-  Carrot-pineapple cake
-  Red velvet chocolate cake

First of all, the place was so dirty. Floor was sticky, dishes were nasty we had to ask to have them replaced.  Coffee pot that she came to the table looked like it has never been washed. We sat at the window and on the frame of Windows, there were old food particles everywhere.  Yuck!  Maybe you can&#39;t see all these nasties if it&#39;s at dinner time, but I was there for lunch. 
The lady who served us was very rough, almost like working in a diner. 
Sushi(hamachi maki) smelled old and fishy.

I went in on a Friday night with my husband and we arrived a bit earlier than our reservation, so we just sat at the tables in the bar area. It was still really nice and they had live music playing. 

E+O has some awesome small plates (tapas) and main courses. There is a heavy Filipino influence in their dishes. My husband and I ordered 4 small plates; crab cake, crispy brussel sprout and kale salad, chicken sisig, and disco fries. We also placed an order to share an entree of pork adobo, but we were so full w/ the small plates that we had to cancel the order!!! The 4 &#34;small&#34; plates were very filling and tasty! I think my favorite was the crispy brussel sprout and kale salad! It was perfection!!! The other items were good as well, but the sald sticks out in my mind. Oh, and it was warm!!! YUM!!!! 

I was sooo full, but I had to sneak a peek at the dessert menu. And that was a mistake! I ended up ordering the red velvet molten cake. It was good! :) 

Oh, and I had a lychee cocktail to wash it all done...very tasty and I recommend it!

They have lunch entrees!
Chicken sisig with a poached egg on top with rice is pretty bomb and felt healthier than your average sisig - but still very flavorful.

Duck and Daikon is out of this world.
And that kale and shrimp salad is super good.

Nothing from the entree section really grabbed my attention.

Red velvet lava cake is awesome!

After I posted my review, I received a very nice note from the manager who invited me to come back and give them another chance.

That chance came this past weekend for a late lunch. We arrived at about 2 PM and the place was not crowded at all so we were immediately seated. While I like having cocktails with dinner and no so much for lunch, I decided to go for a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was not on their drink menu but to my surprise, they had a Bloody Mary Bar set up replete with lots of stuff. And, while it was a very good tasting Bloody Mary, it was lacking in alcohol content. I was a little disappointed by this, but not overly so.

My wife ordered iced tea - she is very picky about her tea and does not like any flavored ones that are popular out there. When ordering, she asked specifically about this and was told it was plain iced tea - not so. I think the server should have known. She did make it right by allowing us to send it back and simply get seltzer with lemon.

We did not realized that Sunday was Dim Sum day and you could not order off the main menu for lunch. We decided to go &#34;all out&#34; and ordered two of the Dim Sum plates - Chicken and Chive potstickers and Buddha Chicken wings. The potstickers were okay - nothing out of the ordinary. The Chicken Wings I thought were outstanding (albeit a little sticky), They have some type of shrimp (brine shrimp) in the coating and my wife is not a seafood eater. We did not realize how they were made when we got them so she took one bite and I got to eat them all.

For the meal, we both ordered burgers with fries (you have a choice of fries or salad). The burger is a double patty served with or without cheese, with thousand island dressing and jalapenos. The jalapenos offer a nice touch, and the sweetness of the thousand island was a nice change from ketchup. But, the meat was kind of bland.

I also ordered a sushi roll called &#34;same name but different&#34;. I would classify that as outstanding. One of the best maki rolls I&#39;ve ever had.

The service was good, but not great. With only four tables that had people sitting at them and there were two servers you would think the servers would be all over you. No so.

So, long-winded (sorry) but since this was a follow up, I wanted to be complete in my story. I was a little disappointed in the service and very disappointed with the burger. The Dim Sum were good. The sushi was fantastic. I think E+O is one of those places where you need to know what to order, and what not to order. 

Overall, my experience was better than last time. If you only look at the ambiance and decor, it really is nice. Last time I went, when we sat outside, it was beautiful. The interior is also nice. Reading other reviews there are lots of comments about the appearance. For me, more important than appearance is the food. For that reason I am increasing my previous 2 star review to 3 considering everything mentioned above."

My favorite dish to share with a few people is the crispy brussel sprouts with kale and shrimp salad. It has a tangy flavor but the shrimp makes it delicious.

We came in on a Sunday afternoon. Host rushed out from a corner of the dining area and seemed discombobulated. Sat outside. Waited ten minutes to get a server or water (it was 92 degrees outside). When we got a server she was confused and even more so when we tried to order. We order drinks, one order dumplings, one order sushi rolls. Ten minutes later, a different server comes over, asks if we ordered, and if we &#34;remembered the drinks we ordered.&#34; Excuse me???

Half an hour passes. We get the food but STILL not the drinks. Hail a waitress and complain. Five minutes later we get the drinks. And then the napkins...ten minutes later...after we asked.

Bonus: food wasn&#39;t even that good.

I could have gone to a dive and received a better burger with a better burger bun, I recommend just take both items of the menu before e+o embarrasses itself even more.

I came for lunch along with co workers. The waitress was nice and polite. Let me preface by stating there was probably a total of 2 tables occupied besides ours. 

We were asked if we had been before and when half of us said yes, she had given us a breakdown of the menu and her recommendations. 

Service in general was very slow considering the amount of people in the restaurant. I had to ask for my lemon slices two additional times before I received them. We had order roughly 20 minutes after sitting down (not because we couldn&#39;t decide) and our food took about another 40 minutes to get. This is rather unreasonable considering the fact that pretty much nobody else was in the restaurant. 

The chef special sliders were pretty good. Only opportunity there was the horseradish was missing from the sandwich so I had to ask for it to be brought on the side which now means I had to put it in the sandwich myself. The tuna tango was fairly small but tasty. (not sure how you share the tuna tango) The Thriller roll was great.

Finally made it over here, and a month later, what still stands out to me is that brussels sprout and kale salad!  Oh my, that was delicious, and me thinks it may or may not also have to do with the fried onion strings in that baby.

Other dishes our party tried were:
- duck confit hash
- pork belly (served over an overwhelming bed of raw, white onions... interesting)
- sausage pizza
- bone marrow taco (had higher expectations for this, as the bone marrow was not fatty melty, but rather fatty gelatinous, which was a detractor)
- chocolate tres leches (so so)
- carrot cake bundt cake with cream cheese frosting

Our table had a 7 minute debate about whether to order it bc everyone was pretty stuffed at the point this claim was made.  As a champion of all things dessert, I ordered the chocolate tres leches as I am not a huge carrot cake fan, and that completed the table&#39;s dessert order.  Adam really wanted us to try the carrot cake bc he sent over a free one!  That was really nice.  It was good, but sorry dude, &#34;we still have to go to work tomorrow&#34;.  Read: not life changing.  P.S. Adam&#39;s a fantastic waiter: attentive, was prepared with recommendations, and had good energy.

I will definitely be back for that brussels sprout and kale salad!"

We&#39;ve been frequenting this restaurant for the last year and it never disappoints. I love that we can have a pizza, sushi, a grilled cheese sandwich, burger, and a steak and all are perfectly prepared. The tempura shrimp and brussel sprout salad are my favorites."

Often times when I&#39;m feeling down, the first thing that goes are my taste buds.  What I will do to compensate with my sudden sterile taste receptors is add more of everything.

3 packs of sugar in my coffee instead of 2.  2 scoops of hot sauce in my fried rice instead of 1.  3 shots of jack in my Coke instead of 1.  E+O may not advertise that they are a rehab center for the depressed but they should.  Because if you are having trouble feeling you will certainly be reminded that you can feel again by the way they spice and flavor their food.  

We ordered some type of disco fries and received a bowl of petroleum cheese with a few manipulated potato chunks.  I ordered a clam chowder soup that lacerated my top layer of tongue it was so salty.  Everything we ordered had such a strong taste, we needed a full pitcher of water to wash it down.  Even their Mac and cheese was salty.  This the place to go if you&#39;re depressed and want to be reminded that you are indeed not as dead as you thought.

The service on the other hand was great which is the only reason this place didn&#39;t get a 1."

It was one of the worst and comical dining experiences I&#39;ve had in a very long time based on the quality of the food, selection of the food, and the service (or lack thereof). I must qualify that I&#39;ve been to E+0 multiple times for lunch and dinner previously and had a better experience, but this was based on an a la carte menu and not their ill fated brunch buffet. 

Snapshots
- Food was unimaginative and selection was painstakingly generic i.e. I could get the same items and any local diner. Maybe my expectations were misplaced but E+O advertises themselves as infusing a contemporary and asian twist to their dishes. Not true by any stretch of the imagination for this brunch. Plain eggs, sausage, bacon, waffles, etc. 
- Food taste was bland, under-seasoned, and just plain bad. Enough said. 
- They are not setup for a buffet model. The line was always 20 people deep, moved at a glacial pace, and food trays were usually empty. 
- In terms of service, I&#39;ve never had a server avoid eye contact. I tracked our server as he aimlessly walked a lap around the entire restaurant. Didn&#39;t seem like he was checking on his tables or delivering food ... he just, took a lap for the fun of it. 
- They automatically charged a 20% gratuity regardless of party size for the brunch. Seems inappropriate for a buffet? Or perhaps I was just hypersensitive because of the preceding dining experience. 

It seems that this was purely a money grab for E+O and the event lacked any planning or imagination. I obviously won&#39;t be going back for their brunch or any buffet themed event. Seems like it wouldn&#39;t be worth the reputation hit but maybe not?"
e-o-food-and-drink-mount-prospect,Melissa A.,D9i3LUq4UHh9rg62kym8yA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,189,6,7NRj_JMYSZtTjGr0Nv3x9Q,4.0,2014-10-09,"Who&#39;d have thought you&#39;d find an upscale restaurant in a strip mall in the suburbs??  E+O is a great dining addition to the area and perfect for a date or a dinner with family/ friends.  This was my second time dining at E+O (Earth and Ocean) and I had a much better experience this time around.  The first time I bought a LivingSocial or Groupon deal for a prixe fix menu for two which included appetizers, entrée, and dessert.  I don&#39;t remember all of the dishes we had the first time we ate here but they had a separate menu for the deal, which was not as impressive as their normal menu.  Service was fairly quick but nothing really stood out to me that time besides liking their outdoor patio.    

As for my second time, I came back a few days ago with a group of friends and had a great time.  Service was spot on and the food was pretty impressive.  I forget our server&#39;s name but he was hilarious and very attentive.  I had heard rave reviews about their crispy Brussel sprouts and kale salad (our waiter also highly recommended it), so we ordered 2 of those since no one in our group likes sharing (me included)!  We also ordered the bone marrow and carne asada tacos and roasted duck for the table.  For dinner I split the Filipino Adobo Style Pork Belly with a side of rice with my sister since we were already full from the appetizers.  Sometimes greed has a price (not really because then you have leftovers for the next day ^_^ and who doesn&#39;t like leftovers?). 

Appetizers:

Crispy Brussel sprouts and kale salad - YUM, this salad is perfect in texture and taste.  The Brussel sprouts and kale are shredded and cooked to crispy perfection with a nice sweetness making it addicting.

Bone Marrow and Carne Asada Tacos -This dish was pretty disappointing and I&#39;d say pass on it.  I absolutely love bone marrow (I&#39;m Chinese and you grow up eating that) but this bone marrow wasn&#39;t that fatty and pretty tasteless.  The carne asada didn&#39;t add anything to the dish but rather took away from the bone marrow since you couldn&#39;t experience the buttery, gelatinous goodness.  

Roasted Duck - This dish was pretty good but not as spectacular as the kale salad.  The duck came with crispy onions and fried daikon hash which was really tasty.  The duck was shredded but it didn&#39;t feel like the star of the dish; it was a bit lost among the onions and daikon but overall yummy.  

Entrée:

Filipino Adobo Style Pork Belly - Mmmm pork belly.  Need I say more? I love the fattiness of pork belly even though I know I&#39;ll probably have a heart attack (kidding but kinda not).  There&#39;s something so delicious about tender pork with a layer of melt in your mouth fat on top.  Some people may think that sounds disgusting but don&#39;t knock it until you try it!  This is a slightly sweet dish and comes with grilled onions which I could have done without.  They didn&#39;t really add to the flavor or dish in any way.  

Dessert:

Carrot Pineapple Cake with Cream Cheese frosting - Our waiter told us this dessert was amazing and that it would change our life.  We opted to skip dessert but he really wanted us to try it so he gave us one for the table anyways.  This little cake was yummy but not life changing (sorry sir, didn&#39;t mean to burst your bubble).  It was served on a sizzling hot mini skillet and topped with a light cream cheese frosting and some cut up fruit.  I loved the texture since the cake had a nice crispy crust and moist center and the cream cheese frosting added the perfect amount of sweetness. 

Drinks:

Strawberry Sling cocktail - This tasted like strawberry juice and was a great summery (I know summer is over) drink. I highly recommend this if you&#39;re in the mood for a fruity cocktail.  

Check out E+O for some tasty drinks, relaxed atmosphere, and most importantly good quality food!"

The last time I went here was for lunch. There were 3 of us and we ordered 3 things: the brussel sprouts, the pizza of the day, and the totally tuna sushi roll. The brussel sprouts are the definite thing you HAVE to get when you go here, the dish is sooo flavorful and even if you hated brussel sprouts as a kid you will realize how much you love them with this dish. The sushi rolls are always really good, although never spectacular in my opinion, but they get the job done. The pizza (really they&#39;re like flatbreads) we had wasn&#39;t great, it was a white pizza with prosciutto on top. The toppings were really flavorless, but the bread was really what made it good. I&#39;m guessing their other pizzas they offer are tastier, and it&#39;s good to know their base is good!"

I&#39;ve been here twice and I can&#39;t even remember what I got the first time. Clearly didn&#39;t leave an impression.. But I remember everything being either bad or just okay. 

During my most recent visit, I ordered a sushi roll and it was really bland. Bland..?! How is sushi bland. Maybe the rice was unseasoned. Maybe everything was unseasoned. Ironically, sashimi in other restaurants are more flavorful than that roll : /"

My husband and I just moved to the area from downtown and we are huge restaurant connoisseurs. After reading the reviews and looking over their menu, we decided this would be a great place to take my brother and his wife to dinner, as they were in town celebrating his 40th birthday. Now, I&#39;ll start by saying, aesthetically, we though the restaurant was well done. Great location, setup inside was beautiful, one side is a nice bar- other side is the restaurant. We were sat on the restaurant side obviously, for dinner, in a large booth for the 4 of us. Table was big enough for us to fit comfortably and enough table space to fit all the food we would be ordering. They have a great cocktail menu and their food menu is diverse with a large selection of apps and share plates. We were very much looking forward to trying most of their menu. 
Now, as the waitress approached to take our drink order and go over the menu, we were distracted by the booth at the other end of our row- approximately 50 ft away from our table. The 4 ladies were intoxicated and so obnoxiously loud, we could not hear our server who was standing right in front of us. As we had to ask her to keep repeating herself, I made a comment about how loud they were and to my surprise her response was a roll of the eyes and &#34;I know, they&#39;re so loud.&#34; Letting that first incident go, we proceeded to order and start with about 5 items from their app menu. As the food was placed on our table we engaged in conversation with each other only to continuously have to pause and wait for the obnoxious table to stop yelling and laughing so loud, so we could hear each other speak without screaming across the table. As our starting plates were cleared, we ordered another round of drinks, as well as large plates to share and again having to repeat ourselves as our waitress could not hear us 1 ft in front of her, because the other table was so loud. At this point I told the waitress how disturbing their voice and laughter was to our table and that we could not have our own conversations due to their volume. Her response this time was &#34;I know, they&#39;re on their way out, we just dropped their check.&#34; Now, as we received our large plates their voices seemed to not only get louder, but it was literally to the point where my table could not talk to each other because we couldn&#39;t hear ourselves let alone each other. We asked for our food to be wrapped to go and ordered a dessert just to be able to sing happy birthday and leave. Again, not able to hear that idea was pointless. By this point, I was furious and demanded that my waitress ask them to quiet down and have respect for the other guests at the restaurant. As we sat there waiting for the check, we heard the manager walk over to their table and greet them. Never once acknowledging how loud they were or that other guests had complained. As we signed our $500 check, we didn&#39;t even touch our last round of drinks, left the dessert on the table, and left the restaurant baffled by the lack of concern for OUR dining experience by this restaurant. Not only were my husband and I mortified that WE chose this restaurant but we felt horrible that this was the experience my brother had on his 40th bday! HUGE disappointment. The food was great and we would have definitely been regulars here, but after that experience, we will NEVER come back."

It&#39;s a super chic spot for a night out with friends or to celebrate something special.

We arrived earlier than expected, and my friend Sarah S. called to see if we could bump up our reservation.  They did so without any problems.  We soon learned another friend would join us, and our waiter moved us to a large booth without any hesitation.  Service was stellar throughout our meal.

I started my night with a Strawberry Smash, a cocktail with strawberry puree and St. Germain.  The rest of the cocktail menu was tempting, but I had to exercise some sort of self-control.

The food is amazing.  We started with the Proscuitto Wrapped Burrata, which was a &#34;snack sized&#34; appetizer but still delicious.  We then shared the Smoked Pea Hummus.  Honestly I didn&#39;t love this dish, but smoke flavor usually doesn&#39;t win in my book.  It was still an interesting dish with complex flavors, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to give it a try.  

I was most surprised by the Crispy Brussel Sprout salad.  It was my first time eating brussels sprouts, and all I could think about was that episode of &#34;The Cosby Show,&#34; in which Rudy basically wasted 30 minutes of primetime refusing to eat them.  Really, Rudy?  It wasn&#39;t that bad, in fact, I really liked it.  It was crunchy and had lots of other ingredients mixed in.

I was doubtful of the Sweet Corn Linguine, because I wasn&#39;t sure about the whole idea of corn in pasta.  The sauce was so creamy and buttery though, with just the right amount of pecorino.  Yes, there was corn in the dish, but it totally works, kind of like kettle corn.

We shared some of the sushi rolls, including a featured roll topped with tuna poke, and another with white tuna and spicy tuna rolled into one.  Both were tight rolls with fresh ingredients and overall fantastic.

Somehow, we still had room for dessert, and we shared the carrot cake and an apple bread dessert.  The carrot cake was really crumbly and just OK, but the apple dessert was to die for!

Prices are reasonable; I would recommend ordering a few dishes and sharing with one or two people, especially if you want to really get a good feel for the whole menu.

E+O is a surprising, but welcome, spot in Randhurst that you should definitely check out."

And a funny story...my family has an ongoing joke with my mom that the loves carrot cake even though she really hates it. I won&#39;t get into the specifics. But when I asked our server, Alan, what the dessert was, he said the best one was the carrot pineapple cake. As we all laughed, he brought it to our table insisting she give it a try.

I would highly recommend the dish that comes with the *crispy brussel sprouts* and kale, minced shrimp, sweet chill vinaigrette, peppers, and shallots. It was so good that we ordered two dishes of these!

Here is the rest of what we ordered:

Popcorn shrimp tempura with spicy honey aioli and glazed walnuts. One of the other table favorits.
Disco fries: hand cut french fries with gravy and cheese sauce. A little heavy for my taste, but still good. I do love my french fries!
Linguini with sweet corn cream, corn kernels, scallion, cracked pepper, pecorino. This one was interesting...maybe I&#39;m not used to a sweet pasta dish, but I would prefer a creamy or savory pasta dish over sweet corn...but that&#39;s just me. Still worth a try!
Thriller roll: soft shell crab, spicy tuna, mango, cucumber, unagi, wasabi aioli and nori. I&#39;m not sure if I would order this again, but it was a nice balance with all our other dishes.

I think we might have ordered one other dish, but I can&#39;t remember what it was...hmm...

She walked away and must have went to the nearest whole foods to get my VOSS sparkling water and then walked away.

The food here was okay, although the portions were pretty small for the price. The service, though, was S. L. O. W. Made a reservation for 7:30 and didn&#39;t get seated until after 8:00. The hostess said they usually allot 1.5-2 hours for people to eat, but some were staying for up to 3 hours. Fine, whatever, you can&#39;t help that.

After being seated, the waitress came by to fill our water glasses. Ten minutes later she asked if we wanted to order something to drink. After that much time we were ready to place our dinner order. An hour later, we still hadn&#39;t received our food and were beginning to see why people were staying for 3 hours.

My partner loved the bone marrow taco. Every tables seemed to order the crispy brussel sprout. I just don&#39;t get the concept of deep fried salad, all garnishes were deep fried in that dish. It felt greasy in each bite.. Trout entree was ok. It was so average that i think i can make it myself.

My date and I were friends with the server and he pretty much ordered for us. We tried a couple of sushi rolls and some sort of appetizer (can&#39;t remember). The food was good and the ambiance was great-- very contemporary, especially for the suburbs.

My second time here was recently and for their brunch. My date (same date, funny enough) and I walked in and were the only ones for a bit until a family came in later on. There was a make-your-own mimosa and bloody mary bar. I made my own mimosa and it was alright, my date made his own bloody mary and that was decent. I was pretty annoyed because I told my date I wanted brunch-- french toast, skillets, the usual brunch food. He claimed that they had great brunch here...he was only going off the fact that he had been there before and drank at the bar during their &#34;brunch&#34; and had great drinks. Their menu was just a lunch menu with nothing that was a breakfast/brunch plate. So I was forced to order pork fried rice...it wasn&#39;t even good for fried rice. There was nothing unique or special on their take on the fried rice-- the Chinese place by my house makes better fried rice than them. Then, my date said that their red velvet &#34;lava cake&#34; was really good. So we ordered that and it was no damn lava cake--there was nothing in the center that oozed and it was completely overcooked (it tasted burnt). The cake was overcooked, so obviously it was very dry and it lacked flavor. The only good thing was the graham cracker crumbles that the ice cream came served on and even the ice cream didn&#39;t taste premium. I was extremely annoyed at this point and didn&#39;t mention anything to our waiter about it because I didn&#39;t want to embarrass my date, the waiter was really nice, and I knew that once I started to complain about something there would be no stopping and I would probably mention something to my date about how he had made a terrible mistake in picking this place for &#34;brunch&#34; and that he has terrible taste in food and judgement. Needless to say, the car ride back was just silence. I haven&#39;t gone out to eat with that date since. 

*My three-star rating is because my first experience here during dinner was good, but don&#39;t ever come here for &#34;brunch&#34; or even lunch."

The Nigiri Tuna&#39;s were fresh and a really generous portion.  The Caesar salad is well worth the 7 dollars.  Everything was very reasonably priced for Chitown.  

My only recommendation would be to add some pepper to the Caesar salad, which is more or less an observation as opposed to a critique since I can do that myself. 

Service was on point, without being obtrusive.  I never found myself without silverware or a feeling that I had been left for dead (I do have abandonment issues ;).  

This is the kind of place where jeans AND dressier attire are welcome.  They have a medium sized incredibly well balanced menu to appeal to Tapas, American fusion, and Sushi/Nigiri/Sashimi tastes.  I would have given them five stars, but I reserve that for the dining experiences that boarder on gastric bliss (to be a bit PC)."

The breaded pork tenderloin was tasty and but the braised pork belly was just ok and would pass on It next time.  Had a great dessert with the carrot cake and pineapple dish.  Great looking restaurant and good vibe.  A bit pricey but if you got the cash highly recommend this restaurant.

I just have to take 1 star off because the service takes a while. You can see most of costumers in the table waiting and keeps looking at the server for their food. 

My advice is give yourself time to stay here for awhile and enjoy the company of your friends/family. I promise the food is worth the wait. The staffs were nice and friendly as well."

What brings it down for me is in the hosting. I will admit that one of my pet peeves is illogical table seating. The last evening My wife and I were there, we had a reservation and arrived on time. As they were about to seat us, I asked whether we could have the clearly open table by the window. The host, perhaps inexperienced due to age, replied that he did not know whether it was reserved. Okay, first how about expending some effort finding out (the restaurant was by no means full and several booths existed around the restaurant). He did not. Secondly, even with the preponderance of open booths, he sat as at a cramps two seater amidst of row of them (in my world, seats like these are the worst). Really? I am hearing impaired so this is the worst as background noise provides interference. Fortunately as it was after 8:00, the couples on either side of us left soon. However, no matter how the food is, and it is excellent, I will think twice about returning. There are too many quality restaurants in the area with excellent hosts that will fit the bill. A note to restaurants and hosts, make these type of modern accommodations for diners. The table in question was not reserved and was occupied by 2 walk ins about 15 minutes into our dinner. While in the scheme of things not a great sin, but enough to probably cost them future visits from my family and me. Not to mention word of mouth. Too bad, as seating someone should be the easiest thing a restaurant does."

Came in one lunch and it was nice. I appreciate the interior design and decor to this place. Its modern and fresh looking. My boyfriend and I ordered the spicy chicken wings and spicy crunch tuna roll for appetizers. Both lived up to my standards. They were delicious. I had the chefs special called perfect 10 and it was duck ramen noodle soup with an egg. It was good. Not too exciting or flavorful. Just average. And I was disappointed at the fact that there were only four pieces of duck in the soup... The highlight for me was the ginger soda it came with (I forgot the exact name of it). 
The tango mango tuna roll was okay but my boyfriend did seem to enjoy it a lot. The fish was fresh which is a plus. My boyfriend had some seafood dish which he said was really good and tasty. 

I will have to come back and try dinner because honestly the food was not that impressing. Denise our server was fantastic though. I just didn&#39;t see what all the hype was about this place. I have had a few friends come by and try it and I had seen it in Chicago&#39;s best but I don&#39;t know if its worth the trip for many.

Start with the bacon jam quesadillas, small enough to eat in one bite but the salty, slightly smoky flavor packs quite the punch.

The watermelon pork salad was rather bland but everything else we ordered was expertly prepared.

Earth salad ($7) - 2 stars. So boring. Pass.

Bone marrow carne asada tacos ($14) - 2 stars. Marrow melted way too quickly. Gone by the 2nd taco, even though we had started immediately at the advice of our waitress.

Squid ink tagliatelle with sea bass ($18) - 2 stars. Bland, forgettable.

Roasted duck and daikon hash ($12) - 3 stars. 60 degree egg. Crispy outside, fishcake/odeng texture inside. Sweet soy-based sauce.

Crabcake ($15) - 4 stars. Half-pounder. Pieces of lump crap meat. We all liked this.

Carrot cake ($8) - 4.5 stars. Highlight of our meal. Reminded me of a St. Louis buttercake. Memorably good. One of my top 3 carrot cakes.

The weather was beautiful and I noticed they had a really pretty out door eating area and there were 4 open tables. We went to the hostess stand to check in for our reservation and I asked if we could be seated outside. I think my words were, &#34;Pretty please, it&#39;s my birthday&#34;. The gentleman behind the counter told us they don&#39;t seat people with reservations outside, which I thought was pretty weird. Then he added, &#34;Besides, if you want to wait for outside it will be another 30 minutes.&#34;  We were already 15 minutes early for our 8:15 reservation so we said no. About 10 minutes later another couple without a reservation came in. Not only were they seated before us, but they offered them an outside table which they weren&#39;t even sure they wanted. At 8:15 we were seated next to a couple with two small kids.   I don&#39;t mind kids, but we were trying to have a romantic dinner and were sitting on a bench that was along the entire wall, so we were right next to them, even though there several tables open. The waitress must have noticed we were less than thrilled because she moved us to a nice intimate table without us asking, which was really nice. Then we ordered drinks. They have a mixed drink that&#39;s a play on an old fashioned. When my husband received his drink it was not even filled half way, and that was including the ice!  Our waitress was great, she made excellent suggestions. Try the Brussels sprouts!  Normally I can&#39;t stand them, but these were yummy. The deviled eggs were great too. I enjoyed the basil shrimp, nice big prawns, lots of flavor. Dessert was disappointing. The lava cake looked and tasted like a frozen cake they nuked in the microwave.

It must come from the utter desperation for finer dinning in the bleak area around Randhurst Mall. Walking in, it seems like a trendy hipster dowtown wannabe restaurant trapped in a half empty mall. Leaving, it is all of those, and not worth the visit. 

The drinks are downtown priced. $12-13. The food is downtown priced. The sushi rolls have sparing amounts of fish in them, and maybe that is because the sous chef, who is allergic to seafood was making them. The chicken wings are deep fried, fatty globs of uneatable chew. The kale salad was nice, that kept them from a 1 star review. The short rib was nice, but had no seasoning/salt. Same for the wings. I told the bartender/server this, and he laughed at me and  mocked me, like I had not the experience to critique. With drinks, food, tax and tip, the two of us spent $100. I felt ripped off. 

By the way, the wings at Buffalo Wild Wings in the mall would have been better. We should have gone to Blackfinn next door. 

I predict closed by 2015.

With all do respect to the managements response, and as I read from some other reviews , the chef needs a seasoning tuneup. I think my review of my experience was accurate and to the point. This restaurant is not in the top 100 of Chicagoland eateries. It could make the top 25 of Mt Prospect restaurants though."

I told him to pick any appetizer as I&#39;d eat anything. He selected the crispy brussel sprouts and kale dish, which was the item I&#39;d be least likely to have picked. But I&#39;m glad he selected it as the dish was excellent. Lightly grilled with chopped shrimp mixed in and a spicy yet sweet vinegarette type sauce. I could have eaten that all night.

I had the Filipino adobo style pork for dinner - it was good, but not so good to make it &#34;the reason&#34; to come back. For a night cap, I ordered my usual Grand Marnier. The bartender pulled out two snifters and poured 2/3 shot into one and the rest into another. He dropped the &#34;2/3&#34; one by me and headed back into the kitchen. At this point, I&#39;m wondering what is going on. He comes out of the kitchen with some near boiling water in a coffee cup and the remaining liqueur that I ordered. He says, &#34;Have you ever tried Grand Marnier heated?&#34; I told him no and he offered my a try. He rotated the snifter in the coffee cup with the hot water for about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes. He set the glass down and asked me to smell it first - but not to closely as the alcohol would kind of shoot into my nose. Well, it was outstanding - the fragrance and the deep flavor that the heat added was a whole new dimension. I love restaurant staff that offers new ideas and dimensions - not enough of these kind of people in that industry anymore.

Bottomline is that it was a great evening with the food and venue at E+O helping make a reunion of two HS friends from quite awhile back a nice night. Look forward to returning to E+O - thumbs up all the way!"

I ordered the tuna naruto- an appetizer but similar to ordering a sushi roll- which I really liked. Fresh tuna wrapped in cucumber, and especially when ordered with a seaweed salad it&#39;s a great combination. I also tried the Bok choy vegetable dish, a Chinese beef dish, and a Chinese fish dish.

There is a $4 delivery fee (minimum of $10). You can order through Yelp. I have ordered multiple sushi rolls. They have a nice variety of nigiri, and maki, both more simple maki, and signature maki. I have had the more simple maki at other places, and it&#39;s all about the same. I have ordered the Dragon Maki, Snow Maki, Firecracker Maki, and others, and they are all very good.

For a long time, ownership was staying the same but they kept reconcepting and/or changing the name. Well, Yume finally has brought new management &amp; ownership to this location! 

I really want to try their sushi offerings but I&#39;ve been really hesitant because I&#39;m scurred! They have such an expansive menu with sushi just being one of a million offerings...my general thought it it can&#39;t be that fabulous then!

I&#39;ve tried their Chinese dishes a couple of times. The lunch specials for Chinese food are under $7 and a good size. It&#39;s a great deal and always makes both lunch &amp; dinner for me which is fabulous. I&#39;ve had the sesame chicken and the sweet &amp; sour chicken.

They do 2 mono maki sushi rolls for $9.99 which is a good deal I wish to partake in in the future.

Overall, I&#39;m happy to see this location busy, they&#39;ve cleaned up a lot and are a decent location. I wish they&#39;d step up the food a bit so it wouldn&#39;t be quite so bland and packed a bit more flavor."

Yes, I know it is not as well known as Yu&#39;s. However,  the food and service here will make you want to return back again. The staff here is highly attentive and quick. I never had to ask for extra napkins, extra napkins, refills...well you get my point. My glass somehow magically stayed full the entire time!     Now that is some service! 

They&#39;ve a pretty big lunch special menu that has something for everyone. Kinda cool that the lunch specials are valid all week, not just weekdays. The fiance ordered the Yume Beef Tenderloin on my first visit here.  His entree was delicious and full of flavor.  I probably would&#39;ve eaten the rest of his entree if I wasn&#39;t so full already.  My $12 dollar sashimi lunch special blew me away. When the waiter brought out my plate of sashimi it looked like a dish you would see at a 5 star restaurant. The fish was fresh and firm. The quality of the sushi and the presentation was outstanding. 

Honestly, the value and service here is just phenomenal. The servings are a bit big, but the food is delicious. I would probably eat here every week if I lived in the burbs. Quit reading this review and go eat at Yume!"

Reasonably priced and large portions served so we can pass around family style.  Try the Japanese non-carbonated soft drink CALPICO they serve as I did - very pleasing different flavor not too sweet.  another yelp reviewer previously pointed out this&#39;s a &#39;doomed location&#39; and unfortunately there is some truth to that in that several oriental restaurant tenants have come and gone at that mall space before over the years.  Obviously they&#39;re determined and not reluctant to give it yet another shot.  Good luck to YUME as we want to return here in the long run

It arrived within the stated time. The chicken teriyaki was delicious and the highlight of our order. The tempura batter is quite heavy for tempura, which I didn&#39;t like. The crab rangoons were pretty good. 
The unfortunate part of the order was the sushi. I ordered nigiri because I&#39;ve had a huge craving for a week now, and I couldn&#39;t wait. The order must have been poorly handled or improperly packed; the sushi had tipped over and mixed into the wasabi before getting to me. There was so much of it all over my nigiri that it was inedible (and I don&#39;t shy away from wasabi). $5.50 isn&#39;t cheap for 2 pieces of salmon nigiri, so I was really disappointed. Please be more careful with your delivery orders! If we do decide to give Yume another chance, we will definitely eat in rather than order delivery."

That&#39;s how I felt when we walked into Yume. The owner, Ken, and our favorite bartender, Jeff, made us feel so welcomed from the moment we stepped inside. Ken was formerly at TL&#39;s in Bartlett, so we&#39;ve known him as a top notch server for quite a while. And we live in Bartlett, so the fact that we happily drove to Schaumburg and plan to do so again will tell you something about our visit. 

I couldn&#39;t help it. I compared everything to TL&#39;s mainly because the similarities were striking. 

The service...we had excellent service at Yume. My glass was never more than half empty. Plates were cleared quickly when it was obvious we were ready for them to do so. Food was served promptly and did not sit waiting to die again before we ate it. 

The menu...the options were plentiful and yes there were some very similar dishes. So I ordered them to compare. The szechuan dumplings were tastier here as was the Mongolian beef and the philly roll. Let&#39;s talk about that philly roll for a second. The ratios in this roll were spot on!  So much so that my husband mentioned it at least twice. It&#39;s nice to order a roll that isn&#39;t overwhelmingly cream cheesy. 

The space...I found it to be clean which is high on the list for me. We chuckled at the crystal chandeliers as they are overkill, but the bar and the sushi bar look great and it is obvious a lot of care went into doing things right.

The only thing that I didn&#39;t flip head over heels for would be the lobster mango roll. Honestly, I think it&#39;s me. I don&#39;t order lobster basically ever and when Ken suggested I try the roll and it looked so beautiful, I was all in. I liked the sauce and the mangoes, but the lobster wasn&#39;t my favorite. I think it was a little too salty for my palate. 

Take a trip over to Yume. It&#39;s easy to find with plenty of parking in the lot. We didn&#39;t have to wait which was a major plus for us and the service was just as it should be - excellent!  Can&#39;t wait to try more things on the menu!!"

Ok, maybe not the greatest analogy, but Yume has some tough obstacles to face. It&#39;s in an odd location, it took over the spot of another restaurant (so people may not know that it&#39;s new), and people just have a fondness for Yu&#39;s Mandarin up the street. But Yume is definitely worth the visit and you may find you have a new favorite Chinese (and Japanese) spot in Schaumburg.

We came here on a Sunday for lunch, and were pleasantly surprised to see they have lunch specials even on the weekend. I went with the Yume Beef Tenderloin. I got a soup, spring roll, rice, a ton of beef and veggies, all for under $10. The YBT is a must-try - crispy peppery beef full of spicy aroma. Just the right amount of sweetness and stickiness, it&#39;s not like anything I&#39;ve had anywhere else. The fiance went with their sashimi lunch special. I tried some of her tuna and found it firm and fresh, and she said she really enjoyed it. We also sampled the Firecracker roll, and it was a great bite for something that could have been too gimmicky.

The service was great and overall the value almost has me wishing I&#39;d move out to the burbs (almost). Heck, we even caught my grandma sneaking a bite of her broccoli - she usually hates veggies to the extent of picking onions out of her noodles, so it&#39;s quite the testament to this place. Excited to come back for dinner and try their surf and turf combo, which is basically the YBT but with shrimp."

The decor is definitely nicer than the previous tenants and the service is very friendly but the higher prices (although portion size is pretty good) and the uninspired cooking prevent it from scoring any higher for me.

Food overall is pretty bland, devoid of texture and seasoning for the most part (not often you can order a szechuan style dish and eat the whole thing without sweating even a drop). The food itself is not actually bad, presented nicely and with good colors --- nothing is really overcooked or unpleasant. But, I&#39;m confused since it&#39;s not very Americanized (fried, tons of sauce, very flavorful) but the flavors aren&#39;t very traditional either. It doesn&#39;t even sit in the fusion category of restaurants like Sun Shui or Pei Wei -- just food that doesn&#39;t excel at either and becomes very unmemorable.

Here were my thoughts on specific items:

Egg drop soup - Pretty watery, not a super strong egg flavor and consistency needs to be thicker.

Hot and sour soup - Lacks depth of flavor, was a bit spicy and had a good kick of pepper.

Spring roll - Filled with tons of cabbage, crispy skin but almost tasteless filling.

Vegetable fried rice - Had a decent amount of wok-hay for rice only stirred with vegetables, didn&#39;t have excessive amounts of soy sauce.

Crispy garlic shrimp - Not really super tasty for shrimp surrounded with tons of chilis, pepper, and onion, but enjoyable overall. Probably the best dish I tried.

Steamed halibut - Good sized filet, a bit soft on the meat texture and almost no flavor from the ginger and scallions. Depended too much on the soy sauce for flavor but a great deal for the low 7.75 lunch price.

Cumin lamb - Meat was tender, but could&#39;ve rendered out a bit more fat. Despite being surrounded by tons of peppers, scallions, and onions -- the dish wasn&#39;t that flavorful and the cumin and chili oil weren&#39;t that noticeable.

Overall, this restaurant was alright -- food wasn&#39;t very exciting but it wasn&#39;t bad either."

Went on Sunday night, was pretty slow, service was spot on. Couldn&#39;t have asked more from my server. Seaweed salad was great, very large portion, almost too much. Almost. 

Hot and sour soup that came with deluxe sashimi plate was very tasty. Not so much sour, as it was black peppery. But still tasted good enough devour the whole bowl! 

Only reasons for 4 stars.... The yellow tail sashimi on deluxe plate was off tasting, minerally, little fishy, I only ate one piece. But everything else, tuna, salmon, tako... On the sashimi deluxe plate was excellent. Loved the octopus! Yum. Came here Because of the pics of oysters and clams and uni, sadly they had none of them available :( another reason for 4 stars) There is one TV, so if you are wanting to watch a sports game, hope other customers want towatch same game. I wanted watch playoff hockey, but people were watching basketball. 

Didn&#39;t meet the owners, but sushi chefs are Chinese, If that matters to you. I heard no-one speaking Japanese, and I speak decent Japanese. Only heard Mandarin. 

I would deff come back-to-back the service rocked. But don&#39;t expect authentic Japanese anything....very Americanized

I wandered in for dinner on a Thursday evening recently, and ponied up to their small bar setup since I was dining solo.  I asked for them to change the channel to TNT to watch the playoffs pregame show, and they just handed me the remote and said, &#34;go for it.&#34;  Something about that small gesture convinced me I was in for a real treat!

I ordered the spicy salmon maki and the basil garlic chicken as my entrees.  Both were absolutely PERFECT!  I know there have been some reviews that talked about the price being too high, but for the quality AND quantity of the food, plus the attentive service, I consider this place to be a bargain compared to Yu&#39;s.  Huge portions, plus the staff checking in often enough take sure everything was good.

They have a great selection of spicy ones! My favorite is the spicy crab. 

The potstickers (spicy), are terrible and a waste of money.They had no spice at all and they were super chewy! Also have ordered the Mongolian lunch special with vegetable fried rice, it had no flavor at all and the rice seemed old or had been sitting out! 

Overall, Delivery/service in general is quick if you are on a time limit. Prices are comparable to other places. If your craving sushi then definitely try them out!"

Ordered crab Rangoon, vegetable spring rolls, spicy tuna maki roll, and red dragon maki roll. I was told it would take 20 minutes. I arrived a little bit after 20 minutes and I was told my order would take only a couple more minutes. I was fine with it, and waited. Within the 25 minutes I waited, I was never updated on my meal, was never offered anything to drink, never received a sincere apology, completely ignored. Heard one girl say to the other after 10 minutes, &#34;where is her order?&#34; And never told me what the kitchen said. Then once the younger girls were out of earshot, the woman making the drinks at the bar, started complaining to the people at the bar about how the younger girls don&#39;t know how to do anything and are not good at their jobs. Not professional at all to tell to customers, even if they ask. Once I finally got my food, I left and received a couple &#34;sorry&#34;s from one girl. The younger girls were nice.

Two, I&#39;m wavering between a 3 and a 4 here and I just can&#39;t  decide so they&#39;re getting a 4 because for some reason I&#39;m feeling generous today. Don&#39;t get too excited. It won&#39;t last. 

Anyway, we stopped in on a Saturday right as they opened (11:30ish) and we were one of 4 or 5 tables sat. That&#39;s got to be a good sign, yes? I must say, the hostess and waitstaff were really nice and accommodating of our tiny human which isn&#39;t typical at a sushi joint. And speaking of waitstaff? There was also at least 4 people helping tables, bartending, seating, etc. which is also not typical for a sushi place either...I swear there&#39;s always one lone server in the weeds the entire visit at most Japanese places. 

As for the food, it was pretty decent and it was suuuuuuuuuper cheap. We got a three roll lunch special each, an order of gyoza, and soup (which I&#39;m pretty sure came with the lunch special) for $38. Granted, it wasn&#39;t fancy rolls but rather had regular old maki, but still. I got three spicy rolls: tuna, salmon, and yellowtail.  The rolls are kind of small and the rice is hard(ish) BUT they were fresh, weren&#39;t complete mush and mayo (they at least had a little bit of chunks), and tasted spicy(ish). Since I&#39;m a complete sushi snob I wish that they were chunkier and spicier but they were certainly good. I would say that for the Schaumburg area they are on par with Minami and Sake, WAY better than Sushi Yama, and slightly less delicious than Daruma."

The duck was disappointing.  The meat was overcooked and kind of mushy.  The duck was seasoned well, and the bed of bean sprouts added nice texture and made the meal healthy.

My initial encounter with Yume was a delivery order.  It arrived VERY QUICKLY and everything was done to perfection!  :-)

Thereafter I&#39;ve been there for dinner and while the atmosphere/decor doesn&#39;t seem to have changed much from older days of other, failed restaurants occupying that space, the service and food are both FABULOUS!  

I did notice that the owner/manager seemed to focus on just ONE particular table as opposed to &#34;making the rounds&#34; to greet other guests even though the two times I&#39;ve been there the restaurant wasn&#39;t crowded at all.  It&#39;s not that big of a deal but I guess a big enough one that I noticed.

The food is EXCELLENT and the server seemed to wear many hats including tending bar.  

Oddly, the food provided in delivery seems to be superior to that ordered in the actual location.  All are excellent but for some unknown reason delivery food ranks higher, IMO, than the food on location.

In any event, 5 stars from me!"

Zume is just a couple blocks from my home and offers a great selection of food.  I was reluctant at first to go here because I remember the last 2 restaurants that were in this spot weren&#39;t that great (Chinese Garden &amp; Aloha - both had same owners).  This place has a new owner and is much nicer!  The interior has been redone and has a quaint relaxed feel.  I had tempura appetizer (2 shrimp &amp; 5 veggies), egg rolls, &amp; miso soup on my first visit;  all were very good!  The staff was very kind and fast to refill drinks and check if I needed anything else.  All in all, great first visit!  

On my 2nd visit here I had miso soup &amp; tempura appetizer again (they were great the first time, so I had to get them again!  They were again great!), and orange chicken.  The orange chicken was a huge serving and was very tasty!  I admit I haven&#39;t really had orange chicken at a good restaurant, more just from the &#39;fast food&#39; type Chinese places.  So compared to those, this orange chicken was simply amazing!

One nice thing about this restaurant is it basically has 2 menus: one for Japanese and one for Chinese.  The menu is split down the middle; half for Japanese &amp; half for Chinese. It&#39;s very easy to navigate the menu and the choices are extensive.

On my 3rd visit I decided to try some sushi.  I started with an appetizer of tempura calamari (First time having tempura calamari and I think I like it more than the standard fried calamari at non Asian restaurants), then had a toro tuna nigiri, &amp; salmon maki.  The sushi tasted great and super fresh!

Prices are reasonable as well.  I would recommend anyone who lives in the area to give it a try!

***Update.  I have now been here many more times.  The food and service are always great!  I have tried a variety of their sushi &amp; cooked dishes and have always been pleased with how fresh and tasty their food is!"

I thought the calamari and the scallion pancakes were too greasy. The pancakes didn&#39;t look anything like the picture on the menu. I enjoyed the New England clam chowder and the dry chili chicken dinner extra spicy. Very tasty. A little more diced scallions would of been nice. Other plates looked savory and plentiful. I heard the egg drop soup was good. Service was very accommodating and friendly. Prices were reasonable. Overall an ok experience. We didn&#39;t order from the Japanese side of the menu but I did see delicious looking plates whizzing by me. I&#39;ll have to try their sushi next time.

I&#39;m not yet convinced this place is better than Yu&#39;s as was reviewed previously. Perhaps this is so if one orders from the Japanese menu.

I had tried sushi before, and unfortunately it was not a great experience.  This time, on the advice of my date, I ordered the spider roll, her thought process being that I may find the cooked sushi more agreeable.  I&#39;m happy to say she was right!  If you are new to sushi or Japanese cuisine, perhaps that may be a helpful piece of advice.
     For an entree, I ordered the Mongolian beef with miso soup, and my date ordered the orange chicken with sweet and sour soup.  The miso soup was very good.  The broth was really salty, which me and my date both enjoy.  The sweet and sour soup was tasty, but a little too spicy for me (I&#39;m kind of a baby with spicy foods).  The Mongolian beef was excellent, very tender, and really tasty.  The orange chicken was quite good as well (probably my favorite Asian dish so far).  It was not spicy at all, but was very flavorful.
     At this point, my opinion on Asian eateries may not be worth much, but if I were you, I&#39;d give Yume a shot.  Especially if, like me, you&#39;re new to Japanese.

I couldn&#39;t wait for it to open and give it a try.  I have been to many sushi places in the burbs as well as the city.  This one is right up there with the best of them.
The menu is color coded purple for Chinese and blue for Japanese.
Very well organized and easy to follow.
Service was exceptional.  Refilled drinks, fresh plates between courses and checking back often to make sure everything was going well.

We started with a crab rangoon off of the Chinese menu. 7 or 8 to an order and bursting with filling served with a ramekin of sweet and sour and mustard on request.
My daughter and I split the 3 maki special for $15.95 at dinner.  We chose the smoked salmon/cream cheese, spicy hamachi and shrimp tempura.  There were many other to choose from.  The ones we had were very fresh and tasty.
My sister ordered Mongolian shrimp which came with a choice of three different soups.  The dish was rich and sweet with just a little spice and was described perfectly be our server.

I highly recommend this restaurant and want to keep it around!
If you&#39;re headed toward Conant high school for anything, make this a destination and grab a bite to eat!"

I got the Firecracker roll with spicy salmon and fresh salmon on top. It was so flavorful, with a hint of richness from the mayo and a fresh but not overpowering citrus flavor from the lemon rinds with which they artfully decorate the roll. Definitely plan to get Yume again. There isn&#39;t much sushi in this area that tastes better - only Daruma and the further out Renga Tei.
Let&#39;s all support Yume so they can stay in that seemingly cursed restaurant location! Pretty please :3 :3 :D"

We went there yesterday and ordered Crab Rangoon, Orange Chicken and vegetable fried rice for 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids).
The food was outstanding, the prices reasonable, quantity was very good and the quality was great. Service was quick and the place was clean and open, compared to how it was when it was called Chinese Garden. There was a good crowd and we got a nice window booth.
We will definitely visit again. I hope they maintain their quality. They are not well known, they need to invest in marketing, through coupons, or Groupon."

I didn&#39;t even know this place was here! All I can say is WOW! Both of us started with the Hot &amp; Sour Soup which was very hot in temperature (a must for soup but sadly lacking in a fair number of restaurants) and also had a pleasant spice that built as I ate more and more. My husband ordered the Crispy Garlic Shrimp from the Chinese side of the menu. It had so many huge shrimp with beautiful peppers and onions. It was flavorful (I sneaked a bite!) and just the right amount of heat. I ordered from the Japanese side of the menu. First off I had the Tuna Avocado Sumiso which had huge chunks of the freshest tuna I have ever had over avocado with a beautiful sauce that was just the right amount. I also order the baked mussels which were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with a nice crab flavor from the filling. I then had two of the signature make rolls. The Red Dragon had beautiful tuna on top and was good but I didn&#39;t get any spice from it. The sauce was very good on the side. The next roll was the Fire Cracker. I can say without a doubt that this was the best sushi I have ever had!! It came with thin lemon slices in between every few pieces. It had a sesame chili sauce drizzled on top and the combination with the lemon flavor, salmon and cilantro was a flavor explosion in my mouth. I LOVE this roll!! The only thing better would be more lemon slices to get more of that citrus zing! Otherwise perfection! 

After dinner we decided to try a drink at the bar since they had a nice drink menu. My husband had the Dark &amp; Stormy which had Myers Rum, Ginger Beer and Lime. He said it was spicy and good. I had the Passion Gaga which had Strawberry Nigori Sake, Grey Goose vodka, fresh strawberries and lime juice. So refreshing and delicious. I usually don&#39;t like sweet drinks (Hello extra dirty martini!) but this had no extra sugar and was wonderful. 

So excited to have found this fabulous new place. They haven&#39;t been there long but the food is so very fresh and inventive. I am looking forward to going back again soon! I can&#39;t wait to try the Chinese side of the menu! 

Okay, confession time, went again yesterday for take-out sushi, had another drink while waiting (Pomegranate Martini-wow again!) and the food was just as good and fresh. This place is a must for Chinese and Japanese food in Schaumburg!!"

Sushi is my favorite food, so eating it as much as I do, I definitely can tell you which is good and which is not so good. Needless to say, I really enjoyed the sushi here! There&#39;s a lot of great lunch specials, and all day sushi specials if you want to buy a few rolls for less. Their specialty rolls are delicious, and their homemade sauce has a great tangy taste to it. The interior design is modern, clean, and on the fancier side of casual. Our server was new and seemed a little nervous, but was very nice and informative. They also deliver if you feel like ordering in.  Definitely a new hidden gem of Schaumburg!"

The good: 
Sushi was super tasty. We got the red dragon roll and yume roll. Fresh and very good. Came with soy sauce.
Spicy chili oil chicken was very good but too spicy for me (partner liked it a lot - get it if you like spicy - the texture was GREAT too).
Monogolian beef was good.
Food was done quickly and packaged nicely.

The bad:
They only gave us two very small servings of rice. Not nearly enough rice to go with each entree.
No fortune cookies.
The soup they gave us with the entrees was not good. I&#39;m not sure what kind it was (sweet and sour or egg drop or a combo of the two) and I didn&#39;t know it came with the meal, but I would have rather had egg rolls or something if I had known it came with. Neither of us ate the soup.

I will be going back here with a friend for just sushi and eating in to see what it&#39;s like to eat there. I thought the sushi was really good, and maybe they just don&#39;t have their to-go system down yet. Worth a try!"

They offer traditional appetizers and others with the owner&#39;s added twist. The special clams and oysters were phenomenal. 

Our group tried a wide variety of the menu. While everything was great, some notable main dishes  were the beef tenderloin, the princess Thai chicken, and the red snapper. 

Being with a large group we appreciated that Yume offers pitchers of Sapporo and other Japanese beers. 

Additionally, while serving a large group is never easy, the staff at Yume was great. I can&#39;t speak highly enough of our experience. Yume is a must try, affordable, high-quality restaurant that quickly became our favorite."

I&#39;ve been here various times and I do notice one thing they lack which is service.  The food is great.  The sushi is fresh and the Chinese food is really good.  Being Asian we have high expectations of the food and it has been met.  I had called in 3 weeks ahead for a reservation of 14 and requested that the table be set up in the back room since it had more windows and had more lighting.  However when we got there we were setup in the front where it was really dark at 6.30pm.  I ask the manager or hostess that I had requested the table in the back room so they were not sure what to do.  I insisted that I get the tables in the other room and they said they would get us settled in but it took 20 minutes to do this ?  Really a party of 14 ?  You had 3 weeks notice and this is a Saturday with 1 waitress working the entire night ?  We ended up spending 600+ and I am truly disappointed with the poor slow service.  I will come back for the food but it will be either takeout or sometime when it&#39;s NOT busy because it seems like they don&#39;t have enough staff to service during the busy dinner hours."

This place is nice and clean. The food was tasty and well executed. The menu incorporates cuisine from Japan, China, and Thaiwan, and more. There is something for everyone. 

The prices are more than fair. I will be going back without a doubt. Great place for a date.

That said, I only got a small taste of what they have to offer. Soup, dumplings, and 2 standard Maki rolls for dinner. I was stuffed. I would order the same items again.  Next time I will have to try one of their specialties.

I had the General Tso&#39;s chicken and was pleased to see it came with Broccoli.  So many places have stopped serving it with Broccoli.  If you like spicy, try the Dry Chili Chicken was we had that as well.  Spicy, but tasty.  The spice did not overpower the other flavors so that was nice.  We also order pot stickers, and got 6.

We ordered scallion pancakes, Szechuan spicy string beans, Yume delight that is a combination of beef tenderloin and shrimps, and 3 sushi rolls including spicy tuna, spicy yellow tail and eel cucumber. They are all tasty but with issues. The pancakes are too oily, the Szechuan spicy string beans are not spicy at all, the shrimps are nice but the beef tenderloin are not in good quality, sushi rolls are a total disaster. Also, all dishes are quite salty. The environment is nice and quiet. The only complaint is that they place a super bright light above each small table, not sure for what purpose."

We had been patrons at Aloha and Chinese Garden. In my opinion, Yume far exceeds these two restaurants.

Same location, new owners and staff. The service was excellent. We went mid-afternoon because we had heard that they had lunch specials on the weekend. Their lunch specials are huge! You receive your entree, rice (fried rice if you want) and spring roll. Great lunch prices too. 

We started with the Crab Rangoon, which was good.

I had the Sesame Chicken. It&#39;s a good indicator of how good the food may be. Their Sesame Chicken was absolutely delicious. The saw was slightly sweet and not overcooked. My mom got the Mongolian Beef. The beef was so tender and the sauce was super savory. It was much better than Yu&#39;s. These dishes were our litmus test to be more adventurous.

Next time we&#39;ll try some of the Japanese dishes."

NO. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. First of all, the food was extremely expensive for the quality, the food took over two hours to get here, one hour after promised arrival time and then upon arrival the food was ICE COLD and gross. The restaurant is 1.6 miles away from my place of business... there was NO excuse when I got a text at 4:46 pm ( already an hour after placed order) saying that my driver was on the way... At 5:20 I called asking what was going on and was told there was &#34;heavy traffic in the area&#34; as if I couldn&#39;t look out the window and tell that that was a lie. THEN, it still took another 24 minutes for my food to arrive. 1.6 MILES AWAY!!! It was a pretty expensive piece of garbage since the food ended up straight in the trash due to it being cold and gag-worthy. I hope that dining in is better than their delivery service but either way I will never step foot inside or offer them my business ever again."

When I saw Yume on here, with all the great reviews, I thought I&#39;d give them a call. The guy I spoke with said they Don&#39;t use ANY MSG in their food, however it is already in some of their appetizers and soup, which is expected. But NO MSG in their main dishes at all. So, being that it was also my birthday and after a great workout, we thought we&#39;d check it out.

Location: in a strip mall/plaza area, near other restaurants (so lots of parking).
Inside: Bar to the left with White Sox game on, separate tables and booths for seating (nice booths), Sushi bar to the right, bathrooms to the back.

Pros:
-They don&#39;t use MSG in any of their food (thought there&#39;s already some in some of their appetizers and soups).
-Nice, quiet area for eating
-Paper tablecloths (for creative art)
-I don&#39;t know if I was just thirsty, or if the water was just that good, but I was really into it.
-Clean
-The service was very hospitable and professional - kind people.
-The food was SO GOOD!
 --I got the Florida garlic dish with scallops. I can&#39;t remember the last time I ate something where the chef knew exactly how to use garlic (I like to sweat garlic). The scallops were also perfectly cooked. It was SO good (I brought some home to enjoy later). Came with rice and soup (see soup note below).
--My wife got the orange chicken, but asked that it be mild (it&#39;s regularly spicy here). I don&#39;t like Orange Chicken, but I really liked it here. Not too sweet, not to doughy, came with rice, broccoli, and soup.
-The price was reasonable.
-No long wait for the food
-I&#39;d say it&#39;s authentic.
-Sox won, Cubs were rained out  :)

Cons:
-All their soups (except one with fish) had MSG. MSG hurts me, so I just opted out of soup.
-MSG in some of their appetizers, also.
-The Garlic dish I got didn&#39;t have any veggies in it (the server said he believed there&#39;d be mushrooms, water chestnuts, and maybe other veggies in it).
-No wifi (or not free, anyway)

I still have to try their Chicken &amp; Broccoli (my common test for Chinese food), but from our experience last night, I believe I can honestly say that we&#39;ve found our new favorite local Asian restaurant."

I was even more please to see the variety - sushi, noodle soups, chinese, thai-style dishes.  

Our first visit went fairly well - tried the cumin lamb and the crunchy prawns for lunch.  The portion was ample, the taste was pretty good (a bit too much cumin and too many red peppers to pick out) with plenty of fresh stir-fried vegetables.  The service was quick and pleasant.

Next we tried takeout and on the whole were pleased with our order (rice noodles with bbq pork, cumin lamb, a spicy thai chicken dish) though everyone in the family liked something different.

The next lunch was not so successful.  Service was very slow.  The basil chicken dish is just awful - dried not fresh basil is used!!

One more try at dinner - let&#39;s try a hard to mess-up standby like kung pao chicken.  And now I realized what I don&#39;t like about their taste - everything is sweet and the chicken has an odd texture and taste.  

Sorry - it just doesn&#39;t satisfy so I don&#39;t think we will be returning here much even though it&#39;s just down the street."

All in all it was a very pleasant experience. The only thing keeping me from giving it a full 5 stars was the fact that were seated by the bathroom when there were a couple of other seating options available. But there was no bad smell!

The restaurant menu is very similar to TL Lounge in Bartlett and the food is equally as good if not better. The beef in sizzling platter has an excellent gravy and the beef very tender. The same can be said for the basil chicken. Steamed halibut with ginger and scallions was also superb.

I ordered the lunch Kung Pow chicken.  Had lots of dried chilli&#39;s but no heat at all.  The sauce actually was a little sweet. It was almost as if it had corn syrup in it.  Proportion of vegetables to chicken was probably 6 to 1. If your a big eater and like bland food, the $7 price is good.  The Hot and sour soup had a good pepper taste but no sour at all.  I didn&#39;t like the consistency either.  It was too thick and slimy.  Staff is friendly and service was good."

Time of my visit: Lunch

I was in a mood for a buffet for lunch today.  I looked this place up on Yelp! and it looked like it would be either a hit or a miss.

When I arrived, I asked how much the buffet was, before seating down (not that I am cheap, but I ran into an issue with another buffet. I reviewed, where the price was not the same everyday).  The lunch buffet was under $9 (bill came to $9 and change).

I ordered water and upon it arrival, I went to get food.  My first plate was all sushi.  I am not even gonna bother listing what I got.  It was mediocre to average at best.  I was not expecting it to first class sushi, but I was expecting it to be a lot better than it was.  It almost did not taste fresh and tasted stale.

My second plate was cut up hotdogs, BBQ chicken and their version of orange chicken (I think it was called general chicken) and a slice of pizza.  BBQ chicken tasted chewy, orange chicken was a bit over fried and hotdogs were hotdogs...  Pizza tasted old.

Overall, I would not recommend this place, there are plenty of other options in the area.  The only thing worthy noting is the service.  The service was phenomenal, the guy would clean up my table every time I would get up (which was twice, I did get some fruit at the end).  A D+ and most of it for service alone."

It was fine for a lunch, but I really couldn&#39;t see myself coming back, unless it was for the hibachi. One of the sushi rolls I had was good (I believe it was a spicy California roll) but the rest were really not tasty. Making my own stir-fry/hibachi was worth it and I wish I would have ordered that first. The rest of the food was lukewarm, even though we came right at open.

The &#34;seafood&#34; is so low-quality that you really can&#39;t get any meat out of it. The work it took to get the meat out of the crab legs far outweighed the amount of meat you actually got. The high point (besides the hibachi) was the ice cream and those sugary donuts.

The service wasn&#39;t that attentive. We had to ask for refills on our drinks and flag down our waiter for our check. 

Overall, it was okay and still edible, but I&#39;m not rushing back."

However on the evening of April 7th, 2016 I arrived at 8:58pm. The stated closing time is 9:30pm. I was watching the entire Buffett being closed down and the hibachi being broken down as soon as I arrived. As a result I did not eat a thing. 

It is fine to close during the 8 o&#39;clock hour... Just state this with your posted hours.

I left disappointed. 

I wish I could say that I will be back.  

On a side note, why is the hostess or person behind the cash register always playing on their cellular phone? I have been here about a dozen times the past year and every single time they are always playing on the phone! Please strive for better customer service!"

Most of the time when people think of a chinese buffet they think of an asian mcdonalds meaning quantity over quality. I was really surprised by everything there was no funky smell and it was not really dirty the service was alright but it its never perfect at a Chinese buffet there was a vast variety of food which is good. There was alot of crab alot alot and it was seasoned well and cleaned well but there wasnt alot of meat in it though
The sushi selection is okay nothing special fake crab type of stuff the sashimi is cut nicely the spicy mayo is amaizing i highly recommend it. The hibachi grill i wouldnt the grill was really dirty and the line was really long so i dont think its worth it. The frog legs were really good but greasy that was kinda a big problem another issue was some of the food was cold and i didnt see any oysters at all theres a great selection price is not that bad when u think that u can eat how ever much u want and stay as long as u want id come back cause im cheap"

We got there right around the time it opened, so everything was fresh, and not crowded.

The sushi wasn&#39;t great, but I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be either. 

I don&#39;t frequent Chinese buffets all to often, years actually. To my surprise, not only did they have the usual white and yellow rice, but they had Hibachi rice. Uh...sweet! Otherwise the food was enjoyable, but nothing spectacular. 

Our server was very attentive and always topped my glass with more water. He was really good about removing our dishes when we were done with them. 

Overall, experience wasn&#39;t too bad. Place is well kept and maintained, plenty of options, they have a hibachi grill (which no one manned, perhaps because they had just opened), and well, the kiddos got their Chinese buffet fix."

Take buffets for what they are and inherently food is a bit harder to manage but the quality has really suffered.  The beef is extremely fatty and the  General chicken is awful.

Therefore, it is inflated. This buffet offers a variety of food. However, the quality is subpar.

Yes, I am on a diet. I was here because my family wanted to eat here. If they didn&#39;t offer the amount of food that they did, I would&#39;ve given three stars.

The selection was wide, but VERY limited for those with dietary restrictions. Many of the veggies were stir fried with meat or in a cheese dish. However, there were some vegan options, but not labeled that way. Mostly guesswork. Their rice dishes were standard, nothing special. Not that ordering coffee from a buffet is the best idea, but it was honestly terrible. Talk about coffee smelling like cat piss. I had some rice, green beans, and a serving of noodles. It was satisfying and second were tempting, but after the food sitting for a while I felt a little sick. Their fruit selection was either warm or out of season and didn&#39;t have much taste. 

This place? Nothing special.

P.S: There are kids running EVERYWHERE. I understand that sometimes kids are hard to control, but this was ridiculous."

I walked in to see a large and very clean looking eatery that was mostly empty. After being seated and looking over the buffet I initially picked a few items and headed back to my seat as no one was behind the counter at the Hibachi to cook anything.

Pretty much every item I tried off the buffet table was lousy, not only that, a lot of it was room temperature or colder. After that initial plate of buffet food, and realizing I wasn&#39;t going to eat anything from off the buffet again, I very quickly decided to get the attention of an employee who spoke minimal English to see if they could get someone to man the Hibachi so I could try some of that food. I stood and waited at least five minutes with a plate of to be grilled food waiting before someone came to the grill to cook it. After I got back to my seat I tried the grilled Hibachi food which was alright. There was a decent variety of items to have grilled including shrimp, imitation crab meat, noodles and various other meats, veggies and even mushrooms.

Unfortunately, the Hibachi grill food, while far better than the food sitting out at the buffet wasn&#39;t that fantastic either. While this place is well decorated and very clean the food and service were both lousy. After finishing off my plate of Hibachi grilled noodles meat, veggies and seafood I asked someone for the check. This took a few minutes as well.

Overall this particular location of Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet was far from supreme. It should be called Hibachi wait and see if we grill your food buffet. Everything about the service was slow, and while the grilled food wasn&#39;t terrible it wasn&#39;t great. I&#39;m going to give it two stars as at least the prices were reasonable."

It was like going from first class to economy.  The inside was clean and nicely decorated.  Surprisingly, it was packed with people during a week night.  They have a large variety of food (over 250 items, although I didn&#39;t count them all and just took their word for it), all very average and will fill an empty belly but may not satisfy the taste buds as much.  The sushi were ok - thinly sliced on a large rice ball.   I only saw 2 kinds of sushi (tuna and red snapper) and a few rolls when I was there.  There&#39;s a part of me that just doesn&#39;t trust sushi from a $10 buffet, but I did bring myself to try a couple and I&#39;m still alive.  

I contemplated trying the Hibachi grill where I could pick my own ingredients and they will cook it for you, but I didn&#39;t find it appetizing.  I didn&#39;t try anything that would make me want to go back and have it again.  The best thing I had was probably the fried banana.  The dessert bar was nicely packed with fresh fruits and pastries.  The salad bar looked good.  For $10 dinner, it wasn&#39;t worth it for me since I couldn&#39;t eat $10 worth of food from here.  They do offer carry out buffet starting at $4/lb without seafood."

Hibachi Grill was good and filling even if you dont want to have other stuff from the buffet.  Chinese Won Ton soup good.  Most items are typical of Chinese buffets.  The salad bar includes raw shrimp!   The management has coupons but they are mostly for a free drink with the buffet.   Wish they would have Chinese tea of Japanese tea included in the price but ah well....       If you go there on the dinner or weekends, there are a lot of unsupervised kids running around.

Is this place as good as every 4* place I&#39;ve ever reviewed.  Probably not.  However, I think it&#39;s pretty good and deserves more than 3*.

The price is pretty good.  $10.  Drinks are extra.  They have a lot of food choices, and a lot of variety.  A lot of American food (mozzarella sticks, chicken nuggets, etc).  They also have a sushi bar, while it is not necessarily the biggest cuts of sushi, they taste ok and again there is a lot of variety of rolls and sushi.  Not just salmon and tuna.
They have a hibachi grill which is basically like a mini flat top.  You grab a few veggies and some meat and watch them cook it.

The ice cream is Blue Bonnet ice cream cups which is pretty legit.  Not your watery frozen vanilla flavored ice mush.

Their salad bar is also fresh looking and has a lot of different options.  

I&#39;m not a huge fan of buffets, but this one is probably one of the better ones I&#39;ve been to."

When I went to get the hibachi, and was waiting for my food, I looked at the warm sushi station next to it, and saw a small cockroach was sitting on the sushi! Absolutely disgusted, I told staff who just swatted it away like it was no big deal... I then proceeded to try the orange chicken, and found a few strands of hair. I walked out.

I had a whole bunch of stuff off the buffet (pizza, fries, sweet &amp; sour chicken, fried rice, etc.) and their hibachi chicken (off the grill).

Don&#39;t get the hibachi chicken.

I&#39;m not sure if it was even chicken, come to think of it. After it was cooked it was a weird grayish shade that just was not pleasant to look at.

Overall, the buffet was edible and affordable for lunch. Was it the best buffet I&#39;ve ever been to? Nope. Would I come back? I&#39;m not going to suggest it, but I suppose I would.

First of all, buffets are weird.  This place is called Hibachi Grill &amp; Supreme Buffet. I was not expecting to see french fries and onion rings.  However, I do agree that they have a large selection of food. I just think it was a little too much.  Hibachi lends itself to Asian inspired cuisine in my opinion.  Anyway, a lot of the food looked like it had been sitting out for a while. I did see someone refilling a tray here and there, but most of it probably wasn&#39;t that fresh. I like that everything was labeled so you could tell what you were getting. I got some dinnertime shrimp and crab thing that wasn&#39;t very good. I also got the sushi. It was decent, but the avocado had started to brown. Service was alright, I think our waiter was named Norris, he was cool. Overall, the food was pretty greasy and cold. I would not go back."

Each time was better than the last. The hibachi food is great. The clams are very fresh and so are the frog legs. The items in the buffet are 5x better than the traditional buffet. The price is great and you definitely get what you pay for. 

Some of the wait staff can be annoying and sometimes you can catch the male waiters trying to be flirty but it doesn&#39;t work.

I always go to the back wall and load fresh ingredients on my plate, and hand it to the cook at the grill. It is usually the same guy it seems, day or night, but he is awesome at his job. I always throw a buck in his tip jar, he deserves it. I get a huge plate of shrimp and rice and whatever else, freshly cooked, for $11 bucks, not too bad. There are always coupons in the Moneysaver magazine which takes $4.50 of the bill for three or more people. My kids eat from the buffet. I dabble a little bit there, but the food is not nearly as good as having it freshly cooked. Some of it has obviously been on the warmer for a few hours. But mostly not that bad. I wouldn&#39;t pay the price for that alone though. The table service is not quite the same as a full service restaurant, but then again these waiters aren&#39;t expecting 20% tips. I like to give them about $5 for the 4 of us, but that&#39;s just to bring our drinks and clear some plates. They don&#39;t take your order or serve your food."

Stay away from ribs and roast beef if you want to keep you teeth.  This is a friendly warning, they are not tender.

I am not a fan of buffets but I did enjoy the other location and I always get coupons in the mail so figured, why not?

Visited on Saturday around 5-6pm and the place was packed. When we were seated we asked if we preferred a booth or table and they were able to accommodate our request. They also took our drink order. That is one thing I don&#39;t understand about these hibachi buffets, they act like it is a traditional restaurant by bringing drinks and then a check at the end of the meal. Why not have everyone pay before they sit and give customers the ability to get their own drinks? Seems like a set up to generate tips. 

Anyways, this place did have a wide selection but it wasn&#39;t very organized. Some sections have Americanized food such as pigs in a blanket and chicken fingers and then BAM, sweet and sour chicken or fried rice. There didn&#39;t seem to really be any rhyme or reason as to how the food was set up. Also, a lot of choices weren&#39;t even labeled. It was fairly easy to make out what the dishes were but I&#39;m sure others might have difficulty. The labels that were present were pretty messy and just scribbled quickly on a piece of paper. It did appear that a lot of the food was replenished fairly quickly.

There is a sushi area but I am not a fan so I can&#39;t comment. They also have a hibachi section which I did have. I do have to note that several areas needed attending to such as the glass by the hibachi selections. They were greasy as though someone pressed their face to the glass, yuck. Also, the floor was pretty dirty/sticky.

They did have an ice cream section along the back wall that had little cups of ice cream. There was a sign that if you took the ice cream out, it was 75 cents.

Pricing is fairly cheap, around $9/adult so you don&#39;t feel entirely guilty if you just have one plate of food. Also, there are always coupons floating around, I had a $3 off.

Again, it is a buffet so set your expectations accordingly."

We USED to go to this place AT LEAST once a week since it opened. I loved the food. The crappy service was not bad, either. Just crappy, because they didn&#39;t speak English very well, and they would take the soy sauce off the table to refill it just as I&#39;d get ready to use it... Anyway, yum, I love the food. I have not, however, been back there since an episode I had there about a month ago. We had a new waiter. His name was Bin. When he gave us our check, we still had a little bit of food left on our plates that we had planned to eat. No big deal, I don&#39;t mind having the check, HOWEVER, BIN, you little cork soaker, it is EXTREMELY inappropriate to come to the table FOUR times and rudely say &#34;ARE YOU READY?&#34; as you swing your arms and stare at the check presenter. Finally, after the 4th time, my girl said &#34;NO. WE WILL TELL YOU WHEN WE ARE READY TO PAY YOU.&#34; Bin, you A-hole, I&#39;m a server too, I know better than to piss off my guests. I know how to get a crappy tip, and you done got yourself one. When we were ready to pay, we gave you the eye, as you had been staring anxiously at us like a horny coyote stalking a stray cat, and you rushed your skinny Asian buttocks over like a bat out of hell, and proceeded to COUNT THE MONEY AT THE TABLE TO SEE HOW MUCH YOUR TIP WAS! I was appalled. You&#39;re an idiot, a prick, and a HORRIBLE server, and I&#39;m thankful that was the one and only time you served me. It&#39;s because of you I won&#39;t ever be back. Thanks a lot for making me not eat at one of m FAVORITE places ever. I realize I&#39;m almost 34 years old and should just go back and eat there and request to NOT have you as my server, but I&#39;m gonna be a little b!tch about it and never go back. And your boss will know its because of you, because we fricken complained about you before we left. SUCKIT! In other news, you people reading this should really go eat there. It&#39;s delicious for the price, and the decor is elegant as hell. Just ask to not be seated in BIN&#39;s section. He sucks.
UPDATE: we went back last night! (Thursday, 9/27/12) Bin got fired!! I assume he screwed up royally, or, the owner read my yelp. Either way, food was amazeballs as always, AND, our server, another dude, was cool, nice, efficient, and nice looking. If I were into men, I&#39;d ask him out. It was just that awesome. GO ENJOY!!"

I really enjoy the sushi which makes me feel like I&#39;m getting my moneys worth because when my husband and I order sushi it is around $40 so the price of about $10 each isn&#39;t that bad. The only downside its the last 3 times we have been there the waiters that take the plates when you are done are very persistent..which gets annoying and when you pay if you leave any tip less than $8 they ask you if everything was okay and look pretty mad.."

I volunteer at a large food pantry with a lot of volunteers. A little less than a year ago, we were planning on ordering lunch. One of the volunteers told a leader that they would anonymously buy lunch for all the volunteers - they ordered pizza from Primo&#39;s.

The owner delivered it that day. He saw the volunteers and all the people that we were serving and it really touched him. He told the leaders that he was willing to bring our volunteer team (about 40-50 people) lunch once a month and he&#39;d cover it. Delivery included. He has done that each month since.

Businesspeople that have that kind of ethic deserve and get my business. If you&#39;re in their area and have the chance to check Primo&#39;s out, I hope you will."

When I called to ask about the pizza, the person who answered told me that he got the crusts from a large gluten free company that starts with &#34;U.&#34; If you&#39;re gluten free, you know who that is. I totally trust that brand.

The gluten free pizzas were cooked in their own little foil pans so my concerns about cross-contamination were unfounded. The pizza tasted amazing. The whole family ate well, including my little ones. We were very satisfied and will be back. There are three tables in the shop as well as a TV so you could eat there if you had a group of two or three, but they do carry out and delivery so that might be a better choice. Prices were great!!"

Good flavor, but crust was a bit heavy for an extra thin, but that happens when you deliver and let it sit while putting kids in bed.

The atmosphere inside as well as the decor - if that means anything to you were both good! It is much bigger inside than it appear and they even have a small outdoor eating area as well - I decided to eat inside - to stay away from bugs as I hate eating with bugs. However, I did have a fly at my table - that isn&#39;t the reason for taking away a star though - at least not on its own.

I gazed through a very decent breakfast and lunch menu and found both selection and price to be very good. Service was also very good - both in speed of delivery after order and in general - the server was excellent!

Food flavor was good, our orders were both cooked to our liking and the only problem I have with this place or ANY place that serves toast is that the butter not be hard. Serving me hard butter to spread on my toast basically shows me that your level of customer satisfaction is lower than my expectation. At home I hate when I find that the butter is still in the fridge - so when I go out - I simply expect them to think ahead more then me - as I&#39;m not in business of preparing and serving food! 

Between the parking, the fly and the hard butter - I rated this place with 4 stars - to me 4 stars is GREAT and I would gladly return! I hope the locals know that they have a really clean place, with great service, decent selection of food at very affordable prices!"

Savoury looks very promising -- a fresh-faced building in a nice shopping strip area with a warm, inviting interior. A large container of organic olive oil sat at the front counter with some empty bottles -- for filling, I suppose.

Well.... beyond the first impression, the visit wasn&#39;t off to a great start. We arrived somewhat early to beat the Sunday brunch crowd to see only one couple waiting before us. Great. We put our name in for a table of eight, sat down in the waiting area, and waited. During the next forty minutes, groups of people came in, waited briefly, and were seated. None of the groups were was large as ours, but we did see a couple tables of five or six get seated rather quickly. What! So... we waited. And waited. FORTY minutes. The wait wouldn&#39;t be so bad if we were quoted that wait and everyone that came after us also waited, but we were the only ones waiting that long! Ridiculous! The staff was apologetic and nice about the wait, but I was grumbling inside.

Once seated, we were squished around two small square tables. I had the fortune of sitting in the middle where two uneven tables came together. Kind of awkward. For that long wait, we should have had a better table set-up, in my opinion.... sigh.

Our waitress came quickly and took our orders (we had looked at the menus prior to being seated so we could order fast). I ordered a coffee, strawberry crepes (YES! Loooove crepes!), and a side of hash browns. Other people at my table got chicken and waffles, chocolate chip pancakes, and regular brunch fare. Everyone stuffed themselves and enjoyed their meals. My coffee was good, the crepes were delicious (although I had to request whip cream after it was served), and the hash browns were OK. 

Best brunch ever? Nope. But good enough? YES! I am thankful the food was good or the wait would have been worthless. Also, $7.99 for a massive plate of crepes? That&#39;s kind of awesome. If I come back, I&#39;m getting the crepes again."

Been here twice now, once at lunchtime and the second, Sunday morning breakfast (we had a 15 minute wait).  Both times service was great and both waitresses were super sweet and very attentive.  Our little 8 month old was present and even the bus boys were saying hi to her.  I really liked the family vibe the place gives off.  

Now onto the food.  First time I had the Caprese Benedict.  Loved the basil hollandaise and the garlic ciabatta bread it was on.  My only critique?  I think I would have liked the mozzarella to have been warmer.  Having the super cold cheese with the warm egg and warm tomato just seemed to be a little off.  Otherwise, I loved it.  And my peach mimosa?  Delicious!  Second time I went with a classic, ham and cheese omelet.  Insanely fluffy eggs, really crisp hash browns, and I LOVED that I got to have cinnamon toast.  Does anybody know if their bread is homemade?  The pieces of toast totally seemed like it.  My husband&#39;s steak fajita skillet was amazing too.  The steak was really tender and that really impressed us.  Most breakfast places just slop some low grade meat on skillets in hopes to mask it by all the other ingredients.  This was the complete opposite.

I&#39;m hoping they are reading these bad reviews and have made improvements and our meals have been a result of that :)"

Every server we&#39;ve had so far have been very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. 

Ive had 2 eggs, hash browns, and turkey sausage, a Greek feta chicken wrap and soup. I absolutely LOVE their hash browns, they are perfectly crisp. I wasnt too crazy about the soup I had, minestrone, it lacked flavor and tasted watered down but my wrap was delicious and large, I took the other half for lunch to work.

Parma Benedict: I&#39;m not even gonna lie, I only reason I got this was because there&#39;s prosciutto in there. I had thought &#34;you can&#39;t really do wrong to prosciutto.&#34; The description said &#34;lightly fried&#34; yea yea it&#39;s not supposed to be like bacon, but it didn&#39;t feel &#34;fried&#34; to me. It was more like &#34;we&#39;ll just slap a bunch of prosciutto on here.&#34; There were also no basil present in the dish, even though the description said so. One good thing I have to comment on how the garlic ciabatta bread is much much better than the boring English muffin. English muffins tends to get soggy after awhile in the hollandaise sauce, but the ciabatta held up nicely. 

The hash brown that came with it...this, this needed a paragraph of its own. Not because it was so damn good that I have to write a whole new paragraph about it. Ohh contraire people! I seriously thought they forgot to cook my hash brown or they cooked half and thought it wasn&#39;t enough and threw in some more. Half of it seemed unfried and the other half was burnt. When you get hash brown, you are looking for that crunchy exterior with the soft potato goodness as you continue to chew, but no. All I got was shitty hash browns. Shitty, just straight up bad.

Nutella crepe: the batter wasn&#39;t too thick or too thin for a crepe. I just think it was too much nutella that you couldn&#39;t taste the crepe itself. I do like that they threw in the crushed chocolate cookie....but it was like one chunk of cookie and that was it."

The food and service was really good in the beginning but now it seems to be very lackluster. The quality control on their food have gone down - from unripe bananas on pancakes to uncooked potatoes in our hash browns. I have a toddler who has some food allergies and if they don&#39;t care about their food preparation it makes me wonder if they are paying attention to my toddler&#39;s food. 

Restaurant have two things to focus on - the food and customer service. Do them well and you will have repeat customers. Acknowledged your regular customers, make effort to know their named, they are your best advertisers."

Today I visited and got a Belgian Waffle with bananas, upon first bite I knew something was off. I thought at first it was the flour they used but after a  few bites of just banana I realized that the papery taste in my mouth wasn&#39;t from flour but from being served unripe bananas... I&#39;m not sure what your kitchen management has been doing lately but I&#39;m beginning to think he/she has just been catching up on beauty sleep back there. While most people may like how quickly the food comes out I personally would rather wait a few extra minutes for quality food.

Sure, we had to wait for about 20 minutes (as you have to do for practically every other breakfast spot - the good ones anyway!), but out server was very nice when we were seated. You know, right away, that this is a family restaurant. The owners and their children and grandchildren could be seen all around the front desk.

I had the Rocky Mountain Savoury Crepe - a crepe filled with ham, bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms, topped with cheddar cheese. It was so good. I also had a mimosa and it was delicious! My husband wanted to try something new so he had the Gyros Skillet, a great choice at a Greek-owned restaurant. The skillet had gyros meat, tomatoes, onions, and feta cheese, topped with two eggs. Also very good.

We did not feel rushed to leave and had a great experience there. Service was good and the food was great. We can&#39;t wait to return!"

We&#39;ve been coming here since they opened, and we&#39;ve never had a bad entree. I love the bacon and onion skillet, it&#39;s simple but it&#39;s really good. They have fresh-squeezed orange juice that&#39;s amazing! I&#39;ve also become a fan of their red velvet pancakes. I haven&#39;t seen them at any other restaurant nearby, and they&#39;re sooo good! 

Why 3 stars? Service! And for the most part, it&#39;s not the actual wait staff, it&#39;s the family that owns the restaurant (and hold various positions). You would think that after coming here somewhat regularly for the past 8/9 years, that someone would recognize us and maybe say something like &#34;hey guys, how are you?&#34;. But no, that has not once happened. They always act as if we&#39;re strangers to the neighborhood. 

What&#39;s most frustrating is the family hostess. We continue to come back because we know the meal will be good, but we consistently have to deal with someone who acts like it&#39;s difficult to greet us, direct us to a table and take our money. I&#39;m sorry, maybe put a smile on your face and remember that it&#39;s your customers, like my family, who keep you open. Maybe be gracious, friendly, and welcoming and you&#39;ll grow your business even more!

We even had an experience at another breakfast place in St. Charles, got to talking to another family at the next table who now refuses to go back there for the same reason!

As for my family, I always say I&#39;m never coming back, but I&#39;m writing this review as I&#39;m waiting for a table. Expecting the same experience."

I&#39;m not one to talk down on an restaurant. But as an executive chef myself I have to say that the last 5 times I&#39;ve been here the food quality has suffered from what it used to be. From asking to a sunny side up egg, and receiving a fully cooked egg on my skillet to onions and tomatoes being poorly prepped, and I can&#39;t forget the overly cooked potatoes on my skillet. If I was the owner I would sit down the the chef in charge and tell him to get his act together and start caring about the food he&#39;s putting out, or let him go and find someone better. There is no excuse the chef should let anything under perfect walk out of his kitchen. If he doesn&#39;t care about your food and the quality of what he&#39;s putting out, he shouldn&#39;t be there."

First, we were seated to a soaking wet table that still wasn&#39;t clean. We ended up asking for our food to go, I just was not feeling the busy, rushed environment. I wish I would&#39;ve checked the food before leaving...I got the corned beef hash skillet with over easy eggs, disgusting. My hashbrowns were still basically cold they did not taste cooked at all, the corned beef tasted like cold mashed potatoes that I was scared to eat because they were not cooked, the green pepper was cut so huge. Also, the pancakes tasted like they had grains in them. Last but not least, the biscuits and gravy were soggy. I hate bashing restaurants but this first impression will be my last impression."

Decor: It&#39;s nice inside. Nothing fancy, but definitely not a dump. There are plenty of tables and plenty of booths to accommodate any size group. I&#39;m really a big fan of the entire wall of windows that allows for plenty of natural light.
Bathroom: I did not use the bathroom during this visit.

Staff: Our waitress was friendly and pleasant. While she was not the most speedy (as one would expect when there is almost NO ONE else in the place on a Friday morning) it really was not a big deal. The food came out relatively quickly as well.

Food/Drink: The food here is always great. Everything comes out hot and fresh and cooked perfectly. The taste, of course, goes without saying, wonderful! I always end up getting the two egg breakfast w/ bacon. This time, however, I tried a smoothie. It was good, but a bit small for the price.

Value: I think the prices are right where they should be. You get great quality food for a decent prcie. The smoothie is a bit expensive for the size, however.

We have gone on a weekday and on a weekend, and by all means - AVOID GOING SAT/SUN MORNING unless you plan to wait in tight quarters for over an hour. There are maybe 2 or 3 seats available for you to wait in, and there is no space for waiting. People randomly standing along walls, rubbing elbows with the wait staff as they come by. The people working the register/hostess stand never seem to be the most friendly unfortunately, but the waiters seem to be quite nice. 

Once you do get seated, the pancakes are magical. We love the Skillets too. I tried the Gyro Skillet for my last visit and was very impressed: Hashbrowns, Gyro Meat, Tahini Sauce, Onions, Feta Cheese: YUM! 

So, all in all, if you have the patience to wait for it, the food is good. It is the best breakfast spot in the area, but I conclude that they need to do something different for the crazy wait times. Maybe take reservations? Maybe offer more seating options for waiting? Allow for us to call ahead to add our name to the list?

Scored a booth after about a 15 minute wait at 9:30 - on a Sunday - so was pretty happy about that. The orange juice was delicious - tasted like it was probably fresh squeezed.

I ordered the eggs benedict with prosciutto, and was pretty disappointed. The prosciutto just tasted like thick sliced, really really salty ham. It wasn&#39;t the thin sliced, delicately cured layers of pork that I adore. And my eggs were pretty much hard boiled, so the whole thing was just super salty and dry. For me, a benedict should be smothered in buttery hollandaise and covered in rich egg yolk when you break through the whites. Not so here. A very modest glaze of sauce and no yolks. Boo. The fruit that I ordered on the side was the highlight for me.

However, my husband&#39;s gyro skillet was pretty excellent. Service was slow, but our waiter was pleasant. Might give them another go if I&#39;m in town, but certainly will not go out of my way."

Even going in around 8pm on a Thursday evening, we were greeted by one of the friendly owners and promptly seated.  The food was hot and fresh.  Even the soup was steaming (which is a major plus in my book).  My son continues to stick with his Nutella Crepes and cleaned his plate tonight.  I tried the skirt steak sandwich.  I am SOOOO glad that I did!  The steak was cooked to medium as requested, it was seasoned just right and the onion rings that I ordered on the side came out crispy without being overcooked.

My 3 girls all said it was way better than any other pancake house they&#39;ve been to! Daddy approved too!

Savoury confuses me.  On the weekends there is almost always a wait.  Even at lunch time there&#39;s usually going to be a wait. The question is: Is it really worth the wait?  I&#39;d say no. By far my biggest issue would be the service. It&#39;s almost impossible to get a refill on your coffee here. Like I swear some of the waitresses avoid eye contact with you so you can&#39;t even flag them down for your desperately needed refill.  This is not something that&#39;s happened once or twice, it&#39;s pretty much every time. There is one nice young blonde waitress who this wasn&#39;t an issue with, when we&#39;re there we always hope to get her section but we never have such luck. Also, the last two times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve been served &#39;burnt&#39; decaf coffee.  As in you could literally smell it in the mug and tasted like tar.  Both times I was told it say in pot too long....why wouldn&#39;t you keep it fresh?  I also find the hash browns to be severely lacking.  They are just really boring and plain. The pancakes are really good, it&#39;s probably the only real reason I end up coming back here. We recently found a great breakfast place in Elgin though and we&#39;ve been making the drive there for the better service and great food, even though we are less than 5 min from Savoury."

Decent breakfast and a couple good dinner items on the menu (skirt steak and pork chops), but things have gone way downhill since then. First of all, the staff is consistently grumpy and a few times rude, for no reason-- just right off the bat rude. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just their personalities, but don&#39;t be in this business if you can&#39;t smile (or even fake it). Secondly, they desperately need to upgrade their dining room. Every time we&#39;ve gone here, the chairs feel like they&#39;re going to fall apart underneath us. Thirdly, the portions have gone way down in the past few years. 

The food isn&#39;t bad and they have a nice outdoor area. Their skillets are pretty mediocre and I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I ask for them to leave off the hash browns altogether (they&#39;re just dry and bland).

Mainly because of the rudeness, we finally gave up on this place and instead drive out of our way to go to Egg Yolk Cafe in West Chicago, where we&#39;re greeted warmly and the food and atmosphere is much better."

I judge a breakfast &amp; pancake house by its pancakes, right? 

Horrible pancakes. Darn it! Why? I got a veggie skillet with eggs over medium and a pancake. About two bites of pancake was all I could do. They are really heavy and too much leavening (not fluffy). Have you eaten Krusteez? There ya go. Like vanilla wafers meets Bisquick. Even the MSG didn&#39;t make me think it tasted good. 

The skillet looked fabulous, but underneath those beautiful eggs was mush. The hashbrowns turned into mashed potatoes. I am not understanding what people see in this place, really. I remembered I had this problem the last time I was here. The b-friend&#39;s skillet was also mush.

The two stars are for the eggs cooked correctly, and the really nice atmosphere outside on the patio. Our waitress was overworked so service a bit slow, but she was really nice. Also, the b-friend liked the Blackhawks stuff. SUGGESTION: Eggs, bacon and toast on the patio. No pancakes."

The eggs are  perfect no matter how you get them and if they aren&#39;t they&#39;re happy to remake them.   Very crowded at times but worth the wait.

Eggs Benedict--the poached eggs were overdone and the hollendaise sauce was bland. Insert sad face because I love eggs benny.
Southwest Omelet--a delicious dish with chorizo, jalepenos, tomatoes, onions, cheddar and avocado (how they didn&#39;t mush the avocado is beyond me!) Soooo good, very flavorful, nice spice.  Very well made. Insert smiley face here.
The omelet comes with a side of buttermilk pancakes--I found them pretty basic, nothing special.  Insert Meh face here
Coffee--weak. Insert really sad face here.

Service:  Our server was friendly, helpful and on point.  I appreciated the host helping us decide which booth would be better for us since we brought le bebe in his baby carrier.

It&#39;s become a mainstay of our visits. When I tell my OTHER siblings &#34;we went to Savoury!&#34; they get jealous. :) 

Tips -- the Kona coffee is awesome - it&#39;s fresh, regularly refilled, and tasty. Ask for flavored creamers too - they&#39;ll bring you a bowl.

More tips - for your side of toast, get Greek bread. It&#39;s almost like Texas toast in size, but has sesame seeds. It&#39;s lovely and delicious. 

Last tips -- if you&#39;re in a group, get different sides, pancakes, and dishes. Share! Everything is delicious. My little sister always gets Nutella crepes - they are truly wonderful. I try to keep it healthy most of the time and get a griller with egg whites.

Savoury is great. So happy it&#39;s become part of the home experience! :)"

We were seated near the kitchen but because of the layout we really didn&#39;t hear any unusual noise.  The server took our order very quickly BUT never gave us her name...which was a shame because I would like to thank her by name.  

The food which ran from Chicken Fingers to Crepes to a Country Benedict and two skillet choices, was prepared well.  The pancakes as a side, which were built up a bit were ok...but that was the only let down.  Coffee came often as well as water, and we were asked no less than four times if we needed anything else!

When I got it and sliced the steak I was SHOCKED.... It was cooked perfectly.... hard to cook out the chewiness in a skirt steak but they nailed it..... I knew a nap was in my near future. My hash browns were cooked well done as I asked and the service was prompt and friendly.

I didn&#39;t want to knock this restaurant down to three stars, but they have earned it.  I have been here at least once or twice a month since my initial review.  While they have retained their &#34;ok&#34; rating with me, some things have definitely gone downhill.

Now there are certain things I really do like about them (they take reservations when you have big parties (sometimes we have 9 or 10 people) and they are nice about bringing out extra plates for our kids.

But something I cannot look past is this:  I bought a restaurant.com gift certificate a few months ago with the intent to bring the whole family here for my mom&#39;s birthday (a Sunday) this February.  There were NO limitations on this $100 certificate when I bought it.  So you can understand my disappointment when I arrived a couple weeks ago to see a sign on their door saying that &#34;they are no longer accepting restaurant.com certificates on the weekends&#34; starting the previous week.

Wow.  As a business, going forward you can make limitations, but you should have honored the ones that had already been purchased for what the purchaser bought it for.

Poor business practices."

Nice atmosphere, table service was okay, not great. I had the pancakes. They were just okay, nothing special. My friend had the chorizo quesadilla. It was okay, but kind of lacking on the &#34;stuffings&#34;.  Check out would have been more enjoyable if the cashier/hostess had actually acknowledged me instead of yakking it up with two of her co workers who obviously had nothing better to do than to keep her from being courteous to the customers.

We&#39;ve both ordered different breakfast items for our dinners. The first few times everything has been either great or ok: skillets, pancakes, and toast all perfectly cooked, and service either wonderful or ok.

Tonight&#39;s service was again fine, but the food was not so great. We both ordered skillets and the hashbrowns were mushy and barely cooked. Our eggs were perfect, but the ham in my skillet was different than I&#39;ve had in the past...salty and mushy instead of firm and moist. My husband&#39;s pancakes were undercooked and doughy.

We&#39;ll definitely give Savoury another chance, but be aware that it&#39;s hit or miss.

I&#39;ve had two or three breakfasts here, and two or three sandwiches for lunch. I would give it 2 stars for the lunches I&#39;ve had, but 5 stars for the breakfasts.

The sandwiches have been, by and large, disappointing. The bread has been soggy, the fries cold once and stale the other time, and the ingredients, not all that great.

So when I go here now, I get omelettes or skillets with pancakes. There&#39;s a giant sign on the front of the store that claims that Savory was nominated for best breakfast in Chicago. After eating there a few times, I believe it.

The eggs are always cooked to perfection, whether scrambled on the side or in the omelette. With skillets, the hash browns are cooked just right and crispy on the outside. The pancakes have the distinct tang of buttermilk. They use a good quality cheese and wonderfully fresh vegetables in the omelettes.

You may have to season some of the food yourself, but it&#39;s better for you to control that part of the dish, anyway.

Definitely visit Savory, and definitely stick with its strength: breakfast food."

We live in Barttlett and we hate fast food places, so we were happy to see Savuory open up.

After eating at Savoury on several occasions, I would say that it is good, but not great. We were unimpressed with the quality of dinner, but breakfast is good. The pancakes are particularly good. Too many restaurants serve tasteless dessicated disks and call them pancakes, but not Savoury. Their pancakes are very good.

The service leaves a little to be desired. It isn&#39;t necessarily bad, but it feels like the staff is just going through the motions and with little enthusiasm. I don&#39;t like a bunch of super fake happiness and flair either, but I am just not feeling appreciated.

The popularity of this place has grown over the years and they are always packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings when I like to go as well.

In summary, I will continue to go back for the pancakes, and keep my expectations low about the service."

For starters, it&#39;s always crazy busy on the weekends, but beyond that, I&#39;ve always had good experiences eating here. It maintains that family-owned restaurant feel by being just that- family owned. The service is great and I always see the same people working there. The breakfast is killer and the pancakes are some of the best I&#39;ve had. The reason I&#39;m giving this place four stars though is because their lunch pretty much sucks. Every sandwich I&#39;ve had here has been bland and dry. Granted, I&#39;ve only had a few so maybe I shouldn&#39;t rule the entire lunch here out. I&#39;ve had a pretty decent pulled pork sandwich though.
Overall, great staff and if you stick to the breakfast, you&#39;ll be fine."

They have there good days and bad days. Recently they have been having alot of bad days.. There veggie omlet has no taste to it- they need to spice it up more. Today I ordered scarambeled eggs and they came all watery- yuck!. Not what I expected. One thing they always have the menu that is tastey is their red velvet pancakes. I never had a bad experience with those. They need to step up their game with their eggs though.

About one minute after we sat down, our waitress came over and asked us if we were ready. Um, no we haven&#39;t evened opened the menu, so let&#39;s start w/coffee. Great. As soon as our coffee was served, we were asked if we were ready yet. So we placed our order, food was out in about 7 minutes, and our check was placed on our table before we were finished eating! She must have come back twice to ask if we were done or if we needed anything else. This happened BOTH times we were there.

I also tried the Gyro skillet which was surprisingly good, except not too sure if the feta cheese really worked too well with the combination. My comments on the coffee would have to be nothing because they dont really do anything too special, but nothing bad either.

The service was very inconsistent for me. I&#39;ve always gone on days where it has a nice handful of customers and I would either receive a lot of attention from our waitress or often be forgotten and have to wait an extra 15 minutes to get our check. Also when the busboy cleans up the dishes, I dont think he&#39;s aware that throwing the dishes ontop of each other makes a loud noise, because it becomes very loud and annoying."

I know I&#39;m picky, I&#39;ll be the first to admit it, but in this economy they should be a little more aware of their guests&#39; needs and be attentive.

Strike One:  October-ish.  Went there alone since my husband was out of town.  Was treated like an inconvenience by the host staff.  They were busy helping couples and families and didn&#39;t seem to want to even acknowledge that I walked in.   Food was good, but who cares about that when you don&#39;t feel welcome.

Strike Two:  December.  Decide to give it another shot, this time with my husband.  Again, FOH staff not that friendly - sorry we&#39;re inconveniencing you by asking for a table!  Water and tea refills really slow.  Breakfast okay, but again who cares when you don&#39;t feel welcome.

Strke three:  husband home sick.  I called to see what soups they had so I could place a take out order.  Person who answered phone tells me the soups of the day and literally hangs up - doesn&#39;t say &#39;thank you&#39;, &#39;would you like to place a take out order&#39;, &#39;screw you&#39;, NOTHING.

We ordered Appetizer for Two, Beef Salad (spicy), Ginger Chicken, Duck Curry (spicy). 

All of the apps were good, the Golden Triangle was interesting, and it was a new and different take on a spring roll. I&#39;m a lover of all things Crab Rangoon, and these managed to distinguish themselves from the dozens of others I&#39;ve had - in a great way. My crab Rangoon disliking companion even said they were &#34;ok.&#34; 

For the rest of our meal, our biggest issue would be that our spicy dishes... Weren&#39;t. I&#39;ve had places make a mild so spicy that I couldn&#39;t eat it (and I like spicy), and it may be that we&#39;re both fairly transparent.... But we didn&#39;t get spicy. You may have to ask for extra spicy if spicy is what you crave. 

For the Beef Salad, the beef was really good, warm, not cold, just too many red onions for me (I&#39;m not a fan). My Ginger Chicken was yum, and we loved the rice (and we are picky rice people). I sampled the Duck Curry (smelled amazing), and while I&#39;m not a curry person, it was good. I&#39;ll be back to order some of my own."

Had a couple apps while waiting for the ramen shop down the mall to open.

So I normally don&#39;t order satay because I&#39;ve had to many dry flavorless chicken strips. BUT this Chicken Satay here is really good!!! Nicely cooked, tender, and moist. Perfect! The peanut sauce is good to. Also had the shrimp egg rolls, pretty bland in texture and flavor. Stick with the Chicken Satay!!

=====================
8/29 Update

Had a couple different things today. Pot Stickers which were small but good. Thin wrapper &amp; a clean chicken flavor. TomYum again, damn those white mushrooms! Crazy Noodles had good flavor and the veggies were nice and crunchy. Drunken noodles was too strong for my liking and I could use the noodles a bit more browned. They were ok at best...

======================
Stopped in for a late lunch...

Started off with some Tom Yum soup. It had good oyster mushrooms, ginger, lemongrass, and white mushrooms. I have to say there is no place for white mushrooms in Thai food!! The broth was super good though, and the chicken was nice and tender! Just skip whitey next time...

Had the Pad Thai lunch special w/ spring roll. The spring rolls are not bad, some sprouts, a little fried tofu, &amp; a nice sauce. The Pad Thai had to much sugar in it for me &amp; was over sauced, many Thai spots over sweeten their meals, this is one such spot. Maybe with 1/2 the sauce in the Pad Thai it wouldn&#39;t be that bad. 

I know a lot of people like the sweetness but to me it is not what I look for in Thai cooking. 

We went off hours, the staff was very nice and we had great service. I will go back to try some of my other favorites and see how they are."

I&#39;ll never pre-judge a strip mall restaurant again. We were looking for lunch, read through the Yelp reviews and tried it out. The decor is ok, but the FOOD is why we will be coming back! We started with Thai Ice Teas (very good) and apps if Golden Triangle, Shrimp in a Blanket, and Soft Shell Crab. All apps were fried dishes, but they all had great flavor. By this, I mean even though they&#39;re fried, you still taste the ingredients--flavor in every bite! It&#39;s not like some places that taste like fried, greasy globs.

We then had two entrees: Yaki Soba w/tofu and Shrimp Panang. OMG!!!! The Shrimp Panang was the freshest, delicious curry I&#39;ve had in a long time. The Yaki Soba w/Tofu had crunchy veg and great flavor. We picked up a togo menu because I found a new favorite Thai place right in my own backyard!

The ingredients seemed to be of relatively low quality and/or overcooked and/or under-seasoned (and if you skimp on one of those, you gotta try to make it up elsewhere, folks). I sampled my wife&#39;s Pad Thai, and it was oddly simultaneously too sweet and lacking in flavor; and my Crazy Noodles weren&#39;t all that crazy...slightly irrational at best.

The crazy noodles&#39; flavor improved a bit after I doused them with two packets of soy sauce (notably, this was the first time that I&#39;ve had to apply flavor enhancers to food from a Thai restaurant), but I still wasn&#39;t at all tempted to down the entire dish in one sitting. (My digestive system did thank me for that.)

I will say, however, that the flavor of my food improved overnight after the morsels had time to absorb the sodium sauce. But my wife&#39;s Pad Thai did not fare quite as well. I consider her to be rather a connoisseur of the dish -- and in her words after finishing her leftovers: &#34;This may be the worst Pad Thai I&#39;ve ever eaten.&#34; Sorry, but I&#39;m just going to have to conclude my review on that note.

Got the Panang curry with vegetables and tofu and was very satisfied.  Compared to some other places where they give you a giant bowl of food that could last for days, the portion size here might be considered a bit &#34;small.&#34;  However, I was personally very happy with the reasonable size of the food.  It was just enough where I could ALMOST, but not entirely, finish it, and even though the bowl was smaller than average, there was plenty of tofu and vegetables... unlike those places that give you four tiny pieces of tofu floating around in a giant pool of curry sauce.  The Panang curry here could have stood to be spicier, but it was very flavorful and hit the spot.

The amazing $7 lunch special also included a soup, choice of egg roll or spring roll, and rice.  You also get the all-important fortune cookie at the end.  All in all this was a satisfying lunch choice, and I&#39;ll be sure to stop back in now and again."

We ordered the Pineapple Shrimp Curry (comes with rice), Pad Thai with shrimp, and Crag Rangoon.  The total was $29.  Everything was amazing!  I highly recommend the Pineapple Shrimp Curry - the curry is perfect.  Not overwhelmingly sweet with coconut and pineapple and has excellent spice without being too salty.  All that we wished for was more rice!  We had a bunch of leftover curry that we just made rice at home to eat the leftovers with. 

The Pad Thai with shrimp was good!  I have to say that I was surprised at how good the shrimp was.  The Pad Thai was not the best that I&#39;ve had because it was a little under seasoned, however I did end up eating all of it with a little added spice. 

The Crag Rangoon is another high recommendation.  They are a little smaller, crispy, and perfect tasting.  It isn&#39;t just all cream cheese like some places.  

This place is located in the corner of a strip mall so it can be hard to miss, but I will be returning soon! :)"

For the price we paid, not impressed at all.  Only 1 person out of 3 liked their dish which was a curry and duck dish.

Not a fan of ground chicken in dishes so they threw in some regular pieces... because I was ready to ditch it when I saw that in there.

I had asked if they had crazy noodles as well on the call made 5 min before I pulled into the lot... not sure if it was lost in translation... seemed like it was not an option.  Am I rambling?  

Point being, the configuration of these mainstays of Thai for me were unexpected and somewhat unappealing. The taste of the beef was mediocre at best... the drunken noodles were ridic salty.

Standard $9 per entree is not that great a price and had more noodles than medicore beef or bland chicken, more onions and tiny mushy broccoli... I would have given this place another try until I noticed the shallow takeout container deal.

Tucked back into a small strip mall flanked by a liquor store and Subway, it isn&#39;t difficult to discern that Thai Cuisine is probably in one of the most precarious locations they could have possibly drawn out of a hat. Though being more out of the way than Florida on a road trip to Philadelphia from Maine, the trip, on both counts, is justified solely for the food. 

Walking in, we were quickly greeted and shown to a small table with a window offering us a complete vista view of the entrance to the adjacent liquor store. While my wife and I made small talk, we were quickly brought our drinks and ordered an appetizer round of Crab Rangoon as we quietly deliberated on what exactly we were going to have for our main course of lunch. It didn&#39;t take long before we both spied our favorite dish, Pad See-Eiw (spelling per the restaurant). 

The Crab Rangoon was absolutely stellar. In that first solitary moment of sampling, memories of lesser Rangoons attempted to flood my brain in hopes of begging to be compared only to be slaughtered with ninja-like precision of the deliciousness that had just been sampled. The mixture of cream cheese and crab meat, which may have been imitation but I realistically could tell (as it should be), was positively delightful. It was like taking a time machine back to the discovery of the dish and being amazed along with the person who created it, staggered by the flavorful creation their impeccable genius had just birthed. 

All six went down without a word being exchanged between my wife and I. They were so sweet and just downright perfect it was like unicorn tears had been imbued into the very appetizer. The fact that they were just the right price only made it all the sweeter, but I can&#39;t recommend these enough. Appetizer or not, they&#39;re downright fantastic.

It wasn&#39;t long before the emptied plate was cleared to make room for the main attraction. Our Pad See-Eiw arrived out of the kitchen steaming with all the fervor of a bear&#39;s breath in the Siberian winter. The smell drifted up mercilessly, staggering us both as the sumptuous smell of dark soy sauce, broccoli, shrimp and egg mixed to create an amalgamated flavor Odin himself would have enjoyed from the halls of Valhalla. It was then we tried our dishes and, god or man, it was perfect.

The noodles, saccharine with taste, just about melted against the egg and broccoli creating something that even now I can still savor in the back of my mind. The shrimp, tails removed and simmered to faultlessness was a spot-on accoutrement to the meal. I&#39;m infinitely happy I opted to have them added to the dish. Hungrily, we ate while trying to enjoy every last bit. My only regret is that eventually my plate was empty. 

My wife, equally enthralled, enjoyed her dish silently. The only communication that ever went between us were nods of approval, punctuated by sips of our drinks. This meal contented us both so completely that we were quieted into docile, absolute enjoyment of our lunch. It was one of few culinary moments I can qualitatively state, was impeccable.

As we received our bill, we were shocked by the cost. Not because it was high, no. On the contrary, it was so low. Considering everything we&#39;d ordered and just how overall pleased we were at that point, my lingering expectation of a pricey bill was cast aside quickly. We settled our bill and began making our way home for a nap, happier than a pair of pigs in mud."

The Thai coffee was also addicting...I had the Beef Pad Thai, and it wasn&#39;t too bad at all.  The hostess/waitress was friendly and I asked her about how it was cooked and she answered promptly.

Still good food, in fact the chicken pad thai I enjoyed for lunch today was some of the best I have had in awhile.  It&#39;s really the definition of &#34;a hole in the wall&#34; - not much atmosphere, but the food is good AND cheap! And... unlike many Thai places that give you what appears to be a lot of food on a very small platter (so when you mix in the peanuts and extras, half of it ends up on the table!), this restaurant gives you a decent sized platter with just as large a portion so you can mix it and enjoy your meal on the plate - and NOT on the table!"

Appetizer option was either a healthy spring roll or if you&#39;re craving for crunch and grease, the egg roll. Most of the lunch item menus are about $7. I ordered the chicken pad thai, that was ok but seems to veer on the sweeter side. I think the one positive was after eating, you don&#39;t feel like taking a nap."

Since moving to Palatine, I have been searching for a Thai restaurant that could be my go-to staple. Unfortunately, the town&#39;s selection isn&#39;t the best. I gave Thai Cuisine a try after trying the other local joints. Thank goodness for Thai Cuisine. My boyfriend and I ordered the Spicy Beef and Green Curry and pork egg rolls for take out. The order was ready in 10-15 minutes. The portions were great. I requested the Green Curry be made extra spicy, and believe me, they did not disappoint!  In addition, they use fresh vegetables (yay!) and not canned or frozen vegetables like they do at another palatine thai restaurant (really?!). They also gave us sides of hot sauce and sweet and sour. The egg rolls were made just right. Not to  greasy and just the perfect amount of crispiness.  I did not have any of the Spicy Beef but my boyfriend stated it was okay. 

I will defiantly be returning to Thai Cusine. The prices are right on par with most of the other local Thai restaurants (between 9-13 for a dinner)."

If you like spicy, thick noodles with vegetable dishes try the crazy noodle; you can add tofu, chicken or beef for the regular dish price. 

I also recommend the Pad Thai Fried Rice with tofu; it&#39;s one of my favorites. The crab rangoon is good too.

I can&#39;t go to this place and not have some Thai iced tea. It is my favorite drink at Thai places that offer it, and it&#39;s delicious here!

Rice was dry and taste mediocre.  Spring roll taste like cat.

I think the uncleanliness also exacerbated my dislike.  They have white table cloths that are so old and filthy!  The food stains dripping down were very distracting.  They are also covered by a piece of glass so there is also a lot of food stuck up under it.  

They need to take each of those filthy table clothes off and burn them.  If you were going to have white table cloths at a greasy spoon....WASH THEM ONCE EVERY 10 YEARS!

I had the crab Rangoon to start and it was definitely pleasing. Perfect sized morsels of crab and cream cheese stuffed inside of thin wrapping deep fried until it is hot and crispy. Perfect filling to wrapper ratio with the great dipping sauce. I moved on to my benchmark Thai dish of basil chicken. While it wasn&#39;t the absolute top version I have ever had it definitely earned its place in the top 5. Great spice mixed with the salty sweet sauce served with fresh vegetables and a side of hot rice. Nothing is better. I also tried their Thai iced tea, and it didn&#39;t disappoint either. I&#39;m not a tea fan but for some reason the mahogany color and down right woody flavor of the tea mixed with milk and severed over cold ice is the perfect accompaniment to an overall superb meal

There is only one other place that can touch their green curry sauce, and that place is in Evanston. Must try the Tom Yum, and/or the soft shell crab. Also, those 2 cannot be touched by competition.

Since I&#39;m from Barrington, I go here every time I&#39;m in back in town. Even though I&#39;m not a regular, each and every time, I feel at home. The bartenders are awesome. The drinks are cheap. Even their food is good (try their grilled cheese). It&#39;s a great place to hang out in Barrington on a Friday night. Thankfully, it&#39;s not a shabby, sketchy bar in town where old men would hang any more. It definitely gained back it&#39;s reputation from over the years.

I started coming here after I graduated college. It&#39;s definitely an interesting crowd. It&#39;s mainly middle aged to older townies looking to grab a drink with neighborhood friends. Then, mixed in, you have the young crowd who come back from college. 

The vibe, overall, is really what you make of it. Whether you&#39;re here for a drink or two to grab a drink or two with a friend or play darts with a group of people, there&#39;s really something for everyone. There&#39;s a jukebox to the side to jam out on a Friday night and a gigantic Jenga that&#39;s always fun to play tipsy. Just fair warning, if you&#39;re a townie like myself, you will probably ALWAYS run into someone you know."

I remember being dragged in here once by my father when I was a boy. Probably so he could pay a off a gambling debt and/or knock back a quick shot. It was pitch black in there, as it was only lit by the red glow of an old neon beer sign. This was the kind of bar that people hid away in, a real salty old dive. Those days are gone. 
 The Yankee Doodle is a fun, small pub serving up a surprisingly good craft beer list. The bartenders are kind, knowledgable, and on the ball. The staff is also not shy with a stiff pour in a cocktail. The interior is almost exactly the same as it has always been, except the lights are on and you are not afraid to touch things.  
 So maybe before taking the train downtown to catch a Cubbies game, or commuting home from a rough day at work, or doing one of the kick ass train-stop-bar-crawls, stop in to this old Barrington watering hole and slam a beer or two in Dads honor."

It is sort of hidden in what seems like a mini strip mall in the back corner of the building, adjacent to the Barrington Metra train station parking lot. 

It is a divey bar and not very spacious. They have jukebox and fireplace (but it wasn&#39;t on, which would have been great considering it was such a cold night). Washrooms (at the least the women&#39;s) were not very clean. The patrons consisted of both a younger crowed (20&#39;s &amp; 30&#39;s) and older adults; it was probably a 60/40 ratio.

The beer selection was decent. It&#39;s getting to the point where I&#39;ve tried so many beers that not every bar has ones that I have not had yet, but Yankee Doodle did have a few. I can&#39;t remember which beer I ordered, but it was new to me and a special of the day. 

The thing that irked me about this bar was the bartender. She was plain rude. I told her nicely I needed a minute to decide on a beer and when I was ready to order, I looked her right in the eyes, we made eye contact, yet she still walked away &amp; basically ignored me. I continued to look up and right at her, an obvious signal that I&#39;m ready to order. She even took the order of a guy standing next to me, even though I had been standing there before him. I gave up and had one of the guys I was with order for me. Surprise, surprise, she waited on him. Seems like she picks the males to wait on, maybe in hopes of getting a better tip. Luckily, there was also another older male bartender behind the bar, so for the next round, I ordered through him.

Another thing that tainted my impression of this bar was during the last few minutes before the bar closed. The bartenders announced that if everyone wasn&#39;t finished with their drinks by time the exact closing time came around, they would collect the drinks regardless if you were finished or not. I&#39;ve actually experienced this at one other bar, but it seems these people enforced the rule more so. I understand the bartenders probably wanted to get out of there as any employee usually does at the end of a shift, but you have to understand it&#39;s a bar! It&#39;s one thing to keep announcing that the place would be closing soon or that everyone needs to get out (after the closing time). I&#39;ve seen many bars do that, otherwise they would have belligerent drinkers sit around all night, but to take paid drinks away is plain rude, in my opinion. 

I really can&#39;t see myself ever returning to this bar, mostly because of the rude service. I&#39;d rather drive to another town than to go here again, even though it&#39;s probably one of the closest bars to my house."

They also have lunch and dinner items like sandwiches, salads, soups, etc. I was in the mood for breakfast, so I ordered a skillet with pancakes (the pancakes came with it). On that note, you get a TON of food for how cheap it is. My friend ordered crepes, and it came out as pancakes. They were very understanding and replaced them right away. Overall the food was good.

I had a veggie wrap and it was great.  Lots of fresh spinach, broccoli, shrooms, tomatoes, onions, a bit of cheese and just enough Ranch to hold it all together.  It was delish.  The fries that came with it (I could of ordered fruit for the same price but come on who picks fruit over fries!) were fresh and hot.  My dining buddy opted for two over easy eggs and yep, instead of two her big ass plate had four eggs!

Waitress was good.  This is not fine dining.  The carpet could probably use a good steam cleaning but our plates and flatware were all clean.  It&#39;s a pretty large restaurant so they can accommodate lots of folks even during busy times.

I called in 40 minutes ahead and had to emphasize a small. They didn&#39;t ask for my name.

We arrived and my +1 put in his order. I got my pancake when his soup came out (fine by me!).

Sooo... is it SUPPOSED to be eggy on the inside? It looked crispy/overdone on the outside and seemed WAY undercooked inside. It was completely dense and eggy. Not sure what part was supposed to resemble a pancake.. or even a cake.

Needless to say I had a little bit, but it wasn&#39;t very palletable: the eggy batter melded with the apples.. it seemed half cooked and the texture was almost custard-like. I took leftovers home, so I hope it&#39;ll be better with a second nuke in the oven. (Note: the texture slightly improved after another 40 minutes in the oven, but it was still unpalletable with NO flavor. Tossed it.) I can&#39;t believe we paid $10 for that thing.

Our server seemed really awesome at first, but she ended up being very inattentive. She never asked us about condiments and coffee refills and of course by the time we remembered to ask her for some, she was nowhere to be found (for looong periods of time). She gave us To Go boxes, but our check didn&#39;t come for well over 10 minutes afterward. And, sheyut, we were hell-bent on getting a second coffee refill, so that came after we finally got our check.

The girl ringing out the checks was nice and personable, so that was a plus.

For less than $10, I can get a delicious homemade sandwich that is a generous size, fries (or fruit) coleslaw, pickle AND soup! Other places offer a lame sandwich and a bag of chips for the same price, how can you compare?!

Generally superior to the big chains like Denny&#39;s, or IHOP the menu&#39;s are usually very similar even if the food isn&#39;t. One Sunday morning I was out searching for a new place to grab breakfast and came across Bentley&#39;s. I decided to stop in and was very promptly seated and handed a menu.

The inside was fairly spacious with lots of tables set up. It&#39;s one of the larger pancake houses I&#39;ve seen in terms of sheer floorspace. After looking over the menu I decided to try the polish skillet. The skillet I received had some nice pieces of polish sausage in it. Some white mostly unseasoned and flavorless potato mush at the bottom. Cheese, eggs and green peppers in it. The quality of the sausage was excellent, as was the cheese but there wasn&#39;t a lot of other flavors working here. There wasn&#39;t that much egg, and as mentioned the potato at the bottom was bland. 

With my skillet I had an option of pancakes or toast. The pancakes here were perfectly acceptable, but nothing super impressive. Service was speedy, though a bit impersonal and I was left with a decent meal, but I wasn&#39;t that impressed either. Overall I&#39;d say Bentley&#39;s is an average pancake house and award it three stars. If you&#39;re nearby and hungry you won&#39;t be disappointed. But it&#39;s not worth going out of your way to visit here either."

A lifetime of pancake houses, and I have never seen this on a menu.  So logical, but never seen before:  With the omelet you have two choices.  Potatoes or fruit.  And then the standards - rye toast, wheat toast, white toast, pancakes, or - what&#39;s this? -  FRENCH TOAST.  I have never had that option.  What a great idea.

Two half slices of French toast with my omelet.  Not a stack of huge pancakes.  But a couple pieces of really tasty French toast.  Why doesn&#39;t everyone offer this?

Service was excellent, the coffees and waters were regularly refilled, and everything else was a good pancake house experience.  But every time I order an omelet henceforth I&#39;ll be thinking about having French toast with it."

I enjoy a chicken breast on a croissant with soup. Usually a chicken soup is available and I am a happy girl. The restaurant is clean and bright. 

Sadly their wait staff leaves something to be desired. On our most recent visit, my iced tea glass was empty the entire time that I had food in front of me. Our waitress disappeared multiple times (smoke breaks???) and the owner/manager kept looking at me, but never once made his way to the table.

This place is bigger than the Wood Dale location and they were packed for brunch on Sunday.  There was about a 1/2 hour wait for a table.  It was worth it, though.

Yeah, Big loser &#34;L&#34; on my forehead. Boooo! 

Anywho, I love this Bentleys! It&#39;s busy, especially on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Snagging a seat at the counter is easy on those busy mornings but just be warned, the cacophony of plates clashing at the busboy station and server to cook conversation behind the counter might upset you if you&#39;re looking for a quiet morning. 

There&#39;s a huge breakfast and lunch menu but I&#39;ve always gone for the breakfast no matter the time of day. Portions are huge and everything is very fresh. This weekend I tried the veggie skillet for the first time and it was really tasty. The veggies were crisp-tender which to me is perfect cuz I am not a fan of soggy veggies. 

I&#39;ve had different breakfast items from the Benedict&#39;s to omelets to pancakes/french toast and have never been disappointed. Nothing too, too inventive on the menu--basic breakfasts, but they do not disappoint. A big plus is the single-serving of flavored creamers (International delight) on the table. Coffee is hot and strong and plentiful--service is friendly and fast. I guess we&#39;re regulars because when the servers remember that I like regular coffee and hubsbie likes his milk served with his breakfast and not before--wow, those things make breakfast a little special."

It looked fairly busy but we were seated along with another couple right away who sat down at the table next to us.  My husband and I both ordered omelettes with toast/pancakes and hash browns.  The couple next to us ordered a little before we did and the table behind us (family of 4) ordered just after us.  We waited for a very long time and both tables beside us and behind us got their food (not simple omelettes) before we got ours.  Our waitress said ours would be out shortly and after 10-15 minutes did we finally get our omelettes served by a younger man in a dress shirt.  My husband asked him for ketchup, hot sauce and syrup and he said he would be right back.  After about 15-20 minutes of us pushing our food back and forth on our plates, our waitress comes up to us and asked if we wanted boxes.  I said no, we&#39;re still waiting for someone to bring syrup, ketchup and hot sauce.  By that time everyone around us had already finished their meals and were about to head out.  She came back, apologized and thanked us for our patience.  Something tells me she could tell I wanted to go off on her but I held my composure.  Quite a talent I must have.

When I sat down and looked at the menu, I noticed a lot of choices - but what jumped out at me was a chopped Greek salad.  I LOVE Greek salad, but sometimes it is annoying to eat because what you get is a salad with tons of huge ingredients on top that you then have to take off the salad and cut into pieces.  I asked the waitress how it was and she told me &#34;excellent&#34;.  So I went with her recommendation and ordered up the salad with some chicken noodle soup.  The salad was the best Greek salad that I have ever had with all of the classic Greek salad ingredients: cucumbers, feta cheese, Greek olives, peppers all chopped into bite sized pieces.

We came in from downtown Chicago for business via Uber and checked into the Holiday Express at 3PM and there was no place walking distance to eat so we had no choice but to order something for delivery. We were very hungry and had an event to attend later so we both needed to eat. I tried one pizza place and they didn&#39;t open till 4PM and the owner told me that if I ordered he&#39;d have it to us by 430PM but were so hungry that I said no thank you and looked for the next option which was a big mistake. 

I ordered a Veggie Double Dough Pizza and they told me 45 min to an hour so that was no problem. They still hadn&#39;t arrived 90 minutes later, so I called them back and the lady who took my call could not find a record of my order. I had paid by credit card so I thought maybe it was the other place. I called the first option and asked if they opened at 4PM was told yes so I called Pizza Bella again and the lady told me that the pizza went out 9 minutes ago. Felling frustrated, my reply was &#34;that&#39;s a long 45 min to an hour.&#34; A few minutes later a knock came at the door and it was the pizza.

We opened the pizza box and it was very hot, too hot to pick up so we knew this thing just came out of the oven. Then it was terrible. The dough was over cooked and the topping fell off every piece we tried to pick up. What we did manage to eat was bland and next to tasteless. What a huge disappointment. I told my friend the story of Ohio State Pizza being so bad I could only eat one bite, which I may have spit out. My friend said that he&#39;s had better cheap frozen pizzas. With this &#34;double dough&#34; pizza all I really ate were the toppings. I think we had two pieces each. We would have been better off with the vending machine snacks in all honesty. 

For being in the Chicago region I had no idea pizza could be so bad and the service wasn&#39;t any better. I guess we&#39;re just spoiled living in the city. 

When I posted our experience on Facebook the next day my friends comment was &#34;And the idiocy of their poor service - just ....wow&#34;.

Terrible experience with Pizza Bella. It&#39;s too bad."

We ordered an XL Hawaiian pizza with Pizza Bella the other night and WOW. It was covered in pineapple and Canadian bacon with the perfect amount of BBQ sauce. What is with the other pizza places thinking that we want 5 little pieces of pineapple? It was the most delicious Hawaiian pizza I have ever had. 

Also, the girl working the phone was an absolute delight and made the experience THAT much better. I wish I had gotten her name (Wednesday night last week). She was so sweet and patient and actually knew about customer service, what do ya know! 

I also got the Caprese salad, which was very fresh and delicious. Being Italian, I make this salad on the regular and I appreciate your twist putting cucumber in it. Keeps it fresh although next time I will probably keep it just with tomato and mozzarella. 

Overall this place is beautiful and wonderful. Next time I&#39;ll try the pasta. Thank you!"

I took a leap of faith and ordered the entire meal from Pizza Bella.  We are Italian and take our food seriously, especially where we go for Italian food.  Well, the food was amazing!  Eggplant Parmigiana was delicious, green beans were scrumptious not over cooked or soggy and were in a delicious marinade. Sausage and peppers, same thing - amazing :) Chopped salad was yummy and oh my goodness their chocolate cake, delectable. I wasn&#39;t remotely ashamed about not cooking, PB handled it for me and the entire family was thrilled.
Thank you Pizza Bella for a homemade Christmas Eve meal that was delicious. Happy New Year ! See you soon:)"

They wrap the crust around a thin layer of cheese, gives it a stuffed crust feel. Cheese has an assortment of spices (rosemary and oregano, I think?) that gives it a distinctive taste. It was nice for a fast lunch! Also came with a soda.

Folks were friendly, service was fast- good experience, all in all."

so we ordered that exact pizza. Boy what a difference from the menu picture to the actual pizza. The actual pizza looked like it was overcooked and deflated   I have to admit it tasted okay. But.

We ordered on a Saturday night about 6 pm.  Ordered online and made special notes about minor modifications to the items we ordered.  Large chopped salad with both olives and pepperoncini on the side and both the Italian and Creamy Garlic dressing, 10 regular Teriyaki wings and 10 &#34;breaded&#34; Hot (Mild) wings with blue cheese dressing and celery.  Affordably priced and, for a Saturday night the wait would be 1 1/2 hours.  We are in the &#34;red&#34; zone for delivery so there was an additional $3 charge.  To be honest, all of this was fine as long as we didn&#39;t need to leave the house! :)

When the order arrived in 1 hour 15 minutes, the wings were hot, (we received 10 teriyaki and 12 hot) the salad was cold and finely chopped and all but the celery were packaged nicely.  In fact, the celery was missing and we never received it.  A little disappointing because I love the celery when I&#39;m eating wings, but I did without.  Plenty of dressings included, both with salad and wings.  Incidentally, large Chopped Salad was more than enough to serve two people a good size entree salad.  The Creamy Garlic dressing was UH-mazing combined with the house Italian (kind of like a think Balsamic Vinaigrette).  Absolutely delicious.  When I ordered the breaded wings, I assumed they were boneless.  THEY ARE NOT.  They are simply regular, bone-in wings tossed in a small amount of breading then deep fried - not bad, per se, just not what one comes to expect when one reads &#34;breaded&#34; wings on the menu. Not bad, mind you.  Just not necessary to our tastes.

All in all, great wings delivered, even to us in the &#34;red&#34; zone, hot and crispy.  The Chopped Salad will be a new favorite with the Creamy Garlic and the Teriyaki wings will be in our next order. Both are really, really good.  I&#39;m very excited about this restaurant and we will definitely order again.  

***Four stars is only because the celery was missing.***"

I ain&#39;t kidding... they do not fit in the styrofoam box they&#39;re served in and the weight of the slice literally destroys the thing. EPIC.

I made the mistake of ordering two slices, thinking I was gonna chow down... I did, don&#39;t get me wrong but I could barely finish the first slice. I painfully opened the box to the second piece of pie and mustered all the strength I could to rip a piece off and get it to my mouth even though I was ready to puke.

The crust is stuffed with mozzarella and it is a hefty crust to begin with... it&#39;s so thick and so heavy. Nice bready taste. They fold this f%$#er over on itself for half the radius and it&#39;s all cheese inside. Nom nom nom. cheese... bread... need extra sauce for dipping... nom nom nom.

The meats were nothing to write about but they were accordingly plentiful on the meatlovers.

You could feed 2 or 3 normal eaters on one slice for sure.

The overall pie is meh... better than GIANT SKEEZERS or TRIOMINOES or MAMA JUANITA&#39;S or even JABBA THE HUT for sure, and the stuffed crust and sheer size are winners.

For a slice under five bucks thats about as hefty as a medium pie anywhere else PLUS a free soda... They got the best game in town."

We tried this well-reviewed pizza place because they&#39;re one of a few places that offers a gluten-free option. 
However, I soon learned that gluten-free comes with a hefty price tag of nearly $20 for a small w/ 1 topping (yikes).

Was it good? Oh yeah. Good crust. The cheese wasn&#39;t overly greasy. 
My wife couldn&#39;t tell that it was gluten-free! A win!

We also ordered a small 1-topping sausage for my son and I.
The sausage was outstanding. The pizza was also pretty good. 

For 2 small pizzas and it being nearly $40 was a bit expensive for my blood but a good pair of pies overall."

Wings were very dry. I didn&#39;t realize wings could be that dry. We didn&#39;t even finish them and we always finish our wings when we get them at restaurants. Pizza was too doughy and undercooked.

You should know what you like, what you are attracted to and what is good for you, but sometimes on your path to the best (pizza in Europe, for example) you slum it.  

You KNOW that you should pass the pizza-per-slice place with no one in it, but you could eat a slice and still walk, so convenience beats taste.  You KNOW you could buy the ingredients at the market down the street and use the pizza stone that is gathering dust in your cupboard, but laziness beats... well, most things. 

For the simple combination of dough, sauce, cheese and toppings, the endless choices and risks are substantial.  So, it was with great hopes and slothful expectations that I called Pizza Bella when the pizza craving hit the other night.

Uh oh, strike one: we live .7 miles away and are somehow outside of their typical delivery range, which means an additional fee.  Baffling and off-putting, I continued.

After that, some balls and fouls (to continue the baseball metaphor): 53 minutes for delivery, but $30 for a salad and an extra large pizza with toppings.

Then, it came.  The food was very good and hot.  The delivery man was polite and pleasant in that oh-most-pizza-delivery-guys-are-pock-marked-17-year-olds-or-scary-middle-aged-gentlemen-and-you-are-neither-of-those way.

We did delivery.  The food arrived hot and the driver, although lacking a touch of common sense (called me to tell me he was outside but my doorbell looked broken... I advised him to KNOCK and I then I would have known he was standing out there), was a pleasant enough teenager with manners (and even thanked us for the tip we gave him).

I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich.  It was large, flavorful and had more than enough cheese on it.  The red sauce makes me want to try their pastas next.  I added fries to make it a combo.  They, too, were hot but weren&#39;t anything worth writing home about.

My husband ordered the buffalo chicken wrap.  He was concerned that it would come and not be big enough for him but, was pleasantly surprised by its size upon arrival.  The woman who took our order over the phone advised it was made with their inferno sauce and made sure that was OK.  Typically, nothing is spicy enough for him but, he actually had said this was HOT!  He also made his a combo w/ onion rings and those were MUCH more pleasing to the pallet.  They were large, both in size and portion, and were battered not breaded, which is how we both prefer them.  I was jealous I didn&#39;t get the onion rings, instead!

We also ordered two appetizers.  
The fried mac &#39;n cheese bites, which were also hot &amp; fresh, not soggy like many fried foods are when you order them via delivery.
The stuffed artichoke was very greasy and just didn&#39;t do it for me.  Then again, I have yet to find a single restaurant who serves one that I like.  Maybe I need to get over the fantasy of finding one that should taste the way I imagine it should?!

The only turn off was that no salt, pepper, ketchup, utensils nor napkins was included in our delivery which, in my opinion, should be standard.

Overall, we enjoyed dinner and will be back to try more of their items!"

Pizza Bella is our favorite carry out place. I only wish they were open before 4pm on Sunday to order pizza for football season!

Someone in the kitchen must have mis-read &#34;easy&#34; for &#34;extra&#34; -- layer of cheese was a half inch thick and there was so much sauce that the edges didn&#39;t even form a crust.  Brutal!  It seriously looked like my 5 year old dressed this pizza.  Guess the Friday night cook is better than the Saturday night cook?!

The sausage was very good and the spinach and mushrooms a lot tastier than at most pizza joints. We also liked the sauce and crust (parts).

First off the food.  I loved the fact that they small deli-like area with fresh cold cuts and cheese just waiting to be sliced for each customer!

That was great.  

Now on to the but... When management forgets that they have other customers and loudly handle rude customers its a huge distraction.  While there a group of teens were doing some horseplaying, the guy behind the counter (which I am assuming was a manager) screamed over &#34;not in here - this is not the gym.&#34;  At that point the teens looked embarrassed, put their heads down and giggled.  He then screams... &#34;Keep that in the gym at school!&#34;  All I was thinking was, &#34;sheesh it was over and you&#39;re giving me a headache with your yelling.&#34;  

It was also freezing cold in their.  Don&#39;t get me wrong it was raining, so being a little wet may have played a part, but when i rub my arms and says sheesh... and an employee chimes in and says.. I know its cold in here right, Im like come on!

They have their ingredients in a deli case and when you order, they actually cut your meat right in front of you. LOOOOOOOVE IT!!! I hate Subway and places like that for that exact reason. Good call, JM&#39;s! You earned my business on that factor alone.

The bread is soft and fresh. They could probably stand to use a more &#34;durable&#34; type of bread seeing as they pile on the ingredients. I tried the turkey sandwich with lotsa pickles, lettuce and tomato along with all the seasonings and some oil and vinegar. It was quite yummy. Fresh and filling. I only ate a half which is why I probably should have ordered their smallest sandwich. Note to self for next time.

Freshly sliced in front of your face meats are a plus, and veggies look and taste fine.

Reminds me of Jersey, but not quite the same.  Biggest difference is size and price.  At most &#34;mom &amp; pop&#34; sub shops in NJ you get a larger sub at a smaller price.

But while here, get it Mike&#39;s way...he won&#39;t do you wrong."

In fact not too far from where this chain got its start at the Jersey Shore. New Jersey is the home of the sub and no one can quite compete. The bread is always soft inside, but crusty on the outside. The meats and cheeses are piled on. Vegetables top the meat, then always, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and oregano.

When you leave New Jersey, the further away you get, the more it all seems to change. First, the bread loses its crust. The weight of the meats and cheeses decline. It just never seems the same.

I admit, I never went to a Jersey Mike&#39;s in NJ. Perhaps when you are in the state where people expect their subs to be made a certain way, they do. But, I have been to Jersey Mike&#39;s in a few states and my impression has been consistent. While the sandwiches are good, they are not Jersey subs.

First, the bread is large and soft - like a large hot dog bun. I say large because they are very bready. I guess bread is cheaper than meat. So, there is less meat that you would get on a real Jersey sub. The vegetables are fine. And, if you get it made &#34;Mike&#39;s way&#34;, the oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and oregano are all added. But, they do ask you if you want mayo too. To a New Jerseyan, asking that question is sacrilegious.

There are a lot of places to get subs in and around Chicago, and many are chains - Jimmy Johns, Subway and Quiznos for example. While none of these are indicative of a real New Jersey sub sandwich either, their prices are better."

Anyway, a coworker told me that they recently opened, they were packed with people and they had excellent Subs. That made me want to try them.
Ordered &#34;The Original Italian&#34; and &#34;The Club Supreme&#34;. Here is my take on the sandwiches.......
The Italian one, not so hot. The meat and cheese was sliced so thin, I could not really distinguish what they were through all of the lettuce, tomato, and vinegar dressing. I thought that the bread was not Italian enough for me either. I like a crusty bread for an Italian sub and this one was too soft crusted for my liking. The sandwich itself was a messy one. The dressing is definitely applied in liberal amounts as attested by the leakage all over the bag. I was not too impressed with this one.

The Club Supreme was a much better sandwich. It too was messy, but had a much better flavor. I could taste the turkey and the bacon on it.
Bottom line is that in my humble opinion, this is a chain and you can always get better when you go to an independent place for just about anything once you find the right one.

I do not go to any of the sub chains, but thought I would try out this one. OK, I tried it. However, I will stick to other choices, such as Serino&#39;s or Alpine or Al + Joe&#39;s. They are the real deal. Especially with Italian Subs.

Total rating would be 2.5 stars. Since I can&#39;t rate like that, I will give them a 3 because the Club Sub was OK.

Cheers to All"

The employees are usually friendly and the meat, cheese, and vegetables are fresh. My only complaints would be that the sub rolls are often overbaked and the roast beef can be fatty or too rare. Otherwise, everything is pretty good. The free birthday sub (for Rewards Members) is a definite plus. It helps to offset the rising prices (regular subs are now above $7)."

Overall,a very good/tasty sub sandwich. The Club Supreme# 9 done &#34;Mikes Way&#34; with oil, mayo,bacon bits with tomato and lettuce/onion makes my mouth water. Meat is sliced in front of you and the line moved fairly fast on my visits here. Will go back soon"

Upon entry I didn&#39;t know what I wanted being it was my first time there and I was on lunch around 1:00pm. The young man asked what did I want and I stated I haven&#39;t made up my mind. Sarcastically he states, don&#39;t worry we&#39;re only open until 9. I let that slide because I figured that&#39;s just there culture. Once I made up my mind I went with the mini Turkey and again (I guess it&#39;s a joking atmosphere) I get the sarcasm saying we&#39;re out of Turkey. By now I just want to get my food and leave. Once I did get my sub I wasn&#39;t impressed. Mainly due to when I bit into it, the sandwich was ICE COLD. Now I understand...it&#39;s a cold sandwich meaning not heated but jeez! I swear I bit into ice! I had to heat it up in order to get some enjoyment. But if I wanted a heated sub I would have ordered one. The sandwich was just ok. I prefer Alpine&#39;s or Pot Belly&#39;s before Jersey Mikes."

But then about a month after they opened the sandwiches would taste different everytime.  Our last order (last as in we probably won&#39;t order again) had a blast of Oregano so strong that it ruined the sandwich.

Anyway, we did have a few good meals from here - but the last few weren&#39;t consistent."

Awesome choice, the smell made me even hungrier. Really friendly service and atmosphere. I asked the gentleman in front of me what was good. He literally said &#34;Everything is good here. I come at least twice a week&#39;

Then the sweet nice older man behind the counter was adorable. Who told me every Monday is half off pizza. 

We got a cheese and sausage pizza brick oven and 2 hot sandwiches.

Yum.... Definitely will be back.    ;-)

Since Mondays are half off pizzas, I ordered TWO (3 hours of hiking gives a girl an appetite, and I love leftovers)! My total was less than $10!

+ Veggie - 4/5
I really enjoyed the unique veggies and the tang from the sun dried tomatoes! I wish there were a few more veggies since it was a tad imbalanced: mostly eggplant and sun dried tomatoes.

+ Verde - 4/5
The three cheeses really lent some great flavor..I just wish it had a teensy bit more. The heaping topping of peppery arugula was so fresh!

The crust was delicious and chewy.

Of course I&#39;ll need to try more menu items, but as it stands I&#39;m a total fan of Serino&#39;s pizza! I just may be back next Monday to try some others!"

I also love their selection of sides that they have at the deli.

Lastly, they have a variety of drink selections to choose from.  You can&#39;t go wrong with this place as their food, drinks and service is by far superior to most places around the area.

Make sure you come early as it gets packed quickly."

Has potential, but the woman working tonight was less than friendly.....I explained I had never been there before and would need a minute to look at the menu. She proceeded to stand there and stare at me until I placed my order....I went with the American sub, yummy sandwich and I like that they put the mayo inside the meat so my bread didn&#39;t get soggy!

I live right down the street and have been in here at least a hundred times. I was thinking about this place as I was enjoying one of their delicious pizzas and it dawned on me that I had NEVER had anything from this place that was not excellent. Once again, NEVER.
  Always prompt service, always excellent sandwiches and pizza. Try the Serino panini, or Caprese, or the Italian sub, or anything they make. It&#39;s all good.
1/2 price pizza on Monday can&#39;t be beat. My fave is the Margherita.
A gem of a place.

The only real downside is if you go while they are busy, it is tough to find parking!

Ever since the Army Trail Rd. restructuring, the ONLY exit out is West!

Just an example, I got a sandwich on Monday but then my boss bought me lunch... So I saved it for Tuesday&#39;s lunch. When I opened my sandwich... My co-workers were like &#34;omg, where is that from?&#34; Once I told them... They jetted out to get subs for themselves. A day old sandwich still looked delicious and btw it was still amazing! 


The only reason I am giving 4 and not 5, is that some of the staff isn&#39;t exactly friendly. However, most of the girls are super nice."

They were pretty good, I wouldn&#39;t swing through again unless there were some sort of deal or coupon. 

I got the 12 inch Pesano sandwich, the bread was good but tough.

The muffuletta was decent but had a big chunk of olive pit that almost broke a tooth. 

The caprese salad was good but it&#39;s so basic I would be shocked if someone messed it up. 

Will maybe come back to try the pizzas as they look very authentic Italian."

I ordered the Sicilian Grilled Chicken wrap, which contains chicken, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato (I ordered without), roasted red peppers, jalapenos, and mayo.  It had to be one of the greatest wraps I&#39;ve had in a long time! So flavorful, and filling. And it was only $4.99, which was a steal. 

They have a large variety of sandwiches, paninis, and subs, and of course they also have pizza and pasta dishes. There&#39;s a deli where you can buy cheese, meats, and prepared salads (pasta, macaroni, etc). They also offer catering.

The food portions are very generous and the prices are extremely reasonable. I can&#39;t wait to visit again."

Menu item not as described! ~Grilled Chicken Caesar (Pita Wrap)

I ordered online and expected it as stated on the website.

The meat is actually not grilled chicken breast, but chicken lunchmeat. The romaine lettuce appeared to be standard shredded lettuce. There were no croutons and minimal tomatoes and olives. The green peppers were there. However, no cheese that I was aware of. And the dressing was very watery and more mayo-like than Caesar-like. 
I was disappointed and will not order from there again."

Topped with their Italian dressing these are wonderful sandwiches and a great value for the quality you get."
