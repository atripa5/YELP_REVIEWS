I have done brunch, lunch, dinner, ordered for pickup, had reservations, had to add ten people to my reservation, had to add four kids meals to my order. It didn&#39;t matter. They were great. The food is great, service is better, and the beer selection is incredible. Stop reading reviews. Go here."

Sometimes I feel like the food tastes amazing and on other days it&#39;s just kinda Meh.... bland. 
Tonight was one of those Meh moments. The salmon did not taste good and it was way to overcooked. The burgers are usually really good and some of their other main dishes. 
Just have to come try it and see for yourself. The music is super loud, so if you&#39;re bringing a date you will have to yell. I personally don&#39;t mind it. 
So far I have been here for Brunch, lunch and dinner.
Service has always been great for me. The drinks are tasty, strong and well priced. 
The 3 stars are solely for the food. I do love their &#34;build your own bloody marry&#34; bar during brunches on the weekend. It&#39;s definitely a hip place."

Service can be a little slow but over all, very friendly. We came in around 12:30 yesterday with a party of 5 and sat down around 1:00. I ordered off the brunch menu and had the Pupusas which were corn cakes with black beans, green chile, eggs, and cheese. It was pretty good. Hubs had the burrito which lacked the bacon it was supposed to have but our server brought him a side of it. My SIL had the french toast and really liked it. My nieces ordered some stuff off the kids menu and 2 homemade pop tarts. The pop tarts were good! The frosting is a bit sweet but they were served warm and I felt transported back to my childhood. I wish they came in more flavors than just blueberry!
Cheers for being very gluten free friendly and vegetarian friendly as well. 
I think the big draw here for brunch is their $2 bloody marys- I mean, wouldn&#39;t that get you in the door too?? The BM bar isn&#39;t super impressive (pickles, mix, a couple hot sauces, and some horseradish) but one can&#39;t be too picky when the price is right!"

I like the reviewer that described this restaurant as &#34;homey yet trendy,&#34; that&#39;s pretty spot on. Also, the food and drinks are delicious. Wonderful staff, too.

Everything I tried was amazing, even the aioli that came with the artichoke fritters, &amp; I am not an aioli fan. The fritters, which I expected to be kind of a breaded patty with minced artichoke, maybe some garlic, were simply artichoke pieces like you&#39;d buy in a can, but fried. &#39;From a can&#39; isn&#39;t a put down; frying them is a great twist, and they were yummy! I didn&#39;t know what to order so went with something I normally wouldn&#39;t get excited about, the breakfast burrito, a balanced mess of textures and flavors. I definitely ended up eating more than I meant to. The brat burger my friend ordered was gone in minutes, and the accompanying sweet potato fries were awesome, the perfect size to allow both softness and crispness. Later the next day, I had their bread pudding- no complaints about that either.

On a Saturday morning (11:00), there was no wait for brunch. This was a huge plus for me, as it&#39;s hard to find places without huge lines. It was very busy but is also a large place. Very reasonably priced. I was expecting to pay more than I did. 

My favorite aspect of The Hornet was the drink selection. Craft cocktails call my name, &amp; this place had tons. The hibiscus mojito was really good, but tasted almost like a regular mojito. I wish I had tried something else; their drinks are made with unique ingredients such as ginger liqueur, herbs like basil, lavender, sage, and mint, balsamic simple syrup, earl grey simple syrup, cream of coconut, &amp; jackelope pear gin.

This will become a staple for future visits to CO!"

The good: they were able to seat us fairly quickly on a Sunday morning at a very lovely outdoor patio.

Well I blame the Denver housing market for that. If I lived nearby, I&#39;d be a regular. They have a surprisingly diversified tap list of local to international brews. They have an excellent happy hour that includes food and drink specials. And their pierogis...hot damn those pierogis! Bacon, mushrooms, roasted peppers, onions, garlic, basil butter, asiago - they&#39;re not going to be mistaken for your grandfather&#39;s from the old country, but they are fantastic pierogis with a new world twist. Their pork taco is excellent too.

Chill, artsy kind of atmosphere with a small stage for live music makes the vibe enjoyable too. One of our favorite UMS venues. I always look forward to a trip to The Hornet."

Great open area, good vibe, and friendly &amp; attentive service. My sister and I split the turkey Brie panini with tomato soup dip and the Podunk pulled pork with sweet potato fries. The tomatoe basil soup dip was the winner of the evening - flavorful, creamy, not overly rich. The panini was standard though. The pulled pork bouton BBQ sauce was tangy and sweet with the right hint of bourbon. The onion strings made it. Be careful with the brioche bun - it might fall apart! The appetizer lettuce wraps are just the right amount of spicy... And everything comes separate for you to put together yourself."

This includes a time when you were able to smoke in the restaurant, and thankfully, that time is over.

My rating is based on this visit, as I firmly believe they have one of the better Bloody Mary bars around for a Brunch visit.  

In this case, it was for a large birthday party of about 20 people.  The Hornet is usually packed, so the fact they made this work, should give it an extra star (I originally put in three).  They were quick to accommodate us, frequently came by, and there were no issues at all with billing a huge amount of people.  From what I recall, nobody was billed wrong.

The food is hit or miss.  So look at the reviews.  I did not, and ended up with an okay Gangster.  A friend put it best saying, &#34;Looks like a wrap you get at King Soopers.&#34;  And the fries are just a-okay too.  But I saw some awesome looking Nachos out on the table (too far away to sneak) and the breakfast is always good.

So consider this long-lasting Denver site an endorsement, just do a little bit of research, and it may even be five stars."

Both my friend and I got the Dixie chicken, since the waitress had recommended it. The chicken was honestly like one big McDonald&#39;s chicken nugget.

Wrong..we hadn&#39;t hung out in awhile and with the casual, no rush atmosphere at the Hornet we just stayed there. Appetizers, drinks &amp; then a small meal. Our waitperson, Belinda, was a kick- funny, fun &amp; patient. 
Don&#39;t mean to make the food a side note. Everything was delicious.  I had lettuce wraps for my entree- so tasty.   And the pierogis were the perfect appetizer.

The locals said it was a great place to grab good food. We were seated quickly and within minutes had local brews on our table. Everyone was really impressed with their selections. 

I looked at the menu and had to do a double take. They have PUPUSAS. Hold the phone. That&#39;s right, El Salvadorian PUPUSAS. For those unlucky individuals who have never had an opportunity to try one before, they are little pockets of corn meal with meat, bean and/or cheese stuffing, topped with a bit of El Salvadorian cream. Delicious.  Upon my friend&#39;s recommendation, I ordered the honey fried steak. I asked if they could substitute a pupusa for the fries and they said no problem. Welcome to Denver- where everyone is laid back and rolls with it!

My food was awesome. The honey fried steak was crispy and sweet, not too much breading, and paired with a light gravy for dipping. The pupusa was soft and doughy with a crispy outside, covered with a mound of pulled beef. There was a side of succotash that was kicked up a notch with beans, tomatoes and some spices. 

My friends also loved what they ordered- a hummus plate, salmon salad, and more. The service was as great as the food, restaurant clean, and the staff friendly. We will definitely return on our next visit!"

However, if you are in the mood for something greasy the hornet is not a bad place to be.

We came here one night for happy hour and ended up staying for dinner. We ordered a variety of apps - all which were pretty good. The food came out surprisingly quick which was a nice surprise as the drinks took a little longer than expected. However, with that being said, it was happy hour and the bar was packed!

The biggest issue I had - and it wasn&#39;t in regards to our table - I watched an older gentleman sit and wait for over 10 minutes for a server to come and say hi and take his order. It was super sad and he ended up getting up and leaving. It wasn&#39;t that busy in our section so I was surprised this happened. It wasn&#39;t as big of an issue for us since we already had our food - but it was just tough to watch.

I&#39;m sure if we&#39;re in the area again and need a happy hour spot we would stop in; however this would not be my first choice."

They don&#39;t have a list of drinks on the menu and do have an alcohol menu on the table and give you a brunch menu. The longest part was waiting for our server but she was very friendly !!! We order drinks and food around  12 . Our drinks were delivered and we sat and looked around at the fun up beat ambiance. We were shocked to see our food arriving at 12:10 !! Service was so fast !!!! I couldn&#39;t believe it !! I got the black bean vegan burger with avocado and fries . Let me say SO GOOD ! Get it if you love veggie burgers especially black bean !! Homemade and Delicious, full of flavor and hot ! My dad got the breakfast burrito and enjoyed the immense amount of pork green chili, cheese, and the perfect egg to potato ratio.

Our server this time was fantastic, very attentive and prompt. So prompt that she must have put everything into the kitchen at once and brought our appetizer the same time as our meal. Just a small annoyance, considering we had to quickly scarf down blazing hot artichoke fritters that was like swallowing the face of the sun. Luckily, we had $4 happy hour draft beers to save us.

My no goes to the crowd that flocks here. Annoying, loud yuppies 20-40. They pick the place and never shut up. I honestly almost caused a scene because of how obnoxious they all are. And, I ordered this vegetarian, Peruvian fish which sounded wonderful. It looked great, but it was room-temp and lackluster.

I do not blame the restaurant for this. However I give the low rating because the food gave me and my boyfriend incredibly bad stomach pains the next day. The food was good while it was going down though. So enjoy it in the moment but oh man just wait until the next day."

Well they&#39;ve taken a step in the right direction by adding rotating taps that highlight local brewers.

First, the $2 make your own Bloody Mary bar is always a good time. They had tons of fixings to put in your drink including horseradish, pickles, olives, celery, hot sauce etc etc. Second, the waitress recommended the Dixie chicken dish from the brunch menu with buttermilk covered chicken, gravy, two eggs and potatoes. It was DELICIOUS. I don&#39;t know what they put in that gravy but it was heavenly. My boyfriend got the French toast and my friend got a veggie wrap. There was no food left in our plates. The service was polite and efficient. I have no complaints. I will definitely be going back again."

Had a group of 8 that she seemed to hate from the second we walked in (absolutely no idea what we did to earn her very cold shoulder).  Every time we needed something we had to flag her down, but she would go to another table first after being flagged down just to be even more unpleasant.

We then caught her talking to two other tables about how much she hated our table; maybe she could have at least given us a chance and told us how we offended her?!

The kicker is because we were a group of more than 6, she charged an automatic 20% tip which is about 19.9999% more than she deserved (could it be that she ignored/disliked us on purpose knowing we were an automatic tip?) .  

Food was just ok- the chicken mixture in the Thai lettuce wraps tasted and looked like it came out of a can; but the wraps, sandwiches, and especially the sweet potato fries were good. 

Been coming here since I was a kid, sadly this experience has scared me away for good.

Cheers!"

They have a fantastic happy hour! Three dollar drafts, it might be 3.50$. We have had the fries, the Thai chicken wraps, and the fish taco. Everything has been tasty. The fish taco was my least favorite, everything tasted good. It was just the ratio between the protein and all the toppings was overwhelming, and made the fish soggy. It is still good. 
Happy hours 4-6, and late night I would have to look that up. They have free wifi too."

When the street held more sex and book stores than hip eateries or hipster-clothing stores. 

But there are places like The Hornet that have stood the test of time in some ways because they are so adaptable. Years ago, the Hornet was a more typical bar/grill place but they have updated their decor, improved their service and added menu items that reflect a bit of that hipster sensibility.

Their appetizers are smartly done with lots of small, but sharable plates like pupusas, pirogues that you don&#39;t usually find at a typical bar. The baskets of stuff like chips and salsa or sweet potato fries are generous.

And of course they have options for dietary trends and tendencies such as gluten-free and multiple vegetarian options. Their veggie wrap is actually one of my favorite things on their menu with crispy artichoke fritters, garlicky mushrooms, roasted red peppers, spinach, hummus and a spicy aioli over-stuffing a tortilla. It&#39;s a great tasting and creative veggie sandwich.

My only big complaint about the Hornet is how they arrange the restaurant when it&#39;s not as busy. They clearly have some servers go home if their isn&#39;t a crowd, closing whole sections of the restaurant. The problem is that if a crowd comes later, there can be a wait for tables even though whole sections of the restaurant are empty.

I sympathize with the policy and its only affected me once, so I guess I can&#39;t be too annoyed. 

Hornets are insects found all over the northern hemisphere from the Arctic to hot deserts of the Middle East. Denver&#39;s The Hornet shows an adaptability reflective of its namesake."

My girlfriends and I walked down Broadway and picked the Hornet to enjoy some grub and light cocktails. We were seated on the patio with a great view of people watching. We ordered some mimosas and began looking over the food menu. The waitress seemed to take forever bringing our drinks and finally taking our food order. I got the cheeseburger and fries. A friend got the lobster mac and cheese. The food arrived quickly, which was brought by someone else other than our waitress. My burger was bland. It was as if they didn&#39;t season the beef at all and just threw it on the grill. I was a little disappointed.  My friend&#39;s mac and cheese however, was legit! The lobster chunks were huge.  It was ozzing with cheese. I learned my lesson.  Next time, get the lobster mac and cheese. The waitress took her time coming to check on us, which at that time we wanted more drinks. She took the drink order and brought out the wrong ones. She seemed little distracted.  Other than her and the bad tasting burger, I would say this is a good place to check out for drinks."

I also enjoy the Hornet for dinner.  The prices are very reasonable.  A turkey and Brie panini is $10, with a side.  There are several side options to choose from: fries, sweet potato fries, potatoes au gratin, cole slaw and others.  The sandwich was incredible, perfect balance of cheese, turkey, sauce and topped with arugula.  I haven&#39;t been able to find a sandwich in a sit-down restaurant for under $12, so I was excited to see the price of $10.  They also have quality burgers too.

All the regular fixin&#39;s - nothing crazy like beef sticks or Shrimp, but who really needs all that in their beverage anyway? ($3 mimosa as well) I had the breakfast tacos. I was imagining two wimpy little tacos to be honest - no way. These were like open face burritos. Delicious. I got a salad instead of the potatoes - with their homemade Gorgonzola dressing - on man. I would seriously just go back for that dressing. My other half had the broadway dip with mushrooms. Also delicious. The bread was the real show stopper in that meal. Overall it was great.

First time today with a small group for lunch - we were seated very quickly (right in the booth we wanted) by a very friendly host and then served by a newbie in training who was equally as friendly and charming.

Brunch is served late which is my all time favorite - I had the breakfast tacos vegetarian style which came with homestyle potatoes. Quite good even with my no meat and no cilantro flavor killing requests. It was two large tortillas filled to the brim - could have been shared with two normal level hunger people. 

My mates had a salad and the banana french toast, both of which were delcious according to their feedback."

Nachos were ok, needed more cheese--only the top chips were cheesy, left us wanting more.
Chicken and fries were also just fine, they lacked seasoning. I thot it was pretty lazy, its clear they are just frozen foods, which I dont mind but...can I get a little flavor?

My boyfriend used to live around the corner, so it was our go-to brunch and/or happy hour spot, depending on the time of day. Always always always for brunch on Sunday.

The $2 build-your-own Bloody Marys can&#39;t be beat, and the double mimosas are $5. And as soon as brunch ends, happy hour starts! You can day-drink for cheap all day! Pretty solid tap list too, if you&#39;re into craft beers (I am). 

My favorite brunch dishes are the dixie chicken and the hornet omelet. The french toast is pretty good too, if you prefer a sweeter breakfast.

I was skeptical of my friends&#39; choice, as Yelp currently rates it a 3.5 stars.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that this is a solid restaurant/bar.  

The inside is a bit dark, but we&#39;ll call it cozy.  The music is a little loud for my taste, but let&#39;s call me old.  The service is very friendly, of that there is no question.  The happy hour bar menu is probably one of the better I&#39;ve seen.  Many appetizers from the regular menu are discounted.  I really liked the menu, which consists of standard bar food, and some interesting twists.  I had trouble deciding what the order.  

I like the cocktail menu.  I had a tequila cocktail with strawberries and jalepeno that was unique and blended well.  The rest of my party sipped on beer.  My friends had the pirogi, which looked good (but had cheese on top, so I didn&#39;t taste them).  My husband had the fried chicken sliders.  I tasted a piece of chicken not ensconced in cheese, and it was good.  I chose the french dip, as I am prone to do.  (They have a really delicious sounding fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy entree that I wanted to try, but I&#39;ve learned that I am so fond of my own version, no one else can measure up.)  The ciabatta bread was nicely toasted, the meat well flavored, and the jus just right for dipping.  The fries really feel short.  They were not smokin&#39; hot, not well seasoned, and really didn&#39;t taste like much.  

Overall, a cool restaurant with some unique menu items."

We arrived too early for the drink portion to start but the food specials were going. Why don&#39;t they start these at the same time? We ended up doing a round of full-price drinks instead of waiting a half hour. 

The artichoke fritters were killer. I&#39;ve been avoiding artichoke for years now but these welcomed me back. They&#39;re soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and very addictive, especially with the dipping sauce (you&#39;re gonna need more of that). 

My first drink was a draft beer, a double IPA, which my friends turned up their nose at. I however enjoyed it immensely. I debated ordering a second drink, but was excited to be taking advantage of the happy hour prices and ordered a malbec. 

I was disappointed when my bill arrived with an $8 glass of wine on it. I asked the server about the happy hour pricing but she said it was for house wines only. I&#39;m not one to push, so I paid up. However, the menu clearly stated $3.50 &#34;wines&#34; - not &#34;house wines.&#34; I would have certainly gone without a drink or with a house wine had it been advertised properly."

I ordered the salmon and and came out grey. Our server literally hung out in the back corner talking to her friend who had just gotten off work and possibly also a manager? Come on, y&#39;all. It wasn&#39;t busy, our table was right next to you, yet you didn&#39;t help us?

The worst part was when they said there was this drink special: $3 Jack Daniels. Obviously our table ordered that. Then my friend, who had two drinks, got his bill for $12. When he asked, she said &#34;yup, two for one&#34; and walked away. Not only did that reasoning not make sense, but what?! Come on, Hornet. Not cool.

We&#39;ve decided to stop giving our service during postseason baseball, which is a shame because it was a couple hundred dollars for them plus great tips because we&#39;re all former service industry folks. A let down and bad food and, well, boo."

However, it was very tasty and would order again.  I also tried their fish taco which is battered fish with guacamole and a cream sauce.

This place is also a must for Sunday brunch. $2 Bloody Mary bar and they&#39;ve got all the fixins you could ever ask for! The servers are all very kind and helpful, and the best part is there usually isn&#39;t a wait. As for food, I&#39;ve tried the breakfast burrito and the dusseldorfer brat burger. I highly recommend the breakfast burrito, although if you order it, come HUNGRY. It can feed a Kenyan family of four. The dusseldorfer was different; a little too dry for my liking. It would have been better with some additional sauces, but still solid.

MUST TRY - The Homemade Pop Tart. I know it&#39;s not made in house, but they heat it up to perfection and it is the perfect accent to share over brunch.

Overall, a great brunch spot to check out in Denver!"

Fabulous happy hour drinks,  especially Saturday mimosas and bloodys!! However, today, sitting at the bar was another type of experience. Annoying. My friend and I had to ask to get menus. Ask to get drinks. Ask to get food. Then I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t see our waitress for 40 minutes and then had to ask to get our bill. That to me is ridiculous.

I roll into the Hornet almost weekly. The past 3 weeks I have had brunch there every weekend. The food is good. Not spectacular but good. The odd thing about the Hornet is the consistency of energy. There is always a customer buzz, partially because it&#39;s always so crowded, but the service is inconsistent.
The $2 Bloody Mary&#39;s are well worth the adventure.
The double Mimosa is probably my favorite.

We had calamari on this visit and it was delicious... Kind of messy though, but let go of your inhibitions and indulge. I&#39;m living proof that nobody judges you for getting a little messy. 

The sweet potato fries are a Hornet mainstay. Always good! 

The beer menu is appealing. I&#39;ve always wanted the menu to have Odell&#39;s &#34;90 Shilling,&#34; but I&#39;ve never seen it.

The soup of the day was done Italian soup and it was good. I nibbled on others plates and the chicken wings were decent but not as crispy as I like... same with the shoestring fries.

Not sure why I hadn&#39;t tried them before, as I enjoy South American food and they have a pretty varied menu for a food truck.  I didn&#39;t get anything too exotic this time, wanting to try the basic arroz con pollo to see how good their food is, but I was impressed.  The flavor was excellent, even for just plain grilled chicken, due to the spice mix they use and the sauce which was a bit like chimichurri.  The rice was well prepared, though I was hoping for fresh veggies rather than using a frozen carrot, pea, and corn mix.  But they redeemed themselves by adding in a few sweet plantains to the dish.  Plantains make everything better.  I&#39;d try lots of other things on their menu too, so I&#39;ll have to remember this truck next time I see them."

1. The food is delicious. HOLY COW. The half burrito was massive. took up the entire to go box and was smothered in green chilie. mmmm!! They were stuffed with eggs, cheese, hashbrowns, bacon and sausage...which perfeclty hit the spot!

2. Prices are great for what you what! ;)

But lets be serious for a minute... I really have only had one other thing there before. While that burger was quite delicious and the portions were quite generous, my heart still yearns for the half size breakfast burrito with half bacon and half sausage. It&#39;s only about $7 and some change, comes smothered in green-chili and cheese. Half size you wonder? Are you skeptical...? The half size is huge! It fits diagonally in your standard styrofoam take out container.

I&#39;ve actually eaten at the restaurant twice; the servers are always super friendly and the service is quick! Typically my boyfriend and I pick up our order and the longest preparation time we were ever given is 10 minutes. Talk about speedy!

Ordered the stuffed mushroom as an appetizers but the server wanted to bring it after the entree. The brown substance they referred to as &#34;gravy&#34; was nothing more than liquid salt and collagen. Very disappointed and this was my third attempt, thinking them might have just had a bad day in the past, perhaps because it has been put under new management. Whatever happened? They just don&#39;t stand up to what it was. Save yourself from tough meat, salt, and more salt."

It&#39;s become a tradition that I&#39;m happy to keep on because the food is hearty, traditionally American, and served with the sensibility of those lifelong residents of the heartland. 

I usually order the biscuits and gravy, which are great, but have also tried the omelet (pretty good), and the breakfast burrito (delicious but huge enough to feed a family!). They have great bacon, and I&#39;d love to know how many of their ingredients are locally sourced.

It&#39;s the kind of place that welcomes you into the community, fills you up, and sends you out for a hard days work on the farm, or as in my case, a day of resting and digesting on the weekend."

I was a bit skeptical at first; &#34;You mean there is a diner built into the side of a dollar store?!? MY trepidation was quickly replaced by amusement at the use they have made of the space. Specifically, finding the john takes you down a hallway to behind the kitchen where you also find a hidden private room, which always seems to be full. The decorations are sparse and the spaces are open, and not at all what you would expect from a diner. Tall ceilings with chandeliers mixed with country appointments combine into an interesting oleo.

I had the Black and Bleu Burger, ordered medium, and french fries. She had the Reuben Sandwich, with french fries. The waitstaff was cheery and helpful while we ordered and the food arrived very quickly. The only low mark I can give is the fact that my burger was cooked further than my requested medium. It was somewhere between medium well and well done. Considering the speed at which we received out food, I would believe that the patty was already on the grille when I ordered and they did not take the time to grille one to my request. Oh well, everybody gets one. And, as that was the only negative for the trip, I can still give a confident five stars.

Her Reuben Sandwich was one of the best I have ever had on Colorado. The Corned Beef was juicy and flavorful. There was a proper quantity of dressing on the sandwich,  which is a relief. So many places want to drown the sandwich in the dressing resulting in the other flavors being covered. The marble rye bread appeared to have been toasted to perfection on the grille. Be sure to eat it over the plate, as it is one juicy sandwich.

We had noticed the pie rack on the way on the door.  We asked and were informed that most of the pies and cakes are made in house. We split a slice of blue berry pie. The waitress talked us into having it a la mode. The ice cream used appeared to be of the soft serve variety. I had never considered soft serve for pie a la mode before. It turns out, this is a great way to do it. The ice cream is soft and sits on the pie like whipped cream. The pie was absolutely delicious! It was well filled with berries and not overly gelatinous as it often they way I find them. Additionally, the fruit was still somewhat firm, indicating that it was not as overcooked as it the current norm. The pie and ice cream was such a delight to end the meal with. Except, we wanted more, and had to resist temptation as we walked past the pie rack while walking out of the door. 

Now that&#39;s effective product placement.."

This one is a local treasure and worthy of praise.  They have a wide variety of foods to try out, and a bar with at least a few microbrews available.

I tried out the T.A.B., Turkey Avocado &amp; Bacon; which also comes with cheese and tomato, on toasted bread.  It was really good, though if I ever order a second I might request them to double the avocado.  

I have been told that many of their other plates, from steak to pizza, are equally delicious, so it serves as a good excuse to have a meal there 2 or 3 times a week, assuming you are stuck in the area with not many options.  

There is a main entrance by the Family Dollar; and main dining can get a little loud if it is busy.  There is a secondary entrance to the bar around back, adjacent to the Southern parking lot, there are a few tables back there and outdoor seating as well (I think all of like 2 tables outside).

At least in my case, the bar was the more intimate, quieter setting."

The menu over the last few years is old and like I said its convenient.

While we all know most of the food is frozen or canned we went in after a long day and not really into the drive to tower road to go to Chili&#39;s or Applebee&#39;s we decided to go to the diner.

The soup of the day was New England clam chowder, being from the east coast I was reluctant but figure what the heck. When the server brought it to the table I noticed and commented on the color. Instead of being white it was more of on off tan. She said it was fresh (homemade) and just a little different, Well I can honestly say it was not the worst Clam Chowder I have ever eaten but it was close. The worst part was in one of the spoon full I bit into a piece of clam shell. Not a little chip (grain if dirt size) but a piece a little bigger than a dime.

I showed it to the server and she was all apologetic and took the piece right over to Gene the owner. We never even got so much as a look from her.  I was not looking for anything from them but to be honest I expected someone to come over and say something. I guess talking and laughing with other customers was more important. We eat the rest of our dinner, paid our bill and left.

A simple word of advice, when eating there (if you do) watch what you eat. you never know what you&#39;re going to find in the food. You want be sure they are not watching and really don&#39;t seem to care.

As far are we go, IF we ever go there again we are going to stay away from anything home made by them. we&#39;ll stick with the canned / frozen food which is about 95% of their menu."

This place looks like a decent eatery inside and out; the seats and scene are typically clean, although they&#39;re lack luster.

The wait time wasn&#39;t too long, matter of fact it only took 10 minutes tops. Once the food came out I knew it wouldn&#39;t be as good as I anticipated. Me and my friend both ordered fries smothered in Green Chili-something I&#39;m a sucker for-and both plates were a runny mess! 

Once I finally scooped up a bite it hit me: the chili was TASTELESS. I kept taking bite after bite hoping that I would get a twang of heat from the &#34;spicy&#34; green chili, but not once did I taste anything but the salt on the fries.

Smothered bean / beef burrito and chicken quesadilla were ok, but not great.

What made it worse was they had a long scrolling sign asking for our patience because it is their goal to cook their food to satisfy their customers high expectations - we waited 20 minutes and the food was a disappointment.
Don&#39;t plan on going back any time soon."

Was surprised to find that the combo meal I ordered did not have a chicken option and I&#39;d have to pay an additional 1.50 per item for chicken. I expected shredded chicken but was extremely disappointed to find what seemed like store bought chicken. The flavors of the sauces were great but this was not what I was expecting from a business that&#39;s been around for 26 years. I will have to go on the inside to see if I will receive shredded chicken as an option for my meal, I&#39;m willing to give it one more try. Smh"

My favorite things to order are the carne asada fries and the chicken chimichanga. They&#39;ve always made my food the way I wanted Especially when I ask for half mild and half hot chili! It&#39;s family friendly,  fantastic customer service, and awesome food that never disappoints. I even got my fiancee and niece hooked."

I usually get the chorizo, potato, and egg burrito, hot. It is a good size with spicy chile in it. 
I have had a few other items (queso, tamales, Carne asada fries) as well and the food quality has been consistent and tasty. 
I usually go on a weekday morning or weekend late morning. In general I have experienced very slow service. The people working are good at what they are doing and working as fast as they can but the demand can be high. They could benefit from an extra pair of hands, especially when it comes to drink refills. 
The atmosphere inside is nice in that they put in extra effort with decorating details and it is clean (I&#39;ve never used the bathroom there). 
For any spicy chile connoisseurs out there,  this is worth a visit."

I waited approximately 10 minutes to receive my food - this is at prime lunch time by the way.

Today my boyfriend and I decided to go because I had some cravings for some Carne Asada fries. We walk in only 3 people are there already eating and no one in line. We order the fries and a burrito. We decided to eat there. It seemed like we were waiting a while and the girl working the line was in no rush. I saw my fries finally come out but continued to sit there while people before us food was already paid for and gone. We continued to wait for my boyfriends burrito but nothing. They put my fries on a tray and left them sitting on the line while we still waited for the burrito. They noticed that the burrito was taking a while and put my fries back under the heating light. Finally my boyfriends burrito came out (after a 20 min wait) and we asked them for different fries after they had been sitting around for a while. The manager (Sandra) then got real snappy and argued with us that they werent even under there for 10 min...she continued to argue with us which was totally unprofessional! Its not our fault they are understaffed and didnt prepare our food at the same time. I&#39;m VERY disappointed in the way the manager handled the situation. I got my carne asada fries at the end and they were amazing but i had to endure the cook rolling his eyes and the manager arguing with us. This will be the last time I will ever visit here I felt so disrespected. I rather go to the original chubbys in Denver where its 10x smaller and way more busy but have way more customer service skills than this place. It was Saturday morning.

While dropping something off at UPS we noticed the sign for Chubby&#39;s, that it had a drive-thru. That coaxed us over. But one look at the sign at the drive thru was daunting, so we drove around and parked, and went inside.  I&#39;m glad we did.

We eat a lot of Ameri-Mex food in L.A., across the price spectrum. Chubby&#39;s struck as a place that hasn&#39;t quite figured out what it wants to be. It has a drive thru, but it&#39;s anything but fast food. There is no wait staff, and the food arrives on plastic trays...but uses colorful (and heavy) ceramic fiestaware. Our order came up in courses. And the food was priced more like a midrange restaurant (think Super Mex in California).

The food was okay. My wife got the steak chimichanga; I had the three steak taco plate. Portions were generous. The rice was decent but unadorned (no cheese), and the beans were...meh. The included avocado wedge and salsa went well with the tacos, but the corn tortillas fell apart when they got soggy.

I imagine the drive-thru would work for breakfast items like an egg burrito, and the desserts looked okay (but again, priced more like a restaurant than a fast food).

I wasn&#39;t actively disappointed or pleasantly surprised, so call it three stars."

&#34; Yes ... I know just what we need, a breakfast burrito from El Chubby&#39;s with egg, bacon, potato, cheese and some salsa on the side, we&#39;ll get it to go and be back home soon.&#34; 

&#34; Promise? &#34;
&#34; Yes I promise.&#34; 

I have been coming to this location for one of three things for about 10 years. Tamales, steak taco plate or these super helpful, hang over busting burritos. I have actually paid someone to get me one on a most painful morning in which driving myself would have been impossible, not to mention illegal. These things have literally saved my life. The tacos and tamales are also very very good.

OK, so it takes a REALLY FREAKIN LONG TIME at the drive up window. I actually had my car overheat once. The food is not first class as far as other places in Denver go and it&#39;s not close to home any more. 

Nevertheless I have saved my soul and my entire physical well being with their essentials, ( breakfast burritos and an icy cold coke) on several, several, SEVERAL occasions."

The breakfast burritos are pretty good too.

Chubby&#39;s has a secret code that you should be aware of that is at the bottom of their menu. This may make all the difference in the world. I prefer to choose deluxe which includes fresh jalapenos.

They do have a convenient drive-thru. As mentioned in previous ratings it can be a bit of a wait to get your food, but I&#39;ve noticed for me it depends on what I order. The food is pretty good. If you&#39;re looking to pick up some Mexican food that doesn&#39;t end in Bell it&#39;s worth it. Not that that&#39;s real Mexican food in the slightest. I&#39;ve dined in on a few occasions and the decor is typical of most Mexican restaurants. The food is a little on the expensive side for ordering at the counter or through the drive-thru. But when you&#39;re craving Mexican food and you don&#39;t want to spend all night at a restaurant it&#39;s definitely a faster alternative.

My most resent visit was the drive-thru. I ordered one of the combos (chile relleno, cheese enchilada, rice, beans), chips &amp; salsa and fried ice cream. The chile rellenos are one of the things I typically order from here. They are pretty decent. The cheese enchiladas aren&#39;t bad, but I&#39;ve had better. The beans, as recent reviews mentioned, aren&#39;t much of anything. They are pretty tasteless and for the price of the meal they don&#39;t give you hardly any. The rice isn&#39;t bad either. I usually end up mixing the rice and beans with the chile relleno sauce. I absolutely love their chips &amp; salsa and always order some when I go. The fried ice cream is one of my favorites. Where else can you get an order of fried ice cream through the drive-thru? Knowing I&#39;m getting this with my order makes the wait well worth it. Sometimes the shell it comes in is more chewy than crispy. So I don&#39;t usually eat it. But the ice cream is pretty good.

Overall, if you&#39;re looking for some quick Mexican food, it&#39;s not a bad place to eat at. I&#39;ve never had any issues with my orders."

Negatives:  As others have stated, the drive-through is more of a parking lot, as slow as it moves.  The menu is a bit complicated, in that there&#39;s not much consistency between what it says, what they &#34;clarify&#34; over the intercom, and what I receive in the end.  Sometimes everything is inside of the burrito, and others it&#39;s smothered on the top.  Sometimes I ask explicitly that they put it all inside, and they say it doesn&#39;t come like that, and other times they act like I&#39;m crazy for even asking because &#34;that&#39;s how it comes, sir.&#34;  

At any rate, it&#39;s worth the wait at the drive through, and no matter what surprise you receive, it&#39;s still delicious.  I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat there, but if you&#39;re in the area and you&#39;re craving some Mexican fare, give this place a try."

Or shut off your car in the wind-y drive thru that looks a little like an Elitches water ride in February.  Scary, isolated, and grim.  I won&#39;t go back.  No one got sick, thank goodness.  My cheese enchiladas had that annoying lettuce shard business going on. Refried beans were tasty but not condusive to driving.  We were hungry, it was close to Verizon, and I hadn&#39;t Yelped before I went.  

Lesson learned."

My girlfriend had the chicken chimichanga and I had the deluxe chicken burrito. I&#39;m still not sure what made it deluxe unless it was the packet of sour cream.  A chimichanga, burrito, chips and salsa, small margarita and coke was $25.00.  This isn&#39;t a complaint, just a description.  The place is not a service restaurant.  You walk in, look at the menu, order and sit down to wait for your order number to be called out, which took a while.  After ordering we went to find a table.  Plenty to choose from but they either had trays with dirty plates and food on them, or the tabletops hadn&#39;t been washed off yet.  We seriously couldn&#39;t find one table that was clean.  I went up to the counter and asked for napkins to clean the table myself because there weren&#39;t napkins anywhere besides behind the counter.  After asking for napkins the person at the counter rank up two other customers while I was still waiting for a napkin.  Finally our food is ready and the food wasn&#39;t bad tasting.  Kind of plain.  The chicken in both of our meals had a lot of pepper.  Other than the pepper there wasn&#39;t much spice to either of our meals and we both ordered our meals &#39;hot&#39;. My girlfriend, who is Hispanic, immediately got a upset stomach upon leaving and didn&#39;t even finish her meal.  My upset stomach came on later that night and this morning we&#39;re both feeling the pain.  The people working there weren&#39;t very friendly and seemed like they didn&#39;t care about their jobs.  Upon leaving I just looked around and counted how many tables hadn&#39;t had their remaining food / trays cleaned off yet.  Eleven.  There were only five other diners sitting in the restaurant.  Maybe just a bad night but I know I won&#39;t be giving this place another try."

But for what it is, this El Chubby&#39;s succeeds.

First off, the building has been here since the late 70&#39;s. For the longest time it was &#34;Taco Bueno&#34;, until El Chubby&#39;s took over in the early 90&#39;s. Considering it&#39;s basically a take out place, the interior of this joint is well done. Big screen TV, tiled counters and used (but serviceable, sturdy and clean) furniture.

The menu is usually heavy on the cheese. I typically order their beef &amp; bean burrito and it fills me up. I started hitting El Chubby&#39;s in late 1999 yet  I haven&#39;t had any problems with excessive pooping. My colon of steel rules. I&#39;ve also had their cheese fries, burgers and &#34;Steak Order&#34; with no tummy tumult. They offer breakfast fare, but I&#39;ve never been brave enough to try it. Something about eggs and beans mixed together just doesn&#39;t get my appetite geared up. A robust menu, as they even offer desert items and beer.

Overall, I&#39;d say the food&#39;s somewhere above bar food, yet below a full-service dine-in restaurant. This is not formal dining, more like a casual quick-dine joint. I&#39;d even classify it as good &#34;Guy Food&#34;. I&#39;ve taken buddies from my softball team, male co-workers, dad and brother to the place. They loved it. Yet I took my girlfriend once and she thought it was &#34;a fluffed up Taco Bell&#34; and didn&#39;t want to eat there. That kinda&#39; broke my heart. 

Price-wise, El Chubby&#39;s is a good deal. You can a hefty meal for about 5-6 bucks per person. Drive-through window, too. Unless you really love to idle your engine, I&#39;d recommend parking in the lot and going inside to order, though.

Don&#39;t go expecting a gourmet meal. If you want some greezy Mexican fare, hit up El Chubby&#39;s for a yummy stomach filler."

WIth the green chile and cheese inside the cost per breakfast burrito was about $5.50, made me almost wish a Santiago&#39;s was in sight.

When you ask for the &#34;HOT&#34; chili it is actually hot. AND don&#39;t listen to other reviewers who got sick. They simply ordered the hot chili and thought they could handle it, but  couldn&#39;t. The next morning  they regretted it and spent half the day on the toilet. I&#39;ve been going her for over 5 years and have never once gotten sick. The egg and potato burrito is my favorite, with just the right amount of egg to potato ratio. The bean &#39;n beef burrito is Ok but nothing special. When you go there you have to try the Carne Asada Fries with extra jalapenos.  These are the best green chili cheese fries I have ever had. The service is pretty fast and the decorations are mediocre. There&#39;s posters of bull fights in spain from the 1600&#39;s. Overall, it&#39;s a great place to stop in if your by the hood, but not to make a long trip to.

2 star- it&#39;s just casual nothing to special."

This restaurant serves amazing food - be it their Mexican cuisine or just the plain old-fashioned cheeseburgers. I went here once with a friend and we immediately decided that this was our new &#34;place,&#34; and it has remained our &#34;place&#34; since. The waitresses are kind and patient and put up with my rowdy friends like champions. 

I definitely want to address the patron who was worried that they were racially segregating people by tables - I really don&#39;t think they do. I go with my group of white friends all the time and we are always sat in tables off the main dining area, away from the main seating tables. In the review, it sounds like she witnessed white families being sat in the middle while she and her daughter (and another black couple) were sat to the side. This definitely makes it sound like the party sizes were very different, which can easily explain why they&#39;d be sat different places. I know I usually only go with one or two people and am put in a similar place that this reviewer was, so I don&#39;t believe they are racially motivated when seating people. 

Overall, a lovely gem off Jewell and Havana with plenty of parking and lots of charm. Highly recommend!"

What kind of caught me off guard was how they seated us away from the main dining area.  There is a section to the right separated by a three foot wall. The next guy that came in asked to be seated where we were - but the next three families (all white - I&#39;m African American) were all seated in the main dining area.  Then, an older African American couple came in and they were seated with us - away from the main dining area.  

Maybe I&#39;m off and reading too much into this - but from my perspective, the seating was intentional - like we were sitting at a lunch counter in the deep south - blacks on one side whites on the another side.

As far as the food - pretty basic - waffles eggs potatoes and pancakes.  Tasty good but nothing special.  

Next time - i will just go somewhere else - i shouldn&#39;t have to question the motive of people. 



Three weeks ago I accused this restaurant of intentionally seating black patrons away from the white patrons.  The owners have not responded or made any attempt to dispel my accusation.  It appears that separating customers by race is how they do business.

And today&#39;s visit was disappointing. When I tried to get inside I couldn&#39;t because the front door wouldn&#39;t open up completely so I had to go through the bar which is hard to get through in a wheelchair. You would expect a decent crowd for the special but it was empty when I got there. The waiter was pretty quick to serve me and I decided to get their southwestern egg rolls to try something different which was a bad idea because the one I ate wasn&#39;t fully cooked. So after 20 minutes from when I ordered I got my prim rib with  steamed veggies and a baked potato. The prime rib was pretty good but was a small portion   I saved the baked potato for my mom and realized they never gave me sour cream,  au jus, dinner salad, and rolls which most were advertised on the front window as terrible as today was I&#39;ll probably come back for their eggs Benedict and their wings but def not what I had to deal with today."

Its been several month since my last visit and I smelled something was different.  Today&#39;s visit was totally surprising.  

1.  The sign has changed to new restaurant name.  Well, cant tell if its restaurant or bar or ..   just a name.. Is this name something I should associate with breakfast?
2.  there was some 2 by 4s near the restaurant and I thought they were still doing remodeling.  When I looked into the dark tinted window, I can see people inside so we went inside..
3.  All of the tables and chairs been replaced and wall decorations been replaced with dark framed mirrors and dark leather bench seats..  very clean look compare to the past..
4.  All of Dumitri&#39;s sports memorabilia are gone.  :(
5.  I still see few familiar faces still working.

As soon as we sat down, coffee arrived with a offering of small muffins.  this muffin was a trademark with Dumitri for a while but it was phased out for few years and was nice to see them again.   
I ordered the biscuits and gravy with two eggs for $6.  my date ordered turkey benedict which wasn&#39;t on the new menu.  the waiter was new to waiting business but he was very nice and tried his best.
My biscuits were quite dry even though covered with sausage gravy..  the hollandaise sauce has the &#34;artificial right out of the packet taste&#34;..  yuck..

I m hoping to come back again but hope they can improve lot of things..

Dear new owner of Havana Street Stations..  
1.  need big humongous &#34;OPEN&#34; sign.  Can&#39;t see current sign from outside due to the tinting on the windows.
2.  we want fresh baked biscuits.. not the store bought that&#39;s been sitting in the freezer
3.  yeah, you guessed it.. get a new recipe for hollandaise sauce.. it not that tough to make it from scratch..

We all loved Dumitris but that will only last few more tries.  If you don&#39;t improve fast, we will be hopping over to Dozens or Sam 3 or even Perkins.."

The food and service was EXCELLENT! Honestly, one of the best breakfast burritos I&#39;ve ever had. It was huge, and smothered in a very tasty green chile. 

The price was also very fair with breakfast, beverages, and tip for two of us under $30. 

If you happen to be passing through the area, give these guys a try. I think you&#39;ll be glad you did."

I got the pork chops and eggs. Pork chops where super dry to the point you really couldn&#39;t eat them.  The toast had some weird tasting butter. I also got a side of biscuits and gravy. They were ok the gravy was good the biscuits where not that great. Maybe they were reheated in the microwave, they were hard to cut.

I guess the bar and restaurant are connected. Sounded like the bar was having a super time. Maybe they should separate the two places a little better.  I don&#39;t want to hear a loud lady laughing and screaming at 9am. 

I liked this place better when it was  Dumitri&#39;s. I like the remodel but the food was just not that good."

I don&#39;t want to wait 2+ hours to be seated.  I don&#39;t want anything particularly exotic, or dressed up to be so (hold your bacon flight).  I just want a good tasting, hearty breakfast.  I&#39;m happy to report that Havana Street Station fit the bill.  The menu had lots of tempting breakfast options, not to mention some really nice sounding sandwiches and burgers on the lunch menu.  

I opted for the berry waffle.  Served with soft butter and warm syrup, it was tasty and very filling!  My only complaint is that the strawberries were previously frozen.  Fresh berries would have put the waffle over the top.  My dining companions were very pleased with their selections.  I cannot recall the exact menu items they ordered but they didn&#39;t have any complaints.  Portions are huge, so be prepared.
  
I must also comment on the service:  lovely.  The waitresses were friendly and attentive.  We went on Mothers&#39; Day and we were offered &#34;mom-mosas&#34; and carnations.  I thought that was super cute.  Havana Street Station has the potential to be bumped up to four-stars, I need to try something more than the waffle to do so.

It was a normal weekday morning, not too busy.  My dad had their special of the day prime rib, and my bf had an omelette.  I ordered the corned beef hash and my mom just had a side of pancake.  I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t order a 4th meal since that was plenty of food for all of us.  My bf loved his omelette and my dad was very happy with his steak also.  He loved the horseradish, which isn&#39;t runny like straight from a bottle, but it actually was good flavorful horseradish.  I was just ok with my corned beef hash, but I&#39;m slowly figuring out maybe I just don&#39;t really like corned beef hash in general. No fault to the restaurant.

The food was served buffet style and was delicious. I don&#39;t believe the Chicken Parmesan, Spaghetti and salad that was served is normally on the menu but with how good it was I can only surmise that their normal menu items would be just as delicious. The new owner Nick was very friendly and helpful throughout the whole event and genuinely seemed to care that everyone was enjoying themselves.

I wish I would have had the sirloin steak my friend ordered. It was cooked perfect, seasoned, sliced and topped with mushroom gravy served over garlic mashed potatoes. It looked great and tasted even better! Another high point was the scalloped potatoes. The best I&#39;ve ever had! Loaded with bacon and cheese but not overwhelming. Over all, everything was high quality for reasonable prices. A $12 perfect steak dinner!! with sides! I will be back."

While the menu is similar, this is not the same establishment it once was, Dumitri&#39;s. The food is expensive and lackluster.

He actually argued with me over accepting a coupon to their restaurant that said &#34;valid anytime&#34; and &#34;valid now thru November 1, 2013.&#34; We paid full price and got the heck out.

Cod perfectly hand battered &amp; fried.  Crunchy and not dripping in grease.  Malt vinegar and bonus points for offering sweet potato fries as substitute for the usual chips. The fish &amp; chip platter includes a generous serving of housemade cole slaw. F&amp;C dinner also includes a first course of salad or homemade soup.  We opted for the soup...chicken lemon rice and ham with bean...both very tasty, but each a lttle on the salty side.  The fish &amp; fries were seasoned just right.  Didn&#39;t have room for desert...maybe next time.  
The decor is contemporary and attire business casual.  I like it, but, those who favored the prior Dumitris country kitchen motif might feel a bit lost.  
Great service from Francis who made certain we also knew about the weekly rotation of nightly dinner specials.  Friday is F&amp;C night at a significant discount.  Plus live jazz is now offered on Friday eve from 6-9.  The Restaurant connects with with the adjcent Nick&#39;s Place for adult beverages.

The waitress came out, and very politely, professionally, and earnestly apologized and explained that this was a rare occasion and they had a great place normally.  The food came, it was great! and then the owner, Terry, came out, apologized just as genuine as the waitress and gave us 50% off.  It had something to do with the chef.

Set back in a small shopping strip off of Arapahoe, the restaurant felt light and comfortable inside, a pleasant surprise. 

Tocabe is kind of like an Indian chipotle. You choose your base- either Indian taco, another type of bread, or tortilla chips - and then your toppings. You can choose things like bison, beef, veggie, or chicken.

I got the veggie Indian taco. The bread was fluffy and the perfect amount of sweet. All toppings and salsa tasted extremely fresh and delicious. For just under $8 it was a great sized portion and left me feeling full &amp; satisfied but not overwhelmed.

My brother got the shredded bison Indian taco and loved it as well!

The main lady working at the cash registrar seemed like the owner and was extremely warm and welcoming and talked to us several times. If she is not the owner, she is doing a great job representing the company. Before I left I went up to ask her if any of the beans are vegan and I was so happy to find out they all are!! She also told me that the only thing they don&#39;t make in house is the chipotle sauce, which was really good on my taco! 

This is a must-try!"

Hubby, &#34;no seriously...&#34;

...there were several more of these exchanges and I shan&#39;t bore you with the details. Anywho. Holy smokes people! Another fast casual FTW, but not a cuisine you can find just any old place. 

Repeat after me. &#34;I will get the Indian taco.&#34; It&#39;s worth it. Don&#39;t get the grilled one. To be fair, I haven&#39;t had the grilled one, but you&#39;re already going down that road, so..... 

The Indian taco (fry bread with taco-like toppings) will end up being as much food (if not a little more) than your normal-sized Chipotle burrito. And, their fry bread is killer. Better than on the reservation on a Feast Day. You must be prepared to decide between black, pinto, or chili-flavored pinto beans. I think they were a green chili flavor? Either way, I was unprepared, got nervous, and said black beans like a boring person. I should&#39;ve sprung for the chili beans!

And, go back like the fat kid we all are and get another fry bread for dessert. Yes with powdered sugar. Yes with cinnamon. Yes with the honey on the table that&#39;s just begging you to roll on out of there. It&#39;s so worth it!"

BISON RIBS - $14.50
My co-worker raved about the ribs so of course I ordered them. You get 3 big ribs - great portion for sharing if you also order something else. Tasted similar to Korean BBQ ribs (&#34;kalbi&#34;). Served w/ housemade berry BBQ sauce and &#34;fry bread&#34; which tasted like a puffy corn tortilla. The ribs come w/ a side - I got the Wild Rice which had a nice kick; very good. Definitely recommend the ribs! 

BAD HUNTER SALAD - $7.75
Not sure why they call it &#34;bad&#34; b/c it was certainly very good! Arcadia Mix salad served w/ up to 5 seasonal toppings -- I chose the quinoa, wheatberry, jicama mix, sweet corn, black beans and tomatoes ... hmm maybe I got 6. I got the Maple Vinaigrette as my dressing. One of the best salads I&#39;d ever had, and it was a lot of food too. I&#39;d definitely get it again, exact same toppings.

That said, the main dish was so filling, I couldn&#39;t eat it all and was too full to try the Wojabi &amp; Fry bread but it looked amazing.  All the pics on here are exactly what I saw at Tocabe &amp; what led me to want to try it.

I&#39;ve been meaning to come here for over a year, the location is a bit out of the way for me but I will be moving soon so I made sure to hit Tocabe up before I leave.
I got the veggie indian taco. I wish I hadn&#39;t and went somewhere else. It was so incredibly BLAND. I got it with beans, lettuce, and their various salsas. I like the overall concept of this place and I appreciate that it&#39;s vegan friendly but I would much rather go to Chipotle, which has much more flavorful options.
The beans were bland and tasteless and the salsas weren&#39;t much more flavorful, which was quite surprising given that they are typically tasty and add zing to the meal.
The service was excellent, everyone working here is incredibly friendly and smiles at you. Also, the portion size was generous, which is refreshing.
Perhaps the meat options are more flavorful but if the base of your meal is bland, there is only so much that the meat can compensate. I don&#39;t believe in returning food unless the order is incorrect, which it wasn&#39;t in this case, but man, it certainly was tempting in this situation."

So fresh. So hot. Now add a couple of goodies. Spice it up and let me be cause it&#39;s time to get down!

Tocabe is definitely worth a try and for me its all about the fry bread. I&#39;ve tried the Bison ribs with chipotle/blueberry sauce and they were fairly good. The green chile stew has ground beef and alot of white corn in it and was also reasonably good. But you can customize the fry bread
to your liking and I think this what to get here. 

It&#39;s cool to see Native American cuisine that isn&#39;t from a little roadside stand or food truck. This  must be a sign of growing popularity for this type of food and I&#39;m all for it."

First of all the frybread is damn good whatever you get it savory or sweet. Let&#39;s start with savory. 

You start with your frybread base and pick your protein. I went with ground bison and green chili beans. Grab some veg. Then these salsas. I went hominy and a hot salsa. Top with sour cream and chipotle. Simple, fresh, filling, clean, tasty.

Need to satisfy that sweet tooth? Grab some more frybread and pair it with honey or the wojape (think mixed berry chutney)."

When I heard about American Indian I thought it was Indian food, (India) Americanized.  I had always wanted a beef version of my favorite Indian dishes. . so I was sold

Well - this is American Indian.. .which might be better written Native Americans. .which too me is a wide group.  Yet maybe American Indians all ate the exact same thing - my knowledge of their culinary capabilities is limited

Tocabe is one part Chipoltle . . .big nice slow cooked meats like Beef, Bison, and Chicken.  Some ground, some shreaded.  You throw these meats on top of a &#34;taco&#34; which to me is 1/2 pita 1/2 funnel cake.  You can go with a pita like thing instead. . if you want.  the fried taco is the way to go if you have the calories.

You then, like Chipotle, have a choice of toppings and sauce.  My recommendation - Homily and then Hot salsa.  Damn.

The food is great and the concept is different enough to be special. And unlike Chipotle, this place actually SERVES a  chipotle sauce."

The chicken is fantastic choice for your meal. Full of flavor and far superior to what you might find at Chipotle or Qdoba. Buffalo is great also. Make sure you try their famous hominy salsa (featured on Diners, Drive Ins &amp; Dives), it&#39;s amazing!

I hadn&#39;t realized until a couple of days ago, while looking on Yelp, that one had opened so close to me!  I trotted right down at first opportunity to give them a try. 

They are a small fast food Chipotle style restaurant, where you just walk up and pick your main item and then choose your toppings and add any side items; nothing too complicated. Their menu is pretty basic, just a few items, which makes ordering pretty easy. The only issue I had is that both of the people I ordered from weren&#39;t rude or anything, but just looked like high schoolers that were in a hurry and would rather be doing anything else. As I was the only person in line at the time, that was a little annoying. Especially when I was trying to get the young lady to explain the salsas, she mumbled through them very fast and I kept having to have her repeat them. Maybe just having a little sign written up would be helpful? Anyway, my rating would have definitely been 5 stars with a little better experience during ordering, although it wasn&#39;t traumatic, just not great.

Anyway, for the first time I decided to try just the basic Indian taco with ground beef. I requested the chili beans, which are basically spiced up pinto beans, all of the other basics, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, etc. Then you get to pick 2 salsas, YUM! I picked the hot one and their seasonal summer squash salsa. When I started I thought I would order a side of beans and some fry bread, but when they finished making my taco I quickly rethought that idea. If you&#39;re worried about buying an $8 or $9 taco, don&#39;t! These things are huge! They actually look more like pizzas the size of those big flat soup bowls than tacos, and mine weighed about a pound and a half or more.

I ordered mine to go, so I hurried home to try it. It was fantastic! The toppings were all very fresh, no slimy lettuce or tomatoes or anything else. The summer squash salsa was especially good as I was a little tentative about trying it. At this point in the summer, I&#39;m about burned out on summer squash from my own garden and many restaurants seem to have old squishy squash,  but the squash in this salsa was extremely fresh and crunchy and had a great flavor! I&#39;m so glad I tried it. Now I&#39;m going to try to make some with my own squash. And I can see where the fry bread could become addictive. It was really, really good as the base of the taco and I can see why they had honey on all of their tables at the restaurant, because I&#39;m guessing fresh fry bread with honey is awesome!. Next time, and there will be a next time, I&#39;m trying the bison taco and plan to share some honey soaked fry bread with hubby!"

I used to frequent the location in Highlands when I lived a little closer to that area, but I haven&#39;t been in years, so I was super excited when I just happened to drive by this new location.  I popped in and grabbed a menu, which I promptly placed in front of my boss, who had just announced he was buying our team lunch during our next meeting.

My boss was very happy with the catering experience - he said the price was very reasonable for what we got, they delivered right up to our conference room, and they were very pleasant to deal with throughout.  The food was as awesome as I remembered.  We got chicken and beef (wish we&#39;d gotten some bison, but hey, can&#39;t complain about free food, right?), lettuce, a container of each sauce/salsa they offer, sour cream, guacamole, and of course, glorious fry bread.

While there were a few members of the team for whom Osage food was just a little too &#34;out there&#34;, the majority loved it.  As others have mentioned, it&#39;s a shame this location doesn&#39;t do the stuffed fry bread, but everything else about this location is right on par with the original.

It&#39;s set up like a Chipotle or Illegal Pete&#39;s. However, it was lacking in flavor... The fry bread was spectacular in the Indian taco, but the chili beans, shredded bison (tender but not flavorful), and salsas were lacking in true flavor and spices. Maybe I should&#39;ve gotten the hot salsa instead of mild or corn salsa instead of the hominy (or in addition to)....

I was glad I got there for an early lunch as about 10 minutes after I ordered the line was to the door.  The food was outstanding.  I ordered the fry bread with shredded bison and all the toppings.  I&#39;m not sure if I have eaten bison before, but it was delicious and seasoned really well.  The fry bread (Indian taco) was awesome...reminded me of a non-greasy savory funnel cake....and was great with the meat and toppings on it.  The hominy salsa, as mentioned in a few of the other reviews, was awesome as well.

The guy working on the floor checked in a few times to see if everything was okay and also picked up the plates when we were done (nice touch for a casual restaurant).  I just wish Tocabe served premium soda fountain drinks (i.e. - Boylan&#39;s sodas and teas instead of the regular Pepsi / Nestea).  I&#39;ll definitely be back!!  Yum!"

I ordered the Indian taco (fry bread) with shredded buffalo and green chili beans. I expected lots of flavor, but there was none.  Just really bland.

I ate there two days in a row as I had talked it up to two friends.

Day 1: shredded bison Indian taco. Pretty tasty, if incredibly unhealthy seeming. The staff was incredibly friendly and were happy to suggest items. I found the fry bread a bit sweet, which kind of flavored the entire dish sweet. My husband had a ground bison taco with melted cheese. Of course it was delicious-- like calorie overload always is. Definitely more of a once in a while treat.

Day 2: Bannock Bread with ground bison. It was tasty, but somehow still came off sweet? I topped it with cheese and green chiles, and ended up dousing it in the hot sauce to cut the sweetness.

At the end of the day...will I go back? Yes,sure--fry bread taco with melted cheese sauce would be a tasty way to throw caloric caution to the wind...but I&#39;d probably only go back for that."

BBQ for $2 less than I paid for the very small amount of shredded bison on the Indian taco for dinner here.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the meat was good, the frybread was interesting, there was plenty of beans, lettuce, cheese &amp; salsa on it to fill me up.  But, pricey and not enough meat for the price.  Good presentation, interesting options, fast service (order at counter, take to table, self-bus).

I saw the bison ribs, and they looked huge.

But, been there, done that, and I&#39;ll go elsewhere in the future.  I thought the fairly loud music selection was strange for an American Indian place, some sort of odd hip-hop modernistic mish-mash.

We both ordered the shredded buffalo tacos which was seasoned to perfection. We had choices of various beans, veggies, and salsas to put on it.  I had my &#34;taco shell&#34; on the side, which was Indian fry bread.  I got a side of the berry jam to pair with the bread - which was very yummy.

Overall, I really enjoyed the entire experience.  

I decided on shredded bison with bannock. The meat was delicious and the bread (bannock) was tasty and functional as a sponge to sop up all the juice/sauce from the meat, beans and salsa. The ordering process was similar to Chipotle. The additions to my meal, salsa, choice of beans, lettuce, sour cream, yadda, yadda were all along the same vein as. . .that other place. However, there are some differences in what Tocabe offers, of course.  There is a hominy type salsa offering, and of course the bison options.  I really liked the flavor of the meat. The food is served in, essentially, tin pie plates. Simple and functional.

The dining area was very clean and simply appointed.  There was an employee in the dining area keeping it in tip top shape. He was helpful and pleasant.

I have looked through the pictures, but still wasn&#39;t sure how everything was going to taste, or how it should taste.Needless to say, this is my first American- Indian cuisine experience, and it did not disappoint.

First off, I added a star for their great customer service. I see people are quick to deduct stars on yelp for horrible customer service, but I think it is just as important to add a star to recognize friendly, attentive staff. I called at 9:30am not knowing they actually opened at 11am and the owner answered the phone. For me, this is a VERY rare occasion. Usually when restaurants aren&#39;t officially open, they stay away from the phone or door like oil and water. So, that in itself was impressive. We had quite a large group(10ppl) coming in for lunch and I&#39;ve herd it gets extra crowded during lunch and was worried there would be no space for us. He assured us there are plenty of seats(60 to be exact), but should probably arrive early if we all want to sit together. I arrived at 11:15am and there was a long bench perfect for the group. So, if you come with a large group, come in early because it does get packed. 

On to the food! I ordered the shredded bison taco and for some reason or another I was still expecting soft shell or hard shell for the tacos, but it actually does come on a large piece of fry bread. This is definitely a taco to eat with a knife and fork. They pile on the shredded bison, then you get to pick 2 sauces to put atop the mound of food. Then you can add a chipotle sauce which I really did like. The creaminess added to the ensemble quite well. I was also fooled by the size of this taco. I could only finish about 3/4 of it before I had to pack the rest to-go. This was an overall great experience with wonderful company and food. I will be back for more!"

I get the Indian taco with shredded bison and the fixins! You really can&#39;t go wrong with any combo. Lots of salsas to choose from, choice of chili or black beans, and lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheese. Everything is noticeably fresh. The cheese is even freshly grated.

The first visit I had the fry bread taco with ground bison, while my wife got the shredded bison.  Mine was great, but a bite of hers convinced me to get the shredded bison next time.

On the second visit, I got the shredded bison, but this time it had an overwhelming sweetness to it.  I also got it to-go, which I think was a mistake.  The fry bread is great, but it gets soggy if you don&#39;t eat it right away...not as good an option as Chipotle or Qdoba if you&#39;re taking it to go.  

So while I was disappointed in the 2nd visit, I plan to give them another try when I have time to eat-in."

I was just back in Denver for a week and within the six days I was there went to this Tocabe location twice for lunch. It was a happy day when my brother mentioned that they were opening a second location much closer to where I stay in Colorado. The fry bread is not to be missed, though the bannock is not bad either (if you aren&#39;t for deep fried). Just as good as the original location."

This meal had good flavor. Only issue was that I got my dish to go, and when I got back to my hotel (only 2 miles away) I found it was a little cold. Not completely cold, but I was a little disappointed.

Service was excellent. Staff was very friendly and pricing is good. I will give it another shot next time in Denver and give them a shot to redeem the temperature for 5 stars."

It&#39;s closer to home and very convenient when I&#39;m at work. Try their taco with shredded bison - my absolute favorite. Tocabe is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Denver. The food is great and the staff is good. 

The reason I&#39;m giving this location 4 stars rather than 5 is due to the ambiance. The vibe of the Highlands Tocabe definitely did not carry over to this location. Gone is the airy feel, the exposed brick walls and the candle cutouts. Rather, it feels like every other restaurant in the DTC. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I can get past that and WILL eat here often, but I do miss the feel of the other location. It also seems they don&#39;t have Guy&#39;s menu at this location, so no bison ribs. Sadness."

Its pretty awesome they opened a location closer to where I&#39;m at. The food here is just as good at the other location. Like what was mentioned in other reviews the menu is a bit different but nothing major.

If you haven&#39;t eaten at Tocabe I highly recommend it. Everything on the menu you are probably familiar with but it is put together in a way that will probably be new and delicious to you. The ordering style is similar to that of Chipotle/Qdoba. They have some bottled beers available too. If you don&#39;t know what is what just ask the staff they are really friendly and helpful."

We were skeptical of how good their sushi would be considering we were from the Bay area (CA); where we&#39;re fortunate to have so many great  places available to us. Additionally, not too often are you able to find an Asian fusion restaurant that can make all dishes exceptionally well. But this place surprised us and exceeded our expectations (well done). This was the best food we had on our trip and was a pleasant treat. Glad we came across this gem on our way dropping someone off the Denver international airport.

We had the Reunion roll, volcano roll, Broncos roll,  and seaweed salad. We recommend all of them if you&#39;re looking for some suggestions."

I was excited to find another sushi spot become accessible while working. Lots of PROS, but primary CONS is what sets me back. I was getting tired of Thai Chili &amp; Sushi in all honesty. The men are very honest over the phone and in person. I loved the &#34;nightsy&#34; look of the restaurant. Don&#39;t take the toll road if you&#39;re coming from the airport; take Tower Rd, and once reaching the traffic light, turn right. It&#39;s in commerce city of Colorado, so there is a way of experiencing their promises of good sushi without paying for commute. 

I scheduled for pick up, I was surprised they took gift cards. I picked up the smell of the  Cheese Rangoon. The stuffing is very creamy, tasted a few bits of vegetables. An upside is they provide a cup of sweet / sour sauce already, and they allow an extra cup for free. 

My sushi: The Fancy Roll and Red Snake Roll: The Fancy Roll really was fancy, but reminded me of the Avalanche, and baked Salmon Roll from other sushi spots I&#39;d visit previously, so not so unique as it reminds me of other rolls. It was definitely a mouth full: cream cheese, sauces, and if you open wide, your lips won&#39;t get messy. 

The Red Snake made my tummy frown because I&#39;m not big on veggie rolls. I know, I&#39;m unhealthy. But guess what? This one actually impressed me for its lack of creativity in the roll. A lot of lettuce, and avocado. But these rolls weren&#39;t touching my heart like most spots. Hence, I&#39;ll have no choice but to dine in next time and give it multiple chances"

We took our out of town family guests here along with our family... Over a party of 10 including 4 small children. We ordered a great amount of food and the food were good as usual. With the kids noted because they accidentally moved the table and the soy sauce container fell in between the space of the table and window and broke. The staff didn&#39;t say anything and didn&#39;t care to clean it the whole time we were there. However, when the bill came, they charged us $10 for that container. I paid it but was very irritated. I didn&#39;t mind paying it because the kids did accidentally cause it to break, but the least they could&#39;ve done was tell me beforehand that they planned on charging me and the amount. We spent well over $100 on dinner that night. Henceforth why I haven&#39;t dined here for almost a year.

After getting takeout for dinner I am only mildly impressed. 

The majority of their specialty rolls have either eel or mango. I don&#39;t care for either so we ordered rolls off of their regular sushi menu. We ordered the California, salmon and avocado, spider, crabmeat tempura, Philadelphia and red snake rolls. I do think their fish was fresh but I did not care for the spider roll or the red snake roll. There was not a ton of flavor and they had more lettuce than anything. My favorite was the salmon and avocado roll. It was simple but fresh and delicious. I could just order that next time and be happy.

We also ordered chicken pad Thai. I thought the chicken was kind of rubbery and low quality. The pad Thai sauce was also sweeter than we had ever tasted in the past. It was not terrible, just not what we were expecting. But they gave us a ton of it. We have enough for two lunches now."

Today I stopped in for lunch. It always makes me smile when I walk into a strip mall restaurant that&#39;s rather remote and there are plenty of patrons already seated, eating their lunches. 

I&#39;m typically leery about ordering sushi from an Asian Fusion restaurant, but I decided to try a California roll along with my General Tso lunch special with wonton soup, egg roll and steamed rice. I&#39;m glad I tried the sushi, because it beat my expectations. I know a lot of sushi aficionados may say that anyone can make a California roll, but I can attest that&#39;s not true. 

They have a sushi chef behind a full length bar pumping out plates of fresh rolls. My roll was delicious. I would definitely come back JUST for sushi. They do a sushi for 2 deal:  16 pieces of sushi with 2 chef special rolls for just $47. Not too shabby when the partner and I can definitely eat our way through $60 worth of sushi elsewhere. 

My wonton soup was very good. Not an overly salty broth with pieces of crispy onion and scallions. The only issue I have with the soup is that the wontons have a particularly odd flavor. I can&#39;t pinpoint what it is yet. It&#39;s still good overall. 

My General chicken was great. Lots of flavor and just enough spice. The best part of this dish is the large portion of veggies they mix in with the chicken. Carrots, peppers, onions and broccoli were all crisp and delectable. 

Portion size was ample. I even had some left over for later. 

The only gripe I have is that their service is sometimes not overly attentive. Today it was fine, but other times it&#39;s been slow with drink refills only occurring from us practically flagging down one of three servers that always seem to congregate at the cash register. 

Otherwise if you live nearby or you&#39;re going/leaving the airport, you should try it out. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

If you craving for some sushi, try their love boat, beautiful decorated sushi boat, and fresh fish, and large portion, you think love boat you suppose to share by 2, but hey we can&#39;t really finish it at all! This is what I always order back then when I craving for Sushi!

Their Chinese food is also very nice, and large portion! I mean really wow, I feel the plate is even large than 2 letter paper and its covered with food! The black pepper filet mignon is super good and healthy. The boil the green pepper instead deep fry them. It loose a little bit crunchiness, but you know you are consuming healthy meal.

My mapo tofu was OK, however mapo tofu is supposed to be a spicy dish and mine was quite bland, I had to ask for chili sauce and dump it on top and then it got to a somewhat acceptable spice level.  I kept having to look for salt and pepper though.

Unfortunately when our sushi arrived there was not any wasabi in any of the containers for the sushi.  That was not as big a deal as the response of the manager Chris.

When we called to inform them of the mistake the manager first assured us it was in the packages. I told him there was not any wasabi and told him I could take a picture and send to him.  To make a long story short the way they best felt to resolve the issue was to bring us wasabi an hour later. While waiting for the wasabi we had a family member coming by and they were at grocery store so I asked them to grab some wasabi so we could just eat.

The manager actually showed up at our house with wasabi just as we finished the sushi (kind of messed up I know, but we could not wait any longer).  He asked if we ended up eating it and I told him yes. He said he had wanted to see the boxes so he could tell who packed it and forgot to put wasabi (I think he was just checking if we were lying about missing wasabi). I told him I did take pictures though and when I showed him pictures he assured us this wouldn&#39;t happen again after telling us &#34;oops looks like they double packed the ginger&#34;.   TOO LATE!

Food- really good price for the amount of food you get, well-made, but our party did notice that a lot of dishes more or less had the same sauce on different meata and vegetables.

Service- I just felt that they had no idea what to do.  Took forever to come and take our order, orders came in all over the place, was generally kinda slow, etc. Ok but not the most wonderful.

I ordered the sesame chicken and was not impress because it had a boring flavor and was soggy, also the chicken was not fresh. I love Chinese food so it could be that I have had such good food in the past that any other restaurant ruins it for me. I got my chicken to go and half the box was filled with chicken and the other half rice. The order also came with a side of soup so I got egg drop. I found corn in my egg drop soup, like what the hell!!! I was fortunate to receive enough food to fill my teenage body, so that pleases me when I have to work a ten hour shift. So in summary good serving amount, but on the down side you might as well eat toilet paper because that has more flavor than whatever these guys were trying to make."

True Story. I no longer look out of my office window and see Union Station, but cows, literally. So when my new coworkers offered to take me out to lunch for my birthday, and I mentioned I loved sushi, I thought they were kidding when they brought up Yum. I mean where can a girl get delicious sushi, other than downtown?

I know, YUM!

I was surprised by the following things:

1. Just how close to the office it is. Only a short drive from my Henderson office.
2. Despite it&#39;s small size, Yum can hold quite the crowd. We had about 7 people joining us and we fit in just fine.
3. Prices are pretty good for what you get...which is alot!
4. The YUM roll is outstanding. With every kind of seafood meat included, holy. Makes for a sushi orgasm in your mouth!

Downside?
 1. I don&#39;t know if it was the size of our party or the communication barrier, but service was not awesome. In fact, all of our food came out separately and service was slow.
booo.

Thai curry was disgusting.  Too sugary; more like a dessert than a main dish.  For your best bet, stick with their Chinese menu; sushi if you&#39;re really craving that.  Their sushi is okay; the specialty rolls are a bit too pricey for what you get...but they are very tasty.

Friendly service. Oddly, in an opposite experience from some others, our drinks were offered immediately as we sat down and refilled constantly.

Prices here are higher than the store in Louisville. I wonder if we are paying the North Range tax - since there is no other sit down Asian competition they can charge whatever they want.

Decent food, but nothing overly special. For good Chinese I would still rather drive all the way back over to Li&#39;s in Westminster. I haven&#39;t tried the Chinese take out down the road - we&#39;ll have to see how they compare to this place.

Not horrible, and a nice place if you like sushi, but nothing to lure downtown Denverites over to it.

A solid 3 - not sure if I am a fan yet or not."

When I called to report the problem they told me that they would send more food out as long as i paid for it again. Really??? They look up your history to see how often you order, i don&#39;t have them deliver often so, they know i don&#39;t order to-go or delivery.

First time was for sushi, and it was.....OK. Not great. How can that be? Isn&#39;t sushi, by it&#39;s very nature, ALWAYS GREAT?

Not necessarily. The nigiri was fine, decent-sized pieces and very fresh, fairly hard to screw that one up. 
But the maki was, well, to be blunt about it, downright WEIRD. 
Unfortunately, the exact name of the roll escapes me at the moment, but it was roughly twice the size of a normal maki roll in cross-section, and covered wiith some strange, pinkish mayo-based sauce, to boot. 

They were probably going for some kind of window-pane effect here, but it didn&#39;t fly with me, and was a pain in the ass to eat, as well. You had to cut the slice in half or even thirds to get it down to bite-sized.

No complaints about the service, competent and friendly.
One cute touch, though: they put some kind of blinking LED cube under a little pile of rice-noodles as a garnish, very festive! Glowing, blinking, noodles, MMMMMM!

Then yesterday, we went down there for lunch, intending to try something from the Chinese side of the menu. I gotta say, I&#39;m getting a little tired of this &#34;Asian fusion bistro&#34; concept that seems to be all the rage these days, because it invariably means that when they try to do all things Asian, they do none of it very well. 

No exception this time, I ordered my standard fall-back Chinese dish, General Tso&#39;s Chicken. I know, I can hear you sneer from here, &#34;That&#39;s not a real Chinese dish!&#34;  What can I say, I LOVE me some General Tso&#39;s, when done right, it&#39;s spicy-crispy-sweet Food Of The Gods.
Not done right here. It was standard sweet-an&#39;-sour chicken, with a few chili flakes thrown in, AND THAT WAS IT, campers. They even left in the standard pineapple chunks/green pepper/onion/carrot medley so common to S&amp;S. Lame. 
\My wife&#39;s Hunan Chicken at least had a few whole szechuan chilies tossed in there, but, again, nuthin&#39; to write home about.

We don&#39;t have ANY nice, sit-down type Chinese places here in Brighton, although we DO have an outstanding take-out joint. We invariably have to drive to another town for sushi, Vietnamese, Thai, etc.  I had high hopes for Yum because, as you can see from the pix, it&#39;s pretty nice inside. 
Don&#39;t get me wrong, if you live in Reunion or North Commerce City, you&#39;re blessed to have something like this. But they&#39;re about as far away as our standard sushi joint in Thornton, Sushi Tokoro, so for me, all I can say about this place is, why bother?"

Oh one more thing, always be careful when you dine in this type of restaurant where the menu is fused. Truly, if you&#39;re good at what you do, you do one type of cuisine, not two.

I&#39;m a sushi gal. If someone gives me a call and even gets the &#39;su&#39; out I&#39;m so in. (hopefully no one will ever call me to go suit shopping) 

Himself is not so much for the &#39;raw fish&#39; thing. He just doesn&#39;t appreciate it. He likes his food to come from something with legs and preferably moo. But I drug him over, promising that there would be *something* he could eat. 

My parent&#39;s were in town and there are several larger &#39;Sushi Bar Entrees&#39; on the menu that are plenty to share. They come from 6-18 pieces of sushi, a roll along with soup or salad. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was that they kind of &#39;surprised&#39; us with the sushi. You didn&#39;t get to pick your fish. They&#39;re also really new so several of the beers/wine on the menu weren&#39;t available.. yet. 

As far as the food went, the fish was fresh and the Miso soup was awesome. Himself got the Kung Pao Chicken which I was was granted one small little bite and it was pretty good. The chicken was well cooked, the breading still nice and crunchy. No complaints there. 

Over all the place was nice and clean. The food was good, and there were several options for the sushi lover, and the not so much. 

I&#39;ll be back. Hopefully they&#39;ll have all of their alcohol choices up by then and I&#39;ll be able to pick my fish!"

Three reasons I love this place:

-Cheap

-Delicious

-Great, quick service

You can be in and out in less than an hour and still get a nice hot breakfast. That&#39;s pretty cool.

If you&#39;re in the area and looking for good, cheap breakfast with great service...look no further.

I&#39;m hungry!  I didn&#39;t want the normal whatever was open at 5:30 in the morning fast muffin thing.  Then it hit me, there&#39;s a Village Inn on my way to work since I am on this side of town now.  

Entry trusty Yelp App...  Look them up and give a call.  I guess before it never dawned on me that you can call in an order for pick up.  This made me happy, very happy.    

It took a few rings for them to pick up the phone as it was ugly early for everyone involved.  Then I was stumped, what the heck did I actually want??  I remembered they made Potato Pancakes, yes that would do nicely.  Well since I had been there last they expanded their Potato Pancake offerings.  They now have Southwest ones and something that my attention Potato Pancakes with Sausage and Gravy.  It&#39;s also served with eggs and some fruit.  No eggs thanks, so they included a little extra sausage and some extra fruit.  

That would do nicely for sure.  A little heavy for the hour, but the good thing is once you have it you can eat it when you actually get to it.  In my case it was closer to 8 when it actually was consumed.  

By the time I arrived at the location, there was my breakfast all bagged up and ready to go.  I was able to quickly pay and get back on the road to work.   For me it&#39;s a great special occasion alternative when I am not in my normal place or just want a little something different and can&#39;t sit and eat.

Came here on Monday with my husband for lunch. It was his way of getting out of cooking for me. After moving here, all I heard was how delicious their breakfasts are and I finally got to test it out!

The location wasn&#39;t very busy and we were seated immediately. I like the decor! It reminds me of the Curtis hotel downtown. Everything is very bright and retro and looks recently updated. The menu is huge and there is no shortage of breakfast delights. They also offer a flat price and you can choose four items from a list.

I had the &#39;it&#39;s all greek to me&#39; omelette, which normally comes with granola and yogurt, and multigrain pancakes. They were out of yogurt and so I had a side of fruit instead. The omelette was delicious and filled with artichokes, spinach, peppers, and cheese. The fruit was pineapple, grapes, and honeydew and was nice and sweet. The pancakes were my favorite part. They&#39;re spicy with cinnamon and so amazingly fluffy and delicious. There was more than enough food and it was all fabulous.

My husband had the combo meal and had the cheese omelette, bacon, hashbrowns, and french toast. He was very pleased with it all and managed to eat most of it.

Overall, service was fabulous and very prompt. Breakfast for the two of us was only ~$30 with tip and I&#39;ll definitely be back! Especially as I saw there&#39;s turkey sausage on the menu! Yippee!!"

First time, I had my service animal with me and they gave us a hard time, insisting that we show our documentation, which we had, but no restaurant has ever given me any issues in the past. That same time, I ordered a quesadilla with chicken, and it came out without chicken. I notified the waitress and her solution was to bring me out a side plate of chicken...so I had a cheese quesadilla with a side plate for chicken. Pretty annoying IMO. 

Second time we went there, we got some margaritas and split the nachos. I am not a fan of places that do not use real cheese, it was like a velveeta or something. Chips got soggy pretty quick and did not taste authentic at all.

3rd time we went for happy hour with a friend and I love the margaritas. We got the nachos (because my friend wanted to try them), and a couple of tacos. The bill still came out to over $100! during happy hour!! And we were all still hungry.

Overall, I think the place is overpriced. Most of the staff is great (with the exception of the waitress that brought me a side of chicken and gave me a hard time for my service animal) but I do not think I will be back because I cannot justify the cost and the food is not really great.

It is not clearly marked with the name out front so just know it is right across the street from Work &amp; Class. The building itself is really interesting and the interior screams EDGY. They have rooftop seating, though I&#39;ve never seen it. The overall atmosphere is very lively and HIP. Lots of attractive looking people who seem to be attached. Oh well. 
The MARGARITAS were delicious and the HOUSE GUACAMOLE is some of the best I&#39;ve had out here in Denver.  It is also a pretty reasonable portion. I am guaranteed to eat through two baskets of house chips each time I come here so I have to pace myself (they&#39;re good).

TACOS: The pork belly ones were the bomb. 

Service the first time was very nice, second time not so much. Our waitress forgot to bring our drink and our guacamole which led to me eating a whole basket of chips without my guac. A bit disappointing. Besides that though I still think this place is a great spot to start at or end at if in Five Points."

Service was pretty good and the orders were taken swiftly. The starters and tacos were average. We had the bad ass fundido along with the steak, chicken, pork, tongue and shrimp tacos which all tasted very similar. Nothing but an average meal."

I stopped in here for lunch while in Denver and was immediately seated downstairs half inside/half outside (perfect combo).  Our waiter, Giegie, was very attentive and got us our drinks ASAP.  I indulged in a spicy margarita, because you can&#39;t judge a Mexican restaurant properly until you try their spicy margs, am I right?

Anyways, we ordered the Tres Pig Nachoes and I will admit that at first I was a little put off by the name/description (&#34;pig ear&#34;) but the pig ear is just chicharones so they were easy to pick off.  The nachoes were the bommbbbb!!! we ate them so fast &amp; in complete silence.  Next we ordered 2 tacos: steak &amp; chicken.  I liked both tacos, but enjoyed the steak one more.

The manager of this place (I forget her name) came up and talked to us for a while &amp; she was so nice!  It&#39;s really refreshing when someone from &#34;behind the scenes&#34; starts up a conversation just because.

If I&#39;m ever back in Denver, I will definitely stop by here again!"

The Space: They have an open kitchen with a bar that sits along it. Since I was flying solo and not wanting to wait terribly long for another seat to open up that worked just fine for me. Over all the decor is fun. Black tile lines the walls with a break ever now and again for a several tile art piece. They have some long tables in the middle to accommodate both larger groups or several smaller ones. I def want to come back and sit on the rooftop patio with some friends next time!

The Drinks: I chose to have the Sangria Rojo (red wine, pineapple juice, exotico reposado, mexi sprite) for my adult beverage. It was tasty! A little strong (not complaining at all) so it made a great sipping drink. Their menu features some great &#34;Ritas&#34; and suggestions of substitutions if you&#39;re looking for some extra kick or a skinny option.

The Menu/Food: I had the chicken leg, shrimp, and pork pastor tacos for my meal. They were delicious! The chicken leg had chingon slaw, guajillo ranch, and crumbled fuego takis. The shrimp taco had chipotle crema, pickled red onion, and cilantro. The pork pastor had grilled pineapple, apple butter, onion, and cilantro. Each taco ranges in price from $3.50 to $4. They are simple pairings, but the flavor is amazing!

The Staff: They are super helpful and happy to answer any questions you have. If you enjoy your meal don&#39;t forget you can buy a 6 pack for the kitchen! At $6 what better way to say thanks for a great meal. Cheers!

All in all it was a great experience and I hope to bring back some friends, grab a seat on the patio, with a carafe of something strong, and nosh on some tasty tacos!"

It&#39;s got a nice roof bar and strong margs.

Tacos were meh and served on a single measly corn tortilla. Service fair- they were out of items and didn&#39;t tell us until the food was about to come out so one of our diners didn&#39;t have anything to eat while we all did.  We also ordered a salsa trio and had to ask where that was because our server never brought it.

Vegetarian selection is a kale salad, a garden taco (seasonal, and limited,  mind you), and guacamole. That&#39;s about it unless there&#39;s something forgettable I&#39;m forgetting to mention.

Come for the atmosphere and drinks- tacos elsewhere for sure.

The environment is always lively and energetic oscillating between comfortably close to packed in like sardines. Come for happy hour if at all possible for the taco special and pork nachos. 

The pork pastor is my favorite taco; I feel that it is worth mentioning that I do not typically favor sweet and savory fare. But the pork taco which includes sautéed pineapple and Applebutter is money. The steak and chicken tacos are my other two go-to&#39;s. The quest fundido with rattlesnake chorizo is a great appetizer as are the Brussels and the kale salad. 

Lastly, do yourself a favor and try their Los Locos lager. Only available at Los Chingones, this light, crispy, limey lager is the perfect accompaniment to an always delightful feast."

There are actually two locations, one in greenwood village. I have been to both and both seem to be the new spot! 

Came for brunch right when they opened and we sat right along a sunny window. This place has an awesome patio when the weather is nice! 

We split a few items on the menu. Complimentary chips were fresh and delicious. Started eight the shrimp ceviche, it had a smokey chipotle flavor. We then split the enchilada and tacos (waitress recommended one with this delicious crispy cheese). 

The food was well made and did not take forever! Bar area was beautiful and the decor of the restaurant was casual but edgy. I will be back, especially to the patio!"

I really like that chip and salsa are included in your meal and you have something to snack on while you wait for your order. Seriously a huge perk. Our server was friendly, but could&#39;ve been better-my water was empty and needed a refill a few times and I had to flag her down, we would&#39;ve liked more chips but she was nowhere to be found. With the restaurant closing in about an hour, it wasn&#39;t busy, so it shouldn&#39;t be that hard to check on your tables right?

Ordered the steak taco and the pastor pork. I preferred the pastor but both were great. I&#39;m a sucker for a good pastor taco, and I really liked that they added apple butter to give it an extra boost of flavor. I don&#39;t recall what exactly the wild card taco my friend got was, but I know it had cactus and he said it was really pretty good. 

From what I hear, this isn&#39;t THE taco place (Pinches/tacos tequila whiskey supposedly is, so I&#39;ll have to try it out), but this is definitely a contender. If you&#39;re in the 5 points area and looking for something easy and casual, this is a good spot."

The patio is fantastic, and it was a great Friday afternoon for a patio.  That&#39;s the positive.

The server explained a great number of changes on the menu, even noting a 50 cent increase in prices of several items we had no intention of ordering.  I had the taquitos, &#34;an excellent choice&#34; according to the server.  They were OK at best, but I&#39;m talking Jack-In-The-Box $3 OK.  The queso appetizer was greasy and sad.

I tried to order a dirty martini.  No vermouth or olive juice (???).  So I ordered a bloody mary instead.  They didn&#39;t have bloody mary mix, so they served me, essentially, vodka and hot sauce.  It was disgusting.  To have a bar without being able to serve two of the basics of a BAR was stunning.

I expected a manager to come over and address these issues...nope.  We were clearly not happy with our experience, and no effort was given to satisfy us.  Bad service, bad food, no drinks...a waste of time and money. 

Shockingly disappointing."

We went to Los Chingones last month for drinks, after eating dinner across the street at Cart Driver. We walked to the upstairs bar and sat down right away. We were promptly greeted by the friendly bartender. I ordered the Smokey Pina-Rita. I hate to complain about my drink, but I should have asked first if it was spicy before I ordered. It was literally too spicy for me to drink. I mentioned it to the bartender and she gave me a menu and said not to worry she would make me something else, no charge. The second drink was perfect. We ordered some chips, salsa and guac. The house salsa is so good!! I wasn&#39;t even that hungry but couldn&#39;t resist, because it was just that yummy! I would like to go back soon for dinner.

Great atmosphere on the rooftop, where we usually sit. Good service. We get the guacamole or queso with rattlesnake chorizo almost every time. I love that they are open late on the weekends too.

For tacos this isn&#39;t the top place in Denver, but the lamb neck and octopus are amazing! I get the lamb neck every time now. My boyfriend enjoys the steak and chicken. Really good chips and salsa to munch on while you wait. I know the margaritas are good but we typically just get cans of beer. I would recommend this place for groups or a fun date night.

On my last trip they took 20 minutes to get us drinks. When I asked for an extra salsa that costs money (house salsa is free) it never came. Both tacos were cold and on cold tortillas. The fish taco had no mention of cabbage on it on the menu. It came with cabbage. The ceviche was honestly gross and we couldn&#39;t even finish it.

The saving grace as always was the T&amp;T cocktail which is one of my favorites in Denver and of course the awesome rooftop patio."

First off, this place was waaaay too dark. My mother in law had to use her phone flash light to see the menu.

Second, they were out of empanadas. That is ALL that I wanted.

Third, most of the food was terrible. We ended up basically eating chips with multiple different dips for dinner. The steak taco was actually surprisingly pretty good. Other than that though- NO. 

Free salsa- OK, pretty spicy- too spicy for my taste

Tres pigs nachos- Nope. Tasted like melted cheese with mushy meat on chips

Los chingoges style guac- sounded VERY interesting but definitely tasted weird with rattlesnake chorizo

Bad ass fundido- MEH.

Again, the menu didn&#39;t have much except for dips for chips. TERRIBLE dinner.

My father in law said the margarita was WAY too strong as well.

I had 3 tacos, octopus, shrimp and either pork/beef I can&#39;t really remember because all the Tacos pretty much tasted and looked exactly the same. They were mini and yellow. They tasted OK, but the octopus tasted like the shrimp, the shrimp tasted like the pork taco. The landmeat tasted like the octopus.  If I closed my eyes I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell which one I was eating. Even with my eyes open I could barely tell which was which.

We were looking for a great patio and figured Los Chingones would do the trick. We got to the restaurant around 3 and wanted to sit on the patio, the hostess was very nice and she found a spot for us at a table upstairs. For fear of getting sunburned we moved quickly to the bar upstairs because it provided more shade for our pasty skin. 

We ordered a couple of margaritas. They were fine, not very strong, but that was probably for the best. We also ordered the nachos and ceviche. The bartender forgot to enter the ceviche, so it took a little while to get to us. It was pretty good and the nachos were tasty as well. My one complaint, however, is that the bartender knew very little about the menu - he told us there was rattlesnake in the nachos when the menu stated clearly that the nachos had three types of pork, he also didn&#39;t know if we could order a side of pinto beans, and generally just seemed confused and somewhat forgetful. 

Overall, great location and atmosphere (although it would be appreciated if they would turn down the music just a pinch so we can hear in conversation). The food is pretty on point, but the service, as we experienced it, could use a bit of improvement."

We got the white fish ceviche as our starter and it was wonderful. We also got the lunch special of 3 tacos. All the tacos were good I did think that the beef cheek was pretty chewy so I think that one was my least favorite; however, I would order the other two again (pork shoulder and chicken).

Add some lobster tacos, and fancy guac to the table and it&#39;s a party. With their festive decor, loud music and big booths for groups, Los Chingones is most definitely a party restaurant. One of those parties where you sit down to enjoy a tasty meal with friends and the aforesaid strong adult beverage.

Might I also add that they make a mean beer margarita? You know, the kind you get on south of the border trips, with the half bottle of Corona mixed in the glass. In Cabo, they call &#39;em &#34;bulldogs&#34;and in Denver they call &#39;em &#34;Beergaritas&#34;. Either way, it&#39;s vacation in a glass.

My friend and I got 5 tacos all together and also the taquitos. My favorite taco was definitely the chicken leg which I liked over all the fish choices. My second after was the kobe beef. The meat was so tender and flavorful! The taquitos were pretty good and it was a decent portion. However, the sauce it came with lacked a kick and was too sweet. I asked if they had any alternative hot sauces and the waiter kindly gave me a mango habanero sauce which was perfection with the taquitos but my mouth was on fire!

This is a summer staple for my crew. Excellent street tacos, strong margs, and can we please talk about those pig ear nachos????? I seriously dream about them. 

This afternoon we came here, parched and starved after a pool party, and definitely weren&#39;t disappointed. Service was attentive and friendly, and the food was great. I got a beef taco, pork shoulder, and a white fish taco and all were warm, flavorful, and unique. I do think you need to have an adventurous palette to eat here so keep that in mind. The salsa actually has a kick to it which is rare, and although the chips get doused in salt which is not that great,  they come out warm which makes a huge difference! 

Only cons: they took away the tongue taco which we were all obsessed with (seasonal menu I guess), and the pig nachos I mentioned earlier are $12 dollars normally as compared to $5 happy hour. Today I wanted to get them as a side until I saw the jacked up price. Boooooo!!! Oh well....

See u many a days this summer Los Chingones!"

After finally locating a decent parking spot, we made our way to the rooftop and sat on some funky chairs which overlooked the neighborhood. A few servers came by, each saying, &#34;Someone will be with you soon!&#34;

We sat drinkless for probably close to 20 minutes. We chatted, glanced over the menu, and finally were greeted by a nice young blonde girl and we were able to put in our order. It took a verrrryyyy long time for the drinks to come out. We kept glancing around, wondering if we had been forgotten. From then on, we decided to order another drink as our current one was being dropped off, in order to time things correctly (this should not be the case, obviously).

Wow the happy hour here is awesome! I ordered a couple street tacos, even though they are small I found them to be very filling. Flavors are amazing. These aren&#39;t your average tacos, they have a lot of interesting ingredients and flare. We also had the pig nachos which I believe were $5 on happy hour...out of this world!

Totally coming back for happy hour!"

I didn&#39;t try any of the entrees but the others in my group ordered the tamal and chile relleno and liked them. I would come back here during happy hour.

What makes them so good?  Their chips.  Light, warm, fluffly, lightly salted, don&#39;t break when you dip them in the array of killer salsas this restaurant makes.  Their tacos.  Ingredients are fresh and the menu is creative and fun.  Their service. I&#39;ve been here six times and always had a great experience with waiters and bartenders.  The drinks are delicious and the employees are always willing to let you try new things and sides free of charge.  Last time I visited during lunch, I was fortunate enough to meet Claire, a super friendly manager who is on the ball!  She gave us a tray of six salsa assortments and went out of her way to make sure we had a good time.

I highly recommend this restaurant for work lunches, friend lunches, happy hours with anyone, dates, and a great place to go grab a drink before you go out.  10/10."

Also ordered the Red Chile Pork Shoulder taco.  Talk about delicious, I could barely fit my lips around this heaping pile of succulent pork!

The service was great. This past trip the server was on target and super friendly up until food was brought out. I ordered tacos and my friend ordered a quesadilla. They brought out my food first, stating mine was ready first and they didn&#39;t want it to get cold while they finished the quesadilla. This is a pet peeve of mine as instead of the food sitting under a heat lamp, I have to sit with it in front of me, as its gets cold. Rude to eat before all the food comes out, no? After our food came out, I think the server kind of forgot about us. It was a Sunday night, restaurant slowing down, but we waited quite a while to ask for the check.

The tacos (chicken, pork, and shrimp) were delicious. The shrimp one was my favorite! I hear the quesadilla with chicken was super tasty. The margarita packed a push, a super delicious one!

Fish tacos are ok. The aioli sauce tastes leafy and plain. The fish was cooked well, no added flavor. Over all, it&#39;s a boring taco, which is just fine. 
Lamb neck tacos are sweet in flavor. Very good, a surprise if you are not expecting it. 
Agua Fresca today is a watery Orchata, not bad. Very good but not typical of Mexican Orchata. Very light and refreshing. 
Salsa! Very good salsas. Chips are perfectly salted! 
There are several. I&#39;d recommend buying them all, you don&#39;t know which you might like! 
Come here for lunch and if you want a snack between bar hopping. Tacos are 3.50-4 each. Salsa 1.50

Sure, they may not be entirely &#34;authentic&#34; and come with some American influence, but this restaurant has it figured out.  Every taco I&#39;ve tried or one of my lunch/dinner mates has tried has knocked our socks off.

To start, I love the layout of the restaurant.  There is plenty of outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant and up on the rooftop.  The rooftop is hopping if the sun is shining, so if there&#39;s a spot on the patio, just grab it.  If you&#39;re inside, try to nab a seat where you can see the cooks working their a**es off to get all the tacos out.

The drinks: margs are awesome.  They start strong, so be forewarned.  And while I love me some margaritas, I think their best kept secret might be the mojito.  I&#39;m not a fan of a strong minty mojito, and the good news is that Los Chingones serves up their version with some mint simple syrup, which is much less potent.

All the tacos are winners.  I&#39;m a fan of the tingas (chicken), but I also love the shrimp and carnitas.  Any version of steak is a good bet, as are the plan cheese tacos.  Depending on what you want, they&#39;ve got it.  The chips and salsa are some of the best in the area--the salsa varieties they have are all worth trying.  Not to mention, the brussel sprouts are legit.  Yes, I said it.  Brussel sprouts at a taco joint--they come with some cotija cheese and some lime-type sauce--served up nice and crispy.  Don&#39;t miss out."

I had to order 2 of them because they were that good. Our happy hour margaritas were delicious too. My friend and I shared the pig nachos and they were ok.

Being one of the many who still claims Tacos, Tequila, and Whiskey boasts the best taco in Denver, I had to give this a shot to compete. 

We arrived for happy hour on a Monday (HH is 3-6 during the week) and ordered three $2 tacos each, a house margarita, and some Brussels sprouts to share. 

First of all, those Brussels sprouts. Wow. I am going to have dreams about those. Some sort of balsamic reduction in perfectly crispy and pan friend sprouts, sprinkled with what looked to me like queso fresco and fresh parsley. OK. Bomb. My tastebuds are dancing and the tacos haven&#39;t even arrived. 

Now for the meat, literally. Out comes a lamb, steak, and BBQ pork taco. Let&#39;s talk about the pork first. Tender, slow cooked pork with a BBQ glaze. Awesome. Juicy. Seemed it could&#39;ve used something else, but hey, it&#39;s $2 and amazing. 

Steak next. Oh my. As close to melt in your mouth as a steak taco can get. Loved this one. 

Lastly, the lamb taco, which was out of this world. Juggling bites of tender lamb, fresh chips and (homemade ?) salsa, spicy and sweet, and a swig of a just right margarita? Yeah. Clear your schedule, because we just reached peak tastebud overload. 

On a random Monday for happy hour I left Los Chingones with my taste receptors on overload, my mind buzzing, and my pocket less than $15 emptier. I could not have been more impressed. Oh, did I mention they have an entire menu of eats that I still have yet to try? We&#39;ll cover that in part two. 

Cheers to Los chingones!!!"

We came here in the early afternoon for drinks / food and tried several different signature cocktails.  The Urban Legend is my favorite. :)  This twist on a margarita has cabrito blanco accompanied by the deadly combination of mexi coke and pop rocks.  They poor the pop rocks in at your table and they make somewhat of a mess but it is so fun!  This makes the drink fun to drink and it is also pretty tasty. We then asked our waiter to bring something anothe rone of his favorites, so he gave us a T&amp;T which has tequila, lime, TANG, orange soda.  This was much sweeter and not as good as the first, but still yummy. They then brought a palomo classico which had Cabrito Blanco, fresh grapefruit juice, and sprite.  This was great as well. 

For food we all shared free chips and salas aand my dining partners got a cheese quesadilla, and a burrito, while I got a buzz.

Saturday before Vday so we went early to avoid a wait. Arrived about 6pm -10 min wait for a &#34;table&#34; which ended up being the end of a long community high top. It has a modern industrial vibe with some Mexican decor. Not too loud. Upstairs bar/patio looks like it will be nice in summer. 

Service-took a while for anyone to come over. Brought us water and chips and salsa and waitress said she would be right back. We decided what we wanted to eat and laid out menus down but it was probably another 10 minutes before she came to get our order. We found out the reason it took so long was that the kitchen was out of a lot of stuff and she kept having to go back to her tables to get new orders. Evidently it was a nice day (in February) and so they opened the rooftop patio for lunch. This caused them to be out of 3 of the 5 entrees on the menu! A manager came over to check on us later in the meal and comped a round of margs bc  of it (and tacos-see below).
Food- house salsa is delicious! We tried a flight of 3 of their others which pretty much all tasted the same and were more like gravy consistency than salsa. Don&#39;t waste your money. Guac was fresh but bland. Didn&#39;t taste any cumin, or even salt? Chicken enchiladas were awesome! I thought it was odd to put kale on top but actually it was a great compliment to favors. Hubs wanted lamb shank but they were out. Manager said they were taking it off the menu anyway. He ended up ordering 5 tacos instead. My plate was too hot to touch, but his tacos were barely room temperature. They remade them and got them out quickly. 

Drinks- interesting selection of cocktails. The house marg wasn&#39;t bad but not great either for $8. Tried coin style for $2 more and it was quite good. Hubs tried the tang one and liked it but too sweet for me. Several of them have soda as a mixer?

We will probably go back over the summer to sit up top and have tacos/drinks."

We decided to very wisely go in and try this place on a Saturday night at 7. We&#39;re definitely going to have to wait for a table, right? Wrong. We were sat immediately and our waiter was on point the whole night. 

The food was awesome (unfortunately I was a bit too wastey faced by the end of the night to remember it all). I do however remember the quesadilla and that thing was probably the best &#34;Mexican&#34; food I have eaten since moving to Denver 4 years ago. 

Good job Guard. Good job."

As we drove away we couldn&#39;t stop talking about how impressed we were. The food was amazing. Every thing we had from the garden guac down to the warm salted peanut butter and white chocolate cookies they brought us at the end of the meal. To compliment the ridiculous food, the service was honestly the best I&#39;ve experienced in years. The closest I&#39;ve experienced to service like that is 5-star dining. That restaurant is a team. They communicated and met our every need before we knew we needed something. I think every server in the restaurant came by our table at some point, despite the fact that it was busting at the seams. And they were so delightful and thoughtful of our little one. I can&#39;t say enough. We will be frequenting this place. Go now. Just go."

Los C&#39;s was hopping but it seems like a normal thing here. Margarita was extremely over priced and all ice :( I didn&#39;t try any of the tacos, because honestly none of them sounded remotely appetizing. They are trying to be cutting edge, but I like a normal taco. K? Thanks. 

Chili relleno was extremely average.

Overall if I want tacos I would rather go to a more authentic Mexican restaurant. Definitely did not live up to the hype for me. Will not be returning."

I was surprised that Denver&#39;s got a gem in Downtown serving Mexican food to the next level! Chef Sharif served this amazing mussels with slices of orange drizzled in a special sauce! That&#39;s a dish to try.  That was heaven! Ceviche was light and fresh.
I ordered the Kobe beef tacos, shrimp tacos,
Octopus tacos. Of course we had amazing cocktails to go with the 4th of July celebration.  they don&#39;t skimp on the alcohol! Lovely place for casual dining with amazing menus."

I could see saying that there are differences between the two, but &#34;better than Pinche&#34;? No. The tacos, while thoughtful, are less robust. The menu is creative and intriguing, and the food was not underwhelming, it was all pretty good. However, our server rushed us out of there so quick the whole experience was merely a blur. We ordered two drinks before we ordered dinner so clearly we were there to have a good time but we were turned over in 45 minutes, food came out unbelievably quickly. I understand the tables need to be turned but this seemed a little aggressive.

Now, for the real reason behind the 2 star rating. A handful of us visited the DTC location, we were all eating and drinking. We ordered shots of some marque of Maestro Dobel at around $11 a piece. The server asked if we &#34;wanted those neat.&#34; I found this puzzling considering we specified shots, and at that price point what other way would we want it? So we had about 12 shots total. When we received the check there was a $1 up charge for &#34;neat.&#34; I had a discussion with the server and he said that if the shots were chilled there would have been no up charge. Why would I order an $11 shot and want it shaken over ice? That&#39;s what you do with products like Fireball, Jäger, Hornitos...in short, you are being charged for an inherent aspect of the liquor you are buying, paying extra for what should be expected. If you&#39;re the idiot that wants an $11 shot chilled then you should specify it. Had I ordered a spirit without specifying a shot, implying it might go in a rocks glass...then terms like &#34;neat&#34; and &#34;rocks&#34; come into the equation. &#34;The Glenlivet 15 neat.&#34;  Not &#34;a shot of Maestro Dobel neat.&#34; Disappointing."

This being said, consistency can be off especially during the slower hours. The quality, as someone said below, has been lessening a bit lately. 

The service is hit or miss as well. Some of the wait staff are very good while others may forget you are there. I&#39;ve walked out on this place twice due to having to wait 10 minutes to be greeted by anyone after I&#39;ve been sat - even when I was one of only 3 or 4 tables that were in there. It&#39;s hard to watch waiters chatting with each other when you&#39;re trying to get something to eat and the place is empty. Other times I&#39;ve been greeted right away and the service was great. So, again, it is hit or miss.

I&#39;ve never had a problem with the drinks and I think they are the most consistent thing about this place. The atmosphere during their busier hours is good as well. I would recommend this place on a Friday or Saturday night if you are getting food and drinks as that is when they have all of their best staff on. If you go another day it won&#39;t be terrible, but it may not be great."

The food is amazing. Every item on the menu has its own unique flavor. 

At lunch, I recommend the Bento Box... Today&#39;s feature was Corn Tortillas, Steak, Guacamole, Rice, Lentils and a kale salad (with a kick).  I LOVED it!!   

For dinner, we usually order an assortment of tacos (love the steak, shrimp, chicken and pork) and enchiladas.  But make sure to try some appetizers: Los Chignones Style Guac  and Tres Pigs Nachos are our favorites.

FYI There is a newer Los Chingones in the DTC area... They have the benefit of having a &#34;raw bar&#34; (for the seafood lover).

Every Yelper that is like &#34;this is my favorite neighborhood restaurant&#34; definitely knows what&#39;s up, because this place greatly surpassed my expectations in pretty much every way.

The restaurant has a really breezy, open decor, with long common tables and big windows. When you step in here you can tell everyone is having fun and all the waiters seem psyched to be working in such an enjoyable spot.

The food, though, is why I am giving this place 5 stars. The tacos I tried here were just really, really superb. The chicken leg taco here was probably the best chicken-based taco I have ever had anywhere. The chicken skin in it and the tongue-in-cheek addition of Sun Chips just really put it over the edge.

The octopus taco was probably my second favorite but it was astoundingly delicious and absolutely packed with meat. The pork shoulder taco, which was incredibly flavorful, and the very rich shrimp taco were also very good. 

The Brussels Sprouts were sour and sweet and spicy and just really delicious. They were deep fried and covered in this addictive orange sauce. Definitely give them a try.

Anyway, I just really enjoyed myself here and I hope to come back again someday. Maybe I&#39;ll be all old and gray and I will sit down slowly with tears in my eyes and order four servings of the chicken taco."

The hustle and bustle of watching all the chefs prepare all the food. I swear I was drooling watching it all happen.  I got to see everything before i ordered!

This place has great tacos! And you don&#39;t need many to become full. I had three: the special which was buffalo with blue cheese, shredded pork, and beef. There are so many other choices on the menu too. Also try the guac, was good and they give you a decent chop basket and salsa.

I also saw them making amazing looking salads, nachos, more tacos and more tacos... suffice it to say, they are awesome quick and I had my food before I could blink...

The tacos tip to the expensive side for my taste but I can live with it for how delish they are. You also have to pay for chips and salsa which is my least favorite thing of all time but this place is fantastic.
First of all, the atmosphere is *kisses fingertips like an Italiano* perfect. Cute waiters dancing around and bringing you tacos. I&#39;m not joking, they dance and sing. It just looks like working there would be THE most fun.
Food: everything is excellent. Crazy tacos, incredible nachos and brunch food to die for. Breakfast Chilequiles are like Breakfast nachos, just so ya&#39;ll know. Chicken and waffles taco is also on the menu so good luck choosing.
Margs are great too: short (I prefer tequila always tall) but that&#39;s ok."

This place has such a neat patio with a great view. For our group of 10, we were seated on their roomy patio area, which was a relief as it was clear a group that large would have trouble squeezing into any area on the lower level. In contrast to the lower level where we waited, the patio is large, open, and not the least cramped. 

On to the food! I decided to try a variety of items from the menu: per the server&#39;s recommendation, I chose the Brussels sprouts over the corn salad, an order of taquitos, and the Mahi taco. The Brussels sprouts, roasted and topped with lime, chile, cojita cheese and a special sweet / sour sauce, was incredibly delicious. My second favorite was the Beer-Battered Mahi Taco--fresh, flavorful, delicious. Like many of my friends at our table, you probably can&#39;t go wrong ordering 3 or 4 of their tacos for your meal. The taquitos are not the best--they were bursting with flavor but cooked almost too hard and crispy. Choose something else if you are thinking of ordering these.

Service was stellar and very friendly! Great place to grab drinks, grub, and hang out!"

Happy hour is great here too. Drink specials for happy hour usually include a special drink del dia. It&#39;s a fun environment to sit on the rooftop with friends and enjoy the day.

The vegetarian reuben is pretty tasty. Nothing amazing, but the tempeh is loose and there is a good amount of thousand island that&#39;s not too overwhelming.

This is one of our most frequented restaurants. We have a hard time when it comes to eating sandwiches because I get tired of the same ol&#39; vegetarian options. This place blows it out of the water with the selection of warm vegetarian, cold vegetarian, and warm and cold meat sandwich options. I&#39;ve tried many of the vegetarian options and they are all wonderful. I always enjoy the roasted vegetables that are still nice and slightly crispy. (Usually) 

Are you gluten free? No worries, they also have gluten free options here! I love that they offer different options for all types of diet restrictions. Not only is the food good, but they offer such fun decor. It&#39;s mainly superhero&#39;s and funny artwork. There is also a chalkboard that customers can write on. My daughter thinks it&#39;s great that her daddy can draw her pictures. Lol! 

The biggest bonus is that they tell you to pick a card from a deck of cards that are spread out. This serves as your table number for when they bring out your food. If you choose the Joker card, then one of your sandwiches are FREE! Who doesn&#39;t love free food for no reason at all?"

I got a smaller sized one on wheat. I really appreciated the freshness of the bread, and the texture of real whole wheat goodness. I definitely tasted little nutty nubs of wheat. The sandwich as a whole was super flavorful. Their red sauce was quite good with rich tomato flavors and a bright bite of oregano. The grilled onions were perfect, caramelized strands of joy. The tempeh was nutty and absorbed the sauce well. The black olives were of good quality and helped meld everything together.

A joker equals a free sandwich and the card serves as your order number. 

I ordered the tempeh Bangkok sandwich on wheat. The hubs didn&#39;t see the sandwiches were all on French bread so when he ordered his Reuben he was expecting the classic. French bread is not a Reuben so he would argue it should just be called a pastrami sandwich.

Digging in, I realized that the salad was not only bountiful, but it had the freshness, flavor and all of the fixings that I was looking for.

And that&#39;s how we got to Fivestarville, USA, with me as your pilot. Based off of my experience, I can confidentially say that what I ate can only be described as a stupid-good salad.

Tonight I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop by for the sandwich I used to get often, the Alps made vegan. I order my food and sit outside and soon after someone drops off a sandwich. I open it up and it does not look right but I take a bite. The cheese does not taste vegan at all and I realize they gave me the wrong sandwich. Already annoyed I go back in and as I walk up a guy runs up to me and asks if I ordered the vegan sandwich. I say yeah I did and he hands me one and says sorry you got the wrong one. I walk back to my seat open it up and it&#39;s a tempeh sandwich, again not what I ordered. Now I have two sandwiches in front if front of me I did not order and do not want to eat. I tell the lady that I really just want the vegan alps I paid for. 

After waiting awhile she comes out drops off a sandwich apologizes sincerely for the two wrong ones and walks back inside. Guess what? It&#39;s the wrong sandwich AGAIN! It is mushrooms but they are covered in cold marinara sauce and there is no vegan cheese. At this point I&#39;m almost late to where I need to be and just leave.

They sell cold, bland shredded beef as a pot roast sandwich. The menu even says &#34;fresh beef roasted and sliced daily&#34;. Pot roast should be sliced, thicker than Roast beef, and tender, but not shredded.  When I did complain, the cook told me I must have meant to order the Roast Beef sandwich. No, I am a trained chef, and I do know the difference.  I grew up in New England, trust me, I know a pot roast, and pot roast sandwiches from the leftovers!  I would NEVER spend another dime there, I would not recommend to anyone, and I didn&#39;t ask for a refund just to show you that I wasn&#39;t looking for something for free. If you want to charge over $10 for a $4.50 sandwich, it better be the best sandwich I have ever eaten, not the worst.

While I hunted for a parking spot, she pulled up reviews for Sub Culture on Yelp, which left us empowered to give it a try. Its proximity alone to our destination was appealing - but the menu is really what pulled our heart strings.

For years, I have been dying for a delicious, cheesy, meatball parmesan equivalent. I finally met my match with the tempeh parmesan. The bread was pretty typical - but the sauce and the tempeh and the gooey cheese - they really know how to make a girl swoon. Add to that fountain Boylan&#39;s and I&#39;m a happy kid. 

As a vegetarian, it&#39;s exceedingly rare to go to a sandwich shop and have actually options other than a sad salad on a bun. But this place left me conflicted between all the possibilities. And what a good conflict it was! 

My friend opted to take a gamble on the special, and it paid off. Sadly, neither of us pulled a Joker from the deck, so we had to pay for our meals - but it really was worth every penny."

First! I took the pickles out (I dont like pickles, I know, it&#39;s crazy), then I dug in. It was delicious, and the white sub bread was pretty amazing -- crusty and held my sandwich together through the BBQ and slaw. It was a hefty meal, one at which I exclaimed, &#34;This is huge!&#34; and then finished in 5 minutes, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t have told people I thought it would be too much food.

We wandered over here after a nice visit to the Kirkland on a Sunday afternoon and we were pulled in by the beautiful long picnic tables and their outdoor seating area. What a great space!

Frankly we just wanted to bask in the February sun outside, but ended up being incredibly pleased with the sub menu! The menu is so long and ingenious that we probably took 20 minutes to decide what amazing sandwich were each going to have.

I was thrilled to find out they have gluten-free bread and my sandwich was therefore perfect! I can&#39;t remember what mine was called but it was roast beef mozzarella and really great French gluten-free bread. Way to go! Huge plus:  the friendly staff made my day!"

This place is awesome! They have a bunch of different types of subs that are so creative. I didn&#39;t try the slow cooked beef but I will definitely be back to try it. I had the chicken pesto sandwich on wheat and it was really good. The only letdown was the bread. Bread makes a sandwich for me and with the caliber of sandwich types they had on the board I would have thought the bread would have been better.

I can&#39;t help but compare the two; they are the same exact concept right down to the personal pitchers of alcohol. 

However, Sub Culture is just not as impressive to me. The sandwiches are pretty good but not great. The bread is just okay, sometimes a little dry. They do have a lot of options for sandwiches but none of them have yet to blow me away. The sandwiches are far more creative than, say, Subway but not nearly the same caliber of those at Half Fast. 

I like that they offer personal pitchers of mixed drinks, but that being said, I&#39;m not a huge fan of the mixed drinks here. The margarita is alright but none of the others seem very appealing to me. They have happy hour from 3-6 (dollar off drafts/cocktails) so it&#39;s nice to be able to grab a drink and sit out on their patio.

I&#39;ve had one sandwich every Saturday for the past several months. Yes, it&#39;s that good, and no I don&#39;t have a problem. You&#39;ll see why that is true when you go here. Soft, warm bread. Juicy meats. Grilled onions. Cheese. All those things that Americans like. This one sandwich has made Fat Jack&#39;s a distant memory and Snarfs a scrunch of the nose. Also excellent is every other sandwich on the menu, which I can&#39;t vouch for, but have heard from the &#34;YUMs!&#34; coming from fellow sandwich consumers.

My only complaint? Parking is limited. So walk, bike or crawl to Sub Culture to experience your own sandwich nirvana. If not, they offer bike delivery for your lazy ass. Take my advice, skip the frozen meal you&#39;re about to eat and go get a sandwich. It&#39;ll rock your socks off."

So far I&#39;ve tried the Tuna Melt and Roma on wheat. The Tuna Melt was super good, tuna with cheddar on top served warm with just the right amount of mayo. I took it with me to go and when I finally sat to eat it (~20mins later) the bread was still chewy on the outside and not soggy. The Roma is vegetarian and the different vegetables topped with pesto was filling even without meat, so highly recommend both. The best part though, is they play this &#34;gambling&#34; game where they let you pick a giant card out of a giant deck. They use this card to bring you your food (like a table number) but in addition, some cards let you have a free sub! They&#39;ll only do this if you say you&#39;re dining-in but as the guy told me, they wrap it the same way whether you dine-in or do to-go so might as well... And did I mention they serve alcohol?

Personally, I like being a part of different sub cultures - heck I&#39;m a Yelper! When this place took over for the fish joint I was ever so excited - a good sandwich is hard to come by. This place does an excellent job at it though.

For starters - BEER! How can you not love a sandwich shop that serves cheap beer? Check out Happy Hour and pull up a seat on tha patio while the weirdos of Cap Hill walk past. So much entertainment.

When you walk in the front door the HUGE menu is on the wall to the left. Hot or cold, larger or larger sammies a-plenty! I usually get the Yaya + with turkey cheese avocado tomato and lettuce. Total yum. The hot sandwiches are great in the wintertime too. I really like that for 8 bucks you can get almost two meals.

At the register they post little factoids each day so you can learn something new and bring a little &#34;culture&#34; into your life. When dining inside there is usually a solid play list and ample sitting room. Another cool thing is when you dine in you pull an oversized playing card from their deck. If you get the Joker you eat for free! Leave it up to chance - cuz why not?

All in all I&#39;m a fan of this place because of it&#39;s laid back attitude and ease. Nice location, chill staff and not too many stinky hipster patrons like one might think. It&#39;s a solid city sandwich shop."

I have a wheat allergy, so I&#39;m unfortunately kind of used to the compromise, but having the restaurant know their ingredients and pay attention to those kinds of order details, AND getting a call confirming them, was amazing!

Was extremely curious, and pulled the trigger! Unfortunately after ordering I discovered that I was out of there boundaries for delivery and I was unable to leave the office. Sadly I realized that Mondays are the real deal and I was going have to settle... When suddenly my phone rang and the owner said he would personally deliver to my office! Once delivered he said it wasn&#39;t a problem and he was pleased to do so, but normally they stick to a bike friendly region for delivery (good to know), because it is more economically friendly!

Don&#39;t let the menu deceive you there are really only three different combinations of the same sandwich. But worst of all they don&#39;t stand by their business hours or services. They close spontaneously, they don&#39;t deliver when it&#39;s cold out, when it snows, when it rains or when the hipster bike delivery guy is too drunk. Despite all that, they might take your order if you have gauged ears, a fixie or you just look homeless."

The last time I was here this was an empty parking lot, so I&#39;m glad they made something of the space. 

The service was really friendly; the employees were very nice and let me take my time staring at the huge menu. It&#39;s a bit overwhelming; I ended up going with a salad, and ordered the turkey. I&#39;m pretty sure I went with balsamic as the dressing, but I actually ended up not using it, and just using the sambal, sriracha and other condiments as dressing. Honestly I&#39;d do that again, not that the dressing was bad, but the chile and hot sauces worked really well with my salad. It was a very large portion and was filled with a lot of the listed ingredients, and all were good quality. 

My food came with garlic bread and I absolutely love that you can get wheat garlic bread. I also got some sort of drink, and enjoyed the hilarious picture labels on the drink machine (Want Iced T? then push the picture of Ice T. 3 guesses what you push for Ice Cubes). My food did take a few minutes, despite a fairly empty restaurant, and my meal was around $11-12. It&#39;s not exactly a cheap lunch but it was a good lunch. If I&#39;m in the area again I&#39;ll certainly come back, and this time actually try a sandwich."

The only downsides: the bread is almost always really, really dry for some reason, no matter whether you&#39;ve ordered hot or cold, drenched in horseradish sauce or just lettuce &amp; tomato.

I&#39;ve never been a sandwich kinda gal, cause most vegetarian subs are over priced and under fulfilling.

How wrong I was. First, we stopped by on the way to the DCPA, and I had the Alps, which was creamy, cheese, veggie-y and overall, delicious...though clearly, unlike Subway where a foot long is barely enough, the 12&#34; was far more food than I needed. My partner got some turkey action, and polished it off in no time. I followed up this trip with a quick stop before Presidential Debate Bingo at Beauty Bar, and branched out for their veggie rueben.

I LOVE vegan/vegetarian ruebens, like WOHA, and have eaten them at places nation wide. This one is hands down the best vegetarian ruben I&#39;ve yet to have. It was amazing, fulfilling, warm, delicious, and oh, vege-freaking-tarian. Mega thumbs up, and I&#39;ll be back to try the rest of their delicious looking offerings!"

I gave tuna melt a shot and it wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. Extra large pieces of lettuce overwhelmed a small serving of tuna salad that wasn&#39;t really warm enough to melt the cheese. Plus, the main ingredient was sloshed on sloppily, leaving about 30% of the bread empty. Honestly, I&#39;ve seen Quizno&#39;s do better.

I like a sandwich, if done correctly. 

The menu is good, it has quite a variety.
When I&#39;ve ordered, my sandwich has been right, but nothing to brag about.
A fellow co-worker has ordered from there 3 times- carry out (she really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt), They messed up her order each time. Mind you, it was not a difficult order: no lettuce, extra tomatoes.  NOPE!

Two other co-workers ordered a salad - NOT! The lettuce was wilted, and just not good!

Prices - a bit pricey, so you&#39;d expect something good.

Don&#39;t waste your time, instead go to Quiznos which is just down the block, or better yet, order from Snarf&#39;s, which is at 11th and Corona (Wait, don&#39;t do that, as that will make them even more popular, and I think they have the BEST sandwiches around!) Their review to come!

After seeing place after place in and out of there, it seems like the spot is cursed.  And when I heard that a sub shop was going in there, my little heart leapt for joy.  

I&#39;ve eaten here several times, but the quality is just not up to Snarf&#39;s or Mr. Lucky&#39;s- sadly.  I&#39;d probably eat here much more often if it was, seeing as it&#39;s just around the corner.  The sandwiches lack flavor- they just miss something.  It&#39;s hard to taste the horseradish/mayo/you-name-the-condiment on the sandwiches.  The bread kind of overpowers everything.Bland I guess it the word I think of.  And at $10 a sub, that makes it kinda difficult to keep coming back.  

The options are great for variety, and have lots of vegetarian options.  The happy hour is awesome.  The staff is always super friendly.  The &#34;Draw a Joker Card&#34; and get your meal free is so cool!  But what keeps people (me) coming back to a place is usually the food.  And when I know I can get a much better tasting sub for a few bucks cheaper, it&#39;s too tempting to go there instead.

I have had my lunch delivered by their trusty delivery boys on bikes several times now, and have been amazed each time.

So far I&#39;ve tried the Colorado Beef &amp; Cheese, Giving Thanks (that your family&#39;s not here), their idea of a Caesar salad on a bun, and the Yaya+ (my FAVORITE).

My experience with this sub shop has been much much better than that of another tasty sub shop here in Cap Hill **cough**snarf&#39;s**cough**. #1 They don&#39;t take forever only to act like you&#39;re a pain in their ass, #2 They have boooooze!!!!!

Speaking of which....

A few nights ago I finally got the chance to stop into the shop itself and grab a brewski with my sub. Holy AWESOME combo, batman! They even had Dale&#39;s Pale Ale (my favity fave), along with other typical beer offerings and some hard alcohol choices. To top it off, the staff had old school Star Trek playing on one of the TVs, and Give Up by The Postal Service playing the whole time I was there. Can I just stay here forever??"

Will it?

I do like what I&#39;ve seen so far, which is a wide variety of sandwiches at a reasonable cost. They have the typical turkey, Italian, ham, etc. But they also have a surprisingly large vegetarian section and lots of robust hot sandwiches, perfect when you&#39;re feeling a bit peckish.

I had the roasted vegetable parmesan. Zucchini, onions and eggplant were marinated in some oil and balsamic, coated with a sweet marinera and liberally sprinkled with parmesan. The balsamic mixed with the marinera gave the sandwich a nice sweet/sour thing that I found pretty enjoyable. It was a decent-sized sandwich too and was about $7 (A bit on the high end maybe, but it was good).

Service was pretty good, though the sandwich took a bit long to make considering I was the only customer. The decor and layout is very similar to the previous restaurants in the space; You can tell it was once a Chipotle.

And for now I hope it remains Sub-Culture. It&#39;s a good sandwich shop from what I&#39;ve seen and tasted. Let&#39;s just hope that something finally lasts in this spot."

The first time I came in an ordered I was the the only person in the place. A few minutes later a group of 3 came in an ordered. I waited for about 15 minutes and watched as the three people who came in after me all received their sandwiches. Finally someone came over and asked me what I had ordered after about 20 minutes. So they completely lost my order when it was the only order they had at that time. The most recent time I came in it took over 20 minutes for a cold sandwich. They said they had a large catering order come in so they put off everyone&#39;s order in the actual restaurant to make a bunch of sandwiches for a pickup. Doesn&#39;t really make sense that they would drop everyone else&#39;s order to cater to a pickup order. Overall the time management seems to be very poor and how they handle their orders is completely ineffective.

I was told that my fav. sandwich I have been eating had no eggs, dairy, or gluten in it.. .all of which are major food allergies for me bc I have celiac&#39;s disease.  Any of these foods could easily put me in the emergency room.

Pretty disappointing stuff for this girl.  Wish they&#39;d find a different type of bread/option and inform their employees bc so many people in Denver struggle with this same autoimmune disorder... I am, however, thankful for the one employee who knew enough to tell me not to eat it anymore today."

We needed to feed 20 players and assorted team and club staff and wanted to order large servings of assorted pasta with protein to pick up and serve at our team hotel.

We called a few places who were either unable or unwilling to help us. I found the place on Yelp and on the phone I liked what I heard. Two coaches and I headed over and Ben, one of the managers, sat with us and put a program together for us with 4 different pasta selections with grilled chicken on the side for those wanting pasta with chicken in addition to the spaghetti and meatballs.

The food was a hit as all the players as well as additional staff and a few family members had their fill. 

Very grateful that Ben and his team were willing to help our team."

When I asked how much longer, they apologized for being short staffed. 23 minutes since they swiped my card and I&#39;m still waiting...

noodles-and-company-aurora-9,Jared V.,KTlvYU9UzhTwHIki9DbaWw,"Phoenix, AZ",1,1,0,15,31,ibMZtVOS5ZUWo38TpgnPxQ,1.0,2016-03-16,"Before writing anything, I need to disclose that I went into this visit coming off a bad previous experience at a Noodles &amp; Company location in Boise, ID. So I had high expectations thinking it couldn&#39;t be any worse than my last try, but I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong. 

I start out ordering a 3pc potstickers for my beautiful wife and daughter. I had the potstickers in Boise and didn&#39;t care for them, but they love good potstickers and wanted to give them a fair shot. Needless to say, they were just as bland and poorly cooked here without much difference from what I had just a few hundred miles Northwest. And for whatever odd reason they were play as pancakes. My beautiful wife struggled to eat them and our beautiful daughter spit them out. I at least give the chain points for consistency! 

Moved on to order for my beautiful wife. I asked her what she wanted to try and she named three dishes (this is at the register in front of the person helping us, after ordering the potstickers, which comes back later in the review). Figured I would order two different ones and we could split them. Started out with the Penne Rosa: Tomatoes, Spinach, Mushrooms and Penne, Parmesan on top, without any proteins. So far, so good in the ordering process.

Dish #2 - Simple Buttered Egg Noodles. Cashier &#34;Sorry, we&#39;re out of egg noodles.&#34;

No biggie, I&#39;ll order the third dish my beautiful wife wanted to try...

Dish #3 - Pesto Cavatappi
Cashier &#34;Uh, we&#39;re out of those noodles too&#34;.

I asked the cashier what noodles the noodle company had available, and she looked at the menu to let us know they had Penne, Elbow, and Spaghetti. I agreed to alter my order of Pesto Cavatappi to Penne noodles. 

Sure as rain, two bowls of Penne Rosa come out AFTER talking about ordering different dishes while at the counter. I approached the cashier as it appeared we received two of the exact same dish, and I couldn&#39;t tell which one was the Pesto Cavatappi with Penne noodles. She explained the way she understood my request to change the dish to Penne noodles, meant the entire dish to Penne Rosa, not just change the noodle type in the Pesto dish I ordered. The word &#34;Rosa&#34; never made an appearance in the conversation of switching the pasta to Penne, I can assure you. To her credit, she apologized and offered the correct replacement dish, but at this point I didn&#39;t want anything else out of their half stocked kitchen.

As for the two bowls of the exact same pasta, the noodles were undercooked, tomatoes weren&#39;t even ripe, and the sauce was bland other than overpoweringly spicy and nothing else. Hopefully it&#39;s needless to say at this point, but unfortunately neither my wife or I will ever be back to any of the &#34;Noodles we haven&#39;t run out of yet &amp; Company&#34;.

Sorry, no photos for this one which is an extreme rarity for me. Just wasn&#39;t feeling it and wanted to get the heck outta dodge."

One tray of 4 bowls FINALLY went out after 3 were added to the tray of one bowl (which is probably cold by now). I get that there were several to go orders that had been fulfilled....but really?? Leave a bowl sitting?? That shit would not have flied in my restaurant. That bowl would have been thrown out or at least brought out to the table until the rest of the order came out. This is ridiculous. The FOH just stand around and talk, look at the orders and do nothing. Did no one train them on bringing food out? Are they all new people?"

Like some other reviews, there was little sauce in my orders, so it was not as flavorful and bland. The hosts at this place are really laid-back and nice, I do enjoy my visits here because they are pleasant. 

Then again, for a fast-food joint this place will suffice. However, don&#39;t expect an Asian or Italian-grade for the food, it&#39;s just simple fast food. It&#39;s&#34;A-OK,&#34; is what Yelp would call it."

Say What??  Did we missed &#34;The Train Ride&#34; @ Noodles &amp; Company?  Err, I think so, I whispered to Hubs.

Wah..... This Noodle &amp; Company is Brand New in this hood.  I hope that they can keep up with their service and cleanliness of the premises.  This recent visit was on Saturday February 1st 2014.  Time was about 18:00hrs.

Wah.... now they offer MORE Options of Noodles and Pasta, Soups, Variety Options aka Meats or Proteins such as Chicken, Steak, Tofu, Shrimp, Meatballs or Pork to add in your order, Sandwiches, Salads, Small Bites, Beer and Wine...  Wahhh... 

Yes, you order at the counter and you pay at the Counter.  They will give a &#34;number token&#34;, while you wait at your table and they will send your food too.

These were the items we ordered that evening :

*  Small Bangkok Curry with Marinated Steak ($4.39) + ($2.69)
*  Indonesian Peanut Sauce with Marinated Steak ($5.69) +($2.69)
*  Side of Thai Curry Soup ($1.00)

We kept comparing this Noodle &amp; Company to the one along Colorado Blvd Many Moons Ago aka Years Ago like in 2006...

The flavors was just right.  My order of Bangkok Curry with Chunks of Marinated Steak comes with Broccoli, Carrots, Red Bell Peppers, Onions, Mushrooms, Light portion of Rice Noodles with Shredded Cabbage and Black Sesame Seeds at the Bottom of the Bowl.    Doable for a quick Lunch or Dinner.  

I was also surprised that Hubs like his order of Indonesian Peanut Saute, with the Chunks of Marinated Steaks.  The Indonesian Peanut Saute comes with &#34;Mild&#34; Spicy Peanut Sauce, Stir Fry Rice Noodles, Broccoli, Carrots, Cabbage, Asian Bean Sprouts, Cilantro, Crushed Peanuts and a wedge of Lime.

The Thai Curry Soup, was just A-Okay too.  Though I cannot deny it was too diluted for my personal taste bud, but its Doable.  The Thai Curry Soup is of Yellow Coconut Curry Broth and comes with Fresh Spinach, Cabbage, Mushroom, Tomatoes, Red Onions and Rice Noodles.

All in all, our Dinner was filling, though I cannot deny, it could be spicier, or the Food can be slightly hotter than lukewarm.  Hence that is why, they provide Sriracha Hot Sauce Bottle, next to the Beverage Dispenser.  Another establishment that has the MODERN Ultra Cool, Coke Cola Beverage Dispenser!  I like...

3.5 stars but NOT quite 4 stars as yet.  Definitely returning when needed coz now we know that Noodles and Company have variety and other options that we would like to order.  Left the establishment at about 19:00hrs.

Just to be that guy I showed the cashier I was still on hold and all was said &#34;my apologies.&#34; One person ahead of me when I walked in. They weren&#39;t busy. Then they can&#39;t get simple orders right. Then heckle you when you make them change it. On a separate occasion they verbally made fun of my wife while she kept saying she didn&#39;t want any dressing on her salad. &#34;Who eats salad like this? Just the leafs?&#34;  I can&#39;t say I won&#39;t eat here again. But I might chose another location and if you can avoid this one do it! They have no customer service what so ever.

I went and ordered a basic meal, food was okay.

The issue was with the staff in the kitchen, it was a completely disorganized mess and in my opinion, unprofessional.  

Obviously, they were understaffed and couldn&#39;t handle the workload.   There was a large to-go order in front of everyone and it cause chaos.  The staff were speaking to each other in the kitchen in what seemed to be a very condescending manner and it made me very uncomfortable and also, everyone else in the restaurant including the hostess it seemed.

I waited about 15 min for food, which at a fast-casual restaurant is pretty appalling.  Everyone behind me waited longer and were consistently rolling their eyes.

Not even a &#34;we&#39;re sorry for the wait&#34; when food was delivered.

Seems this location needs some help to get back up to their CHQ standards."

Last time the &#34;manager&#34; was rude and wouldn&#39;t take our to go order (after we had dined in for somebody at home) at 8:50 because he had already closed the doors even though they close at 9! Now this last time, I ordered an Indonesian peanut sauté and it was so much sauce, sprouts, and condiments, they thought I wouldn&#39;t notice there were only about 10 noodles. Now being that the name of the restaurant IS &#34;NOODLES and co&#34;&#34; they should have an abundance! Honestly I don&#39;t recommend this place at all.

We did until the last few trips in the last few months.  The establishment has begun not using the same amount of sauce on the dishes and lately they have been kinda way more noodle and way less sauce.  Then today I found a very long black hair in the pulled pork mac and cheese.  I was disgusted.  The supervisor I spoke with seemed sorry it had happened but did not give me the sense that they were taking full responsibility.  She offered to replace the dish.  But what an inconvenience since my husband who was sitting down to eat -now had to make another trip out to get my new dish.  I am still waiting for him to get home, they have delayed our dinner and we all go to bed very early to get up at 2am so now they have also delayed our bed time by delaying our dinner."

I ordered via &#34;Groupon to Go&#34; and was pleased to see that The Well only had a $2 delivery charge and they were offering 7 of their specialty pizzas for $9.75.  So at 5:30pm I ordered a 12&#34; Combo special pie and a caesar salad. 

By 6:50pm I had not received the food nor heard anything from the shop (no way it takes almost an hour and a half to make a single pizza and salad and deliver it to me 1.5 miles away on a Sunday night.) So I called them and first they couldn&#39;t find my order, but then when they finally did, told me it was with the delivery guy and should be arriving soon. They said they got slammed with 12 deliveries at once. I get it, but maybe call the customer and give them a status?  

OK so I wait some more. It took until 7:15pm for the food to arrive! Ugh on top of this, I had very carefully entered in explicit delivery instructions because we live in a large building that is confusing and I wanted to make it easier for the driver to find us, plus our apt is far away from the &#34;traditional&#34; main entrance and it is easier for me to just roll down in the elevator and grab the delivery according to my instructions. But no. The guy gets there and calls me up from the main entrance... the delivery instructions had been completely ignored. Sorry, this sounds very self-indulgent and whiney, but I put those instructions there for a reason and not to mention by this time it has been almost 2 hours for a single pizza and salad, and I was so annoyed that had to walk all the way around to the main entrance.... gah!  

So I bring the order upstairs... the salad is droopy, soggy, and wilted, and the WAY OVERCOOKED pizza is literally ice-cold. Because we had to heat it up again, it becomes even more crispy and overcooked. Like a pizza cracker. Completely unsatisfying and disappointing, I don&#39;t care how &#39;cheap&#39; the groupon special was. Terrible experience with this business."

Just tonight I was in there to order take out. It was me, the owner&#39;s mother, a two top, and one other person in for carryout. I waited for 40 minutes to get an 8&#34; pizza and 6 wings. The pizza, in my opinion, has no flavor (sauce doesn&#39;t taste like anything) and the crust is doughy. My Moscow Mule was flat and nobody ever asked if I wanted/needed anything for 40 minutes.

Service was awesome - super friendly and laid back. Seated right away.

Really enjoyed the pizza - we got veggie and added on artichoke hearts. Ingredients were fresh. Sauce was best part! Garlic knots were alright..would have liked more fresh garlic over powder."

Love this place, and the owner Dino knows what&#39;s up.  We ordered pick-up this time instead of delivery to check out their location.  The bartender chatted with us and told us the history of the place while we had whiskey and beers and waited for our pizza.  Even met some other Chicagoans seeking out great pizza.

Now that the area is expensive they are still holding onto it and not chasing the quick money. The pizza was really tasty. The topping were well proportioned and fresh.

Today my search has ended. I walk out the door into the sunshine, a jubilant smile on my face, belly full, and I realize this is what joy feels like.

Let&#39;s start by asking an important question:

Do you like really good Mexican food...? If you answered with an emphatic, YES I DO!!! Then you&#39;re going to LOVE Chaka&#39;s Mexican Food. 

After seeing it hit the Hot and New spots here on Yelp, we gave it a try-- let me mention that I lived in Arizona for 16 years before moving to Denver and my girlfriend is both a native of AZ and Mexican herself... So after numerous disappointing attempts to find a worthwhile Mexican spot that serves both authentic and high quality food, we had our expectations pretty low! 

After our first lunch at Chaka&#39;s not only did we have amazing food, but we LOVED Jessica, Chaka, and their entire wonderful family. They serve really really good and incredibly tasty Mexican food. Like really really good!!! 

For me the true test of a great Mexican place is the salsa. Here at Chaka&#39;s their blended salsa is delish. Perfectly spicy, layered with flavor, and they have no problem serving bowl after tasty bowl with their awesome salty chips. 

Now the next test for me is how well they prepare and serve up Carnitas. Let me tell you that my mouth is watering thinking about just how good their carnitas were. We were practically licking our plates clean. 

Chaka&#39;s serves up very fresh, well seasoned, and very authentic Mexican food. We loved it so much we went back again the next day!!! The smells alone are so enticing you will want to visit regularly and often. And the service is exceptional. The wonderful people who run Chaka&#39;s will treat you with care and truly want you to have an exceptional meal. 

We absolutely loved the enchiladas, devoured the supreme burrito, and can&#39;t wait for more of their hard shell tacos. And let me just say how incredible their rice &amp; beans are... Wow!!! It really doesn&#39;t get any better unless you have a Mexican grandma at home who has a multi-generation technique of fixing up refried beans. Because at Chaka&#39;s they are so good you will be scraping up the plate to get every last drop. 

Seriously, it is well worth going out of your way to experience the kind, personable service, as well as the very best and most delish Mexican food in all of Denver. 

Let me just say this is not some hipster, ultra trendy street taco joint playing bad music and serving bland Americanized food. Chaka&#39;s is the real deal hole in the wall Mexican restaurant serving the good stuff. Come here for great flavor, fresh spice, and down home Mexican goodness. 

And don&#39;t forget about cheap beer specials and their killer $6 margaritas...

I am a huge fan and when you try this place you&#39;re going to love it too!"

If you want the normal guac ingredients (tomato, onion, jalapeño, etc.) they charge you $1.00 per ingredient. Also ordered the bean burrito and a chimichanga.

It is in a strip mall off Evans so I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it if not for the good Yelpers. 

Very tasty chips and salsa (they do mention it&#39;s $1.50 after the first basket so beware!)

They make a mean margarita (rocks with salt) and it&#39;s not tiny or overly boozy like other local Mexican restaurants. I do appreciate a well mixed drink and Chakas does it well. They also offer frozen margs but one was plenty for me. 

I tried the carnitas torta. While it was tasty I have been smitten by Las Tortas so I am a bit biased in the tortas department. For $1 you get a big side of hot and crispy french fries. 

I did try some of the adobada tacos and they were really delicious.  

They provide a green sauce with tacos that is very tasty and not overly spicy. I like spice but sometimes I have a few bites and can&#39;t do anymore. 

My wife and I also shared a cheese enchilada (with diced onions on top if you want)

We normally don&#39;t opt for dessert on a weeknight but decided to try their churros with ice cream. They definitely go big as there were 3-4 churros and lots of vanilla ice cream, sprinkles and chocolate sauce.

Muy delicioso!"

Food was fantastic, and affordable.  Service was great!  Two people taking care of you... So you always have drinks and they know all about the menu.  
The only reason it&#39;s 4 not 5 is because it&#39;s pretty typical and I think they definitely have a kitchen that can put together some great specials!  It&#39;s such a big menu... Hard to decide what you want or what will be good."

Chaka&#39;s is a small restaurant in a nondescript strip of shops. Walking inside one can tell that they&#39;ve worked hard to make the interior of the restaurant pleasant and enjoyable. There is a real charm to the decor. Even more importantly, from the moment we stepped through the front door, there was never a single question whether or we were valued customers. The service was impeccable. Our servers were attentive and friendly. The menu is large and fairly typical. There is a good selection of Tex-Mex type favourites, as well as a few more classic Mexican options. Everything that we ate was very good. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a pleasant dining experience."

We are forever on the hunt for a great Mexican restaurant since the closing of our favorite, La Cocina de Marcos (sobbing). The service was great, friendly staff and the food came out quickly. We had some combinations and I had a straight up bean burrito, and I was extremely pleased with the refried beans, the staple of any Mexican restaurant in my opinion. Everyone liked their combos, the chile rellenos was a big highlight. The enchilada sauce is unique, I think it has some nutmeg in it? The green chile is tasty and thick, available in mild, half and half and hot. They have daily specials and to-go breakfast burritos for $2 which I will definitely be back to try. Overall we loved it and it&#39;s our new regular Mexican place!

Wanted to update my review to 5 stars because after having been there several times, I have seen that they are consistently good, and the staff is awesome and so nice. I really hope they stick around! Oh, and the breakfast burritos are really good, too."

Found this place using Yelp, and it definitely didn&#39;t steer us wrong. 

The exterior facade and location (a little strip mall next to McDonald&#39;s) doesn&#39;t look like much, BUT DONT BE FOOLED, the minute you step inside, you&#39;ll be welcomed by a comfortable interior and likely several hellos from the great staff.

And I&#39;m a big fan of Taco Bell, which I think most would hesitate to classify as &#34;Mexican&#34;. Or &#34;food&#34;. ANYhoo, I tell you this in fairness to this cute little (I presume) family run restaurant, and to be clear that I&#39;m not a refined food critic. Just a gal that really, really enjoys her tacos. And I genuinely think most people would, and do, based on the reviews, enjoy the food here. 

I found the salsa to be fairly typical. A bit on the spicy side and nothing out of the ordinary. The chips were not my favorite. They had an odd, bitterish taste and unappealing texture that was enough to make me stop shoveling them in my mouth pre-meal, which is uncharacteristic of me. My man friend and I both ordered a combo. Mine came with a guac tostada, a cheese enchilada and a chile relleno. His was the same apart from a beef burrito in place of the tostada. We agreed the chile rellenos, which we ordered crispy, were not as crispy as we would have liked. The cheese enchiladas were thoroughly unremarkable. I opted not to eat mine, puzzling over how so much cheese could possibly not result in absolute deliciousness. The man&#39;s beef burrito was tasty enough and my guacamole tostada was the winner of the group and genuinely yummy. The guac was generous and just smooth enough and everything on the tostada tasted fresh. I would on the whole give the food a solid &#34;C&#34;.

I would like to add that the staff was all very friendly and our waitress was very attentive and nice. Overall, I probably would not personally be inspired to return but wouldn&#39;t recommend against giving it a try to others."

As others have mentioned, it is in a strip mall just west of McDonalds.

First, you are always greeted when you enter.  Jessica and Chaka are always there and they are both amazing.  

The salsa is delicious and they will keep it coming as my husband goes through it pretty quickly.  One of the most important aspects is that the food is always consistent - everything is fresh.

We have brought family and friends here and everyone loves it.  Francisco is usually our waiter and he is always friendly and provides excellent service.  The service is always quick and it amazes me how fast our food arrives - always hot and delicious!

The prices are beyond reasonable and they offer a lot of dishes - though I always get the chili relleano and guacamole tostado and my husband always gets the bean &amp; beef smothered burrito.

LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!"

I discovered Chaka&#39;s took over the space that used to serve really good bbq. This place seats about 50 people.There are 5 tvs so mo matter where you&#39;re sitting you can see the game (not that it matters to me).

The menu had a great selection to choose from with some items that you do normally see at other chain Mexican restaurants. The prices are very reasonable too. 

Oh their salas is wonderful, not too much cilantro, not to spicy bust just right. I got a combinaltion plate and was able to make a substitution for a $1. I loved that there were different flavors on the plate, not just one sauce used to cover everything. For the green chili you can choose mild, hot or half and half. Let me tell you the crispy chili relleno was heavenly! The rest of the food was good too, nice and fresh and not too salty. The only thing I didn&#39;t really care for was the flan. It had a lemon taste to it instead of just the nice vanilla-y custard.

The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. I&#39;ll definately be back to support this locally owned business."

What puts Chaka&#39;s over the top is service and (we think owners).  Everyone is so nice and puts the simple dining experience at a perfect pace.  Love, love this place and highly recommend.

Everything there was subpar at best. The chips for the chips and salsa were stale and tasted old. We ordered Carne Asada tacos and a veggie burrito. The tortillas for the tacos were so thin that couldn&#39;t be picked up and the meat had to be eaten with a fork. This is the reason that most places do double or triple tortillas. For the cost, we could have had tacos from a food truck and a beer. I expected so much from the veggie burrito and that was a mistake. The tortilla was a wheat tortilla, which was gross, and the veggies inside were all burned. That combination made for a nasty burrito. I couldn&#39;t even get half way through it because it was so bad...I was hungry though. I love Mexican food, but I will not be coming back to this restaurant."

I am a HUGE fan of &#34;huevos rancheros&#34; covered in this sauce as well as the &#34;burrito con carne y frijoles&#34; stuffed with shredded spiced beef.  It&#39;s delicious. Their margaritas are about par and the wait staff is friendly and fast.  The young proprietor appears to also be the chef and it is cool watching him and his team sling out orders.  If you want to try some of the traditional dishes their red tamales and menudo are also pretty good (lean and clean)."

Normally, I would have headed back toward Colorado Blvd and the multitudes of restaurant choices it offers, but I decided to check Yelp to see if there was something worth doing in this area.  Wow!  Am I glad I did!  This place is excellent!

This area of town is nothing to write home about and, frankly, is none too attractive.  The small strip mall in which Chaka&#39;s is located is one of those older storefronts in serious need of a facelift - but don&#39;t let that stop you!  Once you walk inside, you&#39;re transported to a very cantina-like atmosphere.  The restaurant is small (about 6 or 7 booths, and 6 tables), but nicely decorated and clean.  I was greeted when I walked in and sat down to peruse the menu.  My server (an owner?) brought me chips and a wonderful homemade salsa along with my iced tea (I&#39;ll have to try a margarita another time).  I decided on the Carnitas Tacos and added rice and beans.  The carnitas was excellent!  It was succulent and flavorful.  The tacos came with cilantro, pico, shredded lettuce and some chopped radish (very pleasantly surprised to see that!).  Since I added rice and beans, they were on the plate, as well.  If I had to come up with a critique, I would say that the quantity of rice and beans for the extra $3 was a little skimpy.  A little more of each would be welcome, as well as serving them on a plate separate from the tacos.  It was a little much for one plate, and the condiments for the tacos ended up buried under them.  A minor point.  The food I had was so yummy, I can&#39;t wait  to come back and try something else!

PS - Full bar.
PPS - Clean bathroom."

The pork was so overcooked and dry I could barely eat it.  And, there was no queso and no sauce whatsoever on the tacos so they were basically dried up beef on a tortilla with a little shredded lettuce and radish.

Then Chaka&#39;s opened up and made it all better. I ordered the combination plate #6, Beef Burrito, cheese enchilada &amp; soft relleno. They have hot, mild and half &amp; half green chili, I ordered the hot. The green chili wasn&#39;t that so hot that you can&#39;t enjoy it, hot. It was full in flavor and great. The soft relleno wasn&#39;t the fluffy kind that I usually love but more of the omelette kind, I wasn&#39;t disappointed after tasting it however, YUM! The enchilada was good and served on a separate plate per my request, I like to taste the enchilada sauce and not have it mix in too much with the green chili. The beef in the burrito actually had great flavor, so many times the beef can be so bland. Joel had the Chulettas de puerco, not something I would normally order but boy did I have order envy.. It was great. I tried his beans and then had to order a side for myself. You know you enjoy a new restaurant when you are still sitting there and thinking about what you&#39;re going to order next time. The margaritas were great, I normally don&#39;t finish mine because there&#39;s too much sweet &amp; sour, I drank the whole large margarita:) as it turns out our very good waitress was the owner, Jessicca and her husband is, yep, Chaka!

It is INCREDIBLE here. One of the best places I&#39;ve been. Fast-casual, order with a person and then grab a seat until your name is called. My friend and I wanted to sit outside and I indicated that to one of the staff, and he very graciously offered to let us know when our food was ready and actually brought it out to us (not in his job description!! I really appreciated it!). The place is cute and has some nice outdoor seating.

In terms of the food, they have some interesting options. It is very easy to eat meat free if that&#39;s your thing, but they do also have some chicken dishes available. I got the not-fried falafel (love falafel and hate fried food so right up my alley), the sweet potato salad, and the the cucumber tomato salad. The falafel was good, with black beans as well, which I enjoyed. The tomato cucumber salad was OK (I wish it had more feta because I love feta and that&#39;s basically why I ordered it) as well as the sweet potato salad. I appreciate that the calories were listed and it seemed like a healthy option. However, the portion sizes were kind of small- I left hungry (and I&#39;m not a hard person to fill up). I wish I would&#39;ve gotten better sides next time- they were OK but not overly impressive.

However, I&#39;d come back here for the service alone. That was great."

Best part is it doesn&#39;t leave you with a stomach ache or the need for an after lunch nap.  I also ordered some falafel, which was very tasty, but a little dry.  The falafel are baked here, so I guess a little dryness that&#39;s to be expected, but they could probably use some refinement of the recipe.

For breakfast I had the Denver scramble which had broccoli and kale and I also got it with double eggs. I also had the chocolate and espresso shake which was in the revive section of the menu but I can&#39;t remember what it is called. The Denver scramble was delicious. For me it wouldn&#39;t have been enough food without the extra egg.  The shake was too sweet for me, especially for breakfast.  I wish they would offer a less sweet version.

Prices are totally fair for the quality and portion sizes.

They have some unusual (to me) ingredients like clear udon noodles and farro; they were well made and something different for a change. 

The salads and bowls were great - I loved the cholula vinaigrette and the bone broth soup! I think soup is stupid (it is a drink pretending to be food - food requires chewing) but this was so good I was licking the bowl!!!"

I often stand at the counter while the girls finish their conversation with their backs to me. I&#39;m not normally in a super rush when I get Noodles, but just some eye contact is cool.

There was no line, huge positive for a Friday night, and the restaurant was about half full.
The young man, okay, who are we kidding, the teenager who took my order was nice enough although he had no idea what was in the pot stickers. No worries though, he found out for me. Trying to find a seat proved to be a bit more difficult. There were plenty of open seats but most of them were full of dishes that had not yet been bussed. 
I ordered the chicken pad Thai and the pot stickers appetizer which, by the way, has chicken in it. The pot stickers were good. The pad Thai, not so much. I expected more veg, less egg. The sauce was wrong, too. At this price point I would much rather go to Pei Wei and have a fresh, less greasy pad Thai."

I&#39;m not hating on Noodles in general, I wouldn&#39;t necessarily write a good review but normally it&#39;s pretty consistent regardless of location.
But let me tell you why mgmt should a) read Yelp comments and b) why you should avoid this place:
1) Dirty much? Not too busy yet every table covered in plates, and when the did finally come around for the plates they didn&#39;t even wash the tables so there was still crumbs.
2) Soda machine was gushing water/soda every where. Gross.
3) I would have been okay with all of the above it if it wasn&#39;t for their staple dish mac and cheese served cold to me, the broccoli I got was hardly cooked....it was so bad my 2 year old who eats spiders off the ground didn&#39;t even want to eat his. 
4) I complain to someone about my cold food, and you;d think a mgr would come over or offer a new dish up or you know ANYTHING to make the situation better - nope, I could see him hiding in the kitchen doing nothing. I mean he was all of 17 years old...but still get your stuff together.
5) $33 for a cold gross meal that gave me a stomach ache? Yep - rip off.

I ordered a bunch of square bowls for my wedding rehearsal dinner, and payed for it in full online. It was over a hundred dollars, and I payed immediately and in full. This was also a week in advance. Anyway, I got the confirmation code and (luckily) saved the email. 

While I rehearsing for my wedding they called me. It was only about 10 minutes before the time I was supposed to pick up the food. They said there had been a problem, and we&#39;re super snotty about it when I pointed out I already had a receipt and confirmation, and a bank statement on my side. The dumb chick on the phone said &#34;uh yeah, we&#39;re not showing any payment, and we just wanted to make sure you still wanted it&#34;. Um, hello?!? I told her we did, and she said they could no longer meet the time I&#39;d reserved ( again, over a week ago). I told her that was unacceptable, and a poor way to conduct business. She then tried to say she&#39;d been being &#34; proactive&#34; by calling me 10 minutes before the pick up time. That is not what proactive means. 

So, I had to send my fiancé to noodles to pick up the food, and prove we&#39;d payed for it. She stared at the confirmation email for a really long time, and obviously didn&#39;t believe us. Keep in mind it was the email they sent to us that even said we&#39;d payed ahead and to skip the line. Finally she begrudgingly admitted that we had already payed and gave us our food. But, despite the fact their website claims that they&#39;ll provide plates, napkins, and silverware they conveniently forgot to include ours. So we had to make another stop to get those things which pushed back my rehearsal over an hour. 

They didn&#39;t try to pacify us at all. No offer of a discount, or a free rice krispie or anything. They tried to steal over a hundred dollars from me. Buyer beware, and save your receipts. 

Thanks for ruining my rehearsal dinner, jerks."

Rude, impolite teenagers busily typing away on their iPhones and mobile devices or popping their pimples when you try to order. 

Tables with half-eaten meals on them, with flies buzzing around. 

When I went with my darling wife, no one said &#34;happy birthday&#34; or even tried to force out a mock smile. At least try to wince or fake a smile! Pretend you&#39;ve got gas!

There was no water when we went, and the 20-something &#34;manager&#34; did not offer water or know how to respond to my request for water. 

In 2013 America, most restaurants have running water somewhere in the facility. She could have given me tap water, but the thought process was too complex for her to compute. So no water, rude service, no smile much less &#34;happy birthday,&#34; and flies buzzing around tables that haven&#39;t been bussed. 

Maybe the pimply-faced 20-something girl was the manager, maybe she was not, but whoever the manager was that day, they clearly don&#39;t give one noodle what the establishment smells like inside, how clean the tables are, or whether or not customers are treated politely. 

I won&#39;t go to this location any more because it is so disgusting. The one on Colorado Blvd. they at least try to keep clean."

My only complaint is as of recently they have an employee there who is rude. Ever since I started eating at Noodles and Company I always have received adequate service. So when I was graced with the presence of this employee I was shocked. I figured they were either new or having a bad day.

After encountering them again I do not think this is the case. They have a poor attitude, to say the least. The last time we went in they rang me up and gave me a total, when clearly there was another person with me. You should probably ask if we want anything else before stating my total rudely. 

When I asked for a different salad dressing than the usual options, said employee acted as if it were out of the question, and I order it all the time. I was so annoyed with the attitude of this employee that I wrote a complaint to Noodles and Company. Up until now they have not responded to my e-mail. Go figure.

I can take my business elsewhere and if this is how the employees will treat their customers I will stop dining there. It is a shame because I love their food. Their mac and cheese is delicious. They would have received five stars, but I deducted two. One for their rude employee and two for ignoring the e-mail I sent through their website regarding said employee."

I remember sitting down with my friends, having a huge bowl of their pan noodles or mac and cheese and walking away full and happy.

Since that time Noodles has really expanded not only in their locations but in their menu. They&#39;ve added a bunch of salads and soups and...for me it&#39;s never really worked. I&#39;m of the opinion that the only side you need with their dishes is one of their rice krispie treats.

So, I swung by their newest location and picked up some pad thai with shrimp. The noodles were just one big clump and the tofu in the dish tasted like a total afterthought and didn&#39;t absorb any of the flavors. Really disappointing, especially considering the number of places you can go for noodle dishes on this side of town. I wanted something a little more complex than mac and cheese, but I think I&#39;ll stick with that from here out. Service was fine but when you have an open kitchen you should encourage your cooks to do something else between dishes than give the back of the restaurant  the thousand-yard stare.

A note, I got this address from their order form; this location is part of a new development at Havana and Mississippi known as the Gardens on Havana where Buckingham Square used to be. It looks like Google maps hasn&#39;t updated with the new streets yet. They&#39;re going for an outdoor mall kinda thing. So far there&#39;s Noodles, the Qdoba next door, and a nail salon coming soon. Riiiiight..."

To my chagrin/surprise, seven of the ten tables I could see were dirty/cluttered with previous customers&#39; bowls, glasses, dirty napkins and brown take-out bags.  I did find a table to sit at, but not where I preferred to sit.  Meanwhile, the staff was standing around the front of the store chatting.  My food was brought out relatively quickly and the staff was polite.  That was the only saving grace?  About halfway through my meal, apparently one of the staff got bored talking and brought out a plastic container to bus some of the tables.  Eventually, after several trips, she got all of the dirty tables bussed.  I never saw her wipe a table down.

The hype! The anticipation! The excitement!

The slight disappointment when you realize that you&#39;re eating soggy noodles in a hotel room from a plastic to-go container. 

The introspection that follows as you ponder the leftover sauce in the bottom of the bowl. How did I get here? Do I make good life decisions? Why did I eat so much of this mediocre meal?

I wasn&#39;t impressed at all with my meal. My friend and I shared three pasta dishes because we are a disgusting pair: macaroni and cheese, beef stroganoff, and pad thai. The mac and cheese was watery, the beef in the stroganoff was too peppery and chewy, and the pad thai was alright. All in all, I&#39;ve had better versions of all three dishes.

My favorite dish is the Whole Grain Tuscan Linguine with Parmesan Chicken, accompanied by a Snickerdoodle cookie.  Seriously, both are to die for!  And at a great price that doesn&#39;t break your budget.

It was kind of noisy in the kitchen area, and I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s typical or not, but I know that I had to ask the cashier to repeat stuff a couple of times (I have perfect hearing) and the person behind me also had to ask for repeats. I do think the prices are a little high for what you are getting; that could just be because I know a box of noodles costs a dollar at Walmart. 

The eat in area was very clean and you could tell it was a new location because everything was nice and shiny. I did notice there was water bucket on one of the booths which I thought was kind of amusing. You&#39;d think a brand new building wouldn&#39;t have leaks, but oh well, what can you do.

The service is also lacking and you can&#39;t get in and out quickly at all which is usually why someone would venture to the local coffee shop- quick, fast, good service and food.  Not really the case here from my personal experience. 

Coffee drinks take forever to get b/c they normally only have one person making coffee, who is also running food from the kitchen, etc. The people taking the orders are usually painfully slow with no sense or urgency whatsoever. With my most recent visit, I ordered two coffees and a sandwich.  The coffees took a painfully long time to receive and after 20+ minutes waiting on a sandwich (yes, a small little sandwich) I had to ask for my food to go. Rather than an apologetic response for such a long wait for a sandwich, the employee was quite rude, made no effort to quickly get me a to go container or put it in a bag, and didn&#39;t even respond when handing me my to go bag upon my &#34;thank you.&#34;  The food is good, when you get it in a timely manner...

Very simple order at the counter, they give you a number to place on your table, and the food is brought out shortly. 

The restaurant is like walking into someone&#39;s home. You immediately feel comfortable. It was a beautiful day and we decided to eat outside on their little patio. 

We ordered their egg sammi (with cheese and meat of your choice), yogurt with house made granola and fresh fruit, and a slice of banana bread to split. Their coffee was great too! Giant coffee filled ceramic cup while eating in and also got a paper cup full of joe when I left (she offered when I ordered and took her up on it later!)

All of the items in the bakery case looked so delicious. The banana bread had no nuts, so major points in my book. Next time will try those huge scones. 

If you are in the area, great place to chill and support this local business."

Came in early (7am) on a Thursday and there were a few people were in line. Really great service and the bacon garlic aioli sammie was good but pricey.

It&#39;s location is probably frequented by a college crowd nearby. It&#39;s a cozy spot with a very utilitarian decor. Outside seating that we took advantage of on a warm day. 

We had their breakfast sandwich. I had the bacon, egg sammi on a Brioche bun. Anything freshly made on a flaky brioche bun is a good intro to a first visit. 

I will skip the mimosa next time. It was weak. Although it was served in a bigger than usual glass. Order their iced tea. It&#39;s the bottomless kind:)

Great service. Easy to find parking next door. If n the area I&#39;ll stop by."

The customer service was great and the cashiers remained professional and calm even though our group of 20+ people came in all at once with empty stomachs.

The noshery welcomes you in for a cup of joe with a breakfast sandwich, yogurt, or waffle to boot. On a waffle streak lately, I went for the homestyle waffles with fruit compote and vanilla bean cream, and though, I would have loved a little more crisp in my waffle the bean cream was original and a perfect addition to the waffle. It wasn&#39;t as sweet as I was expecting and I enjoyed that since my waffles were already doused in syrup to my liking. 

The service was so genuine and sweet. It&#39;s a counter ordering process while your food is brought to you and it seems to work for them. They did have a wide array of delicious looking scones and muffins, too! I&#39;ll be back!"

So my first impression was a good one as they were sampling white chocolate cherry bread. If I weren&#39;t such a healthy person, I&#39;d have bought bags of it. Delicious stuff! I decided to go with the special (which was an egg sandwich on a garlic bread).

So props on the food. It was good. What really made me happy was the coffee (surprise surprise). They use Coda roasters and it was a fine cup of coffee. Again a breakfast gets points for not going cheap on their coffee.

The impression I get of this place is that they are going for a more relaxed college joint that serves some good food. I&#39;d love to come back and try their biscuits ad waffles to see if the rest of this place lives up to the hype. I&#39;d recommend this place."

And just as I expected, the food did not disappoint! I ordered the biscuits and gravy which was very hearty and absolutely delicious. My boyfriend also ordered the potato waffles, and now I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll ever go back to eating ordinary waffles. D:

You can&#39;t go wrong with either one of the waffle options. The one and only thing I wish about the savory waffles is that the salmon pieces would be presented better and maybe checked on a bit closer...some of it comes out not very appetizing. But! The sweet waffles&#39; fresh compote is always to die for, the service is a 10/10 at all times, and the space is adorable and makes so much sense for the neighborhood.

The Noshery cafe is located within walking distance from Regis University.  It occupies a cute little corner off of Regis Blvd. and Lowell.  Although not a splendid view, they do offer outside seatings and plenty of inside seatings as well.  The place itself is very minimalistic; clean, chic, and have nice pastel green &amp; grey tones throughout.

At times this place can get busy, but later in the day it calms down a lot.  As you can expect, a lot of the customers are students from Regis so there are plenty of room to study and of course, there&#39;s caffeine.  Noshery offers a nice array of coffee, tea, and assorted pastries.  They also have breakfast and lunch items.  I went there yesterday and ordered myself a turkey sandwich with a side of fresh fruits.  The sandwich was delicious and fulfilling.  The fruits was a good, healthy addition as well.  Moreover, I really want to try their homestyle mac&#39;n&#39;cheese...next time.

Another thing, the barista at Noshery is super friendly and attentive.  She&#39;s an awesome gal.  Make sure to leave her a tip!!!"

There are always bars and coffee shops around colleges, but come on we need food too.

My husband now works for Regis and has gone to the new Noshery coffee shop and liked it suggesting that I check it out. Now my small coffee house experiences aren&#39;t much different from Starbucks with over priced pastries and microwavable breakfast sandwiches. I wasn&#39;t too sure, but my husband is not a fan of Starbucks, so for him to like and come to a coffee house more than once and recommended the place nevertheless is something worth checking out.

Wow! What a great find. The owner is a pastry chief, so wonderful selections of yummy treates both delicious and gorgeous. The breakfast options are quality portions home cooked and absolutely delicious. This morning alone we got coffee home made waffles, breakfast sandwich, and fruit for under $15 when 3 coffees at Starbucks cost $15 without food. 

Check out their biscuits and gravy, Amazing! They have a half and option with gravy and green chili, sooo good. The green chili is not store bought, but home made and has great flavor. My daughter loves the waffles, my husband loves the Breakfast Sammi. 

For being a coffee house this independent owner (not franchised) really takes care and love in her business. She has made something special in quality. I highly recommend this place."

The space is really cute and well decorated with white and turquoise accents. It was very cozy and welcoming and the staff were outrageously nice. I asked about a cookie that I&#39;d never heard of that I&#39;ve now forgotten the name of. The employee broke one in half and let me try it. It was a less sweet sugar cookie from the Midwest. They were excited to share their product and it really made a positive impact on my experience. 

I ordered the prosciutto and Brie sandwich for myself and the turkey sandwich for the hubs. My sandwich had a little bit of cherry with it that made for a perfect balance of sweet, tart and salty. The bread was perfect with just the right amount of crispy crust but soft enough to easily eat.  The hubs&#39; turkey was also very good and he liked the pickled onions. Both sandwiches were elevated by small touches that made a big impact on the flavor. 

For dessert my choice was the flourless chocolate cake and he got the salted caramel tart. The best one by far was the salted caramel tart. You could taste the homemade throughout the caramel, chocolate ganache layer and delicate chocolate crust. The flourless chocolate cake tasted a little one note and wasn&#39;t as rich as I like flourless chocolate cakes. 

Between the sandwiches and the genuinely happy and friendly employees I would recommend the Noshery any day of the week!"

I would say go often and enjoy the yummy deliciousness being served fresh daily at The Noshery! 

What&#39;s better than a cafe serving well made coffee, delish food, and out of this world amazeballs pastries &amp; goodies...? Not much in my book! 

The owner, Andrea is a Colorado native, a well trained master pastry chef, who cares as much for her customers as she does her perfectly crafted baked goods. You will find locally sourced ingredients whenever possible, and a passion for food that will leave you smiling ear to ear. Her baking skills are world-class. The flavors leave this sweet junkie craving her pastries daily!

Truthfully I drive out of my way for their Breakfast Sandwiches! It&#39;s so refreshing to enjoy fresh, flavorful food at a fair price and in such an inviting, friendly environment. The Noshery staff is kind, warm, and always helpful. It&#39;s like being amongst good friends, eating well, and sharing happiness each visit. 

While selfishly, I want to keep this Denver Gem all to myself, and the locals who have already discovered this fantastic treasure-- all should be treated to the yummy-goodness found fresh daily at The Noshery! 

Andrea takes custom cake and desert orders and I must say her prices can&#39;t be beat and the products are truly world class. She&#39;s on her way to becoming an elite party chef and we should all enjoy her treats before she&#39;s swept away in chef star land...

Go for breakfast, lunch, or whenever your sweet tooth is calling. I am a huge fan and I know you will share in my excitement for Andrea and her brilliant eatery at The Noshery.

Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be here and was more than accommodating.

We had the biscuits and gravy and the potato waffles with salmon. Order half and half on the gravy for the biscuits and gravy. Both, green chilly and traditional were definitely worth having. Get the waffles if you like good tater tots (who doesn&#39;t?!), but want to feel healthier than you actually are! The salmon was plank smoked, so another star for that alone."

Parked on street out front. Handful of people seated. Could tell some students from Regis stop in. Decent breakfast options and coffee selection. 

Decor was adorable, many recycled and repurposed pieces of furniture. Bright and airy. Comfortable seating inside and small patio out front with maybe 5 tables. Very friendly staff. 

I would probably give it another 1/2 to 1 star except my food was not great-Potato Waffles. Described as a savory waffle with a nice texture made with potatoes in batter side of smoked salmon and creme fraiche. It looked like a regular Belgian waffle and had little flavor on its own. If I could get a bite with the salmon and creme all together it was tasty, but there was very little of either thing, not enough for every bite of waffle. And it was served with a side of regular syrup?!  

I will go back and try something else on the menu. Egg Sammies made with house baked brioche roll. Looked like they had a good bakery selection. And several sandwich options. 

I was there until noon and did not see a ton of traffic. Maybe they are busier on the weekend or earlier during the week. Development in the area may help business?"

I ordered the potato waffles which were perfectly fluffy with just the right balance of savory and sweet. They were complimented with a few wonderful chunks of house smoked salmon. Wowza was this good!

I also ordered an iced chai which was the perfect way to wash down my breakfast.

They have a great selection of pasteries and I can&#39;t wait for summer so that I can order one and enjoy it on their patio.

I&#39;ve been here a few times already, and I knew from my first visit that I would be back. It helps that it is right across the street from work, but what makes it great is the place itself. Limited food menu, but by no means limited in flavor and freshness.

Sure, the place is probably better for their drinks, but I am a food person before a drink person. So, knowing that I haven&#39;t had their drinks as of yet, I could say going there for their food is well worth the visit.

More on to the &#39;meat&#39; of the review...if you are looking for a quick and easy to-go breakfast item, look no further than their breakfast Sammi&#39;s (egg sandwiches). They&#39;ve got a variety to choose from (bacon, sausage, ham, or veggie).

And if you have time, don&#39;t mind the slight mess, and looking for a bit more to eat, their biscuit&#39;s and gravy are awesome. Feel free to choose the white (sausage) gravy or the green chili...or do half and half (which I recommend).

As you can see, I am not just a food person, but a breakfast person. They are open for breakfast (7:30am) and lunch (till 4pm), but I&#39;ve only had breakfast items so far. Their potato waffles with smoked salmon are tasty as well. Kind of a savory dish. It comes with a chive crème fraîche, as well as a side of syrup, but I left the syrup untouched with these savory delicacies.

They have a decent variety for lunch, including sandwiches and salads, and they can also accommodate for little ones. Being a bakery as well, they&#39;ve got a good array of sweets to choose from. On Friday&#39;s they make some dang good donuts (good size too). And a friend of mine is in love with their gluten-free fruit bars. She&#39;s not a GF person, she just really loves these.

They do offer some adult drinks along with their coffee drinks, which include some beers (I believe, Upslope options), some wine, and cocktails (such as mimosas).

Try it out. The decor is simple (quant), but has a fresh feel (like their baked goods)."

+ Atmosphere. A very refreshing white and teal.
+ Food. Prosciutto sandwich with mozzarella and cherry compote. The potato, bacon, corn chowder was delicious. We used our potato chips as scoops and turned the soup (it was highly viscous) into a dip. You should try it.
+ Service. Very good. Normally, you do you own busing, but they were a tad slow so they did it for us. Great!
+ Beer, wine.
+ Music. I loves the oldies.

I had heard great things about this place, the chef/baker/owner&#39;s delicious items, and the casual atmosphere. The decor is tasteful (recovered wood, doors, shutters) and full of natural light. Free WiFi, great ambient music, clean tables. 

My only disappointment was my plate of homemade biscuits and gravy. The plus side: I was offered the possibility of having both the country and the green chile gravy. The down side: the temperature of the green chile was cold, if barely luke warm. 

Luckily, the genuinely friendly and capable server/barista/cashiers offered a small pastry as an apology. In fact, the service alone would bring me back. And I will come back for lunch soon. ;)"

Thankfully I started at Regis recently otherwise I probably wouldn&#39;t have found this hidden gem. Seriously, everything I have had here is completely legit!

My favorite breakfast foods to nosh on at the Noshery is the Bacon, Egg, &amp; Cheese Breakfast Sandwich and the Homestyle Waffle. Also, at $5, I think their sandwiches are a STEAL! Oh! And the banana bread is freaking AMAZING!

For lunch, I have had the pleasure of noshing on their Steak and Chimichuri sandwich and Pasta Salad on more than one occasion! You can really tell that their food is not only homemade, but made with love (awwwww!). I&#39;m just sayin&#39; that the bread they serve here (on the breakfast and lunch sandwiches) is soooooo gooooood! It&#39;s like they kidnapped some old German woman to bake them fresh rolls and pastries every hour on the hour. 

So, with that all being put out to the universe, if you happen to find yourself on this side of town and are looking for some grub to nosh on, the Noshery is your spot!!!"

The baked goods are all off-the-chart amazing (scones, flourless chocolate cake, tarts, etc...). The owner and her chef work on those every day except Monday. The breakfast and lunch items I&#39;ve tried so far were also very satisfying (gravy biscuits, sandwiches with egg and veggies on fresh rolls).

It is flat out my favorite coffee shop in town. 

The Noshery is in the developing Berkley neighborhood in North Denver, right across from Regis University.

She was a pleasure to work with and everything turned out beautiful and delicious. We found it hard narrowing it down to just a few varieties of desserts because her skill set and menu goes on and on. Gluten free restrictions did not even phase her and she had many options for our gluten free guests. As an added bonus we got to plan our menu over delicious lattes and breakfast on a quaint Saturday morning in the cutest little bakery breakfast spot in Denver. Thanks for everything Andrea!

Bacon breakfast sandwich: at $5 a sandwich not too shabby. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the bread for some reason, can&#39;t really put my finger on it but maybe I just find the bread to filling ratio a little high.

Coffee: it&#39;s coffee and not shitty.

Decor: kind of adorable. The mint green makes everything is fresh and so clean clean.

The first time I ordered the potato waffles--delicious and unique, definitely worth a try. The second time I forced myself to order something different, and the turkey sandwich is delightfully original, with crunch and sweet-sourness that&#39;s balanced by a good layer of turkey on soft bread. Another great menu item! I tried the caramel brownie which was tasty as well, and much fudgier than I had expected. Overall a bang for your buck, seeing as it&#39;s quick, delicious, quaint, and local! I highly recommend it to anyone who&#39;s looking for a nice little neighborhood cafe.

I&#39;ve had the chicken salad, turkey sand, breakfast sammie, prosciutto sand, chickpea curry soup and tons of baked goods and it&#39;s all great. I literally have never been disappointed. 

My personal favorite is the breakfast sammie with ham and arugula on a biscuit which isn&#39;t technically on the menu but they&#39;re wonderful and super accommodating. If they can make it for you, they will.

All their bread is homemade and delicious.

for light dinner, i got the market salad with chicken for $8.49.  the picture on the menu looked very good.  it was almost full to the rim with goodies and that definitely sold me right away.  of course we all know this place serves noodle  dishes but they have been serving lot of non-carb options.

what i ended up getting was half bowl of pitiful looking salad.  i see tossed lettuce, tomatoes, chopped apples and cheese.  didn&#39;t even get the chicken which i had to go and ask for.  other than the mishap, it was delicious salad, light  and refreshing.  However, for the hefty price tag, serving size was definitely too small.  Mad 
Green has better portion but there isn&#39;t one near by.

it was a dinner rush time  and lots of people waiting for to go orders to  and the kitchen staff running around like chicken with no head, maybe they deserve another round of market salad."

While I was waiting there was no one nearby and people who were sitting down waiting for food had to walk behind the register to ask someone when their food would be ready as they had been waiting a long time. My food finally came out 15 minutes later than what it was supposed to per the online order. Then they shorted me on something I had ordered and I had to be helped again. I would not recommend.

Maybe it&#39;s the fact that I&#39;m trying more &#34;south east Asian&#34; style dishes.  If you like this kind of food, walk across the street to Thai Garden.  I&#39;ve tried  the pad thai and that Indonesian peanut mess.  On the pad thai, it came with &#34;sizzling&#34; shrimp.  I don&#39;t know how these people define &#34;sizzling&#34;, but these were like those frozen salad shrimp you just thaw.  I&#39;ve had ice cream that was sizzling more.

The Indonesian peanut mess was just strange.  The noodles weren&#39;t  bad, but it was supposed to come with a peanut sauce.  To me, sauce means you can see the...sauce.  

Also, I got there about 11:30 am and it looked like the lunch crowd had come and gone.  Half the tables had dirty dishes on them.

We got a card for one free bowl once a month for a year at a silent auction to support a local food bank.  And, with our month quickly running out, my wife convinced me to stop in there with her, and I did..  It was not what I was expecting at all. 

Inside, I found a variety of good, inexpensive options, options enough to please nearly every taste and appetite.  They had entrees, sandwiches, salads, soups, and more with options for vegetarians, vegans, and even carnivores.  They even had good, low-calorie drink options in addition to beers and wines.  Not every fast good place offers beer and wine.  

The prices were very reasonable, (about $6.00 for your choice), the food was tasty, and the service was impeccable.  

I&#39;ve noticed that this is a chain, and that there are many all over the city.  If the others are as good as this one, I will probably find myself dining there more often.  Whether it&#39;s sit down, or fast food, you can&#39;t do much better than this with your dining dollars.  A really, really nice option"

I highly recommend getting a trio...you get noodles, a protein, and a salad or soup for 7.50, and the portions are healthy.

Oh, this place is also awesome for vegetarians. The noodles don&#39;t come with protein, so vegetarians have tons of choices. Most of their dishes are vegetarian without the protein.

One slightly negative thing...be wary of going to this location on Saturday afternoons. It&#39;s way busy, and with the surrounding businesses being so busy too, its nearly impossible to find a place to park.

We weren&#39;t sure if the place was more bar than grill and wanted our daughter (plus the other patrons that want adult-time only) to be comfortable.  The bartender, JJ, answered the phone and said it was a quiet night and our daughter would be more than welcome!   

The moment we walked in the door, we were made to feel right at home!  JJ and our server were extremely friendly and made sure we were as comfortable as possible the entire time we were there!  While this isn&#39;t a top-of-the-line type of place, it is what it is: decent, cheap bar food and good beer in a relaxed setting! 
  
All the tables are high-tops, so our little one was sitting down low in her high chair. We thought it would bother her, but she thought it was great!  Guess she thought the view was funny from under the table?! 

I had a Margarita (rocks, salt) and my Hubby had Sam Adams from the tap to drink.  My Marg was awesome!  There wasn&#39;t an overpour of sour mix and a splash of tequila in this drink!  The bartender made it right: real sour mix and tequila, YUMMY!!  I used to be a bartender and I HATE it when a Marg is made on the cheap with an over-pour of sour mix and you need ten heartburn pills to compensate--it&#39;s awful!  The Sam Adams was fresh and not the end of the tap leftover from Saturday night. 

We ordered the fried pickles to start and a Philly Cheese Steak with tater tots.  The Cheese Steak was made with Swiss cheese, which is the exact way my husband likes it (no spray Velvetta for him); with onions, mushrooms and green peppers on a baguette.  It was amazing!  The tater tots were flavoured with some type of onion and garlic salt and were absolutely delicious as well!  Highly recommend both the Cheese Steak and the tater tots, for sure!!  

The fried pickles we will pass on next time, unfortunately.  They weren&#39;t fried enough and ended up somewhat doughy instead.  They are served with ranch or spicy ranch dressing, which is okay, but other places serve them with a spicy mayo dressing and it&#39;s definitely tastier.  The fried pickles weren&#39;t bad, yet we were truly disappointed because they could have been so much better. . . 

We had a very nice experience at America&#39;s!  The service was awesome and 90% of the food and drinks were fantastic!  Once we left, they started getting in a more adult, singles crowd and it looked like they would be busy for the rest of the night.  I would recommend going here for a few drinks with friends and to watch a game or play pool. We plan on going back to do just that!"

As of recently, it had been a while and upon my return noticed that there were (clears throat) some changes. I can recall when the crowd was a bit more diverse. I went on a Friday. I used to love their Golden Tangy wings (which I ordered) and their fries, both were dry and had no flavor whatsoever. Their drinks were stiff and did the trick. The prices have gone up and quality has seemed to decline. The service was pretty horrible. Thank goodness one of the waitresses had a great personality that almost completely made up for their lack of service. They have a Jukebox which blasted country music. I remember when they used to have a DJ on Fridays and a small dance floor. I&#39;m assuming the floor was being replaced because their cracked concrete floor was hella dirty and not just with dust. It had napkins old ass French Fries and what appeared to be old gum. I&#39;m uncertain if my experience was just an off-day for this place or if they just suck way more now.

They have made a few changes, not all of them for the better.  The décor is more appealing, and having a good looking bar is a plus, but they made changes to the menu that boggles my mind.  

The prices have gone up.  No surprise with all the changes being made, but the prices no longer reflect the food quality.  I ordered a pitcher of beer for our table.  The waitress informed me that they no longer have pitchers available.  With the new concept, they only serve beer by the glass.  I thought it was odd, since every dive (divey) bar I have been in serves pitchers.  Not a big deal, just odd.  So four beers it was. 

I tried the new smoked barbecue wings, the flavors of the chicken and the barbecue sauce were so mismatched that I could not eat them.  The smoked wings taste like there was liquid smoke added to them (I despise liquid smoke).  The barbecue sauce was thin and a bit weak.  After biting into a wing, I no longer felt hungry, so I cannot comment on anything else food wise.

The bar is still filled with T.V.&#39;s and I still plan on visiting the patio this summer, but I am losing faith in this establishment.  I will come back again to see what the new ownership turns this bar into before passing judgment; I might just eat before I show up."

The bartender was a nice young woman and the beer was cold. The Philly came out and was one of the neater renditions of the sandwich as far as presentation goes, but was very tasty!

I told my husband watch them just take them off. I normally would have done that but with onions I did not want that flavor on my food. Super ewwwy lol well sure enough maybe 1-2 minutes later girl walks back up with it and yep they missed picking some off lol I&#39;m not stupid but I think that was pretty crappy!

Wings are great, very meaty, and the sauces are perfect.  Atmosphere is your typical neighborhood bar.  No frills.  Lots of locals.

Sadly, this place has had a difficult time finding good servers.  I went with a few girlfriends around 8pm for wings and a pitcher.  When the server approached us, we were mid conversation and apparently this distracted her work flow enough that she had  a young man from the kitchen handle our food order.  When it was time for the check, however, she was back with a big smile hoping for a good tip.  We asked for the bill to be split 3 equal ways.   Here were the checks:  $11, $15, $18.  I&#39;m no math wiz, but $44 divided by 3 is not that. 

Checked my bank account the next morning to find I was charged $22.39 for my portion.  Management will be getting a visit from me today. 

I&#39;m really annoyed by this because I absolutely adore this establishment for good food and proximity to my home.

A day for football, excessive Tebowing, drinking and cheering on the Broncos.
A day that is awesome in itself. Sunday Funday baby!

In catching the game with a few friends this past Sunday, America&#39;s was the bar of choice, and apparently the bar to be at, because it was packed. to the gills. Here is a rundown of my afternoon turned evening...

2:25pm = I arrive with bf in tow, and we snag a table in the bar. Thanks to our friends that got their earlier, they picked seats right in front of the big screen. Score. I notice the bar is decorated in all things Broncos. Score x2.

2:31pm =  Our first drinks arrive. Rum is on special for $3, so I prepare myself, and my wallet, for an afternoon of excessive Rum drinking. Beer was cheap too...but why result in crappy beer when you can get a quicker buzz on Rum..for cheap!

2:35pm = The Bronco game begins. I order another drink.

2:37pm = My 2nd drink arrives...and I&#39;m loving it. Our waitress is so fast and on top of it for being insanely crowded. As long as she continues to check back with us, keep my drinks filled and not become annoying with constant check in&#39;s...she&#39;ll get a fatty tip.

2:45pm = Raffle tickets are distributed for free prizes at halftime. I repeat...FREE. I&#39;m so in...and order another drink. I also request a menu to order the greasiest food I can find. So much for the diet. They arrive shortly after being asked for.

3:10pm =The Broncos score their first touchdown! Woohoo! Orange and Blue jello shots are passed around [again for free!] to celebrate, and will be distributed every single time the Broncos score.  this is so money.

3:30pm-6:30pm = A blur of  Rum drinks, rounds of jello shots, free t-shirts, an order of fried mushrooms [which were delicious!] and their wing/fry plate [get the Colorado hot sauce...yum!], another round of jello shots, and a Bronco win in overtime!!

All makes for a perfect Sunday Funday...minus the hangover on Monday.
pshh.

It&#39;s our first visit to this location, but we used to frequent the America&#39;s on Iliff &amp; Quebec.  We really loved their wings &amp; fries more than just about any place else, and were disappointed when that restaurant changed hands.  

Luckily, this location on Chambers is the same ol&#39; America&#39;s we remember with great drink specials and food.  We got wings with honey hot sauce and they were delicious!   America&#39;s has always been one of our favorite spots for fries, and they didn&#39;t disappoint.   Their chicken fingers seem to be made on site (not frozen) and were great.   Buckets of beer were around $10, and we enjoyed several.  

I only had one complaint, which is why I didn&#39;t give America&#39;s 5 stars, and that is the smell.  The restrooms are just inside the front door, and when we came in both bathroom doors were propped open &amp; the place smelled like, well, bathroom.

This is a bar and grill in the truest since of the word. There is a nice sized bar in the middle, with what looked to be a good number of taps and bottles of different varieties.

There are TV&#39;s everywhere, showcasing all manner of sporting excellence. 

High tables and chairs make up the dining area. The chairs are kind of sloped, so be careful. 

America&#39;s is apparently known for their wings. They have about a dozen flavors to include one so hot, that you have to sign a waiver to even try! I ordered a flavor that I think was called &#34;honey hot&#34; which turned out to be delicious.

10 wings for about 5 bucks isn&#39;t a bad price so they get high marks there too. The servers were few, but good. They could use a little extra help I suppose but they tried their best and they were very friendly and welcoming. I&#39;d really like to visit on a game day, seems like it would be great time.

How  have I loved thee, let me count the ways...

Now that I think about it, I&#39;ve never loved it.  However, during the dark period of my life that I lived in Aurora, I did stop in here pretty frequently.  It was a little place with an amazing happy hour.  The food was never dependable, it was different every time you went in.  The service was usually slow as it was always understaffed. But damn, the place was cheap.  I could go in on happy hour and get wings for 10 cents a piece and a $5 pitcher of beer.  Not amazing food, but absolutely amazing prices.

Since then, things have changed.  The service has gotten better and the beer selection has improved.  The wing sauces are still tasty, and the cook staff is still unable to put out a consistent product.  One day the wings will be perfect, the next undercooked, the next batch will come out crispy.  The fries are the same way.  And the amazing prices have completely disappeared.  Even during happy hour, prices are pretty much equivalent to Buffalo Wild Wings.

How have I loved thee?  

1.  You were cheap.
2.  You were convenient.

Those might be desirable traits for a booty call, but not for a restaurant.  Good bye, America&#39;s.  I&#39;m breaking up with you."

I think the review by DF may not be taking into account the wings and the happy hour menu!  Go to this place during their happy hour times I think its 4:30 to 6:30 and 9:30 to close or something like that.  You are in for a treat as you can get your wings with 6 different sauces and the wings are made perfect and are crispy!  Get yourself some celery and carrots and dip them suckers in ranch and gulp down the beer you poured from the nice ice cold pitcher.  Go on with your bad self and get the to die for fried breaded mushrooms, it&#39;s the best in town!  The place doesn&#39;t look like much on the outside but just wait until come in and eat!  Its cheap and you get tons of food and is great to bring some buddies and watch the game as well.  Don&#39;t forget to give these items a try and maybe you will change your mind too."

I opted for one level lower, as my experience has been if they require a waiver, although very hot, they generally don&#39;t taste that good. The ones I ate, forget the name, were very good.

Based on the Yelp reviews, my wife and I wanted to try some good tacos while in Denver. We ordered two micheladas and the salsa trio to start. 

The micheladas were amazing. These were real micheladas, and not just an american version with a little tomato juice. All the flavors were there, and there was a little spice as well. I wish I could say the same thing about the salsa. We were brought the house salsa, an avocado salsa,  a jalapeño salsa, and a chipotle mayo sauce. None of them had much heat or flavor. The jalapeño was the best. It had a little, and I mean a little, heat. It was pretty smoky, but without the kick you expect from a jalapeño. 

We ordered some asada tacos, carnitas, al pastor, and pescado. The asada was ok, but it didn&#39;t come with any cilantro and onions, which are taco staples. Al pastor was probably my favorite, but the pineapples that came in the taco looked like they came out of a can. The pescado was fried to the point where it felt like I was eating chips. 

Overall, it was almost like eating real Mexican tacos. I have a hard time when tacos do not come with onions and cilantro, as these are absolutely necessary when eating tacos. The micheladas were great though, and I would come back for those alone."

The tacos were some of the best &#34;street tacos&#34; we have ever had. We even ordered some to take back to the hotel.

I was happy to see how cheery and festive it is both on the inside and out. I was happy to be able to seat myself at a table or bar and see that all the open spots were sparkling clean and welcoming. I was happy to see the full bar and $5 house margaritas (and all margs are 1/2 price on Mondays, yaassssss). I was happy to see a simple menu with absolutely affordable prices. $2-$3.50 tacos, $5-$8 appetizers, $8-$12 dollar entrees. Flan, churros, salsa trio, authentic street tacos. I was happy with the upbeat music featuring favorites like MJ&#39;s Billie Jean. Happy happy happy.

I ordered two al pastor tacos which come with pineapple, purple onion, and cilantro. A TON of flavor and meat packed into those tiny corn tortillas. My side of refried black beans was fantastic as well, although pretty little. Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t in the margarita mood, so I settled for some Sierra Mist (Pepsi products here, folks... that&#39;s the only thing that didn&#39;t make me happy). 

Our waiter was so sweet and he took care of us without out hovering or checking in on us 10,000 times. It was all just right. I&#39;ll definitley have many happy returns at Las Margs."

Lured in for the first time by the &#34;$2.99 breakfast burrito&#34; sign. Asked for the chorizo burrito and the server asked if I wanted it smothered. I said sure and waited. Service was quick, but the bill was $5.40. Surely there must be some mistake? Nope, if you want a couple green chiles on your burrito, the upcharge is 2/3 again the price of the entire burrito. 

I got over it and opened the takeout container - pretty big, maybe $5 wasn&#39;t so bad after all? Well, it tasted alright, but was predominantly filled with potatoes - I kind of felt like I was eating French fries for breakfast. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be getting another."

The price was pretty high for the taco size (small tacos that average about $4 apiece). The carnitas tacos were excellent, the al pastor ones were dry and not very flavorful, the rajas were ok. 

Service was very friendly. Somewhat slow. 

If you live close, I can see how this would be a good neighborhood joint to drop by, but I wouldn&#39;t trek across town again."

I came for an informal Yelp happy hour. I have never been here despite it being just around the corner from one of my favorite pubs from back in the day. 

Our waitress was great. Even though they clearly weren&#39;t expecting a party of 10 or 12, she handled us efficiently and with a warm smile on her face.

I ordered a Pacifico on tap. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever seen Pacifico on tap at a small place like this, but it was a welcome sight. I also ordered the al pastor and the other pork taco (can&#39;t remember the name). Both were full of delicious, fresh street taco flavor and color. They came served on two corn tortillas, and I always appreciate when corn tortilla tacos come with two tortillas because one always results in eating the taco filling with a fork.

This is definitely a cool neighborhood taco bar that I would frequent if it was closer to home. For anyone hanging around the City Park West or East Uptown area, stop by, get a cheap Pacifico on tap, and order a few tacos."

I hate to go against the grain, but all the good Yelp reviews led me to suggest this place for dinner last night. We got: margaritas, the salsa trio, six tacos, and the chile rellenos between three of us. I thought maybe I was being harsh on the food since I had recently gone to Tacos Tequila Whiskey (AKA Pinches) and that place is really hard to beat, but the two people I was with agreed. The food wasn&#39;t bad, and I know they are going for authentic Mexican, but any street taco I have had in LA/Southern California was better. However, like I mention earlier, the prices are just great for what you get and the staff was really wonderful- accomodating and everyone was in a good mood. I will say there are definitely worse places to eat on this side of town, but also there is much better.

Note: parking was awful, and we went on a week night, so head over early if you are meeting people at a certain time! And another side note: Although it&#39;s in City Park West..it&#39;s still off Colfax, so I got asked for change twice walking to my car, and a lady called me the B word and asked if I want to fight! I was even walking with my Dad!!! This has nothing to do with the restaurant, but I&#39;m still so appalled and I need to tell EVERYONE! Haha"

It&#39;s close to our house and never fails to satisfy.  They have Happy Hour Tues thru Sun 3 to 7, and all day Monday!  $2 drafts, $3 Margs.  Can&#39;t beat it.

The food is inexpensive and hits the spot.  Not amazing and gourmet, but consistently tasty.  Our favorite dish is the chile rellenos.  We get it with vegetarian red AND vegetarian green chile mixed - $9.50.  So delicious!  They have Tecate, Pacifico, Modelo, and both XX on tap, plus a couple of American beers.

The waitstaff are very nice.  They always bring the children&#39;s dishes out 5-10 minutes early which is considerate and thoughtful.  It&#39;s a great place - try it!"

And the staff is very friendly.  If all I wanted was a drink and a place to hang out, this might be it.  But since it&#39;s a restaurant, I&#39;m shocked that it has such good reviews.  The food isn&#39;t completely inedible, but it&#39;s pretty bad.

We started with the Queso, which was supposed to be a blend of melted cheeses served with corn chips.  Sounds delicious, right?  But what you actually get is cheese whiz with some peppers chopped up in it.  You can eat it, but if you&#39;re willing to forgo the peppers then you can get almost the same dish at 7-11 for $3.

I also tried three of their street tacos: the asada, al pastor, and carnitas.  All three of them were boring and flavorless.  The al pastor taco was especially mushy, it looked like they tossed the meat and pineapples into a blender with some sauce and then scooped them onto the tortilla.  The asada was bland, and the carnitas tasted like leftovers.  I love street tacos, but I only tolerated these.

It&#39;s far from the worst Mexican food place that I&#39;ve been to, but it&#39;s close enough that I don&#39;t see myself going back."

If I could rate the staff separately I&#39;d give them 4. The atmosphere is a little divey, but it doesn&#39;t detract (it is right off of Colfax after all) so that&#39;s fine. Unfortunately the food doesn&#39;t live up.

We didn&#39;t order very much so there&#39;s a chance it gets better, although I kinda doubt it. The queso appetizer is basically cheese wiz or velveeta with chopped peppers. The Las Cruces enchiladas were cheesy (which I was looking for) but the sauce was clearly canned. 

My husband ordered three distinct tacos but found them eerily similar looking and tasting even worse. At the end of the night, I wished we&#39;d gone to Chipotle. 

Denver has some incredible Mexican food,  it takes more than an off street patio to impress."

Everything was delicious, delicious, delicious...and the service was also amazing! The al pastor taco was by far my favorite. When I come back I plan on ordering only the al pastor I loved them so much. All of the salsas were good...the red salsas were my favorite.

We came for happy hour and were seated promptly in the bar area (had a group of four). We ended up getting the chips/salsas (I really liked the creamy chipotle dip) along with a few house margaritas. The margaritas were... house-like... but you can&#39;t really complain when they&#39;re $3! There are several other variations of margs like the Patron and Skinny (not as much sweetness) for a few bucks more. They also have really cheap beers if mixed drinks aren&#39;t your first choice.

I was excited to start indulging my thirst early with $1 Mimosas and $2 Bloody Mary&#39;s.  For the price point I have to say these were nice, I could have had five or six of those Mimosas, alas I only enjoyed two since I needed to pace myself for the long day ahead.  

I had a taste of four separate tacos and there were some that were better than others.  The Adovada was my all-time favorite of the four with a black bean puree, queso fresco with flavorful slow cooked pork.  The whole combination was tasty and if I could choose again I may just order two or three of the Adovada. I also sampled the Asada, Al Pastor, and the Carnitas and they were all good.  Some of the flavors were more muted than I prefer for tacos.  

Las Margs is a fun place located just off Colfax, with a small patio and excellent drink deals on Saturday&#39;s.  Service is quite good, drinks are refreshed quickly and food is served piping hot (is there any other way?).  It&#39;s a fun place for the group or to grab some quick tacos on the go."

A fun Mexican restaurant with great food and great prices. Brightly colored with a warm atmosphere and GREAT music selection! SELENA YAAASS! Self seating good for large groups and also a full bar to sit at. It&#39;s also hard not to run into a happy hour it this place. 

Moving from Texas recently I was sad to leave the local margaritas... I&#39;m happy to say I&#39;m in love with Las Margs house margaritas!! Cheap and lots of salt on the rim! Just how I like em&#39;! Also their specialty margaritas are pretty good too. Lets keep talking alcohol at the moment shall we? $1 BRUNCH MIMOSAS ON SAT AND SUN UNTIL 2!!! I think I died and when to brunch heaven  The food is great as well. You pretty much can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu; Street tacos, burritos, nachos, tamales! All good! I also recommend the &#34;Salsa Trio&#34; mmm mmm mmm. 

The staff is quick, attentive and have yet to get my order wrong. Zach is the owner and has always made us feel like one of the Las Margs family. He will seriously sit down and really get to know you if you let him. Great guy. I love my neighborhood taco place and strongly recommend it to you all."

I would call the food, overpriced bar Mexican food, similar to the Rio (tasteless, microwaved yuk). 

Pros:
Friendly staff
Good drink specials
Cheap drinks
Divey atmosphere, yet clean

Cons:
Way overpriced food for the quality. 
Quality of food: ($7 FRIKING DOLLARS for a cup of tasteless guacamole and a basket of chips!!!!, salsa from a jar, $1.50 for an extra basket of chips? $.75 for a tiny side of tasteless, Pace Picante sauce salsa?) 
$4 for ONE street taco? Have you lost your mind?!?

5 stars for the bar side. Negative 10 stars for the food side. 

Hello?!? You are a divey bar near Colfax, not a restaurant on the top floor of the Hilton in San Francisco!!!!  Lmao."

The tinga tacos and the asada tacos are my favorite. The steak is tender and the salsa that tops the taco goes with the meat perfectly. It is garlicky, tangy, and delicious. They even top it with a grilled green onion. It adds a delicious, authentically Mexican jazz to the taco. The tinga comes with slow cooked chicken. It is juicy and it falls apart. The black bean paste they slather on it takes the texture to the next level too. It makes it savory, chewy, tangy, and delicious. 

The store is nicely decorated and they play good music. The outdoor patio is the perfect spot during on warmer days. They have good happy hour specials, especially on Mondays."

And with a busker&#39;s abracadabra it has transformed itself into a street taco shop with a shrunken version of its prior name. 

The mildly surprising thing . . . ? They&#39;ve done a really good job of it. They serve up some excellent choices (my faves = the Al Pastor, Pescado, Camerones and Rajas), and also mix up a top notch house-made guacamole that&#39;s got a nice kick to it. 

All of that makes me a fan.  And while the atmosphere is not particularly appealing they&#39;ve got a decent outside front patio a few doors north of Colfax on Marion that&#39;s a nice place to catch some sun and grab a cerveza along with the good eats.

So check &#39;em out and sign me,

Burritos - I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of, as I tried one but the breakfast burrito I tried once ($2) definitely hit the spot. Make sure you get their chips and salsa to start off with.

They have a neat little patio that&#39;s perfect for enjoying some margs and salsa with a group of friends! Our server Rebecca was great. She was friendly, funny, attentive and fast. Everything you could ever ask for from someone who is in charge of your margaritas!
Their house margaritas are really good! I usually only have one marg because of how sweet they can be but this spot does it right! Just a hint of sweetness, lots of lime and margaritaville tequila...yum! 
We had the salsa trio which actually came with four salsas. My favorite was the creamy chipotle. Jeff&#39;s was the tomatillo. We also tried the queso. Put a bowl of cheese in front of me and I&#39;m a happy gal.
We each had a few street tacos. On my plate were the asada, al pastor and tinga. The al pastor was my favorite though I thought all three were really good. These aren&#39;t your run of the mill skimpy street tacos either. They&#39;re packed full of meat and have honking huge slices of avocado on them.
It was a great time! Rebecca told us that they a great brunch so we will be back shortly for that!"

We stared with the chips and salsa trio. The red salsa was great, the salsa verde was a little too salty for our liking. 

We got four tacos and ranked them as such:

1) drumroll..... Asada
2) adovada (close second)
3) Rajas!!!! Give it a shot esp if you like da veg
4) pastor. Really great cook but the others were just toooo good

Drinks were fine, but the service was awesome!

The bartender was very attentive and Zack was great with the customers. He gave us an order of churros with dank Mexican dipping chocolate on the house! The churros were perfectly hot and crispy on the outside and melt-in-yo-mouth on the inside. 

Would come back again to check out their $1 mimosa deal and grub on some more tacos!!"

We ordered the chips and trio dips which also came with their regular salsa. Although it was spicier that I can handle, the salsa was my favorite and had the most flavor. The avocado dip was bland and watery. It reminded me of when I blend spinach and water as the base for my smoothies. The fire roasted green was OK as was the creamy chipotle but for $3, can&#39;t really complain.

For my meal, I had the salad with fried/breaded tilapia. The greens were fresh and fish very fried and crispy but not greasy - I enjoyed it. It came with a cilantro lime vinaigrette that a bit oily but not bad. My husband had three al pastor tacos and they came stuffed with a lot of meat - good value.

Nice outdoor space and friendly service"

He suggested the Enchiladas Camerones. All I can say is WOW! The shrimp in these kinds of dishes is almost always over cooked - these were perfect! The flavor had many layers that hit gradually with each bite.  A friend rated the tacos as average and I believe her but, the enchiladas camerones were really something special!

I would have to say it was average nothing to wow about. I can see why others may think it&#39;s a great spot due to the ambiance and the great happy hour on weekends, but the food wasn&#39;t over the top or outstanding as I hoped it would be. First we had 4$ margaritas, They were refreshing but they seemed to be lacking that punch of alcohol. We order the 3 salsa which were good, each with a different flavor. It would of made a  big difference to have fresh hot chips, didn&#39;t care for the red salsa. We went with a variety of dishes family style; chile Rellno plate, Asada and Al pastor taco and the star of the lunch enchiladas Camarones.  I enjoyed the fresh black beans that came with the dishes. The renellos were the egg roll wrapped version. More wrap and cheese with a sliver of pepper and it was smothered in a green chile that tasted like 505 which I didn&#39;t care for. The Asada meat on the taco was tender and had nice flavor. The Al pastor meat could of had More of a taste, the pineapple on the taco is all you could really taste. It was over powered with sweetness. Now on to the enchiladas el Camarones. It had a great creamy sauce topped with avocado, tomatoes and cilantro and inside were chunks of shrimp with chorizo. I thought this dish was delicious. If I was to come back to check out happy hour, I&#39;d order this dish again! Overall I think this place may have the potential to be a 4 star place. They just need to tweak some minor things; for example fresh HOT chips!"

We have a Sunday breakfast tradition, and they had $1 mimosas from 8-12 on Sunday&#39;s which was neat.

The only drawback for me was that it has a very distinctly &#34;bar&#34; atmosphere which would have been fine, except it just felt weird on a Sunday morning. We sat at the tables as some of the people seated at the bar were a bit odd.

I had just one stop-in here on a Saturday afternoon and the $2 beers sure hit the spot. You can&#39;t complain with that price! Clearly, this business is understaffed but that could be a simple fix. The employees who were working had a lot of hustle but there still should have been at least one more person taking care of customers.

Although I was enjoying a liquid lunch, by companions very much liked their meals. The food looked and smelled decent so I would be more than happy to give it a try at a later date. Plus, it was a very inexpensive experience - so there&#39;s that.

I really like the physical space. It&#39;s dark and cool on the inside with a small patio for the outdoor kinds of people. The bar area, while very small, is a cool place to hang out. There are also intimate tables set up in the main dining area. I was also very impressed with the cleanliness of the place (including the bathrooms).

The margs were good. Had the chips and salsa and a Carne Asada burrito. Both were good. My friend had a carnitas burrito and the wife had a couple tacos. Everyone liked what they had. Great place to grab a quick bite and some drinks before a show at the Ogden or Fillmore. I&#39;ll be back.

I&#39;ve tried a few different items on the menu and I&#39;ve had the same thing twice. The food is very consistent and always taste the same. The portions are good as well. 

The queso is great and it has a good little kick to it as well.

The food was excellent and the happy hour was extended and dangerous with $4 house Margs. He even hooked us up for being nice. Def will go back. Al pastor tacos were very authentic and the 3 salsas had a flavor to satisfy all at our table. Give it a try well worth the stop."

Tonight we had $2 beers (dos xx amber, tecate, pacifico, modelo on draft) and $3 margaritas - on a Saturday night! The place is clean and the service has been spotty, but not bad enough to keep us away, that&#39;s for sure. Parking can a little difficult at times, being right off of Colfax.

The Mrs. and I shared an order of rellenos. These were delicious with lots of cheese and great chile flavor. We also ordered up 4 Al Pastor tacos, 2 for each of us. These were also yummy yummy.

The service was great, and the food is seriously the best Mexican food I&#39;ve had in Denver! 

Started with the queso, which was creamy and had fresh jalapeños inside. Not overly spicy, but definitely had a kick! They make their chips in house, and you could tell - they were prepared and salted perfectly! Yum!

I had the veggie street taco and was not disappointed. The veggies were fresh and seasoned just right. Word to the wise - one is not enough! ;)

The Owner came by and started chatting with us for a bit. He was so funny and really made us feel welcome! Same can be said about the bartender that waited on us- this team really made our evening enjoyable.

We had such a great experience that we came back the next afternoon for lunch! Cheese enchiladas, rice and black beans... Just delicious! We left truly satisfied and will be making the commute from Boulder to Denver just for the food! (Yes Mexican food is that important to us!)"

We were staying with a friend and decided on Las Margs based on the reviews and proximity to my friend&#39;s house.  They did not disappoint!

The waiter, Miguel, was recently hired and was mostly knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered the enchiladas, hubby had the street tacos, daughter had the torta, and friend had the chile relleno.  We also enjoyed the churros for dessert, which were served with a side of hot chocolate for dipping.  Yum!  We all enjoyed our plates very much.

My enchiladas had carnitas and it was very tender and seasoned well.  It was smothered in a red sauce that had a little spice to it.  The chile relleno had a green sauce, also with a kick.  We enjoy spicy so it was great!  My husband&#39;s street tacos were all good, but he preferred the pork adovada.  The chicken in the torta was pretty good as well, my daughter enjoyed her first torta experience.

There was a bit of confusion on the prices of our beers since we apparently showed up right at the cutoff of happy hour (7pm).  Miguel charged us the happy hour price for the first round and we were surprised at the full cost for the second since we thought it was a Taco Tuesday type deal.  We misunderstood.

On the Taco Tuesday point, they did not have any special taco prices.  I thought that was suprising because here in Southern California pretty much all mexican food places offer a deal on Tuesdays.  Not a big deal, just surprised was all.

Overall it was a good experience.  The restaurant itself has very high ceilings, tons of exposed brick, and a full bar.  Miguel was a plus for customer service.  Our friend said he will definitely be going back when they have special on Tequila night (Mondays), 50% off those super expensive tequila shots."

The owners and staff was welcoming and engage conversation with me even while I ordered 5 minutes before closing on a Friday afternoon!

nice, airy spot. Saturday afternoon and not very many people here. 

ordered  the bruschetta and was disappointed in that. it was pickled, but not the traditional bruschetta and that&#39;s what i was hoping for. the mojito mussels were just ok. i don&#39;t think the coconut in the broth jived with this dish well. it was fine and i ate it, the appetizers were $2 off so oh well. 

my. boyfriend ordered the el jefe cuban. the bread was toasted well, there was enough meat, the cheese was great and there wasn&#39;t too much mustard on it. i had the Asian shortrib with fried rice and slaw and that was disappointing also. the sauce was overpowering, the shortrib itself was overcooked. the meat wasn&#39;t tough but not that tender either. the fried rice was too mushy. too much water. fried rice shouldn&#39;t be mushy like that.

Many fast food places. So this was a great find! I love the patio and decor and it&#39;s open to outside so very pleasant temperature. Quiet music in background. Generous pour on the happy hour wine. I had the fish of the day. Salmon with wild mushrooms, pomegranate gastrique, arugula. The salmon was cooked perfectly. Everything was extremely fresh and well seasoned. Service was excellent.

We just moved to the neighborhood and are looking for good spots. It is way too noisy. All construction is hard surfaces and you can barely talk. In summer if the weather is good the patio would be a good choice. Food is average at best. Trying to be something that they are not. Just does not make the grade. Big bar scene and I suspect the whole place is aimed at a younger demographic. Tried it twice and probably won&#39;t go back. Hoping for better choices at the new construction near the Town Center so we can walk.

They have a great meat slicer that cuts up the premium meats and provides a good show. Mini grilled cheese pretty good. House made potato chips excellent.

Disliked: Not kid friendly. We were here with our 2+5 year old grandkids. No booster seats, no high chairs, no kids menu. Service from Heather incredibly slow for kids and adults alike. Cubano sandwich chewy (after waiting an hour for it to appear). Limited wine list with few fine wines. Catena malbec was the best choice @$10/glass.

Overall: close call between 2-3 stars. I would suggest no young children, as this place does not welcome them. OK for adults who are willing to pay the fare."

At first the service was nice and fast but when they got busy they were obviously short handed and the service was no longer fast but still nice.
I ordered the Bistro Burger, well done, on a gluten free bun. It came not quite well done but close. The bun was very good but fell apart easy like all gluten free buns I have tried. The chips that came with it were pretty good but seasoned in a way I didn&#39;t care for. But i can&#39;t say with what. I&#39;m not sure.

On a bitter cold day their hearty French Onion Soup  topped off with some gently truffled mozzarella, and served along with a side of crusty bread, well, that&#39;s a good thing. Accompany that warming broth with a $12 glass of Catena Malbec, and while not a screaming deal, it made for a simple and satisfying late lunch.

The Bistro&#39;s atmosphere is industrially modern, and suburban simple. The service was upbeat, pleasant and timely. Nothing super exciting, but nothing wrong with it either. A nice place for locals, but not a place you&#39;d travel across town to visit.

As I read this I&#39;m concerned that it doesn&#39;t give enough credit for what they&#39;re doing over there. That&#39;s not my intent. It&#39;s a very nice spot and if I were more local it would probably be a place on my regular beat. So check it out (especially if you don&#39;t have to make a long drive over:).

Service: Very good service! Our server was involved and present without being in our faces.

Menu: Spirits menu is a bit confusing. It was a full menu of selections but then we flipped the menu and there was different full list of selections on the back. The layout design was a bit confusing.

Food experience: Delicious food. The Gnocchi was great, though the portion size included a ton of ghocchi and very little chicken. It should have come with less gnocchi and more chicken especially for $20. 

Suggestions: I dined with friends on a Sunday evening around 8pm and it was absolutely FREEZING at our table by the roll up doors. The metal chairs were ice cold and had no chair pads on them for comfort or warmth. My suggestion is, cover the windows with a heavy, classy draping curtain, swooped from the top of one side so some of the window is exposed and place space heaters (plural) by the table near the roll up doors because it was honestly too cold for any of my 5 party table to really feel comfortable. Also, put cushion chair pads on the metal chairs so people&#39;s rear ends don&#39;t freeze off."

I was thinking steak, but eating on the company&#39;s dime and didn&#39;t want to abuse the policy. I&#39;m really glad though, because I ended up getting the most unique Rueben which was a really special treat for the taste buds! It was classic enough to taste like a Rueben, but the &#34;Tijuana Slaw&#34; (I think is what he called it) that was on the sandwich added a slight kick with just a really one of a kind flavor.

The ambiance was great aside from having to wear my coat through dinner b/c it was cold and drafty at the bar. The service was very friendly and attentive.
We ordered a couple of beers and a glass of wine. Great variety of drinks. A bit pricey for wine by the glass. No fountain drinks which was surprising and disappointing as I cannot stand warm soda cans poured on ice (it always equals watery flat soda). 
We ordered a meat and cheese plate to share. It was fantastic. We also shared a Stapleton Panini and it was delicious as well. I appreciate that they brought it portioned out on two plates since they know we were sharing along with extra chips. It&#39;s the small things that mean a lot. 
Okay, here&#39;s where things get great. We were planning to leave until the bartender informed us about dessert. We don&#39;t usually do dessert but since bread pudding was the first thing out of her mouth we decided to go for it since we have been on a long quest for really good bread pudding. 
Bistro for the win!! Their bread pudding is everything that a good bread pudding should be. Moist, with perfectly crisped edges and an amazing rum sauce. Finding the best bread pudding in Denver was a perfect end to the evening. 
Would we go back? I&#39;m not sure. It was a great dining experience that we were glad to find on the fly. It&#39;s not in our neighborhood so it&#39;s a question of whether we would go out of our way. I think we would definitely go back for drinks and apps or dessert.

This is especially sad because this is one of the only non-chain restaurants in all of the Stapleton enclave.

If you had no idea where this restaurant was, there is a pretty good chance you&#39;d drive right by continuing not to know where to get solid food offerings in Stapleton. It&#39;s in a bit of an odd space, half strip mall, half weird back lot of a storage facility. Keep in mind though, it&#39;s in a little Stapleton neighborhood, so quite and calm will be on the menu (that was my finest pun to date). 

The bar is convenient for conversations among 1 to 3 people, and the wait staff is nice enough to talk to you about whatever may disturb you. Food is tasty, but small based on the price. There is also a selection draft beers to fill your hearts desire. Two meals, two drinks all for around $40 with tip included. Seems a little steep, but I&#39;ll be back to try it again."

Well worth the effort! Just as impressive was the thought they put into the full meal ($25 for all you could eat, $10 for kids). These were no run-of-the-mill sides: the coleslaw was tangy and crisp, the mac n&#39; cheese was homemade and savory instead of gloppy mess, moist cornbread, and the potato salad was terrific - pungent course mustard and a hint of truffle oil.

My bad experience at the Bistro today started by us walking over... not too far but certainly an investment. When we arrived there was a 2 and 4 top open... we were told it would be 15 or twenty minutes. 

I understand kitchens sometimes throttle service to catch up and I&#39;m ok with that. After several minutes of standing at the bar I asked the host if we could at least sit at a table and wait (it was SRO at the bar). He told me they were reserved. 

Long story short... we waited a half hour and one of the tables was still empty. I told the host that we were leaving and unhappy and he reminded me that the table was reserved for a time (10 minutes from then). I explained that we would have been done or close to done had he seated us immediately. Additionally, the table he would have given us should open up and could be held for the reservation.

Given its residential location thought it might be kid-friendly, it&#39;s not. No high chairs, coloring books, or even a kid&#39;s menu. In fact, the child with us wasn&#39;t so much as offered a glass of water. However, there were water dishes for pets.

Our initial waitress (she never introduced herself so no idea what her name is) was quite frankly the worst we have ever experienced. She was incredibly slow, had to ask her several times to wipe down our sticky table, to bring additional napkins (which I finally got up and got my own), it took her 20 minutes to bring our diet cokes (yep, by that time a watered down diet coke), and she placed the order incorrectly. Finally, after reaching the boiling point, we asked for the manager, John. The manager was very accommodating and paid for our meals, and that&#39;s the only reason for 2 stars. Our replacement waitress, Rainy, was outstanding and finally delivered top notch service (request her!!). The food was very good, no complaints there.

It&#39;s tucked a bit out of the way, sharing a parking lot with a storage facility so it took a while for me to even realize it was there. However, once we saw it Nick and I decided to check it out for a date night. 

The night we went they had a lovely trio of musicians playing which really helped set the cozy atmosphere along with dimmer lighting and wood touches. Nick was really into the cocktail list  and thoroughly enjoyed the smoked bourbon Manhattan. The bartender here knows his business. I, on the other hand, thoroughly enjoyed a meat and cheese plate. So, all in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable date night for us.

They have a patio to be enjoyed in nicer weather, a decent amount of space inside for colder days, and nice people that work there. I would agree that Stapleton has a good thing going here and people in the area should definitely check it out."

I recently hosted a small work event at The Bistro at Stapleton and was fortunate enough to have Anthony (the restaurant&#39;s head chef and manager) at the helm.  From start to finish, everything was seamless, easy, and as-promised, from planning out the menu to logistics, pricing, etc.  

When we arrived the night of our event, Anthony had decorated their community table especially for us and laid out the most beautiful charcuterie boards and appetizers to start.  He even had a specialty cocktail using one of our products on the menu for the night (we work at a beverage company) in addition to their stellar wine list.  As each dish came rolling out, we were consistently impressed.  From spanakopita to mini beef wellingtons to tuna tartar - everything was flavorful and delicious.  The restaurant itself is also just CHARMING and has a fantastic, open floor plan with an attached patio and friendly staff. 

I can&#39;t wait to head back for dinner or drinks sometime soon and truly can&#39;t say enough positive things about my experience.  Go Anthony! :)"

It took the server 10 minutes to bring us menus after we were seated. After our orders were finally taken, it took 45 minutes for food to arrive. Our server failed to bring my soup before the main  course was served. In fact she forgot about it altogether. Only after I asked did she bring it with my meal. My meal was salmon which was overcooked and burnt on one side.  wife had a pannini which was ok but served lukewarm.

While the server was apologetic for the food and took the salmon off our bill, the service was not attentive. Coupled with food I could not eat because it was overdone, am not sure we will be back."

I can&#39;t help but sample a lot of everything when I find a new place and so today the party had: 

Buratta - housemade and served with prosciutto, olives. I usually prefer a runnier center, but this was delicious. 

Crepe du jour - we went sweet over savory with the strawberries and bananas with orange whipped cream. Loved this too. Thought the thickness was perfect. 

Steak and eggs - crazy good. They used a cheese that ate like a Brie and tastes like a Bleu. Steak had great flavor and was cooked expertly. 

Biscuits and Gravy - for me this was the highlight. Drop biscuits were sooo good and the gravy is exactly what breakfast gravy should be. Good ingredients give it a gourmet taste but don&#39;t stray from the traditional taste of biscuits and gravy that has been hard for me to find in Denver. 

I&#39;ll be back. Soon."

Don&#39;t get me wrong...  Came here after running some errands.  Yes, the service was stellar.  Yes, they provide us Water as beverages..

Unfortunately ALL THE MEATS contain PORK, that we cannot consume.

Err, Yes they have SALADs and THOSE WHO DRINKs.. but to those who DO NOT DRINK like us, and are NOT into Salad or even Paninis, this place is a NO-GO for us.  Especially for Hubs who is SUPER HUNGRY that evening and wants something substantial to eat like MEATs, aka BEEF or LAMB.

That evening, since its in Stapleton, a lot of the patrons or diners, bring along their children or kids.  We do not have any issue on those.  Sorry The Bistro @ Stapleton.  Yes your establishment can be &#34;comfy&#34;, homey and inviting for those WHO DRINKs aka Wine and can have meats and crackers just to unwind.. but it falls short for those who wants a Decent Dinner.

I&#39;ve tried going here three times, and getting delivery once. I give up. First, they don&#39;t do delivery. When I called to place an order and was told this, I let them know that their Yelp page said they do delivery. They assured me they would update it but they obviously have not, about a month later. Second, their posted hours (7am-10pm) are very misleading. They do NOT serve food for most of these hours, at least not on the days I tried. The approximate times I went into the restaurant were 1:30PM, 8:00PM, and 7:30PM. Not the typical rush hours, exactly, but reasonable lunch/dinner hours. All three times I was informed that they were only serving drinks. If you call yourself a &#34;cafe&#34; and &#34;gastropub,&#34; you need to serve food longer than noon-1PM and 5-6PM."

They have a small but excellent selection of beers on draught. I personally prefer a well-curated beer selection over the kitchen sink approach. 

This notion finds its way to the menu as well. A handful of appetizers, four entrees (plus a special), and a couple desserts. That&#39;s it. As with the beer, I&#39;m in favor of a place doing a few things extremely well, rather than a lot of things poorly. I ended up order the salmon en croute (a salmon filet topped with mascarpone and blue crab, wrapped in a puff pasty, served over pureed peas) and it was delicious.

I wrapped up my evening with a cocktail. I ordered an Old Fashioned after seeing the bartender&#39;s unique take on this classic cocktail. Let&#39;s just say I will trying to replicate this one at home. The bartender here clearly knows his stuff.

Service was impeccable and the entire staff was extremely nice. I would be back again and again if I lived nearby."

After an extremely poor dining experience, I spoke with John (the manager) who did nothing to remedy the issue.  I then escalated to the owner, Anthony.  I have left him 2 messages on his cell phone and 1 at the restaurant.  I have not heard from him and it has been almost 2 weeks.  Absolutely unacceptable!  

As I mentioned before, my dining experience left a lot to be desired.  However, I should tell you that I have dined 3 times previously and was underwhelmed by the food on each visit.  Considering it is a neighborhood restaurant, I continue to hope for things to approve given the lack of options in Stapleton.  On the evening in question, I ordered a strip steak.  The restaurant was not overly crowded and it took 53 minutes for my meal to arrive.  When it finally hit the counter at the bar, it was a huge slab of meat that did not resemble any strip I&#39;ve ever seen.  Here&#39;s where things went sideways for me.  I cut into the steak to notice that it was riddled with fat.  No matter how hard I tried, I could not cut away from the fat.  It was everywhere.  I called John over and explained the situation.  His only response was that he was sorry and he walked away.  I took 2 more bites and waited for my check.  The check arrives with no adjustments.  I pulled the server, Giovanni, aside and said that he should know what the appropriate course of action should be after my experience.  He said that he asked John and that John said that there would be no discount.  Unreal!

Bad food + Horrible management = Not going to be around long.  

Stapleton residents talk and I&#39;m starting the conversation every chance I get.  

Nice work, idiots.

It&#39;s a tapa-like place with yummy cocktails and small bites. We sat at the bar on the outside. It was really nice with some summer breeze and you get to see all the actions in the bar. I love their cheese and meat plate, but I love their drinks even more. I don&#39;t even drink regularly, but their bar manager, Jon can create some really impressive drinks. He is very knowledgeable and even keeps a notebook to take notes on the drink he makes. Now that&#39;s impressive! If you are not sure what you want to get, ask him and he will let you sample something you are interested in trying. He may even makes something for you that&#39;s not on the menu. I couldn&#39;t remember all the names of the cocktails I had but I really enjoyed the watermelon and blueberry drink he made. If you feel adventurous, you can ask him to make a smoky drink. The apricot beer was also very delicious."

My husband and I split the biscuits and gravy - homemade and amazing with awesome potatoes - and our daughter also tried the crepe special, which was strawberry and lime with a salted caramel sauce...she really enjoyed it. I also love the French press, and the staff there is always super friendly and attentive, bringing us more half and half when we inevitably ran out, being coffee junkies and all.

Eating here felt like I was eating at a restaurant back in India which is quite hard to come by in Denver. Indian food is not about the heat but the spices. You can have your desired level of heat but you are going to end up with mediocre food if you compromise on the spices. When you know how to really spice it up you create magic and Indian food is nothing less than magical! ( off topic: indian food has a lot more to offer than tikka masala and saag paneer guys, believe me) 
Well well, monsoon really does create magic. We loved the veg biryani and bhuna paneer. The portion of the biryani was huge! Enough to fill two. I also felt that the quality of their basmati rice was better than the other restaurants. The bhuna paneer came with jeera rice(cumin rice) and the rice was very aromatic. They also don&#39;t use artificial colors in their food, so the biryani didn&#39;t have the nasty orange colored rice. 
Do ask for a mild spice level if you cannot take a lot of heat. 
The food left me very happy. Don&#39;t hesitate to give this place a try. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

I think a lot of their food is so mushy in texture and if that is not part of your niche... I say, get over it and try Indian food now.

Now more on Monsoon -- I came here with my cousin and sister one adventurous night and stumbled upon this place on Yelp. You come in and the decor is aesthetic as the atmosphere was comfortable, and the food, well, absolutely delicious!

We get our food (I usually do the masalas and then order naan to dip it in -- trust me on this) and they are in these little bowls. I&#39;m thinking, &#34;Well this isn&#39;t going to do my appetite any good&#34;. I&#39;m one of the deadly sins I tell you, I&#39;m gluttony.

Anyhow, we could not even finish any of our food! The deception of the size of these bowls was appalling to me... I really enjoyed dinner though. And if you&#39;re looking for some good quality Indian in a nice little plaza, try Monsoon. I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t disappoint!"

We were living in Seattle at the time and we were spoiled with the best Indian food of all time at a little place called Ceadars. Since we moved home in august we hadn&#39;t had Indian cuisine since until we found Monsoon. Oddly enough, my parents have lived next to it since it opened at Southlands. We LOVE it and have gone 3 weeks in a row. 

My favorite is the Tour of Tandoor, which samples 3 different chicken masala dishes in one. It&#39;s probably 8-10 oz of chicken. (It take a little longer to prepare, I think because it&#39;s a larger dish) Whereas the other dishes may be around 5-6oz. (These regular dishes come out very quickly!) My boyfriend got the Tandoori Kebab which ended up being sausage like. Very good, but pretty spicy! If you like spicy I&#39;d highly recommend it. 

The chicken is grilled to perfection and the masala/curry never disappoints! And just to be clear Naan is essential. Any of the flavors are delicious! My two favorites are the cheese naan and the monsoon 1/2 dozen. Basically heaven-bread. 

It&#39;s a smaller restaurant, just like the many other Indian restaurants, with low lighting which gives it a comfortable, homey feel to enjoy authentic food with the ones you love!"

Stuart and Austin were great guides. Food was delicious.   Place is too small. There is a wait but it is worth it . Sauces are to die for and dessert was a chocolate mousse.

WOW, they weren&#39;t wrong!

When we got there, there were only two tables available on a Wednesday night around 6:30 and we noticed that there were several Indian patrons, which we took as indications that this place must be legit.  The restaurant itself is unassuming, not overly decorated, and a bit stark but comfortable.   

Despite it being really busy, and there only being 3 or 4 wait staff personnel, when we told Austin that we were totally unfamiliar with Indian food, he took the time to go over the whole menu with us and explained how things were prepared and suggested what he thought would be the best thing for us to start with being novices.  

We started with the regular Samosas to begin with and the flavors were ridiculous!  They were served hot, crispy and smooth and the spices were hot and cool, sweet and spicy, and just overall delicious.

We tried the Tandoor Tour that had three different types of chicken and it came with masala sauce and rice and we also tried the lamb masala which also came with rice.  The masala is tomato-based and super creamy and the spices were amazing, nothing that I can possibly explain!  Also, let me just say that I&#39;m not a lamb fan but it was excellent.  The basmati rice was well seasoned, hot and delicious too.

It did take a little time after we finished our samosas, to get our entrees, but all of the food was piping hot!!!!!  I know someone complained about the timeframe, but honestly, I would prefer to wait for hot food than get cold or lukewarm food fast and if you&#39;re in a hurry, go to a fast food restaurant; this is totally worth the wait.

We ended up having a lot of food left to take home and they sent us home with extra masala and rice and gave us some rice pudding to try.

I can&#39;t say how this place compares with other Indian restaurants, but I can tell you, that we were super impressed with the service and the food and we definitely plan to return or do take out.  I would totally encourage everyone to try it, it was fantastic!"

I&#39;m not sure what I was expecting with Colorado food, but Indian was definitely not in the top 5 to come to mind. After trying Monsoon, I discovered that this place has it all: delicious food, generous portions, and a fresh, modern restaurant ambiance. 

I ordered the chicken tikka masala, the mini samosas and naan. The chicken tikka masala was packed with flavor. I find this dish to be a good judge of an Indian restaurant. If they can nail this dish, the rest is usually great as well. The mini samosas were delicious as well, and the masala sauce on the side was great. The naan was solid and I&#39;m glad I had it to dip into my tikka masala as well. 

When I was full, I ended up having enough to take home and eat for dinner the following evening - always a plus. 

The restaurant itself was also very modern and fresh looking. I find that a lot of Indian restaurants go for the traditional gold decor with Hindu statuettes and tapestries. While this is not necessarily a bad thing for an Indian restaurant, it&#39;s always refreshing to see a place step outside the box a bit with decor. Monsoon does this with its interior and that was fun to see."

We ordered a cup of Chai and was sad that I checked in after we paid because you get a free chai with a Yelp check in.....and free refills! More motivation for me to come back here 

I&#39;m a novice when it comes to Indian food and tend to stick to tikka masala but tried something new for once. They have the Tour of Tandoor which features a few different varieties of chicken along with masala sauce. The chicken was tasty and in huge pieces so I cute them up and took half of it home to maximize my meals! The masala sauce was on point and I even asked for some to take home so I could add it to meals throughout the week. The meal was pricier than what I&#39;m used to ($16) but it lasted my two meals so I&#39;m not complaining too much. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try the tikka masala and get my free chai!"

Over the summer we have eaten here 6-8 times.  Each time it became obvious that they weren&#39;t cleaning the bathrooms, floors etc properly.  The glass, the doors, floors, cabinets, walls, floors next to walls, are getting nasty.  the floors were literally  slippery with grease this week.  

The food... Tate&#39;s the same.  REALLY GOOD. But they have got to get in there and do a deep clean.  Or it will affect business.

I&#39;ve tried the tikka masala, traditional curry, the korma, and one of the tandoori dishes (all with chicken...someday I&#39;ll be adventurous and try lamb). I&#39;m no expert in Indian cuisine, but everything I&#39;ve ever had here has been perfect. The korma boasts a creamier and slightly sweeter finish than the other two sauces, thanks to the addition of nuts and coconut milk, and it is the meal that I hope somebody feeds me on my death bed. 

Do yourself a favor and try the naan (thumbs up to the alu variety because how do you improve bread? You stuff it with potatoes) and chai. 

The servers here are all lovely, and if you aren&#39;t well-versed in curries and saags  and vindaloos, they will be happy to help a brotha out. Last night our waiter was very chatty and very nice, and didn&#39;t seem irritated that we were there for over an hour and had a late guest.

Before today, I had never experienced Indian cuisine. I had the Lamb Vindaloo with garlic/cheese naan and holy freaking crap it was amazing. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try different items.

The good: 

AMAZING food!! Seriously fantastic. Everything we have ordered here (over 10 different dishes) have been fantastic. Sarah is seriously the best waitress in the bunch. We have asked her many questions and she is always very patient! Her service is always incredible. Tonight was our anniversary and we wanted to celebrate. Sarah was great and made sure we enjoyed our dinner. 

The bad: 
Everyone but Sarah. We usually have a pretty negative experience here with the service. They are usually uninterested or condescending. Tonight we heard (because they have conservations literally next to our table) about issues with other employees, debate about how to serve dishes, wait tables and more. It was awkward. We usually prefer to order to go because of the consistently poor service. 

But if you order to go or delivery you will be very happy!!! :)"

This is by far my most favorite. I read a review on here that said it was overpriced and the portions are small. Let me add some perspective. Last night I ordered lamb curry with a side of naan and two (very well made) martinis and spent $30 and saved half for lunch today! That&#39;s a great deal!

Service is INDEED SO SLOW.... Perhaps for one its the LAST DAY of 2014!

SLAM with ALOT Of TAKE OUT Orders and ALOT of Patrons dining in, packed like &#34;sardines&#34;...

YES, there is a Bar for those who wants to enjoy some Wine, or Beer with their Meals.  YES, there is PATIO Seating areas, if the weather permits.  But since we went there and the weather outside is Cold, the patio seating is &#34;UNAVAILABLE&#34;.

From their Simple Menu, we ordered the following items :

*  Monsoon 1/2 Dozen Naan stuffed with half a dozen ingredients, spiced potatoes, chicken, ground lamb, cheese, cilantro and garlic ($5.00).  Err for this dish where is the Chicken??  Where is the Ground Lamb??  This dish is too salty for my personal taste bud though I bet Hubs bet to differ.  We received this dish at about 18:20hrs.

Hubs Main Entrée is the LAMB CURRY.  While I opt to have the LAMB BIRYANI for my Main Entrée at this establishment.

*  The chef&#39;s very own traditional recipe of an exotic concoction; onions, garlic, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, turmeric, and pan roasted cumin; just to name a few in a medium thick sauce, as with all Indian food, it goes great over rice. - LAMB CURRY ($16.00)

*  LAMB BIRYANI ($16.00) - Their long grain Basmati rice, stir fried with yogurt, onions and peppers with fresh mint and your choice of meat. A meal in itself served with creamy cucumber yogurt sauce.

We both received our Main Entrée orders of Lamb Curry and Lamb Biryani at about 18:48hrs ish.

*  Vegetable Samosa - Crisp pastries stuffed with spiced potatoes smothered in curried garbanzo beans and diced onions ($7.00).  They FORGOT about this Dish, until we had our Dinner mid way.  Err we received this dish at about 18:55hrs ish

From my observation of the Lamb Biryani, there are TOO MUCH of Fried Onions in the Biryani itself.  I Requested for EXTRA SPICY, IT IS NOT SPICY AT ALL.  The Biryani was rather Bland..   The Lamb Meat in the Biryani itself is also too skimpy aka too little for my liking.  *SIGH &amp; SAD FACE INDEED*

Overall for FOOD WISE is 2.5 stars..

Lamb Curry is the &#34;thick version&#34; NOT the &#34;thin&#34; version..  tasted more like Vindaloo just without the Potatoes.   YES, it comes with Rice and their version of Naan.

The Chai is DEFINITELY like Diluted TEA with Condensed Milk.

Food portion in terms of the Lamb Curry tends to be &#34;skimpy&#34; to our liking, though Hubs said he is ok with it.  He rated the Lamb Curry and the Moonsoon Half Dozen Naan as 3 stars.  Portion size is not justifiable with the cost, aka both the Lamb Curry and Lamb Biryani tends TO BE MORE Expensive than we are hoping for or used to.

Perhaps because of the Last Day of December and Last Day of 2014 - everyone tends to have their Dinner, Dining out at this establishment??? MIGHT Return BUT NOT IN A HURRY unless they can &#34;blow&#34; my taste bud with their culinary delights.  Maybe from there, my review might differ.

They even OVER-CHARGED us, if we do not look at the receipt but we managed to catch it, even though our lovely server tends to comp us, but they still OVER-CHARGED for our food that evening.

*DOUBLE SIGH*

Too bad, I forgot to ask for our Dinner Receipt from this establishment.  Drive all across town to get a disappointing Dinner in which I am indeed torn about this establishment with all those GLOWING Reviews...

*BIG MAJOR SIGH WITH MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT*

My apologies for this Rant!

Left the establishment about 19:35hrs ish.

Man oh man was I not disappointed. If you missed the sign and just strolled in you wouldn&#39;t think this is an Indian restaurant. 

The food oh the sweet food of the gods. The three of us order a combination of Naan&#39;s, chicken kabobs, Lamb Vindaloo and traditional Lamb curry. The Naan&#39;s were decent but not spectacular. They were prepared well not under done but not to crispy like some can be. The Vindaloo was slightly sweet, succulent and a hint of spice on the back end. I&#39;m normally not a fan of vindaloos but this one was definitely worth a try. Next up was the Traditional curry. This was not a disappointment. For my taste it has the exact amount of spice and didn&#39;t fade or linger to long. The Kabobs were my least favorite but were prepared just as well as anything else we got. My wife ordered them since she isn&#39;t a curry fan and really only eats Indian when I make her. 

The only negative I have is the lack of protein choices. Only lamb, chicken or shrimp they are executed so well it&#39;s not really that big of a deal. Needless Monsoon is now a fixture on our trips to Denver from now on!"

They have a lot of gluten free options on the menu as almost the whole menu looks gluten free except for the naan and other breaded or pastry filled dishes. I also can&#39;t eat dairy, so my options became limited here to a few dishes. I chose the Dahl with yellow lentils. The dish was tasty, but too spicy for me. Next time, I will ask if they can adjust the spice level for individual dishes or if they only make the dishes at one spice level."

After reading the reviews, I had purchased a Groupon.  When we arrived shortly after 5:30 PM on a Friday, the place was already fairly busy.  The restaurant area is medium small.  The bar dominates the far wall. 

Our service, through the whole meal from being seated to paying and leaving was excellent.  Our server, Jessica, went above and beyond in the level of service provided. My Yelp check-in provided for free chai tea with purchase of an entrée, I opted for the iced chai, and it was quite good.  The garlic cheese naan we ordered was very good. My chicken tikka masala was excellent. It was a goodly sized portion that I could not entirely finish, but was not quite enough for leftovers.  The flavors were solid throughout the entire dish.  I would come back again here in a heartbeat, and that is not something that I often say about places for which I have purchased a Groupon."

The Chicken Tikka is very pleasing to the palate even for those not fans of curry.  Order the naan, natch!  The naan dipper is to die for with all the options.  Its super yummy.

We love Indian and excited to try a new place!! We got lucky on a wintery Friday, so wait was not bad!! But we still called ahead, they will put your name on the list!!

We started with the tamarind wings, apparently the tandoori wings are really spicy. They were great, had a nice flavor but a tad on the fatty side but I get, it&#39;s a wing!! Also a couple of Moscow mules in copper mugs! Yay!

Also ordered garlic naan! Yummmo!! Then we ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken korma! I know we are rebels, but hey, we like what we like!! It came out piping hot and fresh! The side of naan and presentation was a great touch! Flavor was on point! 

Prices are a tad on the high side but Southlands rent is a tad on the high side so I don&#39;t ding them for that!!  The staff was great! Friendly, personable! You can tell they love their job and this restaurant! That goes a long way!!

All in all, great food! It won&#39;t be our go to Indian all the time, but a nice choice for this side of town before a movie or for something different!! Thanks Monsoon, we will be back!!"

We ordered through &#39;Eatstreet&#39; for delivery, and the 2 of us shared the Lamb Curry and an order of the Shrimp Saag (both spicy), Our appetizer was Garlic Naan and for dessert the Ras-malai

The saag and curry were perfect. PERFECT! Like, nothing I would change to make it better. It was so spicy and flavorful. The naan was so good and I immediately wanted to stick my fork in my eye because I didn&#39;t order 2. 
The only thing I wasn&#39;t a fan of is the Ras-malai. Def not their fault, as it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve just never had before. The taste was good...but the texture was not my favorite. 

Anyway, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that asked me &#39;hey, can you point me to some f&#39;n good Indian food??&#39;"

We had the chicken saags and lamb tikka masala both were wonderful. The next time I eat there,I will definatley go for the lamb dishes. It was tender and flavorful. Service was excellent, our server was very sweet and helpful with lots of suggestions for us."

My favorite dish is the Chicken Korma. It&#39;s a perfect blend of curry spices with roasted coconut, and ground cashew and almonds. It&#39;s sweet with just the little kick of spice. Mmmm.... I think it&#39;s time to go again.

For the starters, we like to get the Chicken Pakora. It&#39;s all white chicken meat that is marinated in chickpea batter and deep fried. It comes with two dipping sauces, one that is a sweet spice and the other a hot spice, I think chutney? I&#39;ll have to confirm this when we go back. 

We also order some Naan bread. They have nine different ones for you to choose from. We usually get the Garlic, the Monsoon 1/2 dozen, or the cheese Naan. Naan will also come with some of the main dishes depending on the dish.

Now, Simon has sampled more of the dishes than I have. I tend to stick to the Chicken Marsala and the Chicken Korma. Simon usually with pick lamb over chicken. One of the dishes that he tried was the Lamb Vindaloo. This is a spicy dish and they don&#39;t hold back on the spice. They do serve it with a cucumber yogurt sauce to help lessen the heat if needed. We left that day with Simon&#39;s sinus cleared out.

The dining is casual, it&#39;s family friendly and great service. The pricing is fair for but it can be expensive. When we eat there, it normally runs us $40-50 for the two of us. This is a Date Night stop for us. The food is gluten free and it&#39;s great for Vegetarians and Vegans. They also have Carry Out and Delivery. You can even order on line.

Go and try them out. Trust me, you won&#39;t regret it!"

You know, when your Indian friend tells you he wants to take you to a new Indian place that&#39;s &#34;a little out of the way&#34; because it&#39;s one of the best he&#39;s had in Denver, you take the risk. Needless to say I was rolling my eyes when I hit navigate on Google maps and was told it was 42 minutes from where I lived near downtown. 

After a drive long enough for an entire podcast, I pulled up in a nice suburban mall way out in Aurora. Parking lot was packed so be ready to wait for a spot on a weekday night. Sat down and let my friend order up, and boy, Monsoon let us have it. Everything we ate was incredible and very authentic. I&#39;ve only been to 1 place more authentic than Monsoon, and Monsoon was better. Spice level was a little lacking, but you can expect that from a place in the suburbs given the clientele, if you will.. Just tell them you want more kick. All the naan&#39;s and vegetarian dishes we ordered were top notch. 5/5 Monsoon, well done."

This new restaurant sits in Southlands over near the Which Wich.  It isn&#39;t the biggest spot, but it has a full bar, several booths and tables.  We went for an early dinner one Monday and it was pretty quiet.  The waitress was attentive and answered our questions.  

We started with the mini Samosas.  They were crisp and hot and came out quickly.  I decided I wanted something spicy so I got the fiery chicken vindaloo, and naan. The vindaloo had a great flavor and the heat was subtle at first and built with every bite, by the end I was sweating a bit!  

The hubby had the Monsoon Tikka and my bite of that was great.  The serving portions seem about right and the atmosphere was pleasant. 

 I think it will make it into our regular rotation. It is nice to have some more variety in Southlands!"

If I&#39;m in the mood for heat, their paneer tikka appetizer is to die for. Everyone in my family devours the mini samosas, all of their masala dishes are fantastic, and our go-to dessert is the ras malai. I CRAVE Monsoon!

I was told my party was next on the list to be seated, and 3 tables were sat before me. Their food is worth it...definitely a restaurant for those with the patience of a saint!

It seems that the staff does not communicate well. One host was very apologetic, while the other host did not seem to know which end of the line was the start, and which was the back! Our table was sniped from us as the host was getting ready to seat us, and the staff did little to remedy the situation.

Not to mention the waiting area is God-awful. 

Bottom line: good food...if you can stand to wait for it."

Just had lamb saag and my wife had curry chicken. This is the best for Denver. Yes I have eaten at the other top Indian restaurants. They are good too but this place reminds me of the New York contemporary Indian joints. I&#39;ve been to India too and the textures and spices match the original too.

I grew up eating authentic Indian/Nepali food and they satisfy my picky taste! I usually order the chicken vindaloo. I love spicy dishes, in fact I usually ask restaurants to spice them up even more for me and Monsoon makes me sweat with their extra spicy vindaloo! Naan is fresh and flaky, chai tea is so delicious and sweet, and everything here (except the naan) is gluten free! The dishes take a little long to come out but they make each dish from scratch, so be sure to order extra sauce when you order your meals so you have something to take home. Be sure to try their samosas too."

Cons. 
-Warning to people with perfume allergies: Don&#39;t eat here! The women&#39;s bathroom had four perfume bottles, a scented lotion, oil diffuser, and air wick plug in. It wasn&#39;t until I took a rip there that I figured out why I couldn&#39;t breathe. 
-The waiter was a little too chummy. He kept commenting about the speed we ate and giving his opinions about random things. 
-The restaurant had horrible acoustics and was very loud. I wanted something quieter and more relaxed.

We got a dozen mixed of the chargrilled- 3 of each flavor including the special.
These had so much flavor and the oysters are a great size.
Also, got a half dozen of house raw.  Good size and fresh tasting.
We got 2 apps: toasted ravioli and burrata plate.
The toasted ravs were good and well fried.
The burrata was good, creamy, and the accoutrements were a nice addition.
For dessert we tried the chocolate raviolis served with ice cream.  Sweet but not overly, the raviolis tasted slightly burnt.  We really like the berry drizzle.

We went for happy hour, which I would argue as the best happy hour (for food) in town! $1 for raw and $2 for charbroiled. Since I was hesitant about oysters, I started with the charbroiled. They were extremely flavorful, but rather rich, so I decided to give the raw a try and fell in love with them! For being in Colorado, you can&#39;t expect too much, but these raw oysters take the cake! Just a little lemon and salt, and you are in heaven :) 

The rest of their food is pretty dang good too. I love the toasted ravioli (adult pizza rolls) and lasagna. Their pizza is good too!"

At 6 on a Tuesday night, it was was to find parking but may not be that easy later. Check the restaurant for tips.
The bar was packed with happy hour folks being happy. When we left, the bar was still packed.  It looked like fun.
We opted for the dining room. The hostess was quick to seat us. Our server was prompt to approach with suggestions. 
We both ordered the Bourbon drink I am Paul. It tasted like a whiskey sour but better. Pomegranate molasses was the difference.
I ordered the butternut squash ravioli. it came fresh, hot and handmade? Spinach, bacon and loads of butter made it superb. Memorable. Fresh Parmesan was the perfect finish.
hubby ordered the risotto ball appetizer, fried and  stuffed with sausage and fontina on a bed of marinara. Very good.
Hubby also had the osso bucco, pork. It was over risotto with squash? and tasty sauce.  He claimed it was falling off the bone tender. No left overs here.
Angelo&#39;s is not your typical neighborhood joint. A lot of thought and detail go into this updated dishes. The menu can&#39;t begin to include all the ingredients that go into make these dishes. The layers of flavor are impressive.
These are large portions, so no deserts were ordered. We wish we lived in Denver."

Missed the 3p - 6pm happy hour? No worries, go back from 9pm to closing!

Happy hour raw oysters: $1 each -- very fresh and delicious.
Caprese sliders: $2 each -- ooey, gooey, delicious.
Toasted ravioli (4): $5 -- toasted perfectly, delicious pasta.
Salads (house, caesar or spinach): $4 -- fresh!
Grilled oysters: $2 each -- we liked the original version

As you can see, you really can&#39;t go wrong here. The only downside is the parking situation. There is parking on the back of the restaurant is kind of tight but of course there is on-street parking. The food is worth circling the block a few times to find a parking spot!"

Both the recent times I have experienced rude waitresses who made me feel rushed to order and rushed to leave. 

My boyfriend and I went there again last night for happy hour and we ordered half a some baked oysters, half a dozen raw oysters, and fried oyster sliders. One of the baked oysters was burned and dried up, and the raw oysters were tiny. Even though the oysters were still fresh, the quality of this restaurant has not lived up to its expectations because of the small oysters they served and the rude service. What drew me to this restaurant and kept me coming back was the size and variety of oysters they offered at happy hour.

Although my first impression of Angelos was excellent, they have let to live up to their original standards of expectation. If last night was the first time I&#39;ve been to Angelos, I probably would not come back."

It was cozy and not too loud.  We came for the oysters and they were delicious!

There&#39;s also a daily special flavor that didn&#39;t sound that appetizing to me - shrimp scampi.  I ended up liking the original flavor the best, although they were all good.  They have oyster specials in the early evening and after 9p where you can get 6/$12.

Brussel sprout &amp; bacon hash $5 - Great big portion and perfectly cooked Brussel sprouts.

Meatballs 2/$4 - These were delicious juicy meatballs with marinara sauce.

Toasted Ravioli $8 - There were 6 large pieces that were toasted just right.  

Arancini $6 - The manager brought us these Arancini to try and they were really good!"

We arrived around 530 and were seated right away. Our waitress, Anne, was incredible.  She was attentive but not hovering and gave us excellent recommendations and suggestions along the way.

 Our dinner began with a glass of Moscato and an apple Manhatten.  We ordered the happy hour oysters and toasted ravioli for appetizers.  (We skipped lunch to go to the zoo so we&#39;re starving,  don&#39;t be judgy) The oysters were a good size although the shucking was just okay. The cheese filling of the ravioli was creamy and cheesy. Then the manager surprised us with an appetizer of the balsamic ribs.  They were incredibly tender! 

For dinner,  we ordered the shrimp fra diavolo (with handmade linguini instead of spaghetti, and warned of its heat by our wonderful waitress). It was tasty with a spicy after bite! We also had the lobster gnocchi. The gnocchi was fluffy and seasoned perfectly. I boxed half so i could save room for dessert.  BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE.

Anne recommended the tiramisu and the homemade limoncello. My husband got some port wine. I dreamt of that tiramisu every night since.  I slept so we&#39;ll because that Limoncello is no joke strong. For all we ate (my elliptical will hate me later) our bill was almost half of what we would pay at home on the Chi.

They were very accommodating for our larger party. We were without a server for a while, but Jay swooped in to save us! He was super friendly and attentive.

For food, I had a grilled oyster, a raw oyster, a sausage slider, and the toasted ravioli. My favorite was the sausage slider. I was impressed by how delicate the sausage was in the slider. The toasted ravioli were also fantastic with a nice mix of rich, creamy cheese and crispy goodness. I liked both of the oysters, but they were slightly less exciting than I imagined. Both were however very fresh tasting.

For drinks, I tried their Pinot Grigio on tap and an O&#39;Dell&#39;s Lupulin Pale Ale. The Pale Ale was fine. I felt their wine was a bit flat tasting. 

Overall, I had a good experience and recommend them for happy hour. They have lots of options for everyone including the kiddos!"

Six happy and content customers had so much fun almost three weeks ago. 

I knew before going to Angelo&#39;s that I am going to give their Fried Oysters a try. I had a dozen of their half shell oysters and half a dozen of their fried Oysters($4/each). I&#39;d definitely go for these again. 

The rest of the group tried different dishes that we shared. There was the Chili Relleno Ravioli, cheese bread appetizer, half chicken, calzone, burrata, spinach manicotti and eggplant Parmesan. I like them all!! The in house made burrata stood above the rest I think. 

For dessert we ordered everything they had on the menu: key lime pie, tiramisu and chocolate ravioli dessert. We shared them all and I think my favorite is hands down the tiramisu. It&#39;s creamy. My type! 

I had the One Lincoln Park cocktail. You want a boozy drink? Get this. It&#39;s Goslings dark rum, Don Q coconut rum, fruit lab organic hibiscus liqueur, fruit lab organic ginger liqueur, iced tea and lemon. This made my Creepers list. It will get you.

But Angelo&#39;s is consistently great. We have now tried almost all their pastas. One of my favorites we sampled last night, the buffalo ravioli. This is excellent and I think it will probably be my go to entree, besides the chicken parm. They make everything from scratch including their pastas, and you can most definitely tell the difference. 

Like most restaurants we have a few times where service has not been great, but it has never been so bad that we wouldn&#39;t return. 

Last night we decided on &#34;to-go&#34; and they quoted is 20 minutes and sure enough it was still hot when we got home. 

Another major plus.. They&#39;re open til 12 Wednesday through Saturday, they do switch over to a limited late night menu, but of course the food still rocks."

They are doing some really interesting things with the food here...it&#39;s a mix of Seafood, Italian, and a bit of New Mexico/Mexican flare (Chile Relleno Ravioli???  Chorizo Oysters???  WHAAAAT???).  I tried both of those dishes and they were both amazing by the way.  

We ordered several different plates and were able to try a lot of the menu.  The Calzone was amazing, as were all of the varieties of chargrilled oysters.  On the appetizer side of the house, the garlic cheesy bread and the burrata were the standouts...and please for the love of god get the burrata - it is AMAZING.  There is a lot of punctuation and capital letters in this review, and for good reason; I am still excited about it.  

Service was friendly and attentive, and we weren&#39;t left wanting for anything throughout the meal.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Angelo&#39;s Taverna. My last visit was my favorite restaurant experience in a long time, and every aspect of our meal was phenomenal from start to finish.

The atmosphere is the perfect mix of casual, cozy, and impressive. You don&#39;t feel like you have to dress up, but you know you&#39;re gonna get quality food and service. Our waitress was the sweetest and she knew the menu backwards and forwards, including information on food allergies.

We happily ordered tons of oysters... this is an oyster house, so duh. They&#39;ll explain to you exactly where each oyster comes from (range of prices and locations). Their speciality is grilled oysters -- don&#39;t miss out on these. They&#39;re incredible! They have so many different types of butters you can adorn them with, but my favorite was &#34;the original:&#34; butter, garlic, pecorino, and fresh herbs. OH MY GOD. I could eat 7857384573987 of them. 

We also ordered oysters on the half shell, oyster sliders, grilled lamb lollipops, mushroom risotto with pork osso buco, lobster gnocchi, gorgonzola steak fettucine, and shrimp fra diavlo. I couldn&#39;t eat all those things because I&#39;m GF, but I can tell you everyone at our tables absolutely loved their food.

Fantastic wine menu and cocktail as well, and reaaallly affordable prices. We saw our check and were like, &#34;what? This is amazing!&#34; I want to feel like that all the time, so I&#39;m totally going back often."

Our rambunctious party of 6 ordered quite the smorgasbord. Obviously, we started with drinks. The One Lincoln Park was okay--it tasted watered down but had quite the punch in the end. The Life on Mars was refreshing and delicious; it was the clear winner of the group. I had a classic gin martini (extra dirty). It had good flavor, although I wished the waiter had taken my request for &#39;extra dirty&#39; a little more seriously. 

The appetizers were seriously great, with the Burrata being a group favorite. You absolutely MUST try this. The garlic bread w/marinara (and cheese) was great as well. Angelo&#39;s is generous with their cheese, making me an instant fan. 

I was also impressed with the food. The Chile Relleno Ravioli is a unique offering, but comes together well and has a great flavor. If you&#39;re feeling adventurous (or not in the mood for traditional Italian) opt for this. I also enjoyed the Eggplant Parmesan. It was cooked well, drenched in cheese, and excellently breaded. In addition to trying everyone else&#39;s food, I did order my own dish as well. Ironically, it was my least favorite of the options I tried. The Spinach Manicotti is excellent on first taste, but looses it&#39;s luster the more you eat. The flavors are stable and seemingly uninspired. It should have had more sauce or more cheese. Luckily I had some extra burrata to make me feel better. 

We ordered desserts as well (I know, I may as well be a blimp). The Tiramisu was a favorite, although I found it a little dry (but I like mine SUPER moist). I actually enjoyed the Key Lime Pie as well (and I don&#39;t even like Key Lime Pie)-- but it was too small for the price. The Chocolate Ravioli was my least favorite of the items we tried. They were just too crispy and hard to eat. Sure, it&#39;s unique... but I&#39;d recommend sticking to the classics. 

All-in-all we had a great time at Angelo&#39;s. Our party of 6 was completely satisfied and happy when we left and that&#39;s the mark of a good restaurant. Catering to many different palates and dietary needs is difficult and our group went in with fairly high expectations. Kudos to Angelo&#39;s for meeting (and in some regards, exceeding) our expectations. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back."

Italian food is normally not the top of my list. I usually find it uninspired and heavy for no reason. The food here, however, really surprises the taste buds and reminds me how comforting Italian food can be. 

We went with a group to try this place and had an all around blast. Our server was helpful and friendly and the atmosphere was trendy and lively. 

As always with a new Italian place I had to try the Eggplant Parmigiana. Tasty tasty! The breading was delicious with rosemary flavor, the slices were thin and well cooked, and the serving size was more than adequate. 

By far the best part of the evening was the Burrata appetizer. Maybe you remember me mentioning that at the beginning? It deserves multiple mentions. Perfectly toasted bread with creamy Burrata and olive, tomato, balsamic, and pesto toppings. So simple. So amazing. Order this. 

We also tried three desserts: tiramisu, key lime pie, and chocolate ravioli. The tiramisu won my vote. Nice and moist and very well flavored. The key lime had a good taste but was a little on the small side and not quite as tart. The chocolate ravioli was rich and served with raspberry sauce and ice cream. I didn&#39;t love these little ravioli, they seemed weirdly crispy. 

Overall, a great experience. I will definitely return."

After 9pm, all chargrilled oysters are $2; the chipotle butter and garlic Parmesan ones are both wonderful.  My favorite chargrilled oysters are from New Orleans, but Angelo&#39;s Taverna comes close.  The oysters here are not as big and plump, and slightly under-cooked, but they are still very flavorful.  The meatball slider and sausage sliders are delicious as well.  The meats are seasoned well, the Mozzarella is perfectly melted, and the buns are toasted perfectly.

We didn&#39;t care for the menu of the closest option. Then we went to a place that was take out only and so I turned back to Yelp to find this place.
So glad we did. Although, we inevitably spent more than we probably should&#39;ve, everything was THAT good.
For starters we grabbed a couple of glasses of wine at the bar since we were told it would a 10 minute wait. Turned out to be less as soon as our glasses were poured we had a table.
We immediately order the fancy Italian salad. I could&#39;ve totally enjoyed this as a meal itself. We killed that salad (except for the garbanzo which is not a favorite.) They were heavy on the toppings and that vinaigrette that came with it really set it off.
My husband was super hungry and ordered some super cheesy garlic bread. I could only eat 1 piece just because I wanted to save room for my entree.
I LOVED my yellow fin tuna. It was perfectly cooked and the sauce was AMAZING. Not really a fan of gigante beans, but that didn&#39;t deter me from finishing off the rest of the dish. 
The chef sent us a couple of delectable oysters. Since the hubby doesn&#39;t care for them, I got to have both. Simply yum. 
My husband got the sir psycho sexy pizza 17 inch. It was worth every penny. A ton of meat. We had a whole meal or 2 to take home. 
Loved the place itself and we had great service. Next time we&#39;re in Denver, we must come back."

We had sharing plates of bbq spare ribs, bruschetta, pizza, pastas it really showed off the menu. They have a really nice private room that had tv&#39;s and its own bar.

Came back last night for happy hour! great selection of beers, wines and cocktails and a perfect appetizer menu. Its $1 per oyster of restaurant choice, we also had the friend ravioli. The service was so friendly and accommodating, we sat on the front patio with our dog (we were the only table) and never felt abandon by our server.

The restaurant isn&#39;t big, but it&#39;s not small. It&#39;s perfectly cozy and felt like a romantic, rustic, true Italian joint. They also had a standing wall full of mason jars (couldn&#39;t tell what was inside of the jars) but it was a unique and noticeable decor.

A few of us started with the Italian salad (which feeds about 4 people). As well as the Toasted Ravioli, Garlic Bread (with melted cheese), and some oysters. Salad was crisp and fresh! The Toasted Ravioli was perfectly crunchy, with melted cheese and marinara for dipping. But oooh my gosh, the Garlic Bread was some of the BEST I&#39;ve ever had! And I&#39;ve eaten a lot of garlic bread in my time! Get it with the melted cheese on top. It was crunchy and cheesy and just simply addicting. I also loved their marinara for dipping! Great taste and wasn&#39;t watered down at all. Perfectly thick and had great italian seasoning in it.

Most of us had their HOMEMADE pasta dishes for dinner and their portions are pretty big! They also serve a piece of their amazing garlic bread with each pasta dish. I had their Pappardelle Bolognese. The noodles were perfectly cooked in a creamy sauce. Very hearty and filling!

Then, the owner came to our table, wished my twin sister and I happy birthday, and poured limoncello shots for us all! He even took one too! 

Loved the energy at Angelo&#39;s, and having the owner come take birthday shots with us was a lot of fun! The food is fresh, homemade, and you can tell they use quality ingredients! Our server Vinny was also very friendly and attentive. Will absolutely come back!"

**Butternut squash ravioli - best ravioli I&#39;ve had. They don&#39;t skimp out on the butternut squash filling! Tip: Not vegetarian - there&#39;s bacon bits on top!

**lobster gnocchi - highly recommend! The sauce isn&#39;t too creamy and there is a good ratio of lobster to gnocchi.

Higher ground pizza - average. I recommend sticking with the pasta dishes.

Pappardelle Bolognese - recommended by our waiter. The noodles and sauce are homemade!

**Balsamic glazed ribs - these were on the house! Such a pleasant surprise and they were AMAZING! The sauce is slightly sweet because of the balsamic and the meat literally falls off the bone. SO GOOD.

Found out about them through a friend and was attracted by the $1 oyster (raw) and $2 chargrilled oyster during Happy Hour.  They have two HH and we visited the late one (9 - Close).  Let me tell you, the oysters were fantastic.  The raw ones were the smaller kind (expected for $1 a piece), the chargrilled ones were much bigger and it tasted incredible.  There were multiple styles you can choose from.  Bacon Gorgonzola was my favorite.  Strong flavors from the cheese and the bacon, but you can still taste the freshness of the oyster.  For $2 a piece, what a steal.  They have $2 sliders as well, I thought they were extremely good.  

The service was TOP NOTCH!  We had around 14 people and they accommodated us in the nice area in the back of the restaurant.  (Kind of cool to walk thru the courtyard and get to the other part of the restaurant).

My experience at Angelo&#39;s was not a smidgen (it&#39;s a word, look it up) less than five stars. We went with a group and were able to try a bit of everything, from oysters to ravioli to calzones. They dish some interesting combos that might initially seem odd, but they work so well. Chorizo and char-grilled oysters? Yum. Chile Relleno Ravioli? Way better than you could even imagine. My husband tried the calzone, which was perfectly baked and full of magic. The Buratta appetizer was everyone&#39;s favorite at the table, though. It&#39;s made in house and I can&#39;t think of any other word than perfect to describe it.

Our service was also on point during our visit, especially with a party of six. They had no problem splitting the check and accommodating our many requests for additional orders. Moreover, for everything we ordered our bill was rather reasonable. I don&#39;t often give out five stars, but Angelo&#39;s absolutely deserves it."

The cheese raviolis are amazing, the salads are fresh (spinach and house salads), the cheesy garlic bread with marinara is a great appetizer to start dinner.

The servers, hostess, and owner are welcoming and efficient. My family and I were here tonight and the owner was making sure everyone was having a nice time. He even gave us a calamari to try on the house. 

TIPS: Call ahead to put your name on the wait list. There is also a small parking lot, but it is easier to take a Lyft or taxi. Great for meat eaters or vegetarians lots of options. Nice bar and drink selection."

The lamb lollipops were well-done, the only flavor that popped in the Cesar salad was garlic, the charbroiled oysters were swimming in butter and the mushroom agnolotti should have had a browned butter sage sauce... unfortunately it was just melted butter. The only dish that was good was the calamari.

The day was nice but we decided to eat inside just the same. Cozy and comfy we opted for oyster and mussels. Great choice! Never had grilled oysters before. Found them delectable. We got the house special, then, much to our surprise, and delight, our waitress, Margie, brought over a few samplers of others. Very nice!  So service was above and beyond and very friendly. Oysters-on-the-half-shell? we were a little skeptical about being so far inland but, I have to say: incredible: Fresh, briny and wholesome. How did they do that? Mussels as well! Drinks were excellent too! And; most important of all: the bathrooms were clean and even smelled good! Wow! Great intro to Denver. Thanks!"

For dinner we started with an appetizer that came out right away and was delicious. We told one of the staff how wonderful it was, I think he was the manager.

I also really like that the staff is always super friendly and that  management stops by the tables to make sure you are well taken care of. 

The oysters are super fresh and perfectly shucked - they slide right out of the shell and are very flavorful. They are also $1 a piece during HH which is our favorite time to go. The chargrilled oysters are $2 during HH and there are some other selections as well. I am also addicted to their burrata cheese plate which for $9 is worth every penny. 

We have also gone for the Monday night mussel special and the portions are large and filling - we could not finish the second order because we were stuffed. My husband also enjoyed the limoncello and from the tiny sip I was allowed to have - it was quite tasty and the perfect digestive to end the night with."

Our waitress was not friendly at all. I don&#39;t know what her deal was, but we felt like she hated us. Just a bad attitude. I felt like I was a bother to her asking for anything. We will certainly be back, but will have to sit in a different waiters section."

We started with their truly delicious toasted ravioli, which everyone liked. The salads (spinach &amp; mushroom gnocchi) were good, but heavily dressed. If you like it on the lighter side, be sure to ask for dressing in the side. We should have stopped there - it took ages for our mains to come out after that (on a Wednesday night, service shouldn&#39;t be that slow), and they were disappointing. 

We got salmon risotto, a small pizza, and pollo angelito. Salmon was well cooked over risotto - small plate though. Pizza was okay, nothing special. Heavy on the cheese without any standout features. Pollo angelito had overcooked chicken, a bland cream sauce, and a few leaves of spinach.

Between the slow service and bad mains, we won&#39;t be coming back."

OYSTERS: Order them. Devour them. Order more. Highly recommend the chargrilled oysters (esp. the bourbon chipotle butter) plus whatever they have currently on their raw bar.  

PASTA: We had the mussels with homemade linguine, and went with the chorizo sauce. Also split the Chile Relleno Ravioli. Both had killer Southwestern kicks that brought me back to New Mexico (vs traditional Italian) which was a delicious and delightful change. 

STAFF: Phenomenal. Wish I caught our waitress&#39; name, but so glad we went with all of her recommendations. The owner also sent over a half-dozen raw oysters for us to try between courses, which was such a cool touch.

I&#39;m from the east cost so I&#39;m in love with oysters. It took me a while to find a place not insanely priced to get my fix. Here, I don&#39;t have to worry about it. They have a great selection of east and west coast oysters. The chipotle bourbon grilled ones are insane!

Yes the handmade pizzas and pastas are delicious as well. Gorgonzola steak fettuccine and RHCP are bomb. We usually always order oysters and ribs and mix everything else up. Nothing ever disappoints."

The food is delish! We have the BBQ chicken pizza - which definitely had its own unique twist! The Balsamic BBQ is very different and pairs very well with the other ingredients on the pizza. We also ordered the Chicken Parm and it was so good. The chicken breasts are so thin and the breading is tasty without being overwhelming. In addition - the portions are HUGE.

Finally - please order the chocolate peanut butter dessert if you like the combo - I&#39;m pretty sure we inhaled our dessert and were ready to lick the plate! I will definitely come back to Angelo&#39;s for this dessert alone!

The prices are extremely reasonable consider the portion size and the location. We found it to be less pricey then other Italian restaurants in the area. And the lower price does NOT mean lower quality. 

The ambiance is really neat - cozy and comfortable - definitely a neat date night restaurant. The service was great - we had multiple people check on us and make sure everything tasted good. The food was piping hot when it came out so watch your tongue!

We will definitely be back. This is one of those great neighborhood gems that is worth another visit!"

I came for dinner on two occasions recently, 10 Nov 2015 and 11 Nov 2015 (yes, I came for two dinners in a row). 

Both nights, I ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese ($13), which is not a true traditional Bolognese in the style of Bologna Italy (which is served with tagliatelle), but it is still delicious, even though it&#39;s an Americanised version. Hey, it was good enough to order the 2nd day; however, the sauce was much better the first night I think it was more fresh). 

I have to say that the calamari ($7) is some of the better prepared calamari I&#39;ve had; good enough to also order two nights in a row. It has a little taste of Asian sweet chili sauce, but other than that, the light spiciness from the added peppers was nice. 

The first night, my friend also ordered the pappardelle bolognese, and the second night, my other friend ordered the mushroom agnolotti ($15). The 2nd night also included toasted ravioli ($8), which was okay but not something I crave to order again. 

Next time I go, I would like to try some of the other pasta dishes. 

Service was great both nights, and both nights our bill came to $49 for two (which included some drinks - see receipts in my photos)."

Had the Under the Bridge pizza. Decent pizza but just didn&#39;t do it for me. Don&#39;t know how I feel shaved beef on pizza.

Ordered a variety of chargrilled oysters.  They were the stars of the night.  Loved the original and the bacon &amp; gorgonzola.   The chipotle bourbon was good but I felt the sauce overpowered the oysters.  Also had the special char grilled oysters and it actually tasted like a pizza.

I&#39;ve had many pasta dishes but my favorite is probably the butternut squash ravioli. The hubs usually goes for a steak fettuccine dish of some sort. 

I wish they had more gluten-free pasta options, but then again I know those can&#39;t replace the real thing. And Angelo&#39;s does the real thing extremely well.

Simple, not too expensive, and just right.
Service was outstanding throughout our visit.
A member of our party was accidentally served an eggplant Parmesan rather than a chicken Parmesan (they do look pretty similar with the melted cheese) and despite informing them that it wasn&#39;t necessary to replace her dish, they made her the chicken parm to-go and did not charge for either.
The pizza flatbread that they serve as an appetizer was outstanding (it has some pesto on it, among others).
The Kitchen Sink pizza with sausage and pepperoni was great as well, and makes for great leftovers if the dish isn&#39;t shared.
Risotto, pasta, and pizza dishes eaten by other members of our party were all appreciated and devoured.

Unfortunately, they were out of key lime pie to my great chagrin.
I ordered the peanut butter dessert and was disappointed. It wasn&#39;t a standout and a Reese&#39;s would of tasted better. Neither the peanut butter nor chocolate were flavorful.
The tiramisu and brownie, on the other hand, both tasted amazing.
And this comes from a self-professed tiramisu snob that refuses to order tiramisu in North America due to its gratuitous and widespread misinterpretation.

The aracini was really good, I&#39;ve never had this before! The pastas were ok, I was expecting them to be delicious probably cause our friend hyped it up and maybe because we weren&#39;t super hungry? As I was eating the pappardelle, I found a black squiggly hair in my pasta.. That&#39;s always unpleasant.

I ordered the buratta app, which came with baguette, olive tapenade, tomato jam, balsamic glaze, and a fresh pesto. Beautifully done. For my main course, I ordered the gnocchi truffle salad. Arugula based, seared mushrooms, gnocchi, pecorino, and a truffle vinaigrette. Perfect."

My biggest problem is the customer service. We ordered delivery and instead of receiving the cheese garlic bread appetizer we  received plain garlic bread. I called to see what happened and was assured that I wasn&#39;t charged for the cheese garlic bread. After hanging up I checked my receipt and it turns out that I was charged for the garlic bread side (not the cheese one). I&#39;m mostly just disappointed that they wouldn&#39;t refund me when the person taking my order put in the order wrong. We received the wrong item and to me the right thing to do would be either to offer to bring the correct item or refund the item. I was soooo excited for cheesy garlic bread so I&#39;m pretty sad about not getting it and having to pay $3 for plain garlic bread when both our entrees already came with garlic bread :(

The pasta and arancini we ordered were both good but the portions are very small. 

If you are looking for good Italian delivery I suggest Mici in Cherry Creek North instead. It&#39;s less expensive, better food, and amazing customer service (they would have come back with my cheesy garlic bread)."

That&#39;s my review...

Hahah just kidding. I want to come back and actually try some of their other dishes but my friends and I came by for some late night happy hour and of course we were drawn in by their awesome oyster prices.  I had the original charbroiled oyster and it had a very nice buttery flavor to it, but at the end of the day, I think raw oysters are more of my thing. We also got a chance to try their special of the day, which they don&#39;t always have one, according to the waitress (who was also super sweet) and it was a great dish! Pesto risotto with seared scallops...that makes any risotto lover drool!"

I&#39;m glad after all this time I chose Angelo&#39;s Taverna to fill that gap! I had the greatest experience here and highly recommend it!

First off the restaurant was way bigger than the outside made it seem. Both times I&#39;ve been here the restaurant has been packed with people and our party was take  to a separate back location with additional seating. (This room also had a secret bathroom in the wall... Shh). It&#39;s perfect for large groups so don&#39;t be afraid to invite your friends! 

Now to the food... We kinda balled out for my boyfriends sisters birthday and ordered so much! This pace is where I discovered how much I LOVE raw oysters on a half shell! WOW! They have so many options of oyster for this is their specialty. They also had grilled oysters... and guys... the &#34;Classic&#34; flavor made me die and sent me to seafood heaven! A grilled oyster on a half shell smothered in garlic butter and parmesan cheese!!!! Order these right now! I also had the spicy shrimp pasta and the blue corn ravioli. The pasta for both was so tender and cooked to perfection. For dessert a delicious sweet and sour gluten free key lime pie. Yum! Also check out the endless wine and beer menu. What is a Italian dinner without a good glass of wine? 

The staff was so great. The sister mentioned previously has a strict gluten free diet and our waitress took extra time and attention to explain all of the gluten free items on the menu. Kind, polite, attentive (but not too much), everything you look for in a wait staff. Five stars! I&#39;ll be back very soon Angelo&#39;s!"

Three words: char grilled oysters!  They&#39;re fixed many ways with many flavors; I think original is best with Parmesan, butter and garlic. The most affordable in the city! Go during happy hour for reduced prices. Their pizza is Italian and the ingredients are fresh. ( also served with freshly shaved Parmesan) 
We got a large family sized Caesar salad, fresh and tasty AND served with Spanish Boquerones! Yes! Delicious white anchovies. We asked for extra. I had the chicken Parmesan &amp; asked them to turn that into a sandwich, no problem! Just ask for extra marinara sauce. Their wine prices are very fair and affordable, they don&#39;t raise their prices 300%. Quite a few micro brews on tap as well.
Word of warning; arrive early because on weekends you WILL have at least an hour wait; but well worth it. The staff is laid back and friendly and just a refreshing change from most up tight restaurants in Denver, and you know who you are.... We will be back to Angelo&#39;s again and again!"

Of course yelp told me the chili relleno ravioli was the thing to try so I did. The dish itself was good, but nothing to ride home about. It was served a little cold for my liking. The portion was an ok size too, I was a little hungry after. My friend had the paperadelle which I tried and that was on point."

Unfortunately it was a 35 minute wait when we arrived.  35 minutes turned into 45 minutes and finally we were seated.  I think everyone else decided to go at 6:00 pm on a Friday night.  Our waiter Vinnie,(definitely Italian) greeted us with a big smile.  As soon as Vinnie walked away with our drink order, the owner popped by with some fried risotto and marinara sauce.  Very tasty.  The menu is so vast with all sorts of pastas and pizzas it&#39;s hard to make a choice.  My recommendation is to split everything family style so you get a little taste of it all.  The bruschetta and the fried oysters (all of them) are must orders. My daughter loved the toasted ravioli.  For sure order a pizza; the crust was crunchy, we had a simple margherita (tomatoes and mozzarella) and it was great.  Pastas were also good although my shrimp fra diavolo dish was way too spicy.  I think the winning pasta was the bolognese. We did not get to try dessert because we were too full from dinner.  Make sure to try the lemon drop.  They age them for like 3 months in the front of the restaurant."

This is my neighborhood joint and I love it. It has a family feel to it and it gets packed for a reason! I try to go during &#34;off times&#34; so as to not have to deal with the crush. They have a cute patio out back too when they weather is nice. This place really is the real deal!"

I&#39;m not usually a fan of oysters, but I did enjoy this. Everyone seemed pleased with their food overall. 

I&#39;m deducting two stars due to my perception that everything was good, but nothing was incredible. Food quality did not feel too much higher than a franchise. I had the butternut squash ravioli, and my complaint is that I didn&#39;t love the sauce. I noticed that my friends risotto was pretty oily too.

My sister and I made last minute plans to go out for dinner and showed up here on a whim- and I&#39;m so glad we did!

We started with the Tuna Crudo- while small it packs a TON of flavor. We each got Caesar salads and shared the lobster gnocchi. The salads were your basic Caesar, but the gnocchi was fantastic!! It&#39;s a good thing we split it, too- the portion size is very generous. 

My sister also ordered a few half shell oysters- we had actually discussed with our server (I believe her name was Cassie?) that I DO NOT like oysters at all.... but after chatting about it she actually brought us two oysters to try out to see if she could change my mind about them! While it was still not my favorite thing I was very pleasantly surprised! Cassie was an excellent server and made our experience that much more enjoyable. 

We ordered wine as well as one of the Cucumber Mint Cow Mules, which were both wonderful. The Limoncello is made in house and provided a nice ending to the meal with something not so heavy/filling as a full dessert. It just so happened I had my Denver Passport with me, which is the only reason we tried the drink, but I am glad to have tried it.

I ordered the fried oyster po&#39;boy with the Northern bean soup as the starter. The soup was really good with a nice balance of beans and veggies. It flirted with being a tad salty. 

The po&#39;boy was very good. The oysters were crispy and the remoulade sauce was a perfect pairing. The only thing I pulled out were the fresh tomatoes. Fresh tomatoes just don&#39;t belong anywhere on a menu in February.

I was so confused when the hostess had told me to go outside and to the left. I thought we were sitting outside on the patio until I realized they had a banquet room in the back. It was a nice room. It was interesting, it was either too loud or too quiet in there but it was because we were in a small banquet room. I love the look of the place though. I didn&#39;t mind where we were sitting. 

The menu is overwhelming not in a bad way, just in a I want to try everything overwhelming kind of way. Lol. Our server was Jess and she was super friendly. 

A few of us started off with oysters, it&#39;s something they are known for. While Jess was putting our order in, Gabriel, a manager, walked by our table. He was friendly as well. He asked if we&#39;ve been in before, we said most of us haven&#39;t. So he said he would buy a round of oysters on the house, since we had already ordered raw oysters, they brought us chargrilled oysters (the house original.) I don&#39;t even like oysters but it was so good. What was funny was a few of the girls I was with, was on the same page where we don&#39;t like raw oysters but LOVED the chargrilled ones. 

Shockingly, we ordered another round of chargrilled oysters because they were so yummy! We finally ordered our food, I got the chile relleno ravioli, what an interesting concept. I was debating between that, the lobster gnocchi or a calzone. So many options. I love it. You can definitely find something you like. 

WOW! I loved my ravioli! Definitely something different, and I loved it. I would definitely order it again. I love all the bell peppers that was in it and the corn pasta. I love the pepperjack cream sauce. Just everything about the dish was awesome. Thanks Jess, for recommending it because I definitely didn&#39;t leave disappointed. 

AMAZING SERVICE and even better food. I definitely would recommend this place. Thank you so much for the oysters. Thanks for making our dinner special with the little touches."

We have gone for brunch, dinner, drinks and, &#34;I need a break from moving get me out of here!&#34; happy hour!  The staff is wonderful and super accommodating. Before we moved here, we had a big get together with like 6 people in wheelchairs, and they seated us without batting an eye and treated us like royalty the entire night.  We also went again with a couple of friends who were on the Whole 30 diet, and basically couldn&#39;t eat anything.  Our waitress was super patient, answered all their questions and they were able to have a delicious, sufficient meal without feeling like they were being &#34;those people.&#34;

The small plates are definitely my favorite menu item, and I will go just for the sweet potato fries or deviled eggs, and their beer list is always changing so that&#39;s fun.  The staff is super knowledgable and will let you try samples before you make up your mind.

One thing to note is that it is super loud if you eat inside, so for some people that may be difficult.  Ask about being seated on the patio if you know it will be an issue.

Love you Park &amp; Co!  We will be back!"

They seem to have a good selection of craft beer on tap and bottled. The cocktail menu was diverse. The wine selection was a bit on the small side but serviceable.

Overall, I would recommend for casual dinner or lunch."

The atmosphere is comfortable, service has always been friendly and I have no qualms with the approachable menu offerings. It&#39;s a solid neighborhood spot.

The menu is burger heavy and rounded out by a number of other barroom favorites, including one I gravitate towards whenever spotted - the Cubano. It was a good take on the sandwich and was one I would order again. Other menu items that I have tried have been filling comfort food and it&#39;s never been a challenge to find a beer to wash it down with among the twenty tap lines.

Given the laid back vibe, appealing tap list, TV&#39;s tuned to NFL Sunday Ticket and quality bar fare, I could find myself occupying a bar stool here fairly often if ever in the area."

She had deviled eggs and a gyro; I had the spicy steak sandwich and a Pivo Pilsner. Good was quite good; I usually opt for a burger at Park but was really pleased with the sandwich. 

Service was pretty spotty for a Thursday night and I was disappointed by the odd beers on tap. Nothing terribly inspired or particularly good. There&#39;s really no excuse for that in Denver. 

Still, Park is always reliable for really good food."

Best &#34;hand-cut&#34; fries I&#39;ve ever had and I&#39;m picky about my fried potatoes! The Pattymelt is hands down THE BEST and haven&#39;t had anything yet that I don&#39;t give 2 thumbs up!

The best part of my experiences at Park &amp; Co so far was the service I received on Sunday, 6/19/2016, Lindsey....she was nothing short of the best service I&#39;ve ever experienced anywhere! This includes MANY fine dining experiences in various parts of the country. My brother is a highly rated chef and I grew up in a fine dining atmosphere from a very young age. I can&#39;t say enough how amazing she is/was.

GETTING THERE: Both 2hr limit parking and meters. Parking can be hard to find after 7p.

SERVICE: 5 of 5 stars. Staff is always prompt, courteous, with the customer experience in mind at all times.

FOOD: 5 of 5 stars. All dishes range from &#34;very good&#34; to &#34;excellent&#34;. The Kale salad with steak or ahi tuna is great. The Fuego Melt with a side salad is great too. Wings are meaty and &#34;buffalo style&#34; - my favorite on 17th st.

VALUE: 4.5 of 5 stars. The prices aren&#39;t cheap, but are fair. The quality is always good.

ATMOSPHERE: 4.5 of 5 stars. The bar area is nice and clean, with a classy look. The patio area is covered in winter, and has TVs mounted on the wall. TVs are high quality resolution, and clearly visible, but not overly loud. I see lots of people here on dates."

I see all these glowing reviews about how fun this place is, and I walked out feeling like I was a burden on my server and just not hipster enough to fit in.

I&#39;m uptown for training today, and Park &amp; Co. was the closest spot for lunch.  As a party of one, it was easy to get a table, but that was about where the benefits of eating here ended.

My server was sweet enough, but I wish she had taken a few minutes to refill water during my meal.  Or given me time to ask her what he favorite items were.  Or anything!  Instead, I got the feeling since I was a lone female dining in a tavern full of young male lawyers that I wasn&#39;t her target market.  I got one glass of water - no offers of refills - my entire meal.   My entire interaction with her consistent of sit, order, get food, here&#39;s the check.   

As far as the food, I really liked my pear and arugula salad with ahi tuna.  I liked the sesame crust, but I felt the tuna itself was a little underdone (it was cooked properly, but I prefer mine cooked a little more.). The goat cheese was a nice accompaniment.

Atmosphere was loud; a little louder than I like when dining alone.  It probably is a great place to go with a group, but I wouldn&#39;t make this my top choice when dining solo."

SAMOSAS:
Butternut squash, chickpeas, scallions, hazelnuts, and pecorino.  Definitely was a little on the overfried side when I got it, but the blend of non-traditional ingredients was just right and definitely gave a new spin on the South Asian staple.

TRUFFLE FRIES:
Really trendy, and dusted with Parmesan cheese.  The large is literally the size of the thing they put into the deep fryer.  They were fantastic.

SCARPONE BURGER:
1/3 lb patty, provolone, crispy pancetta
giardiniera &amp; truffled garlic aioli.  Pretty much just a fancy way of saying sauce, bacon, fried vegetables, and meat.  Burger was great and I was actually a pretty big fan of the truffled garlic aioli on the burger.

ATMOSPHERE:
Hip atmosphere with strung lights and a brick exterior.  There are also TVs everywhere whatever sports are on that night, along with a full bar in the interior.

Definitely worth coming to and checking out if you&#39;re a fan of burgers.  It&#39;s also in a neighborhood that&#39;s great to take a stroll in afterwards to work off some of those calories!"

Unfortunately,  my dining companion found a group of hairs in the popper burger.   It was remade without question, and the second try was good...im told.

I couldn&#39;t decide between several of them so I ordered the Scarpone (provolone with crispy pancetta, truffled garlic aioli and giardiniera) while my friend ordered the veggie burger; both of which we split. The burger is a little under $7 for the veggie and a little under $10 for the Scarpone. They were both good with a juicy patty but I enjoyed the Scarpone more because of the cauliflower in the giardiniera. It is one of my favorite vegetables and to see it in a burger was pleasant and surprising. 

I also tried the sweet potato fries which were proportionally  seasoned with salt, crispy and not too oily. 

I came around 1 and they had a 10 minute wait. The patio was full and people brought their dogs (the dogs had to sit on the outside of the patio area but that was manageable because owners were still really close to them).

I&#39;m not docking a star because I think they do what they&#39;re going for, but if you want sliced or shredded steak, you&#39;ll hate it. Park and Co. They chop steak and call it a philly, same with bbq. This is sacrilegious.You shred it or slice it real thin. That should be common knowledge. Why the hell do you chop it in chunks??

I still FIVE you because it tastes great, you just got the texture wrong (or not to my liking) and that&#39;s not really your fault... you can fix that. Order a &#34;Taste of (where cheese steaks come from)&#34; sandwich and then eat one of your own, and you&#39;ll see what I mean.

Get good beer, the best in the neighborhood. Get a BURGER. They do burgers perfectly. Avoid the steak bits until the chef learns how to do them right. The veggie is fine as well.

All around, this place is a five for sure. Kicks the crap out of the other &#34;hamburger&#34; joint a couple blocks away."

Thought this place was okay in terms of food but it seems like a pretty cool place to hang out to watch a game or play some arcade games.

- Toadster Burger (cooked Medium): I liked the burger. It&#39;s pretty simple and not too fancy.  I found that they kept most of their burgers pretty standard/not too fancy and I liked that. It had a classic taste. The patty was juicy but I wish they gave me more than just one leaf of lettuce and one pickle to put in my burger
- Parmesan Truffle fries: These seemed a little greasy/old to me, like they fried them in oil that wasn&#39;t quite hot enough. Flavor was good though. Huge basket.
- Brussels sprout appetizer: this was kind of a disaster... super greasy, came out charred and really dark and unappetizing. :/ i love brussel sprouts and I maybe only had one..."

Came at 7:00 on a Friday night, so had to wait about 30-40 minutes, which is to be expected. Sat out on the patio, which is quite big. I ordered a &#34;popper&#34; turkey burger, as well as some regular fries (which had an upcharge).

When my burger came out, I took a couple bites and determined it was a veggie burger. I asked the server, and he brought me out another one and told me to go ahead and eat the veggie one while I wait. The turkey burger came out pretty quickly, and it was delicious! It had fried onions and jalapeno cream cheese on it. The fries were pretty good, but no good once they cooled down a little bit.  

In the end, the server gave the turkey burger to me for half price (totally not necessary), since he messed up the order. So that was a pleasant surprise!

I was impressed, and I&#39;d love to come back for another meal."

Mis-ordered a beer, asked for a replacement, was lectured by the bartender about wasting beer and how it was unacceptable to &#34;blind&#34; order drafts.  Bartender then swore at and degraded my friend regarding his age until we ended up having to leave.

For those who have been here in Denver for more than a minute, you may recall the Bump and Grind, where the men dressed in drag and the food didn&#39;t. It got many of us through some spartan years of few good places to dine. I believe they were sadly tossed by the L Lord.  Much has come into town since, a few gems even, but they all sort of blur into one giant pretty good so much of the time. How many sliders can one man suffer.

Park and Co today fell a little flat, wobbly in the big shoes it doesn&#39;t come close to filling. I had the steak and kale salad. The steak seemed a little tired and low grade, but maybe that&#39;s my fault for eschewing the burger basics in search of something healthier. The kale really beat me up, more like rabbit fare than people food.  Service was really good, but it was hard to stomach the mediocrity in light of the stellar ghosts that haunt those with a taste for fantasmas. One mixed blessing was the classic rock soundtrack--at least there was no Nickel Back--that veers a little too Dead friendly for my tastes."

The Works fries are perfect for sharing and I can&#39;t remember exactly what they have on them but it&#39;s something along the lines of bacon, cheddar cheese, ranch, and maybe buffalo sauce.  Anyways, they&#39;re definitely worth checking out.

Parking around this part of 17th can be tricky but once you score a spot I think you&#39;ll be glad to hang out at Park and Co. for a while, even if it&#39;s only during your work week lunch break."

I was somewhat impressed. The fries were decent, nothing special. Their Ranch Dressing &amp; Bleu Cheese dressings were super thin &amp; watery. God awful. Their wine list has a 300% mark up. The atmosphere was simple, the burgers averaged $12 each, ( fries or side salad are EXTRA) 
Service was slow, unfriendly, adequate at best. This is the type of restaurant that is good for a visit once every 8 months."

Yes, I realize now, this is probably what everyone else in the greater Aurora area was doing that day as well. As I pulled up, it was pretty clear that this place was packed. Yet I&#39;m not one to walk away from a line. Especially one that moves as fast as theirs! It just means it&#39;s totally worth the wait. 

Once seated I ordered the #15 soup - rare steak and well done brisket, with a side of crab cheese wontons (because why the heck not). I forgot to order a drink, but water works just fine too! The wontons were alright. Seemed like maybe to oil in the fryer needed to be changed. I&#39;ll give them another try a different time. Now that pho was delish! It was just the right amount of seasoning on it&#39;s own. Though, I did choose to add in various other items to bring up the spice. Great ratios of noodle, to meat, to broth! Severs were really friendly, despite how busy they were.

The layout and flow of the restaurant is where things get a little weird. The entry way is very small. So on a busy snowy day you may be waiting outside if you choose to wait. Now after you enjoy your meal you head to the back of the restaurant to pay and then go back to the front to exit. It&#39;s just not an efficient layout. But that&#39;s not enough to stop me from coming back for more tasty pho!

So next snow day you guys know where to find me; slurping up some tasty pho here at Pho 888!"

We found Pho 888, which was about 15 minutes from the airport and had a high average Yelp rating.  It was a Sunday afternoon, and it seemed based on the bustling crowd that many people were in the mood for Vietnamese food!

I tried the special combination plate (Com Dac Biet), which included grilled pork, shrimp, and beef along with some egg rolls.  I&#39;m a sucker for a good rice plate, and this meal definitely delivered with a substantial portion of food that was well-cooked and quite tasty.  I also shared some vegetarian spring rolls, which were warm and sizable!

Pho 888 also serves bubble tea/smoothies, and I tried their pineapple flavor.  It definitely tasted like pineapple but i found it too sweet, and the boba clumped up on the bottom (either because they were frozen or maybe were not so fresh? Not sure what was happening there...).  Otherwise, I really enjoyed my meal and would check it out again if I was in town."

Not the mention the food was bangin!!! I cannot find good pho in the midwest but this place was worth the trip. 

After spending the weekend in Breck, I had a 7pm flight on Monday and was in need a hot fresh meal to seal the weekend off. Pho 888 did not disappoint! Huge portions, nice and fresh ingredients, and really friendly FAST service. I cannot say enough good things on my FIRST visit here. If I can back in the Denver area I will DEFINITELY come back.

I ordered the usual house special pho and grilled pork bun (rice vermicelli). We went for lunch and ended up having a small amount of leftovers for dinner.

Well, let&#39;s be real, I moved from Colorado at 3... so call me a faux native.  I&#39;ve been to a ton of Pho places in the DC area, and this place is as good, if not better.  The broth is delicious, not too salty, but just salty enough.  The spring rolls are extra fresh, I like the twist they add via mint leaves.  The peanut sauce for the spring rolls are even better.  Sweet, with a hint of savory.  

Let&#39;s get more into the Pho.  There&#39;s nothing Faux about this Pho.  It&#39;s delicious.  As I mentioned earlier, the broth is jut right.  The regular medium serving is plenty for one person.  I&#39;m 6&#39;2&#34; @ 245-250 lbs... so rest assured I&#39;m not pulling your chain on the serving size.  I got the #10, which is loaded with all kinds of protein.  I&#39;m about that protein, as I&#39;m about them gainz.  The different meats give you different textures and tastes.  The meat quality itself is good, nothing crappy.  You won&#39;t be getting any potted meat or Salisbury steak in this Pho, just quality protein.

Last but not least, Boba!  I love Boba, I&#39;ve had so much Boba back in the DC area, I&#39;d turn into a Boba.  The Boba here is good as well.  I tried the honey dew melon.  nice and sweet, but not over powering.  Tapioca balls are on point, and squishy.  Ya I said squishy balls... laugh it up.  It had a honey dew flavor, with a bit of a milky flavor, and the two together mix well.  Definitely coming by again for the food.

Service - The service was outstanding, that&#39;s what brought this place from a 4 star to a 5 star rating.  I went with my co-workers, who used to go all the time.  They remember their orders, their names, and made idle chit chat.  You can tell they care about their customers, and want them to come back.  Very friendly, and attentive.  

The place itself - It was nice inside, it has a relaxing feel to it, as if to say &#34;Don&#39;t rush, take your time, enjoy our food!&#34;.  Apparently it was renovated recently, so I can&#39;t touch on how it looked before.  However, currently, it&#39;s nice.

All in all, great.  Would Pho it up again."

And we wanted something warm in our bellies. Never the ones for &#34;traditional&#34; comfort foods like mashed potatoes and beef stroganoff, we opted instead for the more hipster route and decided on pho.

But where to go?!?! So many choices. So many numbers. Should we try Pho 7? Pho 96? Pho 97? Maybe Pho OK? E had one simple question...&#34;Would you like someplace close...or &#39;pho&#39; away?&#34; 

We opted for the latter and went for a drive. The first things we noticed at Pho 888 were at least 12 cars out front with Broncos flags, and a sign informing all patrons that they would be closed for Chinese New Year/Super Bowl Sunday. The Broncos love was strong here.

The patrons inside were the mixed bag I love to see when eating out, with tables of families and teenagers and old couples of all ethnicities cozying up shoulder to shoulder over steaming bowls of Vietnamese soul food.

I ordered a medium with steak, flank, and brisket. E ordered the same without the brisket. I feel like the medium was the perfect size; the small was pretty much child-sized, and the large was twice as big as my head. 

The base broth is quite tasty, but salty (although that&#39;s mostly the norm with pho...). The meat was good and tender, but the rare steak wasn&#39;t as rare as I like it. The garnishes were nice and fresh, and I loved that they gave us two cut-up limes. I put a whole lime&#39;s worth of juice in my pho, and it made it perfect! Sometimes you just need to amp up the acidity and fight off the scurvy! 

We ordered boba teas at the beginning of our meal and were worried they had been forgotten...turns out that the servers only make them when you are finishing up your food, so you get a sweet ending to your meal that you can take on the road! I got the taro, which was a beautiful shade of purple and had a flowery, creamy taste. E got the mung bean, and although it had an interesting grainy texture and an ugly green-brown color, the flavor was earthy and slightly sweet and really delicious. I highly recommend it and I&#39;m definitely ordering it or the red bean next time!

Overall, I really liked the feel of this place, and the pho is good. And I want to try all their boba flavors! They have a ton of interesting ones. So we will definitely be back!"

This is one of the best pho places in Denver. Well, I guess this is technically Aurora so one of the best pho places in the Denver area. I am Vietnamese and I used to live in Dallas and visit Houston frequently. Needless to say, I am VERY picky about my pho and this place is LEGIT.

They have the best broth and their portions are no joke. I get a small bowl of pho and I eat that over 2 meals. Yes, I save it and eat it again. I know, it&#39;s terrible and my parents have already yelled at me about it but the noodles don&#39;t soak up all the broth/get soggy and it&#39;s just too good to not eat every last bite.

They load up the meat in your bowl rather than noodles like other places. Their rice dishes are divine as well. When we are feeling extra lazy, we will get pho and a rice dish so that we can eat that over 4 meals!

I&#39;ve talked to the owner and he lets the broth simmer for hours and you can definitely tell when you eat it. SO GOOD. I&#39;ve also been there when they ran out of broth. He personally came out and apologized but told us that he would rather turn away customers than serve broth that was not up to his standard. Nuts I tell you!

The only thing is that they don&#39;t have sua dau nanh (soy milk) or almond milk tea. Bummer. I&#39;m still trying to convince him to add those to the menu!"

So what better way than to warm up than to have some pho. Like real pho not some makeshift pho some restaurant sold us. 

I&#39;m not going to lie. The plaza this restaurant is located looks kind of run down so you wouldn&#39;t really expect to find some good pho around there, but believe it. 

Anyways if you are ordering take out, the waiters just gesture to the cashier. Place your order with him and bam. Just wait and chill. The food came out within 10-15 minutes. 

My husband and I ordered the classic pho with everything and a vermicelli. Easy orders because you just gotta keep it simple. The pho broth was amaze and generous portions of meat. The rice noodles were a bit wider than usual, but that didn&#39;t stop us from gobbling it down. And the vermicelli was definitely flavorful. I really think Vietnamese grilled meats are just delicious! The grilled pork was on point. Although it definitely isn&#39;t the best pho I&#39;ve had, it comes close. 

I took one star away because the cashier was kind of rude. First, he seemed like he wanted to be elsewhere because he kept hurrying us to make our order. Second he just kind of tossed the pen and receipt at me. Seriously? If you wanna go watch the TV or talk to friends then go and find someone else who can give the customers the service they should receive. And lastly, where was my copy of the receipt, jerk! 

Anyways, I will find myself coming here to get some real pho."

They gave me plenty of bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime, and basil -- but I just wish all of the veggies/herbs were more fresh. 

All in all, not a bad option if you are in the area and craving Vietnamese food. I&#39;d rank it 3.5 stars if I could. However, I much preferred the quality and ambiance of Pho 95 in Denver."

Egg roll was delicious and they added vermicelli along with the pickled veggies to roll in with the lettuce. The com thit nuong was also very good and my bf added an egg on top. I had the Pho ga (dark meat) and this place has the   ginger fish sauce which was a great touch since the only place I get the ginger fish sauce is at home. The only negative thing about the Pho is that I had to order a medium bowl with the dark meat, small bowl was not an option. We also ordered the mango smoothie which was delicious as it is made with fresh mangoes. Negative for this is they only have the option as &#34;dessert&#34; - messing they won&#39;t give it to you until you&#39;re done with your meal even if you order it first.

Why do I hate to travel?  
(within the US not international)

1. Miss my wife and son 
2. The food sucks 

So what the hell happened here? 

If you are from LA then you&#39;ve eaten in Westminster so you know what authentic and delicious Vietnamese food is 

I&#39;m always skeptical when I see Yelp reviews on Asian places but this time they were spot on ... Nom nom nom 

So I ordered the egg rolls and the Dac Biet medium

Hint - if you go to a restaurant and it is the name of a dish in the name - always order that and always order the first selection of that 

So go to a pho place - if you don&#39;t know what to order always order the first pho :) 

Egg rolls come out and the first thing I think is damm they are smaller compared to Westminster 

Boy was I wrong ... They were awesome!!! 
Flavor explosion compared to the bland ones that are circulating these days 
I feel that most pho places just mail in half heartedly their egg rolls now - it&#39;s usually disappointing like ordering meat loaf 

Drooling thinking about those tiny egg rolls right now

So the pho comes out right after - service and speed are not an issue here 

The first thing I do as a snobby pho connoisseur I go for the broth. 

The broth is flavorful and not too light (hate light broths that steal away from what the flavor is supposed to be like) and delicious. You can really taste the difference of a pho broth that is made over days as opposed to same day or night before and this broth is done authentic and it&#39;s done right! 

If you asked me before I would have said you could never get delicious and authentic tasting Vietnamese food outside Vietnam or Westminster but boy was I wrong. 

Five star pho place!!!! 

Not five stars for the area or state adjustment 

Just five stars

Just damm good 

I mean damm good :)"

This place is legit. The food is great and the workers understand Vietnamese, which is a boon with my non-native parents. The servers were very nice and service was pretty speedy.

Service was very quick for the food, but it took quite a while for my Vietnamese coffee to make it&#39;s way out.  They&#39;ve got a decent selection of boba smoothies, though I was disappointed that they don&#39;t have lychee, my favorite.

He has so many regulars that come here because he treats everyone who walks through his door with love. I had the opportunity to speak with him once and it was very clear that he truly loves what he does. 

When I eat here, I always get the Pho Dac Biet, which is the pho with everything in it. The broth is amazing. Extremely flavorful and not overpowering. The meats they use are of great quality and the veggies as well. The noodles are cooked just right as well. Not soggy, just right. 

I&#39;ve also had their rice dishes which are very delicious. You really can&#39;t go wrong with anything here. It&#39;s great to know that you will be treated with great customer service here as well.

Pros: Pho is unbelievably delicious, Broth is simmered for hours (yummy), Meats are fresh, Staff is very polite and helpful. 

Cons: Absolutely none.

2 Star for service

Pho spots usually mean two things: great food and service... This was my first time eating here and per the Yelp reviews that I scanned (but didn&#39;t read closely), decided to get my Pho fix...

The good - 3 sizes of bowls large, gargantuan, and OhMyDam (S/M/L)

The bad - the service was horrible all the way around, not enough utensils/menus, not enough waters, didn&#39;t tell us where/how to pay (its at the counter in the back of the place) and my pet peeve... can sodas!!

First off, you know a Pho place is legit when the menu is in Vietnamese because they&#39;re not really trying to be hip or appeal to anyone but Viet people. 

The pho was delicious and I ordered a large and holy crap is it big! hahah honestly, the bowl was probably bigger than my head! I hardly made a dent and was so ashamed to have left some in the bowl.

So, so close. I will say that the broth in the pho is fantastic. It&#39;s got just the right amount of flavor. I also enjoy the fact that they have many different sizes for whatever amount of goodness you require.

One drawback, and this is purely my opinion, is that all their pho have some kind of raw meat. I just don&#39;t like doing the raw meat thing. Sure I can get it on the side and sure it always cooks in the broth but still. Just sayin&#39;...

The service is impeccable and the staff is super polite. The waiters are very easy on the eyes and the owner is the nicest guy ever! They are prompt and efficient, even during a crazy buys lunch rush.

You may have experienced this in other pho places that when you mix in the other cold ingredients like the bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño, the broth becomes bland plus the soup gets cold. Here, that never happens. The broth comes steaming hot and well seasoned so the additional cold ingredient doesn&#39;t take over the taste of pho.

not bad for a random restaurant in aurora and lots of extra points for being across the street from my brother&#39;s apt. the broth is decent and the meat is okay too. nothing like pho 95&#39;s filet mignon, but also not gross and dry/gristly. prices are $$$$ for pho, so my brother and i shared a large (close to $10 before tax, if i remember correctly). i tried to order a coconut taro boba, my go-to drink, but the server said they couldn&#39;t mix flavors. pretty sure he just made up that rule though, because when i settled on a taro boba drink and asked for it to be made less sweet, he got super confused/confusing and told me he didn&#39;t know if they could do that. i asked if they added extra sweetener or if it was just whatever was in the taro powder and he told me he didn&#39;t know because he didn&#39;t make the drinks... but didn&#39;t offer to find out or anything. after trying to explain again what i was looking for and telling him that if they couldn&#39;t make the drink with 1/2 sugar, i&#39;d just take it regular, he left to go put in the order. the drink came out toward the end of my meal, which i guess i didn&#39;t mind too much bc i didn&#39;t need to drink it while eating my boba, but for a long time, i thought he probably just completely forgot about it. but when i got it, it turned out to be pretty good. not super epic honey boba or anything, but the drink itself wasn&#39;t too crazy sweet (they were able to make it with less sugar) and the tapioca were soft and slightly sweet. not bad for boba from a pho place! i&#39;ll be back to try some of the other menu items!

edit: tried their taro boba, half sugar again. still tasted good, but this time, it was gritty (like they hadn&#39;t mixed the powder thoroughly enough). so a little hit-or-miss, but there isn&#39;t much competition around here so i&#39;ll take what i can get."

Hence after work, Hubs went to this establishment to get our Dinner TO GO.  Man, this establishment is indeed jam packed with other patrons who also wants to have Dinner there.  That evening was on Friday August 15th 2014.  Time was about 19:30hrs ish.

From the Menu we opt the following items TO GO :

*  #21A. Pho Tom (Shrimp) (Medium) ($8.00)
*  #33.  Com Bo Nurong - Grilled Beef Rice Plate (8.95)

  Just take note, The Shrimp is an additional of ($0.50), they will add the TAKE OUT FEE for every TO GO orders you are opting for.  In our case, it was ($0.70).

  Yes, they packed the Pho stuffs separately from the Condiments, The Herbs, The Rice Noodle Bowl what nots.  When we reached home, the Broth is still warm.  I pour out the Pho Broth to a saucepan, to heat it up so I can have it &#34;boiling hot&#34;.

  The portion is reasonable.  But somehow, the Pho DID NOT WOW me as much as I want hoping for.  The Depth of Flavor wasn&#39;t there.  It was just OK.  Well actually it was &#34;Meh&#34; or &#34;Barely OK&#34;.  For the Pho, they provide, Bean Sprouts, Slices of Jalapenos, Thai Basil and a Wedge of Lime.  In the Shrimp Bowl, has Slices of Carrots, Cauliflower, Snow Peas and Green Onions.  I opt to have Shrimp instead, coz I was craving for Shrimp.

  Hubs opt to have the Grilled Beef.  Hubs said its Doable and just OK.  The Grilled Beef, is one Piece of Beef.  The Beef was placed on a piece of Green Lettuce.  It is also sprinkled with Fried Shallots.  It has Rice on one side, slices of Cucumber and Tomatoes.

  The person who took our order that evening his name is Dat.  All in all, just an OK Dinner for us.  Might return when needed though NOT In A Hurry coz I am eyeing for the Smoothies and Jelly Pearl Drinks aka BOBA Drinks that they offer.

If your new to pho get the rare steak pho but if your adventurous get the #10 (got tripe and tendon). IF YOU ORDER EGGROLLS!!! Roll them up in the lettuce leaves with all the other things that come on the plate. Trust me it&#39;s 10x better that way."

The price is reasonable and the staff is amazing! Always so nice and accommodating. We eat here often, even Togo for work. 

Eating there is nice they get busy but are always quick and attentive. Food is always hot and delicious. 

Their portions are always perfect. The staff is very good about substituting things as well. I love the combination rice plate but do not like the pork and they always add additional steak for me. 

I especially love to do Togo because they never get the order wrong and they are quick! Will continue to eat there. It is the ONLY pho place I will eat pho. The broth is probably the best part!"

It is like crack. I just cannot get enough of it. I don&#39;t care if I get a heartburn afterward. The sauce is totally worth it. And I&#39;ve had satay sauces at other places before but the satay here is the best I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s not the red stuff that they have on the table already but instead something they keep hidden in the back because it&#39;s a prized possession. Must ... Eat.... More .... Satay ..... 

I have only tried five pho places in Colorado so far but this one is my favorite of those five. This was the first place I ate at when I first moved here back in the summer. Coming from a city with a LARGE number of Vietnamese people, I was a little pompous about pho and a bit skeptic about the quality of pho in Colorado. 

But,like Kim Kardashian&#39;s marriages, I was wrong. Pho 888 had a great broth (not too strong in anise flavor but not too bland) and had fresh and large vegetables. The servers were friendly and even chatted it up with me. I am not used to having more than a 5 second conversation with waiters at Vietnamese restaurants. They also, to my surprise, serve banh cuon on certain weekends. Their banh cuon and their pho are both equally good. 

The Vietnamese salad (goi) here is huge &amp; needs to be shared. It comes with shredded green papaya, fish sauce, shrimp and a side of crunchy shrimp puff chips. The taro milkshake tasted more floral/sweeter than the taro smoothies I&#39;m used to but nevertheless it was enjoyable. I also tried their watermelon sinh to (smoothie) with rainbow jelly. It was refreshing and reminded me of the watermelon smoothies I used to make when I worked at Q-cup Boba in high school. I will disclose the recipe here

ingredients
1. watermelon
2. splash of simple syrup 

directions
1. blend in a blender

I know. Mind blowing. Their green tea drink is also super refreshing &amp; yummy. It&#39;s milky jasmine tea with matcha? I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s colored like that but it tastes like jasmine tea. I had it with boba once and I was really surprised by how soft and nice the boba were! I usually skip out on the boba because it requires too much chewing but the boba here was soft and easy to chew on.

But anywhoots, I suggest you come get some pho here if you&#39;re in the area. 

Pho is great for 
1. breakfast (as it is traditionally a breakfast food in Vietnam)
2. hangovers 
3. cold days
4. any other occasion that was not listed in #1-3

The workers here are all friendly &amp; the owner likes to make sure his customers are enjoying their meal."

 I do not like many of their other boba flavors because it is too sweet for me.

Cost: 8/10 It&#39;s pretty affordable - not quite as cheap as some on federal (again, this is an unfair comparison considering their have a pho restaurant on every block).

Last week I ordered the Love Stinks burger--if you don&#39;t mind smelling like garlic going back to work, then definitely get this burger. I love that they have a variety of fries you can choose from as well--garlic parmesan is the popular flavor these days. 

If you&#39;re up for more gastronomic delights, order a milkshake for dessert. You won&#39;t be disappointed.

Service has been status quo here, i.e., attentive servers and quick delivery of food (but not so quick that you wonder if the food has been sitting around for awhile...). They make the burgers fresh here--even the black bean patties (my vegetarian friend vouched for this fact).

I opted for the fried version but was instead given a grilled one while the rest of the order was correct. As hungry as I was I didn&#39;t notice the mistake until they brought me over the correct sandwich and was told to keep both. 

Nothing is better than good customer service in my eyes, especially when I&#39;m used to angry servers when you point out their mistakes. Since I got to try both versions I have to say that while the fried chicken is huge and freshly fried, the grilled chicken is very flavorful. The sweet potato fries were also fresh and crispy. Wish I had room to try out one of their many inventive milkshakes but alas after almost eating two sandwiches there was no way I could fit that in.....maybe next time!"

Not sure if they just haven&#39;t worked out the kinks yet, but for the love of all that is holy...please get some competent kitchen staff and bartenders. This is Colorado and you are claiming to be an awesome burger joint. Step up your game. 

Our waitress was super sweet...but that&#39;s where the enjoyment ended. Ordered a lager...received a stout. GF ordered a whiskey and soda...received a whiskey and tonic. Wanted to try the peanut butter + jalapeño + bacon burger...received a slab of ground beef so bloody that I think it was still mooing. 

Things eventually were worked out by the aforementioned super sweet waitress...but 1st impressions are pretty darn important; especially if you&#39;re trying to crack into the burger-bar scene in Denver. Crave, I wanted to like you, but you have definitely lost a customer, and will be losing this customers&#39; friends and family as well. :(

Update....... November 2016. 

This place has earned my business back. Since opening downtown, they have improved their service tremendously, and I can say that a better burger joint in the Lodo/ballpark area cannot be found. I don&#39;t frequent often, but when I&#39;m in the mood for a great burger and a great happy hour, crave is my spot. 

The wise guy is hands-down the most delicious (and filling) burger you&#39;ll ever have the privilege of tasting.

My wife had the &#34;Sin City&#34;, a burger with candied bacon, fried cheddar cheese, bourbon glazed onions. The burgers were huge and we shared the two and had food left over. Next time I want to try the &#34;Luther&#34;, bacon, cheddar and egg burger on two very large glazed doughnuts. It looked awesome. Fries come with the burger and we split a fudge brownie milkshakes, That was very good as well. Thank you Crave and Yelp for the discount as well."

Wasn&#39;t a fan of their buns but everything else was pretty good. They have tap beers for $3 all day which is a great plus.

This place was empty on a Friday night, so I guess people haven&#39;t caught on to how good it is yet! The reason I took away one star was for the service...although our server (bartender) was new, the rest of the staff/management should have supported her better in her training process!!! 

The food is amazing! The possibilities for burger toppings and types is almost endless. I tried the campfire burger which is usually made with buffalo, but I substituted a black bean burger (which wasn&#39;t the BEST I&#39;ve had, but good - it is soy based and tastes a bit like &#34;real&#34; meat which is a little weird to me since I don&#39;t like the taste of meat, but would be good for those vegetarians/vegans that do like the taste). The area where this place totally hits the mark is their sides. We tried the fried pickles, the red chile cheese fries (red chile is vegetarian - and on the sweeter side), and the Das fries (made with beer cheese sauce and topped with bacon/jalapenos)...each of them were absolutely phenomenal! 

Their homemade &#34;crave-arita&#34; was lacking something, but they get points for having really cheap drinks and all of their alcohol being from Colorado."

We stumbled upon the place walking through downtown. What a great jewel!  The wait staff and bartender were very friendly, and even made mention of my favorite burger place in Texas ;) 

We enjoyed the Luther, a Donut Burger, and the Love Stinks which brags of a garlic parm cream cheese that&#39;s just indescribable. By far the best burger I&#39;ve had in quite some time. At least as long as I can remember!  GREAT place."

One of the better burgers I have had. Once you eat this burger, you probably won&#39;t want to eat another burger for awhile. It&#39;s a really heavy meal, but it&#39;s definitely worth a try. I would recommend anyone looking for a good burger place. 

My only negative about my experience was the service. The service from the waitress was pretty slow (except for the part where I paid). 

Other than that, food is great, atmosphere is good, and I would recommend the Sin City burger."

I get it, I eat earlier than the crowd around here but instead of whatever else people were doing they should&#39;ve been here having a burger and a $3 pint of craft beer. Or if you have a sweet tooth (a really sweet tooth) get one of their milkshakes - they&#39;re awesome.

If you&#39;ve read my other reviews you may know that I eat 95% vegetarian - I decided to undo all of that goodwill by ordering the special burger, which had almost the whole animal kingdom on it - smoked bacon, smoked cheese, crispy onion strings, and caramelized onion jam. It was totally worth it, definitely one of the top ten burgers I&#39;ve ever had. You can also get fried pickles as a side, and they basically give you an appetizer&#39;s worth of delicious fried pickle chips.

Oh, and for those of you who do want to stay veg, their bean-soy patty can be substituted onto all of their burgers, and it&#39;s actually delicious. Crave is on my way home every weekday, and it&#39;s a legitimate struggle to not go every single day. Seriously, just go there and get a burger - you deserve to be happy."

It&#39;s impossible to avoid here at Crave, where after one visit, you really will crave their burgers, their awesome service, and that overstuffed feeling that can only compete with Thanksgiving. 

Let&#39;s start with the burgers. There are almost too many to choose from. I&#39;ve tried different ones each time I&#39;ve been in, and all of them were amazing. The Campfire, with BBQ sauce and a coffee coating on the fried onions has a wonderful smokiness that keeps you coming back bite after bite. Today I had the Colorado, which I thought was going to be pulled lamb in the fashion of a pulled pork sandwich, but turned out to be pulled lamb ON TOP OF a burger. Say what!?! Delicious. But, my favorite so far has definitely been the Popper. Unlike other burgers that incorporate jalapenos and cream cheese, this one has a jalapeno cream cheese slab that is fried into creamy, spicy heaven, then put on top of the amazing Crave burger.

Avoiding the gluten? Get your burger bunless--on top of a bed of lettuce instead of on a bun. It also makes it a little less painful to waddle out of the place. 

Also, you can get fried pickles as a side. They charge extra for it, but it is a huge portion. It would be nice if you could get half the portion without up charge. Their fries and sweet potato fries are good too. 

The cherry on top has to be the service. All the servers are efficient and pleasant, and seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs."

First of all, the service we received tonight was really outstanding.  ASHLEY took care of us, and gave us her recommendations, which were outstanding.  She was attentive, and made sure that our first visit to Crave was excellent.  If Ashley is working, make sure you are sitting in her section.

There were three of us in the group, and between us we ordered the Sin City Burger, the Sloppy Burger and the Flaming Tiki.  All three were delicious, and I would order again and again, but the Flaming Tiki was incredible.  Spicy, and sweet, and juicy!  The tempura cheddar cheese on the Sin City tasted great, but it was a little heavy. 

All in all, this was a great dining choice. If you are in &#34;LoDo&#34; make sure you are hungry, and stop by Crave Real Burgers for an incredible burger."

The wolf burger was awesome, I was still full the next morning. The chile they put on the fries is more liquid/less meaty than what I&#39;m used to in Texas, but very delicious. I think I would prefer it on the side as a dip when I go again.

The burger was cooked exactly how I asked and the parmesan fries were out of this world. And it&#39;s probably the cheapest restaurant I&#39;ve been to in LoDo. It would be 5 stars if it wasn&#39;t for my server Kat. From the time we sat down she was cold and it just got worse from there. I get that we asked a lot of questions about the menu, but there was no need to be rude about it. And anytime we&#39;d ask for more sauce or a refill it was like she was annoyed. They were really busy, so maybe she was just overwhelmed and having a bad day. Either way, it was not a good experience. All the other staff seemed pretty friendly though.

I ordered a Boulder sandwich which I think many people of Boulder would be offended by.

The beef tasted like beef - still pink in the middle as I had requested.  And the bacon was absolutely fantastic - and lots of it.  That, together with some tasty pulled pork, and the delightfully crisp fried onions on top made, combined with both a great BBQ sauce and ketchup, for many mouthfuls made in hamburger heaven!  The Fries were very nicely done too.  I ate THE WHOLE THING!!

The food was tasty (mine at least) but for a burger place they do the doneness of the meat strangely in my opinion.  When ordering they ask &#34;pink or no pink&#34; in the burger.  I said no pink, my girlfriend said pink.  You would think a no pink burger would be basically well done, and a pink burger to have a little pink in the middle.  My &#34;no pink&#34; burger was pretty pink in the middle like a medium steak, and my girlfriends pink burger was disturbingly uncooked.  Borderline rare burger.  She could only eat the edges as the whole middle was very very pink.  Unexpected to say the least.  I would think a no pink burger should have no pink whatsoever.  Mine was delicious none the less but my girl could only eat a few bites of hers and was too grossed out to continue. What&#39;s wrong with rare- well done when ordering? If they had cooked them appropriately it would be 4 or 5 stars as mine was really good and all the sides were great and service was too."

I&#39;ve been to two business events in the &#34;Denver airport hotel area&#34; and I&#39;ve struggled to enjoy a decent meal...until today. A huge thanks to Yelpers for their spot on reviews for Woolley Classic Suite&#39;s Jardin restaurant.

I visited this beautiful hotel during their happy hour and found the restaurant portion completely empty. Thankfully to the service support of Tyrone &amp; Roberit, I had a very enjoyable experience!

My meal started with a glass of wine and calamari. The squid was perfectly cooked, but the chili oil was less exciting than other versions I&#39;ve had.

My waiters mentioned that there was a new chef hired two months ago and the menu had been entirely revamped. This influenced my decision away from the Mahi Mahi other Yelpers had reviewed (I was hoping for andouille sausage). I went with the blackened sirloin with truffle fries. The steak was delicious, but the fries were lacking the truffle flavor.

I had a solid meal tonight and I owe it all to Yelp. i wish to give back and thank my fellow Yelpers for their reviews! If I return to this area I will not only consider staying at the Woolley, but will definitely eat at the Jardin! #yum"

One waitress trying to serve. Bless her heart has to walk clear across from one end to the other just to get drinks. Took about 10 min just to get beers. Wings were undercooked. Chop salad was alright. Saw multiple couples leave due to no service.

The atmosphere is nice. Situated inside the lobby and has plenty of TVs and a bar that has happy hour. There&#39;s a cute little river in the restaurant which makes the restaurant even more charming.

When I was at the bar with my friend, I noticed one of the waiters patronizing a customer with another employee because the customer ordered something she didn&#39;t want. I felt like that situation could have been handled a little bit better."

The calamari was possibly the best I&#39;ve ever had. Delicately fried, they seemed to melt in your mouth. Not chewy in the least, I want to know what witchcraft produced them.

The crab cake burger with sweet potato fries was delicious and complex, and the fried green tomatoes had a crunchy, delectable flavor. 

The finish was a delicate ice cream duo of raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream, which perfectly complemented each other.

Highly recommended for a wonderful meal with excellent service."

We love the hotel and it really doesn&#39;t take much time to drive into the metro area.
We&#39;ve never eaten in any of the restaurants serving the airport hotel area but didn&#39;t want to drive anywhere tonight, so I investigated on Yelp to see if there really is anything more special than the usual chains around here. I was intrigued by the reviews of Jardin even though my review here is only the 4th one. 
We walked over and ended up having a fabulous meal. 
The mahi mahi mentioned in another review was exceptional. The fish was succulent and the mashed potatoes outstanding. We also had the side of rice and beans (with Andouille sausage)---delicious and spicy, but not excessively spicy. The crab cakes were great, and the seared tuna salad was also quite good.
We almost passed on dessert and it&#39;s lucky we didn&#39;t. We shared the peach-cherry cobbler with cinnamon ice cream. YUM. We agreed it was the best fruit cobbler we&#39;d ever had in a restaurant. The peaches seemed to be fresh peaches---definitely not canned, and if frozen, it was impossible to tell. Huge slices of peaches with some firmness to them, not a mush like so many cobblers. In addition to tart cherries, there were some unannounced blueberries. It was sweet but not cloying. Not swimming in gooey sauce or full of topping; just lots of fruit. We&#39;re betting the chocolate lava cake on the menu there must be great. Next time.....
There&#39;s a chef back there who really knows what he&#39;s doing.
Robert was our attentive server, and he was readily able to answer any question and help us decide what to order when we were on the fence.
The place was nearly empty as of 7:30 when we left, which made us upset, but we then remembered that weekdays are when these hotels are full; it&#39;s the reverse of in-town hotels. The rates are low on weekends when the businessmen they serve aren&#39;t going in and out of the airport. So we sincerely hope they get plenty of business during the week to compensate because it would be very sad if they didn&#39;t do well.
In fact, Jardine is good enough that if we lived in Aurora or anywhere this side of Denver, we would make a point of coming here to dinner. It&#39;s one of the better meals we&#39;ve had here.
Another reviewer said it&#39;s a &#34;really really really good hotel restaurant&#34;. I would go one step further and say it&#39;s a really really good restaurant that&#39;s situated in a hotel."

I am staying at Woolley&#39;s Classic suites right now and Jardin provides the menu and food for room service.  That&#39;s honestly the only part of my stay that hasn&#39;t been wonderful which is unfortunate because that is one of the main reasons I chose Woolley&#39;s.  

I gave up earning1200+ United miles so that I could stay here.

French onion soup was oily buy flavorful.  It was marginally good.

Woolley&#39;s burger was a mixed bag.  The meat was really tasty but the diced onions on it tasted strange.  I scraped those off.  The sweet potato fries were soggy. 

Chicken Enchiladas Verdes was okay except the only flavor was a hot/spicy that came from the...was it gravy??... I&#39;m not sure...au jus??  The diet soda tasted off somehow.

I really didn&#39;t feel like leaving for dinner tonight so I ordered a pepperoni pizza from the kids menu.  It was doughy and the tomato sauce tasted canned.  So, messing up pizza is not a good indicator of quality, is it?

Finally, I had the apple pie which is actually a puffed pastry filled with apple and raisin.  Again, when is puffed pastry ever soggy?!! The ice cream they bought to put on it was good.

I would suggest the chef throw away the microwave.  I wonder if the restaurant patrons get microwaved food.  I sure did."

I love horse radish sauce, and next time I&#39;ll ask for some extra on the side but the flavor was great! The sweet potato fries were some of the best I have had, which also impressed me.

Perhaps it was the holiday but the food was flavorless, overpriced and poorly executed. As a foodie, I would not recommend this place. The ahi tuna was not even seared and the salad was bland.

The place is tucked into the back corner of a strip mall and has neither curb appeal nor is the interior sexy, trendy or cool. That means the food must be on point! 
All dishes come with a spice level of 1-5 for us Americans, or Thai level spicy for the less wimpy. 

The ginger salad was great. Loved the crispy fried tofu and peanuts. The dressing was well balanced, spice level 3 was perfect for me, as I prefer my mouth NOT to be on fire. Vegetarians beware though, because the dressing contained fish sauce. 
The avocado salad was small, so either order it as an appetizer or get a side of protein. My one beef with the salads is their use of iceberg lettuce, which in my opinion should never be on a plate. It should be used in lieu of Styrofoam as a box filler. 

Save room for dessert. Nothing fancy here, just simple sticky rice or custard. The black sticky rice pudding was warm, not too sweet and topped with creamy coconut milk. Totally delicious. The Thai custard and sticky rice combo equally awesome, and you get to try two desserts in one dish. The custard is similar to a flan, but less sweet and less sticky, without that caramel layer on top. Loved it. I will definitely be back for more."

I paid for that choice all day. So desired healthy and spicy to sweat it out of my system. Yelp found this place and thanks to you all I gave it a go. 

Super crowded at 7pm. Ate at bar. Green papaya salad, cup tom  yum (if that was a cup I would hate to see the bowl) and drunken noods with shrimp. 
Waiter asked how spicy,  I said 10. For all three.

Two sapporo&#39;s could not quell the heat. Had to order a Thai iced tea which also was huge! 

Very fresh very clean and tasty each bite. A bit hipster but decor was brilliant and welcoming although modern. 

Friendly team oriented wait staff. 

Great for solo eaters, small parties of 4-6 and couples. Highly recommend it!"

We went to the Cherry Creek area to pick up some shoes and randomly chose this Thai restaurant for dinner. I&#39;ve had mostly crappy Thai in the Denver area so I wasn&#39;t expecting much. I ordered my stand by for Thai: Pad kee Mao aka drunken noodles, this time w/ beef. My boyfriend ordered Panang curry with chicken plus some appetizers. Everything was fresh, well prepared and absolutely delicious! Noodles were smokey and scrumptious and the curry had a complex spice pallet without being excessive.

The jasmine tea I had was pretty good. Stash brand so nothing &#34;special&#34;. He loved the hot mango martini and said the flavor mixed shockingly well together.

Fresh spring rolls came out first. Normally I don&#39;t like these much but he ordered them and I actually loved them. (Actually it was one larger roll cut in half.) Not too much rice wrapper or too much Lettuce inside. Leaves of mint and julienned veggies married perfectly with the peanut sauce.

Thai wings were next. It came with 6 for $7 which I thought was a bit high but they were super crispy like I enjoy and the lemongrass and peanuts that accompanied was a nice touch. Sweet chili sauce was on the side so they actually stayed crispy :-) yay!

My noodles were flawless. I&#39;d say the portion size was about 1/3 smaller than I&#39;m used to and I had no leftovers to take home like usual but for the quality of the food I didn&#39;t mind. The Rice noodles were fresh, tender and perfectly cooked. Everything from the vegetables to the noodles had a little bit of smoky browning on the bites just like they&#39;re supposed to. They use egg and tomato and the sauce is a delicate brown sauce with some sweetness and smokey spice. The beef slices were quite thin, mostly tender, lean slices of well cut beef. No gnarly cartilage and fatty bites like at all the other Asian places around serve. My dish was so perfect and scrumptious I actually ordered a second entree of it to take home for lunch the next day. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever done that in my life before.

(Note for the spice lovers: I ordered spice level 3-4 &amp; I could hardly taste any spice. The waitress who helped us said that their spice level SIX was equivalent to a *jalapeño* LOL. So if you want epic spice go for 13+ range. My bf got a 10 and I could eat it but normally I can&#39;t tolerate his epically hot food.) 

My boyfriends panang curry was delicious. The curry sauce was thickened but still soupy and not too sweet or coconut creamy. It had complex but well balanced and delicate curry flavor. The veggies were all nicely prepped and the chicken was thinner and more tender slices than I&#39;ve ever seen in any of the Denver area Thai restaurants.

To top it all off the decor, while simple, was charming. Festive paper umbrellas hung from the ceiling. Not exactly a romantic ambience but clean and brightly adorned. Lastly the service was utterly splendid, (and always has been when we returned). All the staff helped support each other and so that meant if our waitress was busy someone else rushed our drinks out or dropped an app off or refilled our water, ensuring everything was either properly hot or cold and fresh. I was blown away by how cooperative and effective that level of service was!

I&#39;d recommend this Thai restaurant to anyone and it&#39;s authentic as can be found around here or even in San Fran or NYC. Very well run, great food, great attention to detail and reasonably priced. Two drinks, two apps and two entrées for all around $70 after tip! Can&#39;t wait to return!"

My biggest pet peve are Thai resturants that baby the American pallet. I love spicy Thai food ; therefore, when I ask for Thai hot I want Thai hot!  

Our waiter informed the chef that I meant business. However, the dish (Thai basil chicken) was not spicy. I still enjoyed my dish and will return because of the great service and high quality ingredients.

Tips: 
The lunch specials include an appetizer but the entree is one third smaller than the dinner portion. 
The crab ragoons are homemade and are an excellent choice.
The ginger tea is the real deal. I could taste the ginger."

However, bottom line is I was disappointed that it wasn&#39;t authentic enough and the foods were too Americanized and lacked flavor. I do have to say that they really cater to vegetarians as their entire menu is filled with lots of vegetarian options. We started off the night with a thai ice tea which was massive! I really did appreciate the generous serving of tea and they even gave you an option to top it with half and half or almond milk. However, I felt the tea lacked flavor and richness to it. It wasn&#39;t bad though. For appetizer, we ordered the fried tofu. I really liked the presentation of the tofu as they were all perfectly cut into triangles and were perfectly fried and soft on the inside. I wish they served it with a traditional peanut sauce instead of the sour and sweet fish sauce. Or maybe even give both, that would be awesome! 

For the entrees, we ordered pad thai and the green curry both with chicken. The pad thai was delicious but their spice level ranking was misleading. It said American was 0-4 and Thai spicy is 5+. That made me assume 5 would be pretty spicy but it was so mild. If you can handle a medium at an authentic thai restaurant, you should probably go for a 8 or 9 here. The green curry was disappointing as it was not rich and kind of watery. It lacked spices but I did like how soft the chicken was in it. 

Overall, this place could definitely improve in authenticity but I can see why it would appeal to the general American population. Next time I go, I will try the other appetizers and get a higher spice level."

I thought the service was nice and the restaurant was okay. I ordered the appetizer sampler, the Tom Kha soup and the drunken noodles. All together it was a pretty fine experience. I wouldn&#39;t give it a 5 though just considering the other Thai spots I&#39;ve been to. 

Drink service was oddly slow."

Came back around 7 ish and it was quite poppin though the bartender said it was actually a kind of slow night for them. We sat at the bar cuz that&#39;s our thing and ordered the shrimp dumpling appetizer, the green curry level 15 and the small hot and sour soup level 15. Wow this was a lot of food for just two of us and we left quite full and satisfied. The way they describe their spice levels because there is no limit was : 10 is a jalapeño, 20 is a habanero, and 30 is what the Thai girls get. 15 was perfect for me, but they have little pots of dried Thai chili so you can make it spicer at the table if you wish. Although I will say we asked the nice lady behind the bar what her spice level was and she casually said 50. Props to her. That lady made our night! 

The crispy shrimp dumpling were quite delectable, and perfectly bite sized. The green curry was loaded with veggies and really had a good flavor. And the hot and sour soup was also loaded with veggies and had a nice heat plus a great soup flavor. All in all it was a really good Thai experience AND walking distance from our house! That&#39;s pretty sweet! I will say the draft selection was eh but they have some bottles to make up for it."

As vegetarian (dairy ok, no eggs) and someone with Celiac disease, this is one of the few places in the Denver metro area where I KNOW I can eat without getting sick. Most of their items are available gluten free, dairy free, egg free and/or vegan, and their cooks know to avoid cross contamination. Their staff are always incredibly friendly and welcoming, as well as knowledgeable, and their lunch special is a really good deal. Plus, mango sticky rice (GF and vegan!)! And even black forbidden rice pudding (also GF and vegan). They do tend to get super crowded around noon, but come before then, or after 1pm, and there will certainly be seating available.

The servers are very friendly. A woman, who I think might be a manager, comes by during the busy lunch hour to check in with how things are going. 

Lunch is by far the busiest time, in my experience, but they will get you in and out in an hour guaranteed. Lunch specials are about $10 for a dish and a small appetizer--either wontons or an egg roll. I&#39;m 95% positive the lunch and dinner portions are the same, for the noodles at least.

I like getting pad see ewe (street noodles) with tofu. And I LOVE their wonton sauce, it&#39;s more liquid like fish sauce, and not sticky like red chili sauce.

Spice levels are quite confusing. They say &#34;American&#34; hot is 5... There&#39;s barely any at all. An avid Sriracha and spice lover, I get spicy level 20 and that makes me sweat. My friends with normal spice tolerance settle with 10 or so. The restaurant will tell you their spicy level can go up to 500... Weird.

Overall great, but can be greasy. Not my favorite Thai restaurant ever, but definitely my favorite in Denver!

The food is pretty fantastic - I find the portions to be just a smidge on the small side for the prices, but the quality is there so I don&#39;t mind. Also, if you ask to hold a certain veggie in a dish, they will actually ask you if there is another veggie you want to sub instead of just leaving the dish lacking. I can&#39;t even say how many times I&#39;ve asked other places to sub a veggie out with a veggie in a dish &amp; they will charge me extra. It&#39;s always packed, great lightning &amp; atmosphere.

The place is extremely popular, and frequently gets full well before noon.  I have tried the curries, the soups, and the drunken noodles as well.  I also have tasted the egg rolls and crab rangoon. My overall impression is good quality Thai food with an emphasis on extra veggies.  Sometimes I encounter a couple things in the dishes that seem superfluous (like extra eggplant or crunchy green beans), but it all tastes good.  The heat scale here goes from one to 10, and seems less punishingly face-melting than what you might encounter at other places.  I think you need to get a least a four if you want to feel anything.

The prices here are not outrageous, but neither are they especially cheap.  However, it seems like you get good value for your dollar.  Service is generally good, but tends to bog down (not surprisingly) as they approach full capacity.

I have not had occasion to come by later in the afternoon to try happy hour yet.  But, with the 1/2 priced beers and other specials, it is definitely on my to do list."

We ordered the spring rolls and they were mostly iceberg lettuce instead of noodles. Very bland. I also order the cucumber salad and it really was a side salad of more bland iceberg lettuce with cucumbers on top. In my opinion, there really is no excuse for a bad salad. The spring rolls were like a side salad with so much lettuce in them, so I feel like I had half a head of iceberg lettuce before the meal even started.

My son likes his Pad Thai a lot. I did like my curry as well. The service was prompt and friendly. Still, I just can&#39;t get over that bad spring roll. Hence, the two stars."

Everything food wise was absolutely delightful! We started with the sampler platter that was perfect to try the majority of the appetizer options. We then shared the pad Thai and the green curry, both at the spiciest level they had ( I love a meal with some heat), and although I could have done with more spice, the quality and taste of both entrees were really on point. Some of the better Thai food I have had in quite some time! 

Now onto the service. Our waitress was very personable and funny but the service was slow, which I blame more on the restaurant being new more than anything else. 

My only real complaint was the bar and cocktails we ordered. We ordered saki bombs expecting a full thing of saki and a full beer but instead only received a half a cup of beer and a single saki shot. I would have not been upset if we were charged appropriately for the quantity but we were charged 8 dollars for each. Extremely pricey compared to other comparable restaurants. We also ordered a Moscow mule that was watered down and also overpriced. I would recommend sticking to wine or beer with your meal as their cocktail options are not worth it. 

Again I have to reiterate how great the food was but because of the slower service and poor cocktails I have to give this establishment only 3 stars. 

I have no doubt in my mind that a couple months down the road, when the establishment has more experience and better organizes the full dining experience they will be a 5 star establishment! 

Even though I have some minor complaints I would still recommend anyone to dine at this restaurant purely based on the yumminess of the food!"

Easy off street parking in a newer shopping center.

Service was great. Our server was patient while we looked through the menu; I was unnecessarily indecisive and they have a lot of great options. He told us not to worry, &#34;they are called Thai Pot Cafe not Thai Pot Express.&#34;  The restaurant has a nice mix of tables and booths, as well as bar seating with a few nice sized tvs that can be seen throughout the restaurant. They would be able to accommodate large parties easily. 

The menu clearly notes what is dairy free, gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian, AND notes what items can be made to these preferences upon request. 

We ordered (all vegan) a tofu spring roll, tofu pineapple curry (6), and Tom ka with tofu (5). Enjoyed all of it and would order again! The 5&amp;6 spice levels were not too spicy, but they bring out spices for you to add, so we were able to get the right heat. I would suggest you start with at least a 7, if you like your food spicy. Portion sizes were nice, not huge, but still enough to take a little home with you. We didn&#39;t get dessert, but they had more options than you normally see on an Asian menu and 2 which were vegan. 

My only complaint is that they use polystyrene to go containers :/ and they use paper napkins opposed to cloth. The napkins were cheap feeling and kind of changed the experience and the to-go containers left the meal on a less than positive note (there are so many other great options, why use those!!!)."

The first time I ate here I was alone for lunch so couldn&#39;t try too many things. I had the Ginger Salad (Choice of Chicken, Beef, Pork or Tofu chopped and mixed with fresh ginger, red onion, green onion, roasted peanuts, cilantro and sweet lime dressing on a bed of lettuce with broccoli, carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes. GF $10.50) with chicken and a side of rice.  The salad was extremely flavorful and satisfying and I thought that maybe I&#39;d found a great place to eat Thai food around here.  Went back with The Hubs a month or so later for lunch.  I think we had Spring Rolls, Tom Yum Soup, Thai Pot Special and Pad Thai.  While the food came out piping hot and was well-presented, it was essentially flavorless.  The spring rolls were mostly lettuce.  The soup had almost zero flavor (HOW do you do that??).  The Thai Pot special was OK, but a tiny portion for the price.  The Pad Thai had way too much sauce and was too sweet.  Bummer.  The restaurant was very busy both times I went, so someone likes the food.

The restaurant itself is very nice with a modern, upscale look.  Service was OK, but we did wait a long time for our food to come out and it took a while for our drinks to be refilled.  They were busy, but still..."

Our service started off really strong. The girl informed us of their spice scale, which ranges from 0-100! 0-5 is basically zero spice. 
We started off with the Thai chicken wings which were AMAZING. Best part of the meal. They came out so incredibly fresh and hot.
Then, This white girl got the pad Thai at an eight and it was perfectly spicy. The sauce had a nice sweetness to it. It was some decent pad Thai.
The boyfriend tried the Panang Curry at an 8 level spice also. We loved the consistency of the broth and the coconut flavor was perfect. Chicken was alright. I would omit the carrots from the dish personally.
Lastly, we finished with the Thai custard and sticky rice. I really enjoyed the two together, not so much the custard on its own. It&#39;s a unique consistency. 
The only downside was that our service really lacked towards the end. Our waitress was a little more focused on doing her sidework. I waited for almost 5 minutes for a refill while she rolled silverware): but would definitely still come back!"

Overall the veggies were fresh and meat was tender. Ok sized portions (most entrees were $11-13). We ordered carryout on a Sunday night.

The first time my man friend and I tried it, we got a green curry and a pad thai for take-out.  Firstly, I want to mention that their spice scale is fairly incomprehensible.  We were told different things on the two occasions that we called and if you peruse the other reviews, you will see that the spice scale varies.  We were told that it was on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being a jalapeno, which obviously does not make much sense.  We were also later told 1-10 with 1-5 being typical hot and 6-10 being Thai hot.  Some reviewers were told 1-100.  Clearly, with such an erratic and variable spice scale, it&#39;s hard to gauge what you want and what you&#39;re going to get.  Perplexed, we aired on the safe side and ordered at a spice level of four.
The pad thai was average, unoffensive, unremarkable.  The green curry was watery and flavorless.  It was borderline inedible and probably the worst out of the probably fifty or more green curries I have had over the years.

After this performance, I was very hesitant to try Thai Pot again.  But it&#39;s very close to where I live, we had a hankering for Thai, and I wanted to believe that maybe we just hit them on an off day.  This time we decided to try the Panang curry and drunken noodles, again for carry-out.  The curry was again on the watery side, but had a pleasant enough flavor.  The drunken noodles were pretty tasty.  With all of the dishes we tried, there were some interesting, non-traditional vegetables thrown into the mix (ie. mushrooms, tomatoes, and eggplant in the drunken noodles).  I take no issue with this as I kind of appreciated the extra veggies and they paired just fine, but some traditionalists might be put off.  Also, all of the dishes we tried ran at about $11.50 apiece.  Not exorbitant, but a couple dollars more expensive than is typical.  And for the price, I will say that the serving sizes are quite small.  The curries were about appropriate, but both noodle dishes were notably skimpy.

TLDR - A little pricier than usual for Thai food, smallish serving sizes and disappointing to passable food.  There are better Thai options to be had."

We were seated by a hostess, who wasn&#39;t very cordial but whatever. However, she sat us at a two top and that&#39;s normal but to be honest, I had a tiring day at work and I just wanted to relax and spread out a little. My husband asked if we could be moved to a booth for more space and she rolled her eyes and signed heavily saying, &#34;we are seating the tables by the numbers.&#34; I would be more understanding if the place was busy, but there were only 4 or 5 tables filled. So we decided that instead of being uncomfortable at a very small table we would go elsewhere. So we went to Silvi&#39;s down Colorado Blvd and we were seated where we liked and had a very nice experience!

People who work at restaurants should approach their patrons like they all 1) have a backbone and 2) work, or have worked, in the service industry and know that crap is ridiculous."

We came with a group of four. They were busy but it took maybe 5 mins to sit us down. The customers service was great. My food was warm... Not hot, which makes me think they finished mine first and let it sit while the rest of my parties was done cooking.
The Thai iced tea, also nothing special. 
I would go back if i was in the area and hungry... But I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat there."

The atmosphere is also really nice. All of the servers are very attentive and enthusiastic about the food they serve.

I got the Pad Khing, a ginger dish with perfectly cooked vegetables, crunchy, not mushy. You select your spice level so this being my 1st time, I selected level 4 which turned out to be just right although I&#39;ll probably try a level 5 next time. The Thai Iced Tea was also good but if you like your Thai Tea sweet, you&#39;ll be slightly disappointed.
Finally, the service is good provided you&#39;re not expecting sit-down fast-food quickness.

My favorite here is the pad see ewe pan fried noodles, which ever good Thai restaurant should have. 

The best thing about this place is their spice scale that goes from 1-50! I hate when you go to a Thai restaurant and get their Thai hot and its not spicy at all. I like spicy food and I&#39;ve ventured to 15 which gave me good sweat during the meal and it was delicious! I am not so fond of the curry or stir fried but that may be subjective."

My last review said the place was crowded. It was crowded on my second visit as well....and I don&#39;t think they can handle that kind of crowd. I previously said &#34;Damned good food.&#34; This time the food was so-so. Not bad, but very far from great. 

Here is the main point: I found a piece of cotton string about 18 inches long in with my noodles. It took quite a while to get the attention of any wait personnel. When one did come, I indicated the dish and said, &#34;send this back to the kitchen.&#34; He took the string and disappeared. The noodle dish sat there. After that he avoided my gaze and didn&#39;t reappear until I made a bit of a fuss. From there on in I was treated as if I were some kind of annoyance. The manager appeared and was a bit chilly in her apology. I got a fresh dish of noodles, but the evening was definitely ruined in spirit. AND....a classier joint would have comped the whole meal. This place took the price of the entree off my check. OK, better than nothing.

There are better Thai places in the area. This place thinks the big crowd is automatic and the staff no longer has to try hard....or even be cordial."

My boyfriend and I love everyone there and we understand that its difficult to train new employees, but we&#39;ve had our order done wrong 3 times in the last month. Mostly over the phone orders. Once we ordered carry out and my boyfriend is allergic to shrimp and it wasnt until we got home did we discover our dumplings were shrimp and not pork. Never had that problem before and have been coming here for a year since we moved. 

Again, great thai food when the order is correct. So much turn-over though. Familiar voice and face go a long way. Also, talking bad about other employees so loudly that I can hear you at the bar is just poor taste.

Great thai food, but please pick up your service a bit. We stay loyal because you cant beat the food, but the rudeness and unprofessional behavior will cause you to lose other business."

The Pad Thai was insanely sweet-I felt like I was eating noodles with sugar lol. The fried rice was decent. Overall, just an average, Americanized Thai restaurant.

Thai Pot has been an old favorite of mine in the neighborhood.  The original place as a &#34;hole in the wall&#34; Thai spot.  I recently was craving some Thai and looked all over for it, decided to Yelp the phone number... turns out the moved a month ago.  

The new location is in the hip new strip mall with Yogurtland 2 blocks north of the old location.  It&#39;s 3 times larger, the interior is spacious, contemporary decor, and well-staffed with very friendly, eager service.  A definitely improvement which is why it is PACKED at lunch.  

The best part is... the recipes are the same!  Yay.  My all time menu favorite is Pad Woon Sen (clear rice noddle).  I ordered a 6 out of 7 for spice... and I have to say... 6 is pretty weak.  I&#39;ll have to ask for a 10 out of 7 next time, my &#34;Thai-ger blood&#34; requires more heat.

Will be back soon."

My sister and I came in before the dinner crowd on a snowy and cold night. There were open tables for 2 and 4 people. We were greeted by the hostess in a horrible way. She said they were expecting a busy dinner crowd and made us feel like we didn&#39;t matter. Our only options were a 2-top table right by the door or seats at the bar. There were two 4-top booths open in the back of the restaurant by the door. Since we weren&#39;t there to have drinks, we didn&#39;t want to sit at the bar. So our only other option was to sit by the door. The waiter greeted us when we sat down. My sister asked how he was and he replied, &#34;Oh, you know, just working....&#34; Which made him come off as though he hated his job and didn&#39;t want to be there. After ordering an appetizer, a table opened up away from the door and I asked the server if we could move tables and he flat out said no because they were expecting a busy dinner crowd. When he said no, he was smiling at the same time, so I thought he was joking. I asked him if he was serious and he said, &#34;Yes I&#39;m serious, you can&#39;t move because we need to keep that table available for other people.&#34; As soon as he said that some people walked in and were seated where we wanted to move to. The waiter looked at me and said, &#34;SEE?&#34; Pretty much rubbing it in my face (how rude). I asked to speak to the manager and she said we weren&#39;t able to move and that night was a special circumstance because they had a small dinner party for a wedding (though the table we wanted to move to was not reserved by the wedding party). I told the manager I did not like the way we were greeted at the door or the way the waiter talked to me and that you don&#39;t say no to customers or else you lose their business. She didn&#39;t seem to care AT ALL. She didn&#39;t even offer any means to show that she cared for our business. From my experience (and others&#39; I&#39;m sure of), if restaurants aren&#39;t able to accommodate for needs or requests, they show they care and offer something on the house. NOPE! This manager was careless, rude, and clearly inexperienced. Overall, we felt like we didn&#39;t matter. 

On to the food, we ordered the crab ragoons appetizer. There was hardly any filling in the ragoons. My sister ordered the Tom Kha soup. She stated that it was alright, but nothing special or amazing. I had the Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) and it was mediocre. Again, nothing special or amazing. Also, there were hardly any noodles in the dish. As for spice range, I said medium. I don&#39;t know what that comes out to number wise on their scale, but mine was more of a mild heat.

The size of the restaurant is small. They need to rearrange their setting and better utilize their space. Having an actual host stand might help (put it by the door instead of having a 2-top table there because no one will want to sit there when it is cold out)

This is the worst service I have ever experienced. From hostess, to waiter, to manager, I am completely disappointed."

If you go be prepared to sit and wait and wait and wait only to have your meal arrive wrong. A girlfriend and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night and we were sat and waited probably 15 minutes before we were greeted and given with water, we then waited for our glasses wine for quite a long time (convinced the waiter forgot about them until we asked about them) then finished our glasses of wine and would have loved to order another but our waiter never came! Finally our food came and it was wrong (one dish included beef for avid vegetarians) and one came with rice when we asked for noodles. We waited again for our food with empty wine (and water!) glasses. 

I mentioned the poor service to a front of house manager and he told me to email someone and there was nothing he would/could do. Nothing on our bill was comped. 

If you go, be prepared to wait forever for your food (with no beverages) and then have it be wrong upon arrival."

For example. The spring roll that costs $2.95 will get you one roll about the size of your fist. It&#39;s filled with cabbage, sprouts, etc and literally ONE shrimp that is sliced into two halves. Elsewhere you can get two rolls with 3-4 shrimp for the same price.

The entree I ordered was also similar. The food is good but the portion size probably only as big as half of a Pei Wei lunch entree. It&#39;s padded with a large layer of diced cabbage and cucumber slices adorned the rest of the plate to make it look bigger than it was. 

In all somewhat disappointing to pay $20 bucks for a meal that shouldn&#39;t have cost more than $12-13 at other Thai restaurants in the city. Moreover you&#39;d probably also get 2x more food for the price.

I&#39;m also friggan Chinese so it&#39;s not like my expectations are unrealistic about American portion sizes. Just saying you get much more food for the money at other restaurants."

My last visit was a disaster, not service-wise, but food-wise. I had tears in my eyes when I got my order of red curry. The curry sauce had a watery consistency, and it completely lacked ANY flavor. Thai food is flavorful, fragrant and balanced. It is quite unfortunate that more and more Thai places  change the dishes to better suit general American palate and I guess, to save on more expensive ingredients. I kept playing with different spice combinations and pretty much gave up on turning it into anything descent.  A friend in my company lived in Asia for a while. He said the food was completely Americanized, and the management was cutting corners. I agreed with him as even I could tell that this was not authentic Thai. All three of us were quite let down.

My friend used to work here and she said that the cook is actually Thai, however it seems that the menu and cooking cater to the American palette. One of my go-to items in a thai place is the Drunken noodle simply because it&#39;s my fave. The tofu was nice and crispy which I loved, however I am not sure if the noodles were fresh. Choppy small pieces of noodles don&#39;t scream fresh to me. There were a couple orders of Thai basil or pad kra prow at my table, and it was oddly served without much thai basil. It tasted fine, but it certainly wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d have again. 

It&#39;s a nice establishment with good service but like everywhere else in Denver, mediocre food. Probably won&#39;t go out of my way to go there but would if I was conveniently in the same area."

Damascus is a small Syrian (like Lebanese) restaurant in Littleton. 
 
On our trips we&#39;ve had chicken and lamb shawarma, lamb kibbeh, moussaka, and spinach and beef pies in various combinations. All have been excellent. Particularly amazing is the munazadala, a dish of eggplant stuffed with lamb, rice, onion, and pine nuts and stewed together.

The hummus, baba ganoush, and pita bread are all homemade and are delicious. You&#39;ll be tempted to fill up on them, but save room for the main dishes!

I will definitely get a grape leaves side next time, one wasn&#39;t enough. The pita bread is fresh baked and soft and warm. I&#39;m salivating writing this review, these guys have me hooked.

Go get some food here!"

You walk in and are transported in time to Damascus.  I&#39;ve never been to Damascus, but they try to make this place exude some cultural feel, and it works.  It&#39;s a mom n pop place, and that makes you feel good dining here too.  Muhanet and, I believe, his wife served us, and they were wonderful

The pita and hummus are delicious, and we ordered the veggie and meat platter.  They were great.  We&#39;ll come back with friends."

Hands down the best place to eat in Littleton. When I have a hankering for fallafel or a veggie dinner, this is my go to place. Everyone should try Damascus at least once. What I love about this restaurant the most is the unhurried atmosphere of dining in. It is not fast food and that is a good thing. In a fast paced world, you actually have the chance to sit and talk to your date...in this case my wife.

If you are in a hurry, take out is just as delicious as dining in. The pita (which is absolutely amazing) will still be hot by the time you make it home. Continued wishes of success!"

I have eaten there many times and the quality of the food always kept me coming back. That being said, I had a hugely unprofessional experience on 7/3 and doubt I will be coming back. 

I had some family in town for the 4th of July weekend and we were going to take out from Damascus Grill. My wife calls at appx. 6 pm to make sure they are open and what their hours are. We are told 10 pm. Since we had gone earlier that same week and found them closed at 8:15, I hopped on their website to verify that information. http://damascusgrill.com/home.php On the bottom of the page you can see &#34;Working Hours Sunday-Saturday 11am-9pm.&#34; Ok, cool, I thought, we will order around 8pm.

I call at 8:15, no answer. 8:20, no answer. 8:25, no answer. So on and so forth until 8:40. 

Since we live only a few minutes away I figured I would just drive by, they were probably just busy and couldn&#39;t get to the phones. I show up at 8:43, head inside the restaurant, and the place is closing down. There is a gentleman sitting at 1 of the tables sipping tea, but other than that empty. I end up speaking to a younger gentleman, and then a middle-aged man from the kitchen trying to find out what the heck is going on. We called and verified their hours. Even the website says they are open until 9. And my family and I have made plans to eat there for dinner and are left without many options at that time of day. 

Not sure what the heck was going on to make them close so much earlier than their published hours, but being put in that situation sucks. A customer showing up during normal operating hours should never have that experience. The 3 gentlemen barely seemed to register that there was an issue with service such as this. So if there is a manager that reads this, what was going on? Within a 2 week period this was the 2nd time that the restaurant closed up early. I make no assumptions about any religious observances that may or may not have been going on (Ramadan was from the 5th of June - 5th of July), but when you advertise that you are open until a certain time a customer should be able to count on that basic service agreement. Where is the accountability for putting a repeat customer in such a predicament?

Very awkward situation for a customer to be in- terrible service. While I have a feeling from all of my previous visits that this situation is just an anomaly, 1 extremely negative experience such as this can ruin your impression of a place."

Nothing can be more authentic than being served by actual Turkish staff. They own the place so the care and service you will experience here is above your usual.

We lucked out when we dined here for dinner. Only a few customers were happily hunched over enjoying their meal. In a few minutes the crowd grew, a short line started forming and then we realized it is actually, really and truly busy. Sitting there and observing the flow of people while admiring their colorful decor I can&#39;t help but notice that regulars frequent this place. People that appreciate good, down to earth authentic food.

To start off we had some pita bread and hummus. You won&#39;t believe the incredibly tasty and fresh hummus they serve here. Perfect consistency. Pasty but gritty at the same time. 

I&#39;m a lamb fan. If you ask me for a choice I&#39;ll always gravitate towards it. So-I saw their lamb chops entree with saffron rice and a side of salad and you betcha- I wanted that! 

Best choice ever! The lamb was tender and saturated with so much flavor.  Grilled with that burnt edges on it.  Big portion for big appetite. 

Very polite service with the sweetest and most attentive staff ever. I am a fan without a doubt and with this I say I will for sure be back!"

My wife and I ate there before a movie at the Alamo, and we didn&#39;t feel like a typical Sunday Brunch, so we decided to head out to Damascus. It is a nice quaint place and the server was very friendly. 

I started with a lentil soup which was delicious, and we snacked on fresh pita and hummus. I ordered the combination platter (kebabs, shawarma) and my wife had the Vegetarian plate with falafel, hummus, and babaganouj. The servings were huge and they were incredibly delicious! And since I have the bad habit of stalking other customers&#39; food, I noticed the gyro sandwiches looked delicious and again, they were huge! 

No alcohol is served, which is a good thing in my opinion, since a lot of families eat there on a Sunday, and you want to make sure you savor the food without loading up on booze. 

My next trip I will try the baked lamb, which seems to be their specialty."

We go to sleep scanning netflix titles. Grow bored of our thousands of Dish channels. Struggle to find the perfect strawberry jam or jelly among the multitudes of promising but inscrutable jars at the supermarket. Go glassy eyed in the wine depot and thumb-numb scrolling Yelp reviews.

If you have come this far, chooser, congrats! You can stop trying to decide where to eat and go here. Immediately.

See, Damascus is so good it eliminates choice for anything but reasons of variety. The food is so perfect the tables next to you are moaning, the atmosphere is warm and friendly, the menu has combo plates that are perfect for two. Sub tabbouleh for rice for a low carb meal? Ask for a second plate of warm and delicious pita because carbs are tasty and dammit you deserve it? Perfectly cooked meats and skewers for friends or family that might find hummus a little too adventuresome and need tamer fare? A menu that is reasonably priced and generously served? Damascus is the opposite of suck.

Wow!  What a great lunch we had!  We each ordered the Greek Salad with Shrimp, and shared an order of Grape Leaves with Meat and an order of Baba Ghanouj.  We also both had the Iced Mint Tea.  This  turned out to be quite the feast for two people (but we managed, somehow)!

Everything was absolutely delicious!  The salad was nicely dressed with olive oil, lemon juice (I think) and herbs, and had a nice amount of feta, olives, and a few pickles.  The shrimp were nicely seasoned and perfectly grilled, and most surprising was the fact that there were six of them (and these are the larger size, maybe about 20-count size).  Both the grape leaves and baba ghanouj were different than what I&#39;ve had in the past.  They were both delicious, just different.  The meat in the grape leaves was seasoned with cumin and that flavor came through pretty strongly - again in a good way, but we like cumin.  The baba ghanouj was very different, as well.  The menu describes it as a &#39;puree of baked eggplant, sesame sauce, chopped walnuts, lemon juice, pomegranate sauce, garlic, and olive oil; served with pita&#39;.  It&#39;s a thicker version of baba ghanouj than I&#39;ve had in the past, but again, it was delicious (and very filling).  I have two words for the iced mint tea - delicious and addictive.

Our server was friendly and our food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The restaurant is small, but cutely decorated.  My only critique is the plastic over the tablecloths (hate that!).

If this restaurant was closer to home, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be a regular here.  I noticed on their web site that there&#39;s a location on Colorado Blvd that is closer to me and I will definitely be hitting that one up soon."

The Littleton area is the restaurant&#39;s current location after residing at three others.  The restaurant chef makes all of their dishes from scratch, including their delicious pita bread. We stumbled upon this place exploring the neighborhoods of Denver, and without hesitation I&#39;m really glad we discovered such a gem.  The restaurant&#39;s interior is simple with touches of middle eastern culture throughout, especially the ceiling covered with colorful blankets.  The interior furniture is a bit outdated, but that doesn&#39;t deduct from the flavors I experienced.

The staff is genuinely appreciative and attentive, from the beginning to the end.  A family owned establishment usually results in such service.  We ordered one entree and a wrap.  The entree included Hommos, puree of chickpeas, sesame sauce, lemon juice, garlic and olive oil, served with pita; one of the best you will ever have.  The waiter brought over two portions of the Hommos and realized that it was one too many.  Instead of taking it away, he simply shrugged and told us to enjoy it.  His error was a total win for me, as it was delicious and irresistible.  The Lamb &amp; Beef Shawarma with its meat broiled on a rotisserie then thinly sliced and garnished with tahini sauce, pickles and parsley, was equally outstanding.  The meat being tender and flavorful was a treat to remember.  The Lamb Chops atop saffron rice were exceptionally tender and dynamic in flavor.  The complexity of flavors excited my palate, as the fresh meats, vegetables and spices compliment.

This authentic jewel is a great addition to Denver&#39;s American saturated cuisine."

Because of this I assumed Littleton was full of weird mountain people and maybe a Qdoba which seems to be a popular place to eat garbage chain Mexican food. But it was 7 and we were hungry after our long drive and my bf was like lets eat in Littleton. 

I figured I was going to have to eat some terrible asian food but then he used the Internet and right across the street was the Damascus Grill.

Besides Taco Bell, the Damascus Grill is the only restaurant I am looking forward to going back to in Denver. We were pretty pumped on eating so we started with Baba Ghanoush which was super awesome. It had some sort of nuts, maybe walnuts? Puréed in it and it was the best baba Ghanoush. At the same time even more excitement happened because we got some totally perfect creamy hummus that is included when you order entrees. ALSO we got cheese canoes which I believe are called cheese pies, but it is a canoe shaped pastry and the center is a cheese, egg? and herb mixture and it was so great. 

I could have stopped eating at that point, but I still managed to eat half my chicken kefta and rice. It was a huge portion. I gave my bf some of my chicken and still had more left for lunch the next day. 

My BF had Syrian sausage which he enjoyed but I did not try because I only eat Italian sausage. There were many vegetarian options as well so maybe my one friend will go with me sometime and I will eat falafel but I also want to eat all the chicken dishes plus spinach pie. I hope I get to go back here when issue #4 of Sabrina comes out. 

The Damascus Grill also has a Colorado Blvd location but Colorado Blvd is too depressing of a place to enjoy chicken. Oh most important part is that the pita us homemade and delicious.

If you have any questions about chicken, please do not hesitate to ask me. Bye."

Have you savored a meal for hours after eating because your taste buds were singing the praises of how delicious  the food was for that long? If you haven&#39;t  experienced  this kind of food then you need to hurry down to Damascus Grill and get yourself an order of baked lamb. Whatever you do don&#39;t take it to go. Sit and have a cup of mint tea and maybe a little Baba Ganoush.

I went here a month ago with two other friends. We had the mint tea. 2 appetizers  (3 if you count Bobba Ghanoush)and 3 entries. My food was heavenly and purchased at the advice of our waitor. I got the mushroom  appetizer, baba Ghanoush, and Bake Lamb. These three dishes could not have tasted better. The lamb melted in your mouth, Baba Ghanoush&#39;s medley of flavors were balance by eggplant puree, and mushrooms were big and could have passed for a meat substitute (if I ever go vegan that will be my go to food). 

However one of my friends  was not so lucky. He order chicken shawarma. It was good but no where level of the lamb dishes. If you have to order chicken please order the chicken kabob. If you aren&#39;t  sure what to order get the meat combo it has let bit every meat. It goes without saying that place of this calobre has a vegetarian section.

I&#39;m always amazed when a server anticipates my needs and delivers. 

This was our first visit to this wonderful restaurant where the service was amazing and polite and every item we ordered was beyond delicious. The hummus was the smoothest, best tasting we&#39;ve ever had. The fresh baked and served hot pita was, again, the best tasting we&#39;ve ever had. The gyro sandwich was generously sized and excellent. Seasonings of all our dishes were perfect. The server added the honey to the baclava just before serving which allowed us to enjoy so much better the flavors of this treat. 

We will definitely return the next time we&#39;re in the area and craving Middle Eastern food."

Finally authentic Lebanese.  The pita bread is amazing, hummus and baba ganoush are absolute perfection.  I have been here at least ten times and it is a gem.

We had the chicken and lamb shawarma and the Greek gryro.  Both were huge and good, although I preferred the gryro. We got two sides of fries, definitely too many fries, you probably only need one side for two people, the fries were good.  The kids had gyro meat and pita bread (not on the menu) but they made it happen and the kids loved it.  Will definitely be back and thanks Yelp!  Rating should be 4 and 1/2!"

We had once had dinner at their branch in englewood and had liked the food. ( looks like the engle wood branch is now closed) we went there on a Saturday and the door was locked)
There was one single person managing the entire place. He was the one taking orders both at the table and for takeouts. He was the one getting food to the tables. This one man setup was ridiculous. It took him real long to come to our table and take the orders. We also had to wait real long to get the food on our table. I am not sure if the service is this bad out there every day. 
We were really not happy with the service so we tipped lesser than usual. What a surprise when bank posted the transaction. The tip amount had been doubled !  

The food is good. hummus, baba ganoush, pita and eggplant moussaka tasted very good, but I am not sure if am going to be back. Not ready to wait for another 45 minutes to have food on the table.

Definitely start with the mushrooms. If you are smart you will save a few to dip into your blissful hummus. Of course you will need to order extra fresh made pita bread to finish the hummus off. 
Choices for a main course are varied and delicious. If you&#39;re a meat lover, the meat platter with saffron rice is great. The grilled shrimp also get a vote. My kids favorite  is the gyro plate (extra pita, please). 
Vegetarian? No problem. Try the falafel. It&#39;s great. 
In a hurry, call ahead and ask for a gyro to go. Can&#39;t fail. 
Did I mention the mixed fruit drinks or hot mint tea? Mmmmm. Tea and baklava. Now there is a dessert to melt in your mouth. I could go on, or you could just check it out and enjoy the great food!"

We liked just about everything about Damascus Grill -- from the food, to the service, to the ambiance. My partner and I split two appetizers, the Falafel and Baba Ghanouj, and then split the #1 Meat Combo plate. The Falafel was pretty good, especially when dipped in the Tahini sauce, the Baba Ghanouj, or the Hommos. It&#39;s safe to say that the Baba Gahnouj is &#34;too die for.&#34; I&#39;d consider it the winner of the whole dining experience -- garlicky and full of flavors I can&#39;t even describe (according to the menu: eggplant, sesame sauce, walnuts, lemon juice, pomegranate sauce, and olive oil). I&#39;m pretty sure I dipped just about everything on my plate into it at some point.

The Hommos was very good, too, as well as the meats on the meat plate. I&#39;m not much of a fan of lamb, but even I&#39;d admit that lamb and Kafta (lamb, beef) kabobs had nice flavor. The chicken kabobs had an exotic, citrus-y taste. There were only two things I wasn&#39;t crazy about: the Shawarmas (which was pretty dry and flavorless) and the pita bread (which were really flour tortillas).

The service was good. We had two waiters, who were attentive, but didn&#39;t hover. I enjoyed their quiet, serious, not-in-your-face demeanor. 

The restaurant is tiny, and you, at times, feel like you&#39;re on display to the other diners, but I liked the decor, especially the striped cloth across the ceiling."

The flavors were nice but there was just something a little bit off. The hummus and eggplant were very flavorful but the texture was weird, too creamy and a little too sweet. The lamb kebab was spiced well but again the texture was weird and a little dry. The best dish was the lamb shank, but that&#39;s my favorite anyway. It came with a cheap salad and a plate of hummus. The saffron rice was good but missing that buttery texture."

It was around 14.00 for my order of Syrian Sausage. I got a decent sized coil of sausage and it was pretty yummy (if a little dry) some salad and a huge (I mean HUGE) heap of rice. 

My husband got the lamb and beef shwarma. I liked his more than mine and was stealing bites constantly throughout the meal. Poor guy had a headache and was sufficiently distracted. It was so easy to steal bites right from beneath his nose. Muahahahaa....

Anyways;

The hummus that came with the meal was the highlight for me. Paprika, olive oil... sooo yummy. 

Service was great until the end when it took a while to get the check but to be fair, the place filled up after we arrived and there was only one guy waiting on everyone. 

Interior was cozy and I loved the fabric on the ceiling. Middle eastern music was playing in the background and it was soothing and super nice to eat to.

I dunno, it really was A-OK but I can get about the same or better for less money.  We got two entrees, no appetizer and water to drink for a little over 30.00 before tip. 

I will be back for the sandwiches I saw some other guys order. They were huge and the guys raved about them. Probably won&#39;t come back for the other stuff though."

In the future I would share an entree instead of ordering our own, or order off the extensive list of appetizers as others seem to have done. The service was extremely friendly and polite, yet discreet. The guys serving the customers seemed to place an emphasis on letting people talk.... perfect on a cold rainy night.

First time to this restaurant for me and my girlfriend. First impression was not good. Very bright lighting and the place looks very run down, not kept up very well. Like the place hasn&#39;t seen new flooring or some paint in 30 years. But hey, that&#39;s okay. Looks can be deceiving. Although, honestly, I was a little concerned about what their kitchen must look like. We are greeted and seated. Table was a little sticky. Again with the harsh light overhead. Five minutes goes by and no one has acknowledged us. Another few minutes goes by and finally someone comes out from the back. But he drops off a to-go order to the next table and turns around and goes back the way he came without even looking at our table. That did it for me. At that point I no longer cared how good their food might be, I was not going to give them my money and time. They weren&#39;t even busy. We left and went to an Indian restaurant that we like."

Coz the last time we were here with my parents were when my parents were in town, June 2010.  Was here with Hubs and my parents Saturday May 14th 2011 evening.  Time its like about 18:00 ish, their peak period dinner hour.  I should have done a reservation, but boy am I glad we could find a place for the 4 of us.  This place is indeed jam packed with other patrons.

So, we can understand, the slight wait, for the service, and the food etc etc.  Above anything else, all went well.  My parents still like the food they order, and that goes the same as us, aka Hubs and I.  Though I think this time around, since Hubs order a different thing from the menu, he was slightly disappointed with his order.

My mum and I ordered the Lamb Shanks, my Dad opt for French Fries and Falafel, while Hubs opt for Meat Combo.  I also ordered the Grilled Mushrooms.  Our order came with the Pita breads and the Hummus.

All in all a good experience dining here.

Since I was stuffed that evening, I ordered a dessert named Nammura to go.  As for the Nammura, though I cant deny its so sweet, I took my time to eat them NOT all at once, bit by bit, cutting into small squares.  Heat it up in the micorwave for 15 seconds, for the yummy dessert goodness.  This Nammura reminds me, of a dessert I used to eat way back that time in Singapore named Kuih Bingka."

At then end, I give the overall food 3.5 stars but the top notch service deserves 4 stars!

Let&#39;s see, the hummus sure didn&#39;t disappoint. The pita though, I thought resembled tortilla too much. But my boyfriend swore they were really good when fresh hot out of the kitchen (by the time I return from washing my hands, they were already cool). It could be because he was too hungry!

The highlight of the meal was the Grilled Mushroom, I could eat these all day long! The server told us she loves this dish too because they don&#39;t taste like Mushroom. Uh, well, they tasted like mushroom, but were so tender and juice with a perfect amount of oil and fragrance from whatever herb/spice that was put on it.

Our server (we thought - and later confirmed - she was the owner&#39;s daughter) was such a darling and let us substitute the Hummus and Pita in our main entrees with the Cheese pie and Spinach pie. They were both pretty good.

So far, everything leading up to the main course had been good, so the high expectation kind of ruined it. The entrees (Seafood combo and Meat combo) just weren&#39;t as good as the starters. The only thing I thoroughly enjoyed was the Shrimp Kebab from the Seafood combo platter. It was perfectly grilled and charred. The scallops were undercooked and tasteless, but hey, scallops are tricky, I know that! The fish was okay.

The meat combo was disappointing. We told her we didn&#39;t like lamb but they substituted it with some very questionable meat that smelled a lot like lamb! The rest of the meat were dry and chewy, even the shwarma, which was supposed to be ground, very tender meat. I&#39;ve had better somewhere else.

Dessert time! The Baklava didn&#39;t come off as impressive. Less impressive was the fact that they only offered one kind of Baklava.

I&#39;m curious to try their other location, we were told they serve lunch buffets there! When we were ready to dry away, the server girl rushed out with my planner book in hand, that I had forgotten and left on the chair, bless her heart!"

Ok. Everything I&#39;ve had from this restaurant has been delicious. The pita is still fantastic, although not quite as delicious as it was a few years ago. But you can not go wrong with a grilled meat entree (comes with rice and hummus). There&#39;s enough to share OR to pack as leftovers for dinner/lunch the next day! 

The baba gannoush gets a special shout out b/c I love eggplant and this dip is better than other places&#39; baba gannoush. It&#39;s a bit smokey, a bit sweet, and a lot of eggplant-y deliciousness."

While the food and the service are great, the restaurant&#39;s building could use some work. The entrance opens right into the dining room, so it&#39;s often drafty. The dining room is pretty crowded, as there are a lot of tables crammed into a small space. The decor is hand-painted and artsy, which some might find charming and others might find cheap. The exterior is a shocking shade of aqua. Overall, it looks like the owners are not prepared to spend much money on the building&#39;s appearance and function. That is easily forgiven, though, because the food is good for the price."

So my wife and son and I headed up to Littleton Blvd. from Highlands Ranch on a chilly day and popped in for lunch.

Since the grilled mushroom skewers appetizer was recommended on the menu, we decided to give &#39;em a try - boy, were they delicious! Tender but firm, brushed with some very fine spices, big and plump.

My son had the shawarma platter and my wife had the falafel plate, and both said it was wonderful and filling. I had Vegetarian Sampler #3, because the selection looked great to a non-vegetarian. The sampler featured mousaka, falafel patties, zucchini mutabal, a nice garlic hummus, rice, dolmas, green salad and pita bread, and everything was excellent, and more food than I could finish.

The atmosphere is a bit contrived - Syrian-style decorations, big photos of Damascus and the surrounding countryside are pleasant, but combined with plastic tablecloths seems a bit hodge-podge. I am not an expert in Middle Eastern music, but found the piped-in audio to be quite pleasant. It&#39;s a bit too dark, but a Westword review on the wall says it used to be way too bright, so dark is probably better. Don&#39;t forget your spectacles if you wear them or you&#39;ll be taking the menu outside to read it.

I found the food here to be as good as any other Middle Eastern restaurant I&#39;ve been to in Denver, and so have rated this establishment 5 stars."

It will make the rest seem kind of blah.

The service is good.  The gentleman that is always in the dining room when we go is such a nice person and is helpful if you have questions.  When we told him we were sharing our food, he took the plates back quickly and split our sandwiches in half and put one half of each sandwich on both plates.  How nice!

The baba ganoush is the best I&#39;ve had in any city anywhere.  It&#39;s so rich and delicious with nutty flavor and interesting texture (ultra smooth base with very small chunks - sesame seeds possibly).  Pita is always served warm and it&#39;s large so we don&#39;t run out of pita. I would probably just lick the plate clean anyway.

Today we tried the gyro and the lamb/rice wrap.  Oh my!  Lamb was tender, juicy, flavorful, and plentiful.  I am afraid I might forget to order anything else from the menu after today.  Gyro was also good, I just really like lamb.

I tried my husband&#39;s strawberry lemonade. To my surprise it was made with real blended strawberries and so it was very nice.  I appreciate that it wasn&#39;t strawberry syrup.  On a previous visit I enjoyed a glass of carrot juice.  Two can share the carrot juice because the glass is gigantic."

No fishy smell, fresh, melt-in-your-mouth. They have a nice array of Japanese whiskeys as well. Get there early if you have a group, as its bar seating only and it fills quickly! Better for a date night. It&#39;s not the most romantic spot, but it&#39;s fun to watch the chefs at work.  

I do think they need a better system for tracking orders; our group of four had plates randomly placed in front of us at different times and there was some confusion as to who had what. It would be nicer if everyone&#39;s sushi arrives at the same time. Overall great quality and a unique spot!"

Cherry Hill Sushi Co is really a diamond in the rough. I have been to hundreds of sushi places and this little sushi bar is immediately unfamiliar and unique, in a good way.

All the staff were extremely friendly and the man who I assume is the owner was very accommodating and talkative.

The food was very simple, fresh, and delicious. My dad and I are somewhat of purists when it comes to sushi. We don&#39;t usually feel like all the deep fried, spicy mayo, eel sauce rolls (though they definitely have their time and place), so Cherry Hills Sushi Co was definitely a welcome experience.

Beyond how good and unique this place is, the prices are very reasonable. When I got the check, I had to do a double take. The price was fairly lower than my estimate (everything&#39;s cheaper when you do the combos), so I immediately put in a to-go order. After putting in the order, I forgot about their specials (on the board), so asked if I could change one and the owner said he&#39;d throw it in for free. The staff also provided me with recommendations for other nearby restaurants while I ate.

If I lived here, I would definitely be a regular.

Thank you to the fine ladies and gentlemen at Cherry Hills Sushi Co for making my first dinner in Denver such a pleasant and memorable experience!"

Food quality, service, value, and uniqueness. Most sushi restaurants have all the flash with their fancy rolls, swanky ambiance, etc. but here reminds me of Japan&#39;s sushi places...simple, clean, delicious. They specialize in hand rolls and sashimi. Friday&#39;s they have fresh uni which I for sure had to partake in. Their toro was bomb and their yellowtail sashimi was mouthwatering. Their sake and beer list was awesome as you cannot find a lot of what is on their menu inmost restaurants. The beer hit of the night was the Sansho. It was tasty and different than any other beer which is hard to say since we live in Colorado. We will be back for sure!"

After one visit, all my doubts have been erased. I think this is probably my new favorite sushi spot in Denver.  I guess it&#39;s true  that a small menu can often mean that the restaurant is focusing on what it does best and that certainly applies here.

I originally ordered the three roll combo, but I was so impressed I ended up upgrading to four rolls.  I tried the spicy tuna, unagi, blue crab, and lobster rolls.  I loved all of them, but my favorites were actually the cheaper ones - the crab and spicy tuna rolls.  What really stood out (as many other Yelpers have mentioned) was the freshness of the fish, and for me, also the freshness of the nori.  I&#39;ve never really liked nori, I just tolerated it.  This was AMAZING nori.  It was fresh, not fishy, and had a delightful crunch to it that really complimented the chewiness of the rice and fish.   I also really liked that my sushi chef brought out each roll individually - it felt like a four course tasting.  And at $18, the price was right on target for a light, high quality meal.

The artistic side of me loved the soft, modern music, the clean white walls and stainless steel appliances, and the gorgeous zebra wood bar.  The economic side of me really dug the fact that the owners have managed to come up with a very smart way to run a minimalist restaurant - one room, no ovens or cook tops, and a single C-shaped bar that allows a small staff to serve up to 20 people efficiently while also putting on a show for us diners (watching the eel getting blow-torched was a real treat).  

I have a feeling that I&#39;ll become a regular at Cherry Hills Sushi despite the fact that it&#39;s a 20 minute drive across town."

Every roll is a hand roll which I was skeptical about but was amazing. My favorite was the spicy tuna and snow crab rolls and we also loved the yellowtail shashimi. The wait staff was spot on. We loved every one of them and they were so attentive to our every needs. 

So why four stars and not five? We reserve five for blow us away places. This place was great but a few things could make it better - a) add a few select appetizers like edamame, b) increase menu selections, c) expand seating options. If you don&#39;t care about these, then check this place out - the fish is really really good. :)"

So it feels minimalist and simple, at a cost to the environment.  Environmentalist beware!!  Except for the ginger tray, the &#34;plates&#34; are paper trays and cups are throwaway plastic.  We prefer cut rolls and ceramic dishes.  The fish was fresh and tasty so the food itself is great, but we didn&#39;t like the atmosphere or scene since you&#39;re watching them work and not distracted from waiting for the next roll.  My favorite roll was the toro.  We ordered the 5 roll combo and 2 sashimi dishes, which came out to how much we would spend at a nicer restaurant.  I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip out here."

Blue crab roll- wasn&#39;t our favorite. Definitely lacking flavor.
Lobster roll- lobster was good but it was missing something.
Unagi roll- tasty
Salmon roll- decent 
Cucumber roll- our daughter loved them!

Yellowtail sashimi- good portion and quality wasn&#39;t bad.
*Eel*-by far my favorite! Ordered about 5 orders. Probably some of the best eel I&#39;ve ever had.

They have a good selection of Sake. Traditional Japanese (cold sake only). Beer and wine list was good too.

The rolls could&#39;ve been better and I say that because there&#39;s just an overwhelming amount of rice in comparison to the amount of fish in the roll. I&#39;m a firm believer that the proportions have to be perfect in order for all of the flavored to shine thru. 
I.e. Sea weed, sushi rice and fish.

The ambience could also use some help. It&#39;s all white which I like and a square shaped bar. Which I also like. The lights are way way to bright. I think the lights need to be dimmed and it will be a more comforting experience. Also I think if they tinted the Windows it would also help. The parking lot is an eye sore. Dark Windows and soft lighting will tremendously help with the atmosphere. I feel with the area so small and the lights so bright it makes you feel like it&#39;s a quick sushi bite rather than chill and drink sake and eat. If you know what I mean.

We won&#39;t be replacing our regular sushi spot but we will definitely give it another try!"

Didn&#39;t expect much since we are from LA and the sushi scene in Los Angeles is extremely diverse and great.  So we found this small but mighty place in Cherry Hills and decided to give it a try.  We walked in and was immediately greeted by a gentleman and we sat down.  That gentleman happened to be the owner and executive chef, Bradford Kim.  I was so surprised by the level of service we received and figured that alone was worth coming in.  And then (drum roll please), we had the food.  Absolutely spectacular.  The fish was on point.  Sashimi melted in your mouth and the hand rolls were made to perfection.  I never thought I would say I would be jealous of people in the Denver metro area for anything let alone food, but was I wrong.  A great sake list with high end sake and great atmosphere with great food.  I will definitely be back the next time I&#39;m in Denver.  A special thank you to Bradford Kim who made my experience at this restaurant to write a long review of praise.  So if you want an amazing atmosphere (simplistic and modern with friendly staff and owner), awesome food, and great sake...look no further.

But I don&#39;t understand where these five stars come from. Went there for lunch and was utterly disappointed. Didn&#39;t realize they only serve hand rolls which was fine. But the rolls were just lack luster. There was nothing special about them. They were small and simple. In fact, they reminded me of my high school to go lunch sushi roll except my high school rolls were much cuter and bigger. Sure the fish was good but definitely not worth the money."

Is one to put on your list to enjoy ASAP! The fish and sushi here is incredible!! My husband and I went the other day and enjoyed most of the menu, as the menu is very simplistic which didn&#39;t take away from anything. To be honest, when the fish is so fresh we found no reason to eat any special rolls. Brad, the owner prepared all of our hand rolls in front of us and also informed us about sake. I have never been a big sake drinker but with Brad&#39;s recommendations on the sake flights I will definitely be sipping on some more sake with my sushi. The sake flight is a must! They also have some unique Japanese beer options that we had and they were great! 
When you go you need to try the spicy tuna hand roll and the yellow tail sashimi ! To die for! This place is going to be make me a regular, I already know!"

I got a lot of &#34;hand rolls&#34; and the fish and crabs were pretty fresh. A couple things I didn&#39;t Like was the limited menu they don&#39;t have any appetizers. And to be honest I think calling their hand rolls hand rolls is just as bad as cutting a hotdog on a bun and calling it a pig in a blanket.

Went here for the first time last night based on some limited reviews I read. Sushi is ultra fresh, delicious, and everything on the menu was awesome. Wine and sake was reasonably priced with a good selection. Service was also awesome as everyone was super friendly and accommodating.  

Two things to point out.. Seating is sushi bar style with bar seats only.  Menu is very limited to about 6-7 simple hand rolls (seaweed on the outside) and 3 different choices of sashimi (which is why I ended up eating everything on the menu lol).  This is perfect for me as again the quality is extremely high and that is what I appreciate, however, if you have someone in your party who isn&#39;t a big sushi person and is looking for tons of fried, mayo covered rolls to mask the fish or get other items this wouldn&#39;t be the right place to go. 

Enjoy!! I will defiantly be back"

All of the fish are so fresh and delicious. I think the favorite so far has been the blue crab roll but everything has been amazing. Truly higher quality service and dining experience.

They&#39;ve got very fresh sushi and their special rolls/sashimi that changes up each week were some of our favorites.

They&#39;ve got a good wine and sake list, and their flights are a sweet way to try some different sake. The staff was very nice, very friendly, and very knowledgable. 

I will say that if you&#39;re looking for a nice date spot for a sit down, one-on-one conversation this isn&#39;t the place to go because it&#39;s just bar seating (the bar is really cool). Love this place, and will definitely make it back whenever I am in the area."

It&#39;s a hidden gem for sure. A small place that can seat maybe 20 max but I absolutely love the intimacy of it. The atmosphere is simplistic yet uniquely hip. It&#39;s clean looking in style but also just in general. The attention to detail at the place is unreal from the moment you walk in and take your seat to the moment you walk out the door. I was a little skeptical at first because it&#39;s definitely not your &#34;traditional&#34; sushi place. It&#39;s actually more authentic than your typical sushi place. If you&#39;re looking for a california roll or something with cream cheese and avocado, you won&#39;t find that here... You&#39;ll get BETTER actually. Every roll is made in front of you, fresh. The fish quality that they use is equivalent if not better than some of the staple sushi places in Denver like Sushi Den. My favorite hand rolls are the spicy tuna, blue crab, unagi, and lobster. I also add on an order of Yellow Tail Sashimi since it&#39;s ONLY $5 extra! I probably go to this place once a week and I&#39;ve never considered myself to be a regular to any place. Who said Denver can&#39;t have good fish even though it&#39;s land locked? Go to this place!"

Occasionally it&#39;s nice to go to those sushi places where you can get all kinds of crazy, special rolls, but I love that I can come here or get take out and not feel too full or gross. I know that what I&#39;m ordering is fresh and doesn&#39;t have added ingredients or sauces. It&#39;s just yummy fish, rice, and seaweed. And the prices... Wow! I can get 3 hand rolls for $10, which is a steal for sushi. Don&#39;t hesitate to try this place. My favorite is the spicy tuna roll. Perfect amount of spice while still being able to taste the tuna.

We came in and sat down to be greeted by the owner, the youngest-looking sushi chef you&#39;ve ever met. He worked in LA before so he knows his stuff but has put together a very quality but casual place here.

The menu is a bit confusing. There are deals to be had by ordering the right combinations of things, which the owner kept trying to explain but we never quite figured out. But the price at the end was pretty low for everything we got so no complaints.

The hand rolls were very good. I enjoyed the tuna and salmon rolls and they were quite fresh. But the star of the show was the sashimi, prepared in a delicious dressing with real, premium wasabi. We also asked the owner to explain all the items on the reasonable-sized alcohol menu and ended up selecting a Japanese rice beer that was very crisp and a good pairing with the sushi.

The storefront is pretty non-assuming and the decor inside is very casual. You sit at a counter and can watch them prepare the food or you can do like us and look out the big west-facing windows on a beautiful Colorado sunset.

This was a fantastic spot and we can&#39;t wait to go back."

If you&#39;re looking for fancy rolls named after the local football team it may not be your place, but if you&#39;re looking for some good fish, a clean and tastefully trendy atmosphere and reasonable prices, check it out.

The owner, Brad is very attentive to quality. He explains the menu. It&#39;s a simple menu and what I like about it is, it&#39;s extremely fresh. I used to joke about sushi in Denver - no coastal land and gloppy Sriracha mayo covered California rolls with crunchy old fired panko. It used to make me want to eat a burger. 

Now, I know that I have an excellent option to have very fresh sashimi and sushi. It&#39;s simple and high quality. It&#39;s minimalist and that is why I liked it. I had the Ootoro fatty belly of tuna and Scottish salmon rolls. There is a happy hour too! Brad bought some very nice whiskey from Taiwan. Yes, Taiwan. It&#39;s one of the world&#39;s best, distilled in E. Taiwan in Yilan. I just came back from there last week. It&#39;s very high quality Kavalan! You can&#39;t find it in other places. 

Service was excellent. Seraphine, my server is personable and cares about quality of food and service. There are cheaper places that serve questionable $1 sushi, this place is nothing like it. I felt like the food is clean, the decor is nice, and the people at Cherry Hills Sushi Co. mindfully care about their customers and product. This place is casual and laid back. It&#39;s all about quality and friendliness. Be sure to like them on Facebook, that way you can write to Brad through their restaurant page to find out what fresh fish arrived that day. That&#39;s how I ended up there. He had me at Ootoro when he gave me the list of fish that just arrived. 

Location - within walking distance from Swedish Hospital. Parking is free. Small strip mall - so if the lot is full, there&#39;s street side parking."

We were here to watch the football game and looking for good food. Being from New York, we honestly didn&#39;t think there were a lot of Asian options and even if there were , it wouldn&#39;t taste authentic. 

We both agreed that their food was pretty good. First of all, so freaking cheap!!!! Monday - Thursday $15.69 (dinner) compared to the other places where it was $25+. That&#39;s another reason why we were skeptical; cause it was so cheap. 
When we arrived , we were immediately seated. They had a pretty decent variety of food. Their sushi was very appetizing and not filled with rice. Eel with avocado, snowcrab with shrimp and avocado, spicy crab roll etc and they were lazily made. As for their hot food, their baked cheese mussels were very yummy , hot and sour soup (YUM)- had lots of mushrooms , bamboo shoots , tofu etc 
Overall, it was just really good. Totally recommend this place. Can&#39;t wait to try what other foods Denver has in store !!!"

Decent food for the price! Today being Mothers Day Sunday makes this place CRAZY!! Glad they have a time limit to tables cuz some of these folks can hang out for a long time!

Yes, it was a madhouse like I&#39;d never seen. People lined up out the door and an entirely packed restaurant. The poor wait staff were very busy and a little stressed by the amount of people. Our server Wendy was so sweet and kind and we went out of our way to make sure to be gracious with her. 

The food was really very good and continually refilled because it was like a damn piranha pool swirling around the troughs! At one point, there was a shortage of plates, and you should have seen the people getting angry. Was actually a little amusing to see the poor guy come out with the plates and get converged upon.

Food items do not seem to be rotated on a daily basis. If you go on Monday and have Orange Chicken you can expect Orange Chicken on Wednesday. This is more noticeable since there are only five or six hot things on the line as far as Chinese entrées go. Seems too much space is being taken by the desserts and salad bar.

Some glassware was dirty. There are interior improvements that need to be corrected (stained ceiling tiles, dripping roof). Bathroom was exceptionally clean.

Staff is exceptionally friendly and attentive and this is what keeps the place at a 3 instead of a 2.

Hopefully they can address some of the issues and return to greatness soon!

It was $14.99 per person for dinner (great compared to Osaka buffet in Dallas, TX dinner =$24.99!!!!). You have to remember, this is a buffet, not a 5 star restaurant. Expectations must be kept realistic. Don&#39;t expect super authentic food but expect a good tasting, good value food.

They had a great selection of sushi. Sashimi, California rolls, eel, salmon, tuna -  yum! For a buffet, definitely some of the better sushis I&#39;ve had. 

I didn&#39;t really eat much of the hot food buffet items. I tend to stray away from those foods (orange chicken, lo mein, beef with peppers - I can make those all at home). No I went for the crab legs. I got 4 plates of just crab legs! The legs were cold, but succulent and juicy! I had used so many  napkins when I was done.

Service stinks,  but people, please learn to tip.  Even though it&#39;s a buffet these people still deserve 12-15 percent.  If good service of course 20 or more!!!
I saw a table of 10 with 4 kids walk out complaining about service.  For a 16 dollar dinner, all you can eat, why complain?  Just eat and go... Your table made more tables angry than your server after they saw the check!

Their sushi is a pretty great bargain and I don&#39;t worry at all about eating it as a buffet.  If your family is hunkering for sushi this is a good option at a bargain price point.  If a member doesn&#39;t care for sushi, it&#39;s ok, they have other food too.  You&#39;ll see a very mixed crowd dining here such as Koreans, Japanese, Caucasians, and Mexicans of all ages.

I guess it&#39;s because I tend to review places that strike me as out of the ordinary, either really good or really bad.  Hiro is very middle of the road, but in a good way.  It&#39;s my standard goto comfort Asian buffet.  It&#39;s where I go when I want good food that isn&#39;t overpriced and I don&#39;t want to wait for delivery. 

  All their food is always very fresh and the place is always clean.  They bill themselves as Japanese &amp; Sushi, but the reality is that they&#39;re a mix with  &#34;American Chinese.&#34;  They have some Japanese fair, such as edamame, gyoza, seaweed salad, tempura fried vegetables  (you gotta try the sweet potato), kimchi and sushi.  But they also have Chinese selections, like egg drop soup, crab rangoons, pepper steak, orange chicken and so on.  If you are someone who is picky, Chinese or Japanese, you&#39;ll still find plenty to eat here.  They also have a ton of seafood options including crab legs, raw and fried shrimp, mussels, clams, baked salmon and so on.  The Vegetarian in your family will be able to find many options as well.

Their Sushi bar has nigiri but is mostly maki.  There are 16 roll options available plus one in the tempura fried area.  They fry it in individual slices so to me it&#39;s over-battered and not my favorite. The rest of the rolls are pretty good quality for buffet style.  I&#39;d say comparable to King Sooper&#39;s sushi.  Again, nothing to write home about, but good.

They also have alcohol, and you can get Japanese beer, like Kirin Ichiban.

Their deserts are the usual Asian buffet pre-manufactured things like creme puffs and little square cakes, but they also have plenty of fresh fruit, jello and puddings.  I would recommend you stay away from the ice cream, because it&#39;s always old, stale and tasteless. 

I think a good way to gauge the quality of a good Asian restaurant is if Asian people eat there, and this place is always full of them.  Overall, I like Hiro and I think you might as well."

This was quite an impressive spread with 3 hot buffet bars, 2 cold buffet bars, and a sushi bar. 1 hot buffet bar had all fried foods like cream cheese wontons, fried sushi/vegetables, etc. The other 2 hot buffet bars had orange chicken, noodles, fried rice, teriyaki chicken, etc. The 2 cold buffet bars had fruits, veggies, crab legs, deserts, and etc. 

Overall, the food was meh. The fried foods were definitely better fresh because the longer the food was out it got soggier. That applies to all the food, but what can you do because it&#39;s a buffet. The hot plate food got cold once it was on my plate longer than 5 minutes. 

My favorite food was the fried sushi (only if it was a fresh batch). The cold sushi was pretty decent and I liked the fried donut. The crab legs were a little hard to eat without a crab leg cracker. Wish the cream cheese wontons had more cream cheese in it. 

For a buffet though, this place is probably better than most. But I&#39;m still giving it 2 stars because I&#39;ve been here before and the quality has gone down in the recent years."

This place was pretty decent for a Chinese buffet, a solid 3 stars. They had more variety than any other buffet I&#39;ve been to and for $15 on a Thursday night, that&#39;s not too expensive. Here&#39;s some of their notable foods:
Crab: cold and waterlogged.
Clams: no. Stay away. Didn&#39;t have any taste. What a waste of clams.
Sushi: similar to grocery store sushi.
Lo-mein: fnasty and has no taste. 
Fried sushi: who thought this was a good idea?
Baked mussels: pretty tasty. Was my favorite item there.
Ice cream: weird. Very weird. None of it is labeled with what flavor it is. It was very airy with no buttercream in it. Strawberry was better than vanilla. 
Calamari: not bad. Not Italian, but were you expecting that?

Dining room is nice and they were good about clearing plates off your table. A strange bathroom cleaner smell was present. Little slow on refilling drinks. For the most part, the buffet was kept stocked. Only thing I noticed was the lychee bin was empty for a long time. You also get a free buffet on your birthday with ID and a paying adult buffet."

I shared with him when I worked in this area I used to go to this Chinese buffet. I did mention it had started to go down so had not been in years. I suggested we go take a look and if not comfortable, we can go some where else. 
Until we arrived, I did not know it  was no longer a Chinese buffet. 
I noticed the place had been &#39;cleaned up&#39; and no longer held that hidden dirt aura.
The food.  Everything we tried hit our taste buds just right. I am not a big soda drinker but decided I would order a Pepsi. It was one of the best Pepsis I had dispensed from a soda fountain in like forever.
The only drag for me was the landscaping as you enter. I think if someone took care of that, the place would be more inviting and indicative of what is to come on the inside.
We decided this make the list of places to go for Asian cuisine."

Hubs was starving and he REALLY wanted Buffet.  *SIGH*  So to this Hiro Japanese Buffet we went.  That recent visit was on Saturday March 22nd 2014.  When we arrived at this establishment, there was NO WAIT at all.  That is good in my books.  Time was about 18:30hrs ish.

We came in perhaps before the DINNER RUSH or perhaps, the &#34;Limelight&#34; of this establishment went down south from other patrons what nots.  We were given the Booth Seats, in which Hubs was hoping for that evening.  As usual Hubs opt to have the Fountain Drink ($1.89), I think it was Root Beer of some kind.  I opt to have water as part of my beverages. 

The Buffet, is all the same, with HOT dishes and COLD dishes and the norm sushi items.  This time around, I managed to get and to eat the COLD CRAB LEGS.  Nothing fancy, nothing stellar about those COLD CRAB LEGS.  For that evening, they also have the SMALL CRABs, in which they just FRIED with Salt and Pepper, edible and doable, since I like to eat Crabs.  Too bad, it was NOT Soft Shell Crabs but the norm &#34;small&#34; crabs.  So beware of the shells and chew thoroughly if you are into those.

Once again, the &#34;Fried-Rice&#34; are either over-cooked or gone bad.  NOTE to SELF : Next time DO NOT take the Fried Rice.  Hubs managed to get the Fried Udon Noodles.  He said the food he choose that evening was A-OK.
  
This time around, the Desserts are WAY better tasting.  That was what Hubs said.   I cannot deny, the Ice-Cream in the white containers, either they melted and re-freeze back, so it DOES NOT look appetizing to eat, the one I choose anyway was the Chocolate Chip Ice Cream tasted &#34;yucky&#34; too.  *DOUBLE SIGH*  I like Hubs option of Strawberry Ice Cream though.

Our Main server, his name is Riki.  Hubs indeed gave Riki considerable amount of Tips at the end of our dinner.  Total cost of our Buffet with Tips and Tax that evening was $40.  Left the establishment about 20:10hrs ish.

Hiro&#39;s is an All you can eat buffet with: soups, tempuras, egg rolls, rangoons, bbq nuggets of meat, dishes of chicken, fish, noodles, mushrooms and more of a broad variety of foods including  a separate section of all of the common sushi and nigiri you can eat. Frequently there is a platter of Sashimi available. If you want a particular type of fish put $1 or more in the sushi Chef&#39;s tip jar, then they will be happy to put together more of what they have for you. 

I love the green lip mussels baked with a magic sauce I suspect leans heavily towards mayo, it is bubbly orange on top and often the tray is emptied quickly after it is placed on the buffet. If the tray is empty just ask the staff and they will get it refilled. The only complaint I have is the crab legs are too skinny, claws too small, which requires too much work for not enough meat but most people pile mountains of the critters on plates.

Usually there are fresh tender sesame covered rice flour balls with red bean paste centers which are marvelous. 

The various shrimps are good and plentiful. The long seasoned green beans are wonderful but I&#39;d like to see snow peas, bok choy, water chestnuts, king or shelf mushroom and less onion, carrot and button mushrooms, which is my complaint with nearly every Asian restaurant. The seaweed salad is ok but could use more sesame oil or traditional seasoning. There are plenty of fresh fruits including perfect peeled juicy lychees and flaky treats."

Disgusting is all I can say. The kimchi was so bad I had to spit it out. Orange chicken was equally disgusting. The only thing I could stomach was the teriyaki chicken skewer. The unripe and very crunchy melon was surprisingly good compared to the other &#34;dishes&#34;. I don&#39;t know how you can make sushi rolls that bad. I would give a half star if I could."

The food is neither good or bad.  If you can&#39;t decide on something, I would recommend coming here to eat.  At $18 a person for dinner buffet, its a great way to satisfy an unruly appetite.  The service easily gets 5 stars.  The cooked Chinese dishes get 3 stars.  The sushi, amazingly 4 stars.  I even went back for seconds!  Last on the list, desserts.  That part just gets honorable mention other than the lychee they offer which was great. This is borderline 4 stars for me but some dishes seemed like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for quite some time.  I&#39;ll give this place another shot.  Not expecting world class food but definitely has a bit for improvement.  Even if they did a little quality control and raised the price even a dollar, I&#39;d give it a whirl!"

I came here for lunch with my sister since we wanted to try it and for $10 it seemed perfect, especially for all-you-can-eat including seafood, sushi, and other variety of Asian cuisine. It may have been a slow day but the selection wasn&#39;t that appealing to me but the quality of food was good. I was surprised that the sushi was pretty amazing and I had to keep going back. What&#39;s more they had cheese wantons! Now this place wouldn&#39;t be something i crave nor would it be the first place to go to but honestly I would come back with friends and family with positive review. If you have second thoughts or doubts about the food quality don&#39;t since its worth it. But the service it less than mediocre with a somber waiter serving us. Could you be any more jubilant. The food platter were always replaced with more so don&#39;t worry about having to wait. So try it once and be adventurous."

This place apparently opened up back in early December 2013 in the place where LD buffet used to be. They renovated the interior and put up some new walls. Everything looks nice and clean inside however, just like with quick fix and flip homes, none of the styles really match; someone just pointed at a bunch of laminates, stone pieces, and colors and said go. Anyways, it&#39;s clean inside! (even in the bathrooms).

The salt and pepper shrimp was not crispy enough and needs garlic. Edible but also not very hot (temperature). Mussels with mayo and cheese were good but could be warmer as well.

General&#39;s chicken is a bit over cooked and overall too sweet. I&#39;d avoid getting that in the future. Same with the dumplings, they are far too dry as they&#39;ve been sitting out in open air too long, Hiro needs to add a cover to this tray.

Jalapeno chicken is so-so but could be warmer. The pepper beef is very good, but it too needs to be warmer. The pork ribs were mediocre and I probably would avoid them in the future. The chicken on a stick was done a bit differently than other places I&#39;ve been to. Instead of having a crispy exterior, it&#39;s soft and has a teriyaki sweet sauce on it. The interior is still very moist; long live dark meat.

The fried shrimp is bland and tastes heavily of oil. Same for the spring rolls. Both need to be fried in a hotter temp oil to avoid this.

Probably the winner here are the green beans. They are surprisingly good. They have a solid crunch and good flavor. We went back for seconds.

The hot and sour soup is a bit on the lighter side of the spectrum. It has average flavor but is extremely thick; too much corn starch.

The crab legs are served cold here, unlike most other places. I will say that they don&#39;t get soggy as quickly this way. The legs actually snap and it&#39;s easy to pull out entire strings of meat in one motion. The legs are the smallest of the small though, so you&#39;ll need a few plates to actually get some meat.

The sushi side of the house looks presentable however the rice is too cold and dense. Maybe it needs to be this way due to sitting out instead of being prepared for immediate consumption. Also, not enough rice vinegar/sugar in the mix. The fish was acceptable but certainly not up to the standards of an actual sushi establishment. For a $14 dinner, I have no complaints.

The soda fountain is on the flatter side of the scale and could have the CO2 turned up. They serve ice cream cups here out of a little chest freezer which normally gets me pretty excited. However these are way too cold or have been sitting too long. Almost impossible to cut (not scoop, cut) into it. We left an open cup sitting on a plate and after 10 minutes it still didn&#39;t appear that it was melting at all.

This review may seem like I&#39;m being very critical, and to some degree I am however, these are pretty specific ways for them to raise the level of their buffet considerable. I&#39;d come back even if they didn&#39;t change anything because that&#39;s how bad the chinese buffet scene is in Denver. If they could do only one thing though, it should be cranking up the steam tables, the food would go up another star easily if we got hot food and not lukewarm."

Japanese food wise,  not much to talk about.  Do have more roll selection and limited sashimi on a boat. Forget which roll it was but included caterpillar rolls, rainbow rolls and several others that was lot better than standard California rolls.

Chinese food wise, about the same.

Do have cold snow crab legs and fresh oysters.

For $14.95 AYCE for Colorado,  need to give extra star."

The restaurant recently opened... about one week ago and the parking lot has been packed since. It&#39;s brought new life to the east side of the HMart shopping center... and it&#39;s good!

Hiro is a buffet, featuring a wide selection of sushi, including rolls, nigiri and sashimi. There are several sushi chefs so the sushi is constantly being replenished, even though it goes fast! 

There&#39;s all you can eat Chinese food, seafood, veggies, stir fry, soups and salads! They also have fresh fruit and yummy desserts. The lemon cake has a light whipped cream (instead of frosting). Very good! We all had a slice... and all of this for only $13.99 during dinner and $8.99 during lunch. That is a steal! 

Our server was great. We ordered tea which washed things down nicely, as we tried not to overeat... which of course, is hard not to, at any buffet. But no regrets here!"

This buffet has very little variety compared to other buffets I&#39;ve been to, but the oysters, snow crab legs, mussels, and ice cream makes up for it. 

The oysters taste kind of weird, my whole table thought the same too and we couldn&#39;t put our finger on why it tastes so much different than other oysters. I ate about 3 plates of these and I didn&#39;t get sick so it has that going for it. 

I really like how they set up the ice cream. They put little sealed cups of ice cream in the ice cream cooler. This is a lot more cleaner and less icky than just having tubs of ice cream with metal scoopers. 

Their sushi variety was also lacking, but I still enjoyed their small selection. The crayfish was very bland with no seasoning or flavor. I&#39;m used to Cajun food so tasting flavorless crayfish almost made me gag.

Overall lots of cons and small amount of pros to try and make up for it."

Like any buffet there are misses, but generally you can find something you like. 

Cold: 
The sushi itself is mediocre; the rice is mushy and not very well seasoned, and the fish is sort of limp. The best was the nigri sashimi. 
The cocktail shrimp and oysters were great -- you can&#39;t really go wrong with those. 

Hot: 
Tempura green beans, broccoli, and sweet potato were all lovely. 
Fried sushi - a deep fried california avocado roll. mmhhmm, yup. 
The hot oysters (with the creamy orange sauce on top) were probably my favorite
The chinese meats were all what is to be expected. I liked them with the seasoned (fried?) rice. The spicy chicken was the best. 

Dessert: 
Love the little ice cream containers -- but where&#39;s the green tea flavor????? 
Very american. 
The sesame donut balls with sweet beans inside were yummy, but not enough filling. 
Have the fried bananas with the vanilla ice cream -- you&#39;ll thank me.

Miscellaneous: 
Edamame is well cooked and perfectly salted. 
The kimchi is as good as you can reasonably expect from a japanese buffet."

Hungry and wanting something new, we stopped by to enjoy some sushi, very pleasing. The fish is fresh and the waiters are lounging around as very few tables are occupied.  The decor is great, lighting is good, however there is a stench next to the soups.  Overall, the food is good, that is if you have a sweet tooth.  Mostly everything is sweet, chicken beef and pork.   

In conclusion, the food is easy to eat, especially the sushi, and the nice decor and good lighting makes the experience greater.

I would recommend this place to those who enjoy good food at a good price.

P.s. server Jing is a moper, whom is inattentive and drags her shoes across the floor.  Pretty epic."

Gross with an off taste... Yuck!!  I can&#39;t believe I put those on my plate let alone in my mouth.... 
They had one beef item. it was ok, but Luke warm as with everything else.... About the only thing that was hot was the soup but I&#39;m guessing that was only hot to keep it from congealing and turning into some sort of goo.
I&#39;m shocked the health department let them open... 
I guess they turned up the heat on the food warmers that day and hid the seafood.
All this cost $40.00..... For two.

Instead when I saw that the place has re-opened as a Japanese/Sushi all you can eat buffet, I decided to check it out. I was really in the mood to eat some sushi.

At one time the LD Buffet was an amazing place to get your fill of wonderful Asian style seafood dishes, as well as non-seafood items. They even had some so-so sushi back then. But when they first were open and at least more than one year, they served Dungeness crab, all you could eat! The place was simply amazing. But over the years the LD Buffet just kept cutting corners and the quality and amount of the seafood until they became a bummer.

I was hoping that we would have a situation like a new LD Buffet, where there would be lots of wonderful selections and great sushi. It is quite unfortunate that I did not see much improvement in the buffet&#39;s quality, though the place has changed. It was very disappointing. 

Most of the &#34;hot&#34; items, though heaping full in their steamer trays was cold. There was not much of a tempting selection. You would expect them to served hot shrimp, but the only shrimp they had was battered fried American style shrimp (yuk) and cold boiled shrimp. No salt and spicy shrimp or anything that the Asians would really wolf down! They were supposed to have &#34;fried snapper&#34; but in its&#39; place was what looked like greasy fried squid and it wasn&#39;t getting selected by anyone.

So the only hot fish was the steamed salmon, which was almost white in color and very bland. They had some skinny snow crab legs served COLD! They did have deep fried blue crabs, which I love, but they would have been so much better if they were still hot. They were cold, though sitting in a steamer tray!

You would expect for any place like this to have some good looking &#34;fried rice&#34; but it was just as white as steamed rice and simply did not look worthy of my plate!

The sushi was not anything that you would call &#34;quality&#34; sushi. It was just your low grade, run-of-the-mill buffet sushi. I was hoping to get some smoked eel, but it was only available in a roll that was too much rice and filler and very little eel. The Nigiri sushi was very limited and nothing special. Most of the sushi was in sliced roll pieces and nothing exciting. Very, very average and limited sushi.

A little warning, if you get their hot tea, they are going to charge you $1.79 for it and it too is nothing special, just a single tea bag in a pot! 

There are too many great sushi places, too many great Asian restaurants in this area of town for this buffet to stay in business very much longer if they continue down this path. I feel as though I wasted my money this evening and I would have been better off going somewhere else and spending half of what I did at this buffet OR by going to somewhere and spending nearly double, but then getting some excellent sushi and all I can eat of it. I walked out of Hiro spending $20.00 and it just was not worth anything near that!

If you want to experience a truly great all you can eat sushi and Japanese food restaurant, one that can go up against the best sushi buffets in the nation, check out Sushi Katsu, which is very close to this buffet. 

I was truly disappointed with the Hiro Japanese Buffet and I don&#39;t see where it would improve enough for me to go back there again."

Myself and three other friends came here with empty stomachs, eager to pound down some asian cuisine. Our excitement was soon crushed. 

My expectations were set low because of the type of establishment. I started off with the sushi rolls which were surprisingly pretty good. The nigiri didn&#39;t taste right so I only had one and left the other two on my plate. The teriyaki chicken was fine and so was the egg drop soup. This is when it went downhill. They somehow managed to mess up Orange Chicken. It had a seafood type taste that was very off putting and led to my loss of appetite which was already damaged from the nigiri. The fried sushi roll had some mystery meat within its battered walls that worried my table. Their chow mein was edible but very pathetic. Maybe it was the bad experience but even their ice cream was questionable. It was rationed out into styrofoam containers and deep frozen to a rock hard level. A leaky lid may have led to its lack of any flavor.   

Overall I don&#39;t think that the food will make me sick (fingers crossed) but I feel that the quality of the food was VERY low. I am the type of guy who can eat anything and everything but not here. I was hoping to eat three plates of food and I was unable to find something worth eating. My buddy resorted to eating a full plate of crab rangoons with sweet and sour sauce. 

I only give it two stars because the food was edible and you might be able to make a meal out of it. The restaurant was fairly busy and many people were taking full advantage of the array of seafood selection (i.e. crawfish and crab legs). I might have just eaten the wrong types of food at this buffet but all four of use were very disappointed and left with queasy stomachs."

At first I was very leery as some of the newer reviews were not savory. But, this restaurant was AWESOME! I found the food hot and fresh from the kitchen. There was a large variety of tasty sushi and very artfully made. They kept the crab legs comin&#39; as customers were loading up their plates skyhigh. Everything I sampled was hot, tasty and fresh.

I like what the new owners did as far as decor. but that&#39;s it when it comes to things we liked about Hiro.  

In all fairness, it is a new restaurant and we did go there 2 days after their grand opening so I&#39;d like to try and give them the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe they just need more time to get into their &#34;groove&#34; but I doubt we&#39;ll ever go back to see if that happens.

The food was cold, bland and either rock solid or had the consistency of baby food.  There was a huge &#34;variety&#34; of sushi; lots of different kinds but they all seemed to have this sweet terriyaki-like sauce all over them.  Also, the toppings on their sashimi were WARM.  Not good.  The fact that there was one set of tongs used for multiple foods and sushi bothered me as well.  

Then there was the service, or lack thereof.  The young lady at the front was rude, condescending and argumentative.  Word of advice, order refills before you need them because you might only see your server once.  And although it may seem that you are responsible for bussing your own tables, rest assured, they will come and pick up your plates... eventually.  

No music or background noise at all, except for clinking silverware, glasses and the sound of people chewing.  

Horrible, horrible experience.  I was really excited to try it initially but was sadly disappointed.  Sorry Hiro, I think I&#39;ll stick with Sushi Katsu for amazing all you can eat sushi.

I wanted something sweet, so as per the advice of the super duper friendly, nice, helpful lady, I went with the cranberry and chevre kouign amann (did I spell that right? Whatever, you probably don&#39;t know how to pronounce it anyway.) and a bran muffin because I&#39;m probably the only weirdo in the world who loves them. 

I pretty much tried both the moment I got home. I didn&#39;t even pet my dogs first. Sorry, guys. The only other KA (I&#39;m abbreviating now because I&#39;m too lazy to google the spelling and my spell check is of no help) I have ever had was at Dominique Ansel Bakery in NYC where he has wisely dubbed his the &#34;DKA&#34; because nobody can pronounce it. It was without a doubt one of the best things I ate in New York, and the one from Moxie might have actually been better. The cranberry chevre combo was absolutely wonderful and perfectly fall. I wish I had bought more than one flavor because now I&#39;m curious about the others.

1. Go early if you want pain chocolate (chocolate croissant) because it is so popular that it often sells out before 11 am. Theirs is divine.  I also love their plain croissants, esp hot out of the oven.
2. Try their King Egg for a savory treat, filling enough for a meal. It&#39;s egg, cheese, and veggie ingredients nestled in croissant heaven, shaped like a large muffin. 
3.  Yes, get a Kouign Amann! This pastry is hard to describe - but theirs has a wonderful texture and taste and they offer seasonal flavors. 
4. Bread!  They are a bread company after all!  My fave is Farmhouse. But if I&#39;m getting smoked salmon, I&#39;ll go with one if their dark ryes or even the GF wonderbrot.  
5. Good  espresso too - my fave is the Cortado!
Casual neighborhood feel,  great products, and friendly staff.  I&#39;m a permanent patron!"

Where do I even start. The shop itself is so charming, fitted into a converted 1860s house, everything from its live-edge wood sign to the velvet upholstery and hand woven displays (rotating for sale), the succulents on the windowsill giving me serious plant envy and the string instruments hanging up, ready for their music nights on Wednesday - everything, everything is just wonderful about this environment. 

A lovely mustachio-d fellow served me a smoooooooooth Americano, the clerk behind the counter was wearing flowers in her hair.  I mean COME ON.  Way to make my morning significantly better, Moxie. Everyone was so gracious about my copious photo-taking and my hesitation with my order - how can I choose amongst the bounty?! As Phil Rosenthal would say, &#34;I&#39;m starting to have anxiety because I want everything.&#34; 

You got your le roi d&#39;oeuf/King Egg, which is a large muffin shaped pastry filled with cheeses and vegetables and maybe meat (today&#39;s special was hatch chilies and Gruyere); you got your apple bretagne; you got your various croissants both sweet and savory and of course, of course, you have your kouign amann.  There are specialty kouign amann (like caramel apple, omg), but at 7:32 AM I managed to snatch the last original kouign amann and now, like Neo, I can never go back. 

No words can describe the experience of eating this pastry with any justice but here is a paltry attempt: just the right amount of sugar brushed on the outside to give it the perfect level of slightly sweet and satisfyingly crunchy texture; creamy buttery; making orgasm noises at work; real deal.   You know how, when you&#39;re eating a pastry, these little pieces of dough flake off on to the plate and you throw those away? Yeah, I ate every little piece. 

Evidently Moxie Bread Co. also does bread, and also breakfast and lunch sandwiches as well as other food, but I completely lost my head in front of their pastry counter so that will have to be some other time (very soon!)."

I am usually here for the kouign amanns which are sensational. Want something savory? The King Egg is divine. I am sad to say that I am so stuck on these two heavenly treats that I have deprived myself of their other delicious offerings. Well, I also usually pick up a Farmhaus loaf which is also... delicious! I know! Shocker.

There are croissants, koign-amann, and muffins. They do look a little darkly cooked on top (except for the croissants), but they are still very good. The espresso drinks were also excellent. 

For foodie parents, no worries! This cafe is so welcoming that there is a shelf full of kids books and a box of crayons. Drink your coffee in peace. Eat the rest of the muffin they didn&#39;t finish; you ordered it for yourself anyway.

Not only is the place super cute, the staff super nice, and the location super convenient, but the food is PHENOMENAL! 

I absolutely adore small bakeries/coffee shops. They usually have tons of personality with incredible staff. Moxie is no exception; it excels in both areas. 

I decided to try The Eldora sandwich ($10) for lunch. The bread was AMAZING. The smoked salmon was incredibly flavorful. The lemon-dill aioli was killer. All around, this is a great sandwich and I would highly recommend it to any and all smoked salmon lovers. 

It was our first visit and the lovely woman working let us try the blueberry Kougin Amann. This was my first experience with this particular pastry and I was totally blown away. It was mind-bogglingly delicious. We ordered two more (piña colada &amp; cashew chocolate) on the spot. They were all incredibly yummy. I absolutely loved that all the food was served on wood blocks. I&#39;ve never seen this before and found it to be super charming. 

I can&#39;t wait to return to Moxie Bread Co to try more of their amazing sandwiches and pastries (and some of their drinks)!"

The first problem, which was glaringly obvious the moment we viewed the bakery case. Burned items. Nearly all of the muffins were burned. And I don&#39;t mean overdone. I mean burned to black cinders. Right on top, visible. And all of the filled croissants, of all varieties, had been way over-baked until they were a dark mahogany brown. Terrible. Croissants should be baked to a nice golden brown. Won&#39;t find them any other way in any patisserie in Paris, or in France, or beyond. I&#39;ve only ever seen super dark brown croissants at Moxie. I would estimate that at least 40% of the goods for sale were horrendously over-baked.

The crazy part? Moxie put all of these burned and over-cooked items out for sale. Inexplicable. Unconscionable. The even crazier part? People were buying them. Lots of people. Bizarro world. I can only imagine that some customers assume that maybe this is the new artisanal way to bake baked goods (burned), and are too embarrassed or uncertain to mentally step back a degree and say WTF? We watched people pass by us carrying tray after wood tray of scorched items to tables, where they sat down and ate as if this was somehow reasonable.

I&#39;m not exaggerating. I wish I were.

Things we tried. The King Egg. Fine, nothing wrong with it. And, thankfully, not burned. But at $6 it was way overpriced. The peach kouign amann. Decent. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing we would seek out again. And yes, given the dearth of non-over-cooked items, we tried the least dark brown of the dark brown ham and cheese croissants. It was refrigerator cold in the center, so not freshly made. The layers didn&#39;t separate the way croissant layers should, and the whole thing tasted...yup...way over-cooked. The drip coffee was fine.

It&#39;s been a week since we visited, and I still can&#39;t quite wrap my head around the experience. One theory- Moxie is actually a performance art installation rather than a real bakery, with its goal being to induce patrons into participating in some great, tacit joke. Ha ha. Apparently, it&#39;s working.

Sorry for being so snarky, but seeing all of those scorched baked goods put out for sale was viscerally offensive."

Added some fresh baked bread and it was a great lunch! Very generous salad. Order at the counter and grab a seat.Some outdoor seating and I didn&#39;t see how much seating they had indoors. Hubby had the smoked salmon sandwich and really enjoyed it. He is not a fan of kale and didn&#39;t even realize it was on his sandwich.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouign-amann 
or maybe a King Egg or tartine and then for lunch any of the sandwiches or maybe just a small loaf of the Algerian with a little butter or good olive oil. For dinner? Why I think I might have pizza or maybe a different loaf of bread and a salad? 

All kidding aside, all the baked goods, food in general, coffee and coffee drinks, the friendly staff, the vibe, just everything about Moxie is for me &#34;Woohoo! As good as it gets!&#34; = 5 stars. 

side note: Once in a great while I&#39;ll come across a loaf or a pastry that might have been just a smidge past perfect in the oven but if brought to anyone&#39;s attention here, they&#39;ve always stood behind their goods and gladly replaced it or if they&#39;ve run out?

We popped in to Moxie for a muffin one morning. We sat out on the patio just watching people in the race run by. An hour later the &#34;Taste of Louisville&#34; opened up. It was so pleasant just to sit out and watch the world go by.

To top it off, the muffin was fabulous! We shared a blueberry corn muffin. It was moist and sweet (but not too) from the corn and the blueberries. So fresh too!

We enjoyed ourselves so much that we went back on the morning we were leaving. Hubby had the same muffin and I had a banana chocolate muffin. Yummy! I also had a fresh homemade kombucha from &#34;the tap&#34;. It was so light and refreshing.

It was the perfect way to end a nice long relaxing weekend."

So when we find a place that makes them, we hone in quickly. I am also guilty of paying insane sums to have them overnighted from a place mentioned on the food network. 

We came here this morning for breakfast and tried three different options. We&#39;ve only ever had plain before so filled was new to us. I got a plum (it had two pieces of plum so I wouldn&#39;t really call it filled) and the autumnal one that was filled with goat cheese and some other items which I can&#39;t remember. The tart goat cheese with the sweet was a nice balance. The hubs got the plain. We both thought they were good but more dense than we prefer. The outside was also crispier and crunchier which I liked but the hubs not so much. 

He also got the ham and cheese croissant which I thought was fantastic. The hubs felt it didn&#39;t offer enough ham. He was underwhelmed. 

I ordered the chai with almond milk which I really enjoyed. The hubs thought his cappuccino was good if not on the smaller side of what he normally likes.

I do not go out to historic downtown Louisville very often but it is worth the trip to see what the community has done and visit some very cute local businesses thriving out there. There is only street parking for Moxie Bread as with most of the downtown area. But on a weekday morning that was not a problem. It is located in an historic small house right on Main St.

The aroma inside is very enticing and the displays full and attractive. I wanted to try so many things but limited myself on this first visit to just 5 items, to spread out over the day for two people (but yes, mostly me.) 

I ordered and ate immediately, the basic Kouign Amman which was flaky, nicely browned, sweet and tasty. I should say right here, that their pastries are all nicely browned which I greatly appreciate. I grew up with a lot of European style baked goods, in the NYC area, back several decades, and that was the classic style. I did not run into pale American baked goods (usually made with vegetable shortening) until moving further west, where  the midwest influence was stronger. As a baker myself, I believe that browning of baked goods adds a richness to the flavor, allows the butter, sugar and flour to meld and develop a caramelization and tastiness that brings out all the richness of ingredients. For me, this goes for cookies, bread and bagels as well as pastries.

I took home and later consumed through the day, a Kouign Amman with a peach filling, shared a Bretagne bread pudding muffiny thing with peaches, a couple of slices off of my half loaf (yay, they will do this) of New York style rye, and gave my husband his chocolate chip/cashew cookie. He loved the cookie and did not share. But I was really, really full anyway. The muffiny thing was OK, everything else fantastic, with the bread a little denser artisan style than I was used to historically for my rye, but flavor and aroma just perfect. They also have a darker, German style rye, but if you like light (color) rye with caraway seeds, get the NY. They were sampling their sourdough that day but I did not try it. There were several very beautiful loaves of various types of breads in the case and if you go specifically wanting a particular flavor, I think calling ahead would be a good idea. I am going back next week to try their basic croissant and their filled, savory croissants, like ham and cheese.

The counter staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and there were customers in to get their coffees too. Nice place."

But with the kouign amann I brought home from Moxie, he insisted on cutting it EXACTLY in half and would not give me a single extra crumb from his half. (And he just said, &#34;They&#39;re so good it&#39;s kind of upsetting.&#34;) 

My friends and I went to Moxie and ordered a bunch of stuff, and I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I&#39;m sad that it&#39;s in Louisville because then I can&#39;t go every day. On the other hand, I&#39;m happy it&#39;s in Louisville because then I can&#39;t go every day and gain a million pounds and spend all my money on kouign amann. 

Anyway, everything we tried blew us away. Plain kouign amann, tart cherry kouign amann, chocolate fig kouign amann, bialy, grilled cheese, pizza, chai, coffee, and a Sycamore sandwich. WE DIDN&#39;T EAT EVERYTHING RIGHT THEN, OKAY? So, honestly, this bakery just blows all other bakeries out of the water. I&#39;m super picky about baked goods (I once tried to make kouign amann...it was not pretty), and I absolutely could not find fault with anything at Moxie.

Quiz quiz to finish up: Do you like butter? Do you like sugar? Do you like gluten? If you answered no, we are not friends. If you answered yes, go to Moxie. Like, now."

(French butter pastry type thingy). It was so good I finished it before the espresso was done and had to order a second. I feel kinda like a just ate a stick of butter... But, you know, in the good way. A little salty. A little sweet. Crackly on the outside and soft and rich on the inside. 
Steve made a great cappuccino. Steve probably isn&#39;t his real name. I made it up. It was just so good that I feel bad calling him &#34;some guy.&#34; I&#39;ll get his name next time and edit the review.
Steve also sent us away with a sample of ciabatta straight from the oven. I had plans of using it as a hamburger bun for dinner. It didn&#39;t last the 100 ft. walk to the car. Chewy, yeasty, delicious.
I was sad to see the deli that used to occupy this spot close, but I&#39;m not as sad as I was before. Can&#39;t wait to go back."

I got my self serve coffee and croissant and left. The coffee was appalling and the butter croissant was too greasy to eat.

Feels a bit like a living room and the bluegrass playing is a big plus for me. I came here following a coffee at Precision Pourover expecting to grab a baked good based on the reviews and ended up with my second cortado of the morning and a &#34;King egg&#34;. The king egg was unreal. Still warm from the oven, filled with egg, sausage, tomato and provolone cheese. The pastry was flaky and buttery and requires at least three napkins. Absolutely delicious. The cortado was very well done for a bakery, but I won&#39;t lie that Precision does a better one. Nevertheless, if you don&#39;t have time for two stops in the morning, I wouldn&#39;t complain one bit about the cortado here. Not sure where they get their beans but even in the cortado, flavors of fruit and spice really shone. Still very smooth but a small kick on the finish. All in all, great spot.

I was on work travel and not expecting to be followed!). He asked why I left and I explained that it was inferred that I should go, as they weren&#39;t selling anything to eat.

This is almost the exact same menu. There are some differences, but they are superficial. Now this is a good thing since the Brite Spot(s) is considered to be some of the best Mariscos and Mexican fare in all of Southern CA. A place where you expect to find top Comida Mexicana. But sadly....

Los Dos Portillos has a bit of an Acapulco or El Toritos design vibe inside and the tables seem to turn quickly. Service is about the same as well. The restaurant noise level was a bit higher than other like setups, but that&#39;s ok because it adds to the atmosphere. We were eating at the newly opened Highlands Ranch location off Broadway just S of C470.

On this visit we had the Ceviche, Seafood Shrimp and Asada Street Tacos.

Ceviche was OK, but not a complete constructed serving. Lack of attention to detail turned up an uneven mix of the molded serving plate with one side having almost all of the fish, and the other almost all of the veg and aromatics. The lime &#34;dressage&#34; was lacking throughout as well, almost as if they ran out of the day&#39;s prep and scrambled to get new up for service. The fish was not as firm as I would expect after ample time of required &#34;chemical cooking&#34;.

Seafood Shrimp Tacos was more than an ample serving. No lack of shrimp here although the shrimp did taste like it came from a previous frozen state - a couple pieces actually had a tad bit of freezer burn. The plate is served with the shrimp over the top of two flour tortillas. Issue at hand; the shrimp served on top of the torts was VERY moist/wet which make the tortillas soggy by the time it reached our table. At that point they were no longer tacos I&#39;m afraid.

The Asada Street Tacos tasted barely OK, but again there was a lack of detail in the prep and presentation. The tortillas needed to be pan heated more. They need to be almost on the verge of being toasted and remain flexible, not limp steamed or perhaps microwaved 2-plys. The meat itself was again ample, but it tasted as if it were many hours old and then quickly reheated in a pan or flat top before served. I cut a piece of the meat in half and you could see a distinct cooked crust core, surrounded my another crusting of the final cook. 

The plating was all over the place. Of the 4 tacos on the plate, it looked as if the tortillas were plopped on the plate, a generic spoonful of the meat kind of generically covered all 4 tots, and then the same heavy handed doling was done with the onions and cilantro. Very sloppy requiring me properly divi up all the ingredients and put them all evenly across all for thin cornmeal platforms. The hot sauce served with the plate was a pleasant surprise being what tasted like a habanero based treatment - exactly as I would expect from a So. Cal place.

Price wise, the menu is about right. Service wise, it&#39;s as good or slightly better than most. On this particular visit however I did not enjoy myself. But -  I will try it again after a month of so giving this new location time to further settle in. Look for a future update."

We are long time customers and the food is always excellent. We particularly enjoy the carnitas, street tacos, and chili rellenos.  The salsa is spicy, the guacamole fresh, and the flavors good.

I&#39;m only giving three stars because of the takeout. Occasionally, we order extra meals because we live far away and it&#39;s nice to have food ready on a busy night. Unfortunately, our takeout orders have been incomplete on several occasions. When you pay the price of good food, you expect it to be in the bag. The way Los Dos ties up their takeout bags, it&#39;s almost impossible to check your order before you leave without looking paranoid. However, that is what you have to do unless you want to give your money away. It&#39;s happened too often to us to be excused as a simple oversight. Great food but check your bags!"

While the service was good and there were some high lights, my brother&#39;s meal was pretty much inedible, thus 3 stars.

The meal started with chips and salsa. The salsa was spicy and delicious. Our server was nice and helpful when answering our questions, and was excellent in making sure we had plenty of water, chips, and salsa.

My mom and I shared the Los Dos Portrillos Combo plate, making it all vegetarian. The lady told us that the refried beans were not vegetarian, so we did black beans for everything. While we enjoyed our plate, and were quite presently surprised by how good just simple black beans were, no flavors were out of this world or unique. And it was quite messy. Kind of middle of the road. 

My brother ordered the fried pork burritos, and it was pretty gross looking and in taste for him. A majority of the pork bits were rock solid and tough, deeming inedible. When we inquired to the waitress if this was normal, she said it was. This was almost unbelievable and it should have been taken off the bill as my brother was obviously displeased. 

Overall, this is an ok Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa were the highlight of the meal.

My mom and I would have appreciated a vegetarian section on the menu or an easier way to see what is vegetarian such as a symbol."

PROS: Arrived at 6 pm and was seated right away. Drink and meal orders taken quickly even though the restaurant was packed. Chips were disappointing, but the salsa was delicious with a tiny &#34;bite&#34; to it. 

I ordered a combo plate with a Chile relleno, chicken enchilada, and a beef taco. The Chile relleno was excellent. The chicken enchilada was jam packed with chicken.

Hubby ordered the steak ranchero. It was cooked a perfect medium rare. The sauce covering it was excllent.

CONS: Beef taco was greasy and flavorless. Chicken enchilada, although packed with chicken, also lacked flavor. The steak, although cooked well, was very tough and chewy. Perhaps because they butterflied it to cook it quickly? Beans and rice also lacked flavor.

BOTTOM LINE: Based on reviews, I expected  better food. Will come back one more time just to make sure our first visit here wasn&#39;t just an unlucky fluke."

We went on July4th and they were absolutely slammed and the staff was running back and forth so I felt bad about it to begin with.  

I ordered a horchata and the Los Dos Potrillos Combo.  The combo plate was enormous and was served with a tamale, beef crispy taco, bean tostada, cheese enchilada and beans and rice.  I ate the taco and tostada and boxed the other two items up because it&#39;s way too much for one person.  However, I did make room for the beans and rice.   The beans were heavenly and velvety smooth.  The chips and salsa at the beginning were a perfect compliment to the horchata which was some of the best I&#39;ve had in the Denver area.  It was ice cold, creamy and super cinnamon filled.

My husband ordered the #19 which was a smothered chicken burrito stuffed with beans and rice and topped with a sauce and sour cream and guacamole.

Keep in mind they seem to run a wait most of the time, seems to be without a doubt on nights &amp; weekends (but it&#39;s not too long of a wait).  We went in at 5pm on a Tuesday, 8pm on a Friday, and 11am on a Saturday and each time they were on a wait, even with the good amount of tables they have.  This tells you how good the place is!  

Service is fast, but not too fast, and the staff is super friendly and accommodating.  They even brought some extra tortillas at no extra charge!  They all seem to love their job and this is the best part about dining here, aside from the food.

Every dish my friends and I have tried has been outstanding.  Namely the Chili Relleno Nachos (how clever!), Guisado (spicy goodness and a lot of veggies), Street Tacos (get a combo of chicken, pork, and beef - all were good), Chicken Enchiladas (they don&#39;t skimp on the chicken!), Mole Enchiladas, Carnitas Chilaquiles (only avail weekends), and the Flan.

I tend to judge a lot of restaurants by their drinks, especially margaritas because it&#39;s not too authentic to me to pour marg mix out of a box - and the flavor usually isn&#39;t that great either.  They are average here - boring marg mix and not strong enough.  If they amped up their margarita game, Los Dos Portrillos would get 5 stars from me."

We found ourselves on a last minute vacation to the mile high city. As we were leaving, we decided to dine at our favorite mexican place in Denver, La Fogata II. Unfortunately, it was shut down for Memorial Day. So in comes this place.......

This place was bumping. They told us that it would be a 20 minute wait (which only ended out lasting around 10 minutes), so we ordered a margarita at the bar. These were delicious. Im not sure if we came in during happy hour or something, but the margaritas were huge and only cost 14.50 for two. 

On to the food, I had a fajita plate that contained beef, chicken, and shrimp. This was very good and worth the ~$20 it cost. Their chips and salsa were also amazing and staff was quick to refill drinks and chips. 

My only complaint about this place was that the service was a little bit slow, which could have been just a matter of them being short staffed (there was a sign in the window). Other than that, this definitely ranks among the best mexican food that I have every eaten. If you are in the Mile High City and are looking for some killer mexican food, this is place to go. There was also a cool looking mini-golf place in the opposite corner of the shopping center that is on my to do list (margaritas then mini-golf???? hmmmmm?) Muy Bueno!"

I almost never write reviews because of the time it takes but I always check Yelp when I am in the areas for food so I feel obligated to write this one.

I visit this place about once a week and have been for a few years. Mostly on weekends because I am addicted to the carnitas. The chili relleno nachos are fantastic as well. My wife loves the street tacos and my kids the chicken burritos. My favorite server is Christian. 

If you are a Margarita lover then I suggest you get the top shelf Marg and have a designated driver. The make great drinks.

So, let&#39;s look at my usual Mexican food criteria:

1. Green chile: I barely had any of this at Los Dos. I expected it would be on my chile relleno, but it wasn&#39;t. I can&#39;t really judge it, but I can say that I wish I had sauce!

2. Chile rellenos: Amazing! The relleno here was so deliciously fried and had a nice flavor. It did feel a bit greasy, but let&#39;s be honest, that&#39;s what makes these so good. I just wish there had been more sauce on it.

3. Enchilada: For the first time in a long time I got a chicken enchilada instead of plain cheese. Wow. That was an excellent decision as the chicken was so moist and flavorful. I loved it.

4. Chips and salsa: The salsa here was hella spicy. I love spicy food, but this was a bit much for me. I found myself reaching for quite a few plain chips to cool down my mouth, which were not that special to be honest. 

5. Margarita: Yum! This margarita was so good. We each had a couple and they were not heartburn-inducing!

Overall Los Dos is great. I would love to go again. I was especially fond of the atmosphere and I like that the waiters spoke Spanish to us. There was some confusion among the food runners/bussers and waiters, as we asked multiple people for more chips and salsa before we got some and the same went for to-go boxes."

From 4:30 on the lines are outrageous, the wait as long as 1 1/2 hours, it&#39;s noisy as heck for dinner, the salsa is so hot that I&#39;ve seen people have horrible reactions to the stuff, it&#39;s a bit dingy in there.

They do something that I haven&#39;t seen restaurants do since I was very young. They bring you a glass of water with the chips and salsa. I remember being impressed by this when I was just a child, and literally no one does this anymore.

No one my age stays at a job that long, so clearly they&#39;re doing several things right. I started in the end of my junior year in high school and after graduating college and finding my career in marketing, I had to say goodbye to the amazing coworkers, amazing food, and  lively energy of Los Dos. 

In 6 years I never got tired of the food here. I was stuck on the burrito supreme for nearly a year! I love the #10 combo. The enchiladas in salsa verde is also incredible. If you are going for a healthy option the salad here is actually very flavorful as well. The green chili is to die for and comes on many of the meals. 

Everything is always fresh. From seeing kitchen operations first hand, I can assure you, the cooks are always very busy and do an outstanding job of being efficient with your order while maintaining high quality.

The range in prices makes this restaurant appealing to a wide demographic of people. You can order an impressive T-Bone steak, my dad&#39;s favorite, or you can order a smaller yet filling a la carte item, which is located on the back of the menu.

I have served a wide range of customers here. I have served some local celebrities, which was very cool. This is a great family restaurant. It is great for dates as well. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, this place is always pretty busy, for a good reason, people love it here. 

For reviewers who feel overwhelmed by the menu, I encourage you to ask your server for clarification, most servers have worked here for a while. They will be able to help you decide what to order.

This restaurant is very near and dear to my heart. I would highly recommend coming here for any occasion. I still try to make it to this side of town once a week and stop in. There is a great energy about this place, it feels like home."

Now the only Downside....  Of all the great Mexican restaurant I have been too this is a top one or two,  however their salsa is not even in the top 50, way too chunky, too watery, and just blah.  They need to add a nice spicey not chunky salsa and a nice smoky spicey not chunky offering, and most importantly not watery.

If you can forgive the salsa the food, margs, and atmosphere is a 5.  Salsa is a 1 overall  a 4.5"

This place - EVERYTHING was spicy. Usually, at a Mexican restaurant you can choose if you want to order spicy or not. Here, you do not get that option. 

My husband really loves spicy food. He said he enjoyed it. I, personally, do not enjoy having my mouth feel like it&#39;s on fire &amp; not being able to taste the flavors in the food bothers me. I scraped all the hot stuff off my tamale and the flavor was great. But, still. If you love the flavors of Mexican food w/o the spice - this place is NOT for you. If you want the heat - you&#39;ll love it.

The wait - we did call ahead seating on a Friday night and had to wait about 45 min. Expect a wait.

Margaritas - I got a Strawberry Margarita on the rocks. It was great. It was strong and I didn&#39;t even notice intil the end of it. Lol. Good tequila.

Im not trying to knock this place bc of my personal preference.  When I reviewed it before I went, I wish I had seen someone warning off wusses like me who can&#39;t handle spice. For everyone else, enjoy."

I&#39;m huge Mexican food fan and have been coming here since it opened.  I will admit, I love finding the dicey hole in the wall Mexican food restaurants to find good food and I will drive to the ghettos to find them.  Happy to say, this is not one of those places!  This is a great area and location.

Food is of course always great!  Service can be a bit lagging but not because the staff isn&#39;t working hard.  This place gets VERY busy especially on the weekends.  So if you don&#39;t mind waiting 45 min to an hour then your good.  They have a nice bar area you can wait in and their margs are nice and strong!  

Normally I would give a restaurant like this 4 stars due to the overwhelming wait times.  However, the food is too darn good so 5 stars!  If I can offer any suggestions to the restaurant it would be to expand and take over one of their neighbors to accommodate the growing popularity.  Or move close by to a larger building."

Los Dos Portillos passed with flying colors -- the tableside guac was fantastic and our server made it with style and friendly conversation. My trip there was a spur-of-the-moment decision while my sister was visiting, and this place was a great find. We had thought about calling to order take-out, but when I saw &#34;Guacamole Served Tableside&#34; on the menu, I knew we just had to go there. We each had the steak quesadilla, and ended up taking home a lot of food. They were the best I&#39;ve ever had. 

My only negative comment, not worth taking away a star, was that my frozen margarita tasted like it had no tequila in it at all. It was more like a liquid Popsicle. It was taken away and replaced with one that was only slightly better. At least I didn&#39;t have to worry about driving home afterward because I wasn&#39;t even a tiny bit buzzed. I think next time I go, I may ask for my shot of tequila on the side so I can add it myself.

All in all, though, this was a restaurant that I think will be my new favorite place. The food was excellent and the service was great. I hope they will reconsider their stinginess with the alcohol.

Update: I returned with a friend (who was born and raised in Mexico) and she gave the food a thumbs up. We both thought the margaritas were weak and our server gladly brought us more tequila. I finally realized that it wasn&#39;t the amount of tequila that was the problem; it was the mix that is way too sweet. I&#39;ll have a different drink next time I go there. The food really is so good, the drinks don&#39;t matter."

The first time we went, we sat in the dining room where 5 servers stood around and stared at us without ever coming over to take our order.  So we went into the bar where the bartender could not even tell us what the Happy Hour specials were.  So we left.  The second time, we were sat in a booth in the bar where it took 10 minutes for the bartender to take our drink order.  The bartender could not tell me what was in the burrito supreme, so he had to ask a server to tell me.  It sounded good, but when it was delivered, there was so much grease floating on the cheese and the hamburger filling was extremely salty and not flavorful.  My wife ordered an appetizer which included a side of tortillas.  We had to return a tortilla because there was mold on it.  Very disgusting, and with no apology from any form of management.   We won&#39;t be back."

I always judge a mexican restaurant by it&#39;s Salsa right off the bat. Los Dos Portrillos did not disappoint! Had a little after kick to it and great flavor. The waitress was around frequently to refill our chips and salsa (which we need a lot of).

Food did not disappoint either. Ordered the chicken fajitas and they came out sizzling. Chicken was seasoned well and the meal was delicious. I tried a bite of the beef burrito and the meat was also very well seasoned and tasty.

I ordered a regular house margarita. They brought me out a strawberry one (why they lost .5 star) but I drank it anyways. Delicious, not very strong, a little too sweet for my liking.

The service has always been spot on and everyone is always smiling.

We stopped here randomly, looking for a place to go out. My first indicator that we were in the right place was that on a Thursday, we had to wait nearly an hour for a table (call ahead and grab a drink when you arrive, they have great margaritas). After sitting down, they brought out chips and salsa, which passed our foodie test. Everything to date that we have ever ordered exceeded our expectations. My husband typically orders the Land/Sky Fajita plate, and my favorite was their breakfast Chilaquiles plate.

Now I know you&#39;re thinking, &#34;Who goes to a Mexican restaurant and orders chile cheese fries?&#34; Don&#39;t question it, just get them. They are INCREDIBLE! The key here is that it&#39;s &#34;chile&#34; not &#34;chili.&#34; Somehow they manage to keep the fries somewhat crispy even though they&#39;re smothered with green chile, which tastes delicious and has a little kick. And they are more than generous with Monterey jack and cheddar cheeses that are combined and baked over it for your cheesy, melty pleasure. This combination reaches a perfect, savory balance that is unparalleled by any other similar dish I&#39;ve had. Then again, I&#39;ve never had anything quite like this.

The rest of the food was terrific. I&#39;ve been there twice and I know that both times the everything my table ordered was excellent. Most recently, I got the steak quesadilla. The steak was cooked perfectly, tender and flavorful. I really want to try the fajitas, which looked amazing when the table next to us got them. And one of these days, I&#39;m going to go on a Friday or Saturday when they have the carnitas, which I hear is delicious. They only have it on those days though. I live in New York and just come here to visit, so I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back. 

The atmosphere is really pleasant and laid back. I don&#39;t usually like going to restaurants in strip malls. I find that they tend to feel a little dirty and trashy, but the second you walk in, you&#39;re surrounded by a friendly, cozy environment, complete with authentic Mexican music playing faintly in the background. Nothing is overdone or in-your-face, and nothing about this place feels cheap or grimy.

The service is wonderful! We had two women keeping tabs on our table to make sure our needs were met. They were attentive and efficient, kept our glasses full and brought out our fresh food at just the right times. As I mentioned, I live in New York, and I was there with my sister, so we had some catching up to do. We were there for nearly two hours, and at no point did we feel rushed or like they were trying to get rid of us. They kept refilling our glasses long after we were done eating and let us gab away. That&#39;s something I particularly appreciated.

In summary, this place is all around wonderful. Great food, great atmosphere, great service. Don&#39;t forget to order the chile cheese fries!!"

I had the carne asada, which was a good portion and perfectly cooked.  All the veggies on the plate were cooked,just the right amount.

I am a strict pescatarian  due to serious health issues and simply cannot eat pork. Well guess what was in my shrimp burrito? PORK!!! Had to immediately spit out my food and discard the dish. My boyfriend ordered his dish without lettuce and tomato, by now I&#39;m sure you can inherently guess that as expected, it came with lettuce and tomato.

Carnation restaurant is in an unassuming location but the packed parking lot and small wait inside are an indication you are in for a treat.  

The menu is extensive but I quickly settled on the chili relleno skillet and the hubs went with the special of the day which was a beef skillet with jalepenos, eggs and potatoes.  We both got potatoes with our meal and they were as we love them to be.  Thin slices of potato that are griddled; you get a nice crisp and soft balance when they are shaved like that.

The chili rellenos were also quite good and mixed with the green chili, egg, potato and an extra side of avocado, it was perfect.  Originally I declined the toast/tortilla side, but after a persistent waitress, I went with the corn tortillas.  These are no ordinary corn tortillas but rather soft pillows of freshness that rival any authentic Mexican restaurant.  I was beyond full but still ate them and enjoyed every bite.  

The hubs enjoyed his skillet very much as well as the bottomless cups of coffee.  He didn&#39;t finish his meal, not because he didn&#39;t enjoy it, but because it was a huge serving of delicious food.  In short, we have added Carnation to our round of diners to frequent!"

One noteworthy thing worth pointing out:
This place certainly attracts Broncos fans. We went on a Sunday, and everyone working and eating there had on orange and blue. So if you&#39;re a football fan who likes another team, you might be an unwanted outsider. We don&#39;t follow football (gasp, I know), but even still, it was a little surprising to see so many Broncos fans in one breakfast establishment."

We came at 9 a.m. on a Sunday and the speed of service was set to hyperdrive; I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like it. Normally I move through life at a pretty fast pace and am appreciative of restaurants that don&#39;t dawdle, but this may have been just a *teeny* bit too fast -- we felt rushed/anxious by all the scurrying around us (this also may have been to blame for my slightly undercooked poached eggs?).

Still, we felt well attended to and never wanted for anything. Coffee was refilled frequently, our server checked on us at just the right intervals, and the check was dropped at an appropriate point in the meal. It&#39;s hard to complain; we&#39;ll absolutely be back."

Danny and his family are great proprietors, always happy to see familiar faces. They take pride in their restaurant and it definitely shows in the food and the service.

I&#39;ve come here close to a dozen times for breakfast. Their omelettes are so good I have a hard time straying and trying something different. But I also have had their enormous breakfast burrito. Their green chile, which smothers some omelettes as well as their burrito, is outstanding. 

Portions are generous, coffee and other beverages are very attentively refilled. Danny&#39;s Carnation is the kind of place where you feel like a regular on your first visit, and every subsequent visit.

Pro tip: ask for a side of their house-made red and green salsas. The red is mild, the green brings the heat. Both are terrific with damn near anything."

I love a good breakfast joint.  You know the kind I mean.  If you want artistic Bloody Marys with ironic artwork and overpriced dishes named after vintage vinyl, please go elsewhere. 

If you want good, honest, American, diner-style foods that&#39;ll fill you up and make you happy without the presumptuous attitude of so many other &#34;Trendy&#34; spots in the 303... You&#39;ve found your home.

Packed to the gills at 10:30am on a weekday.  Always a good sign.  People from all walks of life fill the booths and tables.  Hungover twenty somethings, blue-collar hard workers, families, locals who wandered in after having it bookmarked on Yelp for like 4 years (ahem. me.)  The parking lot is always as full as my tummy was as I rolled out the door.

If you try nothing else, get their house-made Corned Beef Hash.  Because OMG.  Sliced potatoes crisped up with diced onions and shredded corned beef on a plate big enough to make any Grandma happy on Thanksgiving.  And, you know, in case that&#39;s not enough for you, it also comes with two eggs.  Two.  (I got them over-medium and let that oozy yolk permeate the hash, dashed on some Tapatio hot sauce, and went to town.)  But wait, there&#39;s more!  Choose a biscuit, toast, or Hot Cakes!  Well, DUH, I got me some Hot Cakes.  Slather &#39;em up with the margarine and Log Cabin (it&#39;s a roadside diner, folks, not Vermont.) and go to TOWN.  Oh, and that&#39;s all less than $10.  Don&#39;t miss my photo of this ridiculous feast, y&#39;all.  I took half of it home, of course, and let me tell you, that hash was amazing even micro-reheated and slathered with brown mustard for dinner.

We came at 9:30 am on a Friday and there was a little wait. Spinach omelette was delicious and I wish I had ordered that but my friend gave me a bite. I ordered the California Benedict which was a mistake as I forget dives don&#39;t do hollandaise sauce very well. My mistake. I imagine the pancakes are delicious and think I&#39;ll be back to try em.

I got the chicken fried steak w/ a short stack and a side of green chili. This was the best chicken fried steak I&#39;ve ever had. The steak was so tender I didn&#39;t have to use a knife. The potato and eggs (OM) were cooked to perfection. The pancakes were light and the batter had just the right amount of sugar. Based on other reviews I had to try a side of the green chili. This is how green chili should be made. Some of the best green chili I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ll be back!

The nachos were fantastic the ribeye was undercooked the gravy was so-so on the mashed potatoes.. The waitress who was phenomenal took out order but the steak came it was severely under cooked and the shrimp was nonexistent. The manager however came over and took the nachos off of our bill because he felt bad because the shrimp didn&#39;t come at the same time.  His name is Danny and he&#39;s real good dude so he basically saved this review with excellent customer service. My opinion is that maybe ribeye was the wrong thing to order here this is more of a cheeseburger chicken fried steak place but all in all the managers awesome the waitress was awesome food came out quick so I give them four stars

I know not everyone will appreciate this but they are very fast and efficient. Friendly but in a militaristic sort of way. Coffee and water were refilled constantly and service was overall great but not extremely warm. 

Food is diner food on the moderate end of the spectrum. Their specialty is mochaka or something like that. It&#39;s good but looks terrible with glistening clear corn starch based green chili spilling over the edge of the plate. It tastes nice but in a you were cooking breakfast in a single skillet at 2am while really high sort of way. 

The biggest disappointment is that the gravy, like most diners, is made from the instant gravy that everyone uses. Scratch that. The biggest disappointment was the chicken fried steak. The meat tasted off. A tad funky. A bit dry aged in the freezer. 

All that said, a solid four stars because we paid $23 for two and ate way too much food. And like I said the place hums. I like that."

In fact I&#39;ve lived in Lakewood for most of the last 20 years, driven by this place a million times and never thought about stopping by, honestly, it looked like a &#34;dive-y&#34; diner. The restaurant is not far from our doctor&#39;s office and a few weeks ago my wife had to fast overnight for her physical. She was hungry when she got done with her appointment and decided to stop by Danny&#39;s for a quick breakfast. She had the California Benedict and told me that night that it was the best eggs Benedict she had ever had. She took her mom there recently, my MIL had the corned beef hash at the servers suggestion (although she&#39;s not a huge fan of cornered beef) and she said it was DELICIOUS. This morning we went there for breakfast (my first time). I had the regular eggs Benedict with the Canadian bacon. O.M.G. The BEST eggs Benedict I&#39;ve EVER had (and I&#39;ve had a lot, eggs Benedict is usually my go to breakfast item when we go out)! The hollandaise sauce was homemade with a perfect balance of creaminess and tanginess and the Canadian bacon was smoky and delicious, the hash browns are homemade and scrumptious. My wife had the heuvos rancheros (homemade refried beans and green chili, WOW) and my MIL had the pigs in a blanket, the pancakes were fluffy and delicious.  The owner Danny and his wife were both working in the restaurant and made a point to greet us, introduced themselves and thanked us for patronizing their establishment. Service was also great. Food came fast and hot, our server has a smile on her face the whole time and made a point to hug some older patrons that were clearly regulars. This will definitely be a go to breakfast spot for us!"

We were promptly seated. Wait staff was nice, several young girls in Broncos shirts all worked together to make sure you got what you needed.

I was not super excited about the food, I think there was a lot of margarine, which I expect for diner prices. Breakfast choices, are between 8$ and 10$. I had a standard breakfast, and it was okay, everything was cooked well, but it was average. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito, and it was satisfying.

I ordered the country steak skillet with green chiles ( honestly forgot the name). It was delicious and filling. 

My son had the blueberry cakes which he loved.the portion was rediculously huge and he has something to snack on later.

Overall my visit was pleasant and the food was very good. Danny the owner should be proud of his staff as they are some of the friendliest diner staff in Denver. Believe me I have been searching the whole city.

It had ok food and wasn&#39;t that expensive, and maybe the best part, great service. Then the management changed. The food got expensive but not better, and the service got a lot worse.

I understand that servers have it rough, but what finally did it for me was watching them basically cuss out my mom and throw her out forever because she asked if she could have her food cooked properly. It wasn&#39;t just that it wasn&#39;t cooked to order, it was undercooked. The owner himself told her never to come back.

There is a base level of customer service that one should be able to expect at a restaurant. My mom wasn&#39;t rude, she just didn&#39;t want to get sick eating raw eggs. 

I would suggest maybe finding another place for breakfast, or only going here when they don&#39;t have anybody else there- maybe they won&#39;t be so overwhelmed."

We ordered take out about an hour before they closed.  Our order consisted of a couple chicken tacos, a ground beef burrito and the breakfast burrito supreme.  We&#39;ve been on the hunt for a good Mexican joint in the Lakewood area for quite a while now and haven&#39;t had any luck - this was no different.  The chicken tacos were bland and had no seasoning - the most overpowering taste in the taco were the corn tortillas, which I wasn&#39;t even aware they had as the tortillas looked like flour.  My husband ate the ground beef burrito and was just as disappointed, telling me that there was absolutely NO seasoning in the beef.  Honestly, I think Taco Bell has more flavor - and they would have been MUCH cheaper.  

The Breakfast Burrito supreme wasn&#39;t bad.  It also tasted like it had minimal flavor.  I wound up adding ketchup to the meal to get some more taste out of it.

Now I&#39;m not sure if this was just an off night, or they don&#39;t try as hard when you&#39;re getting it to go, or they just have the &#34;left-over&#34; stuff for the last hour ... but, unfortunately, my husband and I will not be back again to test that theory out."

It&#39;s a small neighborhood diner with a truck stop feel. We used to go a couple times a month, but I try to not go in the winter anymore because of their lack of hygiene. The guy who brings your beverage is also the busser. So he will take all the plates, cups, and glasses off a table and hold them by the rim where people drank. Then he will turn around and pour you water or soda without washing his hands. Once I saw him vacuuming a bit, and he had a problem with the vacuum. He picked it up and tried to fix the belt on the bottom for awhile. And then without washing his hands, he brought a table some drinks. Yikes. I have been surprised these aren&#39;t health code violations, maybe Colorado is more lax.

Some of the dishes are flavorful and there are a lot of choices. But don&#39;t get the &#34;blintzes&#34;."

Busy place.

Little afraid of touching plates or anything this one server handled bc one of the servers had a wrapped hand and could see dried blood that probably at one point dripped down her arm earlier that morning.

My 3 year old and 55 year grandpa do not eat the same size portions which were small and no vegetable to complete meal."

That alone merits 5 stars. I&#39;m here now at least monthly, sometimes weekly. I almost always get the chicken fried steak, but shake things up with both green chili and gravy. I&#39;ve never seen the bottom of my coffee mug here, and the coffee is surprisingly good for a diner-like establishment. 

Danny runs a tight ship - they&#39;re open, he&#39;s there. And he&#39;s not above busing tables. His staff is awesome and the food is consistently first-rate. 

Can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu. However, I&#39;m not the biggest fan of their pancakes - a little rubbery. That said, I can&#39;t help getting them as an add-on with my chicken fried steak."

It&#39;s tiny, it&#39;s divey, the waitresses are charming, and your coffee cup is always full. It&#39;s everything I want in a diner. The food is great. I recommend getting anything with green chile on it--especially the chile relleno skillet. So. Damn. Delicious. I swear every time I come here my entire family orders some form of chile relleno because they are amazing here. 

I just can&#39;t think of a place I&#39;d rather go for breakfast. The breakfast quesadilla is wonderful. The standard breakfast items are great, too. I&#39;ve never been here for lunch or dinner, so I&#39;m curious to try some of their other food. I&#39;m certain it&#39;s wonderful.

Do not let the exterior scare you away from this place! Go in and enjoy the amazing food!"

The &#34;hungry man&#34; includes eggs (barely warm - had one bite), biscuits and gravy (cold - one bite), bacon (cooked - ate that), ham (warm - one bite), sausage link (hot - ate that), and hash browns (hot but not brown - just smashed undercooked potatoes - two bites).  The waitress offered to &#34;nuke&#34; what I had left (which was basically everything).  Umm, no thanks. But they were nice enough to to take the coffee off my tab (one of the few things served hot).  So I went ahead and took the tip off the tab.

I used to think this was an old car parts store and passed it many times until one day we had a friend in town and wanted some delicious breakfast grub. We found carnation on Yelp and knew we couldn&#39;t pass this up with the raving reviews.

It owned up to every single positive review and MORE! Seriously, if I could give this place 10 stars, I would.  

The service is so prompt and fast, I almost couldn&#39;t drink my coffee because I had a refill after every couple sips and it stayed so hot.  The food is every bit as amazing as the price. 

This place has some seriously good customer service. The owner, Danny, came over to our table and we had a wonderful conversation with him. His passion for his customers and what he does was so admirable. 

I just can&#39;t get over what a great experience we had at this local breakfast joint that reminded me of hitting the diner in the morning with my dad growing up.

I will be back countless times.

PS The country fried steak is amazing, and the skillets are amazing, and the green chili is amazing....heck, it&#39;s ALL amazing!!"

You walk in, and you don&#39;t expect the quality in food to be that great.   Their exterior and interior is deceiving, as their food is wonderful. I&#39;m from the east coast and we have tons of diners, but I&#39;ve been missing them in Denver.  It is almost like a Diner.  Breakfast is great, their steaks are great, fries come out hot, and burgers look delicious (even though I have never had them)    Employees are very friendly too!

Also you can tell they are supporters of our local sports! 

The service was top notch and I might go as far to say it was some of the best service I have ever had! The entire staff was in tune with each other with making sure we had everything we could need or want. Even the owner as you read in many reviews is very involved and even chased us outside when we forgot our to go box.

Now for the food, the portions are very hearty, it comes out hot and not heat lamp hot fresh hot! I had the Breakfast burrito and a side of biscuits and sausage gravy, the gravy was delicious and  the biscuits were fluffy. The misses had the steak and eggs with the country potato&#39;s. Also very impressive the steak was not dry like a lot of breakfast places can do.

This place lives up to the promise of the reviews and I would Highly recommend it!"

This place is a diner of the &#34;greasy spoon&#34; variety - the best kind of diner says this lifelong Jersey girl. The food is heavy, the portions are HUGE, the price is cheap and the service is bad@ss. And the food came out so quickly I thought it might be the wrong order!

The staff is amazing, always stopping by to see how the food is, if you need refills, etc. - very on top of things.

We were attracted by the valet parking and the reviews.

The food was good.  We had the chips and tiger shrimp appetizers.  The chips were a little bland for my taste, but the salsa and guacamole were excellent.  The shrimp appetizer was incredible!

I had the Cubano sandwich, and it was SO good!  The fries were thin and crispy - just how I like them.  My friends were very complimentary of their entrees, as well.

The only reason that I did not give Degree five stars was that the service was just a little bit slow.  The place was not extremely crowded, so no excuse there.

Located right in the hotel of Courtyard Marriott, is a beautiful modern looking restaurant and bar. Outdoor seating available and in a nice secluded spot from the busy street. Inside there is a bar and an upstairs area. The wait staff was nice, and did well with everyone there for the Mammoth event. The menu does change, I looked online prior to eating there and found something that sounded good but when we arrived it was no longer on the menu. The menu is not very big at all just some selective choices for the bar. However the menu does cater to a good amount of people. I got the Vegan veggie burger, which is nice that they note it is vegan just because I can&#39;t have dairy. Other American bar food choices were on the menu as well. The food is good and hot when arriving not to mention pretty fast service.

The Brussels sprouts were very good. The sever was very attentive at first then lacked in Service as our meal continued. My girlfriend and I had a hard time choosing from the menu so we asked the sever and followed his recommendations. I had the ramen and I could not eat it lucky my girlfriend liked it enough to eat a few bites of it so I didn&#39;t have to send it back. she got a chicken sandwich which I ended up eating, well I eat the chicken the bacon and tomatoes cuze there was so much aoil  on the bun and lettuce was just overwhelming. The soba noodles salad was very good and was very nice the cook made the exception to our menu substitution.  We then proceeded to order a desert that was also recommended by the server, after our sever argued with the cook for five minutes he came back to give his explanation for no dessert and my girlfriend said &#34;well just take the check thank you.&#34; The open kitchen revealed that the oven had been turned off and we&#39;d not be getting a dessert.

Our waiter was like a deer in the headlights and completely forgot to put in our order and then lied to us twice about it by saying &#34;oh, I see it the window, it will be right up&#34; and then disappearing. At 7:25 he rushed by and dropped off the chips and guacamole that we ordered over an hour ago, which we had to gulp down and then rush out to make it to the concert. We never got our food, so I can&#39;t review its quality, and then we never saw our waiter again either. What a complete waste of time and money, I will never go to this place again.

My boyfriend and I were able to get a reservation last week to celebrate our anniversary thanks to the concierge at the hotel where I work. Working in the Hospitality industry, you know good service when you see it- and Hop Alley has it. 

We were seated right away and greeted by our server. She was super nice and helpful as it was our first time dining there. The ambiance is super laid back, which came as somewhat of a surprise considering the amount of praise they have received recently. 

They actually gave us a complimentary Champagne toast to celebrate our Anniversary. Such a nice surprise!

The food...oh, man. So. Good. We ordered the pickled veggies, bone marrow fried rice and the suan ni pork chop. It was all amazing, but the pork stood above the rest. I&#39;d go back for the pork alone. 2 entrees and the pickled veggies were enough to fill us up with no leftovers- but I&#39;d want to get 3 next time just to be able to try more of their amazing food!

Overall a great place for a date night dinner or with a few friends."

My wife and I always check 5280&#39;s top list and try them all out.  We&#39;ve never been as disappointed as we were with Hop Alley.  Many of the entrees were not that inspired and just not up the the wonderful standard set by our fantastic Denver food scene.  We tried nearly everything on the menu and will say the eggplant and pig ears were very good.  The bone marrow fried rice was really lacking any rich flavors that I expected with bone marrow.  The friend chicken seemed to lack much flavor at all and seemed to be overly spiced to make up for it.  

However, the staff was great and we had a really fun time.  They did have some shareable drinks which can be a bit gimmicky but we just went with it and the party atmosphere."

We put our names in at around 6.30pm, and didn&#39;t actually sit down to eat until almost 9pm - that&#39;s an almost 2.5 hour wait, which is crazy. The waitress was apologetic about it and the food was worth the wait, I saw several tables of diners who&#39;d been seated when we&#39;d put our name in still there over two hours later - so the turnover must&#39;ve just been really slow.

Anyway, wait aside, everything else at Hop Alley was pretty excellent. We were told 3-4 dishes for 2 people, and ordered 4 dishes plus the pickles - and it was so much food (we had a ton of leftovers). We ordered the pig ear salad, beef chow fun, la zi ji (fried chicken), the eggplant, and the yen tsai (pickles). The portions are actually quite generous for the price.

The pig ear salad and la zi ji were the standouts - the salad was the perfect balance of freshness / lightness and richness (from the fried strips of pig ear), and the la zi ji were not particularly spicy (I eat a lot of very spicy food), but had a strong ginger flavour and the mouth numbing sensation from Sichuan pepper. The pickles, too, were excellent - and a great value for only $3. The beef chow fun was pretty standard Chinese fare - though the steak that topped it was beautifully rare and cooked and seasoned perfectly. The eggplant texture was very slippery (I don&#39;t typically eat steamed eggplant), and the sauce was nice and well-balanced with plenty of umami flavour, but it wasn&#39;t my favourite dish of the evening. 

The drinks we ordered were delicious and not sweet at all - which I appreciate. The service we received was attentive and engaged, and the food came out of the kitchen with surprising quickness - except the eggplant, which came last - about twenty minutes after everything else (and by that time we were already stuffed). As others have mentioned, it&#39;s loud in here - so perhaps not a good first date spot, but my partner isn&#39;t a big talker, and we mostly spent our time here inhaling the food in front of us.

My only qualm about the whole place is that the rice (which is brought out in a paper takeout box) was quite dry and not sufficiently sticky, like it had sit in the rice cooker too long. It&#39;s a minor detail, but I was surprised that a restaurant of this standard would have lousy steamed rice.

We&#39;ll be back - I have so many dishes I still need to try, particularly the seafood ones."

The one thing that I always wished Denver had was a restaurant that highlighted Szechuan cuisine and now they have Hop Alley! If you&#39;ve never had Szechuan food before, it&#39;s basically Asian/Chinese food that doesn&#39;t shy away from spice! Your nose will run and your mouth will feel numb but that&#39;s part of the experience, and the food is so good that you won&#39;t care.

This place gets packed, so either show up early, or prepare to wait for 30-45 min for a table (but it&#39;s worth the wait, I promise). The space has a contemporary, swanky vibe. And every staff member that we spoke to that night was insanely friendly and upbeat - you can tell they all really enjoy working there.

And the food...OMG! The portion sizes are very generous so we had some lefovers to take home. They also bring you a big Chinese to-go box of steamed rice and place it on your table when your food arrives which I thought was a fun touch. We ordered:

- Yen Tsai: Daily selection of pickled veggies. This was great for sharing and fun to munch on while we waited for our food.
- Dan Dan Mian: Spicy ground pork noodles with a poached egg on top. If you like noodles and don&#39;t mind the heat, this is your dish! Very flavorful.
- Beijing Duck Rolls: The duck was cooked perfectly and rolled in between scallion pancakes. Great flavor all around and loved the scallion pancakes! They were buttery, flaky, and paired great with the duck.
- La Zi Ji: This is a very popular Szechuan dish. BEWARE BECAUSE IT IS SPICY! Felt like my mouth lit on fire but I couldn&#39;t stop eating it because it tasted so good! Just picture pieces of fried chicken in a big bowl full of dried chilis and Szechuan peppers."

Advice #1: call to make reservations. Although this not one of those lines out the door and around the block type of places, it is quaint and there can definitely be a wait. We were lucky and found a spot at the bar which is first come first served. The host up front is super friendly and willing to help. 

#2: order everything. No but really... Just order everything. This place is a fusion place and does everything so right. This is not an authentic Chinese place but that&#39;s the whole point! 

-Suan Ni Bai Rou- garlic pork chop: what a great versio of this classic dish. They cut up a real pork chop vs. slices of pork belly. The sauce was balanced. Nice hints of garlic and sweetness and spice. Nothing overpowered anything. Blended nicely. Loved the bean spouts. 

-Beijing Duck Rolls- not your typical Beijing Duck... It tasted more like Smoked Tea Duck aka as Za Chang Ya. Scallion pancakes were good and the 5 smoked hoisin sauce was delicious. 

-Chilled tofu- this reminded me of Dan Dan noodles except over tofu. Great fusion item. We paired this with the following item. 

-La Zhi Ji (Spicy Chicken)- this is big chunks of fried chicken tossed in dried chili and peppercorn and amazingness. The spice level starts low but as you eat the chicken, it creeps up on you real quick. I&#39;m glad we ate it with the chilled tofu. 

-Drinks are well balanced. 
-Simple menu 
-quick and on point service 
-awesome place to check out"

I&#39;d been wanting to give this place a go for months and fortunately the stars finally aligned last Thursday.  We were seated at the community table thereby avoiding a wait.  While I often feel that situations like these can be slightly awkward, I was pleasantly surprised that that was not the case here.  

Secondly, before I even get into the food, I have to give mad props to our waitress.  She was so friendly and helpful, immediately offering up suggestions about how to order and allowing us plenty of time to decide in what fare we would partake.  

We ultimately opted for YEN TSAI (pickled veggies), the SUAN NI PORK CHOP, the LA ZI JI (fried chicken with dried chilis, sichuan peppers, and scallions), and the Hot &amp; Sour Veggies.  The waitress kindly informed us about how spicy the fried chicken.  Fortunately we both enjoy spicy food.  She also informed us about how the spiciness of the chicken may interact with the drinks we&#39;d ordered.  I cannot say enough about the La Zi Ji....the chicken was cooked to perfection in bite size cripsy (NOT CRUNCHY) chunks.  While the portion size looks huge, roughly half of what is served is actually edible.  The other half is comprised of dried chilis which the waitress urged us not to eat.  Each of the other dishes were delicious and well portioned.  I dined with one other person and I&#39;d say the amount ordered was suitable for two folks with healthy appetites. 

Typically a beer drinker, I was slightly disappointed by the beer selection as the types offered weren&#39;t really my bag.  However, this presented an opportunity for me to step outside of my comfort zone and enjoy a glass of rose.  Admittedly a remedial wine drinker, I was pleased the waitress again came through.  She described the three rose selections available by flavor and price range.  Opting for the &#34;mid range that tasted like jam&#34; I was not disappointed.  

Nor was I disappointed by the space.  Though intimate, I fell in love with the abundance of light in the space which perfectly plays off of the all black walls.  The space is well set up and cozy without feeling crowded.  

Excellent customer service and delightful food.  I cannot wait to come back."

It&#39;s a special cocktail that&#39;s delicious. Very light and refreshing. Had to try to tofu. It was delicious.

We got here a little before 5:30 on a Saturday night and thought we&#39;d have to walk around until they opened.  Then we noticed people going in so in we went.  Thank goodness we did that because by the time they &#34;opened&#34; they already had half the tables filled.  And by 5:43 the place was packed and there was an hour and a half wait!  Go early!

The cocktails were amazing; I got the sheep (times 2) and my husband got the Dog (times 2).  They were worth it although it was half of our total bill.

For nosh, everything is set up to share.  We chose the bone marrow fried rice, Shangai pork and rice cakes, steamed eggplant and Beijing duck rolls.  Wow, every dish was really good with my favorite being the eggplant and the hubs opting for the duck rolls.  The bone marrow fried rice was a little like regular fried rice but richer with little hits of salt here and there.  Subtle yet delicious.  Our waitress mentioned the Shanghai pork was a hearty Chinese dish and she was absolutely correct.  The rich pork gravy with cabbage over rice cakes was comfort food at its best.  The eggplant had the mouth numbing hit of Sichuan that I love.  And finally the last dish that arrived at our table was the incredibly tender, packed full of flavor duck rolls.  The rolls were made out of scallion pancake that had been fried in duck fat.  Yes please.

Service was friendly and they were on their game.  Definitely a place to come back to!"

As soon as you walk in the door its like stepping in a whole new world. The atmosphere is very upbeat, fun and energetic.

For drinks we ordered the Money, Sheep and the rabbit. I just want to point out these drink are strong. Even if they look girly as eff, after finishing the monkey I felt not only buzzed but as if after years of waiting I finally grew some chest hairs.

For food we ordered salt &amp; pepper soft shell crab, La Zi Ji, Beijing Duck Roll and the Beef Chow Fun. Their two most popular items the Beijing Duck Roll and the Soft Shell Crap were amazing. Makes since why they are the most popular dishes. The Crab was incredibly flavorful tender and crispy giving it a very nice crunchy texture. The Duck roll makes me salivate just thinking about it, the sweet sauce gives it a very unique taste. The La Zi Ji was my least favorite (if you&#39;re not use to it the peppers they use aren&#39;t necessarily spicy they give your mouth a numbing sensation) the chicken was a bit on the salty side.

We had to wait 30 minutes to get a table but we were prepared since past reviewers had specified it was a small space and there was usually a wait. 

We sat at the end of the community table and hubby had the Mountain mixed drink $11 (olmeca altos plata tequila. pineapple. celery. lime) and it was sweet and tangy with a little kick. They serve them in plastic cups with a plastic seal &#34;boba tea&#34; style and you stab a straw thru. 

We started out with the Beijing Duck Rolls $16 (scallion pancake, five spice hoisin, cabbage) the duck was very tender and not greasy at all. The scallion pancake that encased it was grilled and had a smoky flavor to it. Definitely would get again! 

Next, we had the Bone Marrow Fried Rice $10 (eggs, green peas, scallions). I liked that it wasn&#39;t greasy as some fried rice can be at other places. The bone marrow had a soft kind of slippery texture to it and was mild in flavor. Definitely would get again! 

Next, we had the Banana Leaf Grilled Bass $38 (long bean salad, sambal blanchan). The waitress notified us that this dish would take about 25 minutes to make so be prepared to wait a little bit if you order this dish. The bass was seasoned with sambal blanchan and the long bean salad that accompanied it consisted of green beans, cherry tomatoes, and Jicama strips. The dressing reminded me of a vinagrette that kind of tasted like a thai curry inspired sauce. Although it was very tasty, I&#39;m not sure if I would get it again mostly because I felt like it wasn&#39;t very filling (we split all the dishes) and there were alot of bones in the fish which made it a bit difficult to eat. 

The menu didn&#39;t have dessert but I&#39;m sure you can find dessert nearby if you wanted.

Prices here are a little steep but this is a trendy/hip asian fusion restaurant so, not surprised. I would definitely return and probably make sure to order the La Zi Ji (Fried Chicken w/Chili Peppers) which reminded me of Japanese Chicken Kaarage because it had a hint of ginger in the batter. The kind gentleman to the right of me offered a piece to us and it was deliciously spicy."

Hop alley is a second restaurant concept stemming from its sister company uncle in the highlands. Hop alley is unique though - from the thorough explanations of the menu, to the loud ambiance, to the bone marrow fried rice. What?! That&#39;s right my brothers and sisters, that is one entree that you&#39;ll not want to miss so get involved and order it first. 

The duck rolls is also a must. This towering plate is described as something you should share. After a bite however, you&#39;ll discover they were wrong - there&#39;s nothing shareable about this delicious discovery. 

Behind the counter of wait staff swooping in, picking up plate after plate you&#39;ll find a line of chefs like scientists - something like a fast paced scene from chefs table. There&#39;s one guy at the end that seems the most peculiar. He inspects the dish before it leaves. Adds a garnish, a pinch of salt, and whoosh - it&#39;s gone. 

They say everything is a shared style but with a little investigation and strategic ordering, you can get in and out with just an entree. Did I mention the bone marrow fried rice and duck rolls? I did. So start there. It will not disappoint. 

Thank you for the food my friends. Eat up!"

The food in the other hand, had a bit more to be desired. The pickles are AMAZING! But... The chicken was far overcooked. The sauce was great! But the dryness was not. The duck rolls were delicious, but a bit cold. The pork belly was chewy and overcooked as well. The pig ear salad though.... Oh my goodness. The ears are fried perfectly, and the accompaning salad was great! By far the highlight of the meal! No dessert was also a bit disappointing. The staff was definitely friendly enough, though I felt like we were rushed out of there, because it is a busy place. So. I wasnt extremely happy with this place, but not completely disappointed either."

Pro tip: during peak hours get there expecting a long wait (we waited 2 hrs), but you can put your name in and walk down to Infinite Monkey Theorum to wait, using the No Wait app to keep track of the wait.

Food was stellar, cocktails absolutely perfect, and above all else the service was phenomenal. Bar staff was genuinely nice, which set the tone for the whole evening. Attentive, friendly service with great recommendations.

Had an absolute blast, looking forward to going back often."

While still on the smaller side, the space is bigger than Uncle and in a lesser known location so the wait is not nearly as miserable.  We waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday night for a table for two.  

The vibe/décor is a lot of fun, with that rap music blasting and we were both happy with our drink choices (Rat, Dragon, Dog -- all excellent!) but the service was a bit on the slower side.  I felt like we sat there with our drinks, ready to order, for much too long.  As for the food, we ordered the eggplant, duck roll, spicy chicken and soft shell crab.  The eggplant was as good as I&#39;d heard (that sauce, though!) and the duck roll was my favorite, but the chicken was kind of disappointing.  Yeah, it&#39;s interesting that it numbs your entire mouth, but it was so dry and desperately needed a sauce or something.

Overall, we did like Hop Alley, but it was a bit pricey and we weren&#39;t blown away so maybe it will be a special occasion type of place for us!"

Concept: shared Chinese plates. I actually like the menu here so much cause there is just so much to choose from. 

Skip the mixed potatoes dish and prawns. Not worth your time or stomach space. Make sure to get their delicious soft shell crab lettuce wraps as well as their duck rolls. Freaking tasty.  Their fried rice didn&#39;t disappoint as well. Best dish though: their bass. Sweet and salty, the slaw that came with it was so fresh! 

Great atmosphere and tons of options for the picky and nonpicky."

Awesome spicy, Szechuan cuisine! Reminds me of mission Chinese in San Francisco. So much spice, you&#39;ll need a few extra napkins to blow your nose and wipe the tears out of your eyes. All in the best possible ways.

What you should order:
+ Whole grilled bass
+ Fried chicken
+ Eggplant

AND for dessert, the bone marrow fried rice. Melts in your mouth like a savory candy bar. 

Yes, they get busy and there&#39;s usually a 30-45 minute queue for a table. So what? It&#39;s worth the wait. Even a group of six was seated in less than an hour on a Saturday night. Granted, it was a cold March Saturday, but the snow doesn&#39;t keep most Denver people from going out. 

Outside of some really stellar Vietnamese food (review to come), this is by far the best Asian inspired cuisine I&#39;ve had since moving to Mile High."

Overall, it was a good dinner, but it was very expensive for what it was. There&#39;s plenty of delicious dim sum (and other types of Asian food) in Denver that costs a quarter of this. Sure it&#39;s more traditional and not as &#34;creative,&#34; but I don&#39;t think in this case creative always equaled better-tasting. And there&#39;s no Happy Hour!

Pros:
- Great staff/service
- Fantastic cocktails
- Delicious tofu dish and bone marrow fried rice

Cons:
- The fantastic cocktails are $12 (and again, no Happy Hour)
- Sure the soft-shell crab is good, but it&#39;s $23, and the soft-shell crab at Sue of Siam is just as good (if not better), but costs under $7
- A lot of the food is way too salty, or the spices/flavors are just short of great"

This mouth and crew of tastebuds traveled all the different neighborhoods (Cap hill, Wash Park, LoHi, SloHi, Highlands West, Potter Highlands and more) of Denver to find these flavors, but alas the mouth and taste-buds were only created with new restaurant concepts that had &amp; in the name and some sort of take on pork belly. 

Then on a fine Tuesday Evening, this mouth and its squad of taste-buds went to RiNo and ventured into a restaurant called hop alley, where alas it finally found what it was searching for. New flavors, new dishes, new sensations it had never experienced outside of fine dining in South East Asia. 

My mouth cried with excitement as a full-bodied spicy tsunami of flavor danced across my taste-buds with every bite of the steamed eggplant. 

My mouth shook with excitement every time it bit into the crunchy, spicy, tangy, yet subtly smooth soft-shell crab.

And it cried with beautiful ecstasy after every bite of the never before tasted Shanghai Rice Cakes. 

My mouth has not stopped thanking me since going to Hop Alley and I am sure your mouth will do the same to you. So do your mouth and taste-buds a favor and ditch the &amp; restaurants and take them to Hop Alley."

Rice is served in Chinese takeout cartons, which I thought was a wasteful despite the cute presentation. A bowl would have been preferred.

It&#39;s a busy place, so prepare to wait regardless of the day of the week. The drinks were good. Service was quick once we were seated.  

We ordered based on their suggestions and got just the right amount of food. Dinner for two [plus 2 cocktails] was more than $80.

We sat at the bar as there was a waiting list for tables. The waitress was attentive. The wine and cocktail selection is good, the beer selection is limited in draft but some bottles were good.

Most dishes are 15-16 dollars and made to share. For two of us we ordered the pork rice cakes, duck pancakes and lamb picked something unpronounceable that we were told were sandwiches.

First we received a takeaway box of sticky rice and 10 min later our first dish arrived. Ground pork and rice cakes with fried egg on top. The pork was ok although a bit salty and the rice cakes were chewy and too many for the dish. We had to remove scrape the pork off the rice cakes and eat it with the rice. Then, the lamb sandwiches....slices of lamb and pickes inside a flat bread that was mostly burnt black. It was ok but tasted mostly burnt and nothing special. Lastly, the duck pancakes arrived. The pancakes were fried and greasy so we had to scrape the duck and eat it with rice. 

Not sure I get the hype of the place"

We started off with the eggplant, totally not an eggplant fan but it was tasty and the sauce was awesome. We moved on to the soft-shell crab, rice cakes and duck rolls all SUPER tasty, we ordered another order of the duck rolls. YUM!!!

As a lover of Chinese food and Asian fusion, I had high expectations. My time working in the Sichuan province of China always has me craving spicey Chinese food - and I usually have trouble finding that, but Hop Alley satisfied that craving.

I had reservations here for my birthday, but the March blizzard interfered with that. Hop Alley reluctantly canceled my reservations, but held true on their promise of making it up to me.

When we decided we wanted to come back in, we called in and told them about the blizzard cancellation. They IMMEDIATELY made room for us on their reservation list for that night. When we were there, they went above and beyond what was necessary - offering us drinks on the house and impeccable service (everyone wished me a late happy birthday, which was really sweet). 

We had the eggplant (omg drooling about it now), the octopus, and the duck rolls. And were not disappointed with a single second of it.

Chilled Tofu- creamy with cucumber and peanut topping to keep refreshing

Dramatic and simple, open kitchen design. Not large.

Each dish had excellent depth of flavour and execution.  Also flavours and ingredients unique to different Asian cuisines. 

Loved: Bone marrow fried rice, scallion duck rolls, whole fish w vietnamese slaw and the pickles!

No dessert or hot tea available. I would suggest orange segments, post meal and some hot tea (perhaps cocktails). Lapsang souchong and jasmine.

I arrived with a party of 7 for our reservation at 6:00 on a Wednesday evening, and there were already good amount of people in the small, understated space. We were sat at the corner table with the Lazy Susan (the best thing ever), and we ordered cocktails right away.

Our group decided to order almost one of everything on the menu and taste it all. The cocktails, which are super creative and named after the Chinese Zodiac, were delicious. We tried the Rat, Ox, Sheep, Rooster. My favorites were a tie between the gin-based Ox and the vodka-based Rat. Delicious!

We then ordered the following 9 meals:

1. YEN TSAI: Delicious and vinegary, the perfect starter.

2. SHANGHAI RICE CAKES: My personal favorite, these rice cakes were a doughy-chewy consistency that I thoroughly enjoyed.

3. LA ZI JI: Tasty albeit mouth-numbingly spicy, but not enough sauce for my taste.

4. CHAR SIU PORK BELLY: I am not a big pork fan, but these were good--crispy as if they were fried, and the sauce was sweet and rich.

5. BEEF &amp; BROCCOLI LARB: The beef was great; the chips were weird.

6. CUMIN LAMB ROU JIA MO: These were bomb, tasted so traditional, and the bread was freshly made!

7. BEIJING DUCK ROLL: These were devoured so fast (approximately 3.5 seconds) that I wasn&#39;t even able to get a picture! Crispy and tasty; they fell apart when you tried to bite into them.

8. HUSBAND &amp; WIFE SALAD: This one was so not my style that I didn&#39;t even try it! Whoops. I heard people raving about the sausage, though.

9. CHILLED TOFU: This was also a personal favorite! The sauce was incredible, and the tofu was cooked perfectly.

I&#39;m already planning my next visit!"

Being my first time as well, we were both impressed. Great vibe, service, atmosphere, and music. The ambiance was good enough that I wouldn&#39;t even mind just grabbing a drink at the bar.

To start, they have some inventive cocktails. The &#39;Monkey&#39; - a take on a negroni (my cocktail of choice) was reinvented with a touch of sesame to add some depth beyond the Campari. They also have a great beer list with a unique variety that you don&#39;t find on most bar taps. 

On to the food - we were told to order about 2 dishes per person. We were both prepared for some small plates and expected to do some add-ons after we received our initial four dishes. So not the case. None of the dishes we ordered were dainty. We were beyond satiated with the four dishes between the two of us, with even me taking home a substantial amount of left overs. Everything we got was delicious. We got the steamed eggplant, suan ni pork chop, Beijing duck roll, and new year&#39;s sashimi. Being a pretty healthy eater myself, I couldn&#39;t help myself with the duck roll which was beyond decadent in fat and flavor. I&#39;d be happy to order each one again, however, the pork chop was undoubtedly my favorite. Expertly cooked, tender, juicy, and probably my favorite piece of pork I&#39;ve ordered in a restaurant. This dish would warrant a $20-$30 price tag at any pretentious restaurant in Denver but was only $15 at Hop Alley. 

If I had any complaints, it might be that some of the food was overly salty. It was a sodium fest which I can tolerate from time to time. I&#39;m undoubtedly going to return, however, when I do, I might ask that they tone down the salt. Anyways, that&#39;s me being nitpicky of pretty awesome meal and establishment."

A few annoying things about the place (no reservations, no table until entire party arrives, hip hop music loud enough to inspire ear plugs) were not enough to spoil a most interesting restaurant. We started off with a porron of daiquiri, which we ordered  because the menu says it serves 2-8 people. It is served in a pitcher with a spout and tasted great, but I can&#39;t imagine it serving 8 unless the 8 are a mouse family. The food: bold is the word that comes to mind. 
We had these dishes:
pickled vegetables- probably the best deal on the menu at $3
steamed eggplant- liked it
pork chop- loved it, my favorite item- sliced, juicy, easy to share
duck roll- good and unusual
sashimi- oh yeah, loved it a lot
soft shell crab- served with lettuce to wrap and with lime mayo, interesting
Overall, a really good experience and a wonderful treat from my daughters to their Dad. Not sure that senior citizens like myself are going to embrace this place as their neighborhood hang out, but this is a great spot to try for adventurous eaters and foodies."

The space is quite small, and I don&#39;t believe they take reservations (at least for smaller parties), so plan accordingly. 

I started off with a killer bourbon-based cocktail (the dragon?) and shared several dishes with my fellow dining adventurers. The steamed eggplant and bone marrow fried rice were both phenomenal, the grilled whole bass was sheer perfection, and the spicy fried chicken delightfully numbed my tongue (seriously, spice haters, steer clear of this dish!). The true star of the show was the duck roll. I am an outspoken hater of duck, but this dish converted me! It is a must try.

I&#39;m not sure if the dishes we had were executed at the level that Chef Lee intended.

The duck rolls (i.e. Chinese burrito) was the strongest dish that we ordered, but the duck was somewhat dry and you couldn&#39;t taste the scallion in the pancakes, two factors crucial for the Peking duck and scallion pancakes that the dish was inspired by.     Admittedly my mom&#39;s preparation of duck was also often dry but that&#39;s what the plum sauce was for.

The other dishes we had- eggplant, hot and sour veggies, and rice cakes- too salty, much too heavy on the spices, and drowning in sauce.   I think the spices overwhelmed any of the &#34;wok hay&#34; essence that makes Asian stir fried dishes so special.

Admittedly we only had a small sample of what Hop Alley has to offer, and hopefully we&#39;ll be back and try the other dishes, and find them to be made with more finesse and subtlety."

I&#39;ve heard so many good things from all my friends. I know it can be tough to get a seat, we got there around 5:30 and were able to sit right away, they were busy though. The hostesses was kind to make sure we were okay with sitting at a community table before seating us, that was nice most places just seat you next to someone without caring.
Food was awesome! Be warned though, when these guys say something is spicy they mean it. The flavors wear awesome, and all the dishes were well balanced. I personally think the marrow fried rice was missing a little something to make it truly a great plate, but other than that the food was outstanding. 
Cocktail menu was creative and we both enjoyed our drinks. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t pay much attention to the beer or wine list.

I cook for a living and I haven&#39;t had such an enjoyable experience in Denver in quite a while. I&#39;ve had plenty of better singular dishes, but the entire meal together was euphoric. We were told that all the food comes out at once and I thought that&#39;s kind of ridiculous, but I was wrong. One dish at a time this might have just been a good meal, but everything working together pushed it over the edge. We had the fried chicken, duck rolls, house pickles, bone marrow fried rice, and the happy couple salad. We started on the fried chicken (the bowl is half sichuan peppers) and bang! Mouth is numb and I start feeling a kind of high from the chilis. The fried rice on its own might be a little one note, but as a reprieve from everything else it&#39;s a welcome fattiness. The duck and scallion pancake is really delicious. It&#39;s a bit of a lob, but still really delicious. Let&#39;s talk pickles. I order pickles at any restaurant where they offer them and they&#39;re almost always kind of meh. They have 5(?) different kinds of pickles and they&#39;re all in different brines. Different textures and different flavors in different kinds of vegetables. Simple, but great. Back to the chicken, the crust wasn&#39;t that crispy, but the flavors were spot on. I don&#39;t know if the meal would have been the same without the sichuan after glow. The salad comes out 10 minutes after everything out for some reason. The fried chicken gizzards, sausage, and duck tongue were on point. The radish was lightly pickled and a prefect respite from the meat. The greens seemed to just be coated in black vinegar. I like black vinegar. For a salad, I would like an emulsion or something so it actually sticks to the greens. The vinegar just kind of rolled off the leaves and left sad little pools on the plate. The dish was great because of the different textures and flavors of the meat, and not because of the forgettable greens. 
TLDR: I love aggressive food. If I spend money I want to be knocked over with flavor. Hop Alley did this. Acid, spice, salty, sweet, and umami in spades. The real thing that makes this a 5-star review instead of 4 is because with a generous tip split between two people I ended up paying 30 something dollars. This is a steal. If you love 3-cheese macaroni with pork belly and deep-fried brussel sprout leaves then go down the street."

I was told that reservations were not allowed and come 30 minutes before desire setting. I came as they advised and I&#39;d to wait 2 hours for a table. I couldn&#39;t seat at the &#34;bar&#34; because the seats were &#34;reserved&#34; and the place is so little you literally have to go out to breath! Meanwhile 2 large parties came and got a table because &#34;they made reservations&#34; ahead of time!!
After 2 long hours of waiting finally my party got awarded with a table. 
Food came in timely manner, very creative dishes, served family style however the size doesn&#39;t reflect a family style standard. Price of the food is average as well as the food.

The crispy pig ear salad is a must try, as are the pork chop and the sashimi, the pork belly is sublime by itself, but falls a little short of a complete dish served atop the sour mustard green - something is either missing, or unnecessary, on this dish.

The food was delightful - the duck roll and crab dish are a must. However, 3 stars because the hospitality of the restaurant was severely lacking. 

They threatened to give away our table because one person was late, sat us at a table too small for our party, and asked us to leave as soon as our bill was paid, offering our party a seat at time bar which was already fully occupied.

My party of four got there at around 6:15 on a Friday, only to find out an hour and a half wait.  Yikes!  Good for them, not so good for us.  Unfortunately they didn&#39;t have much standing room, so we ended up going to a bar around the corner.  The hostess took my number down and they actually use a mobile app where you can see how many people are in front of you, I thought that was pretty neat!

By the time we got our table (the estimated wait time was pretty spot on at 90 minutes), we were ravenous.  We knew the food was &#34;shared plates&#34; style, so first thing we asked was how much we should order.  The server suggested 2-3/person, which I can now safely say is an obnoxious up-sell.  We ended up getting 7 plates between four very hungry and very capable eaters.  The magic number would have been probably 5.  We could have finished 6, but 7 was definitely too much.  I can only imagine the poor folks that get 2.5 or 3 meals per person.

We were also told that the food comes out in a &#34;traditional&#34; fashion, which meant that we had to give our whole order up front, and the chef would pair the foods that went best together and serve over time.  This seemed somewhat reasonable, but quickly realized that it was BS, and everything just came out as it was made.  Not a huge problem, however it was completely unnecessary to lie and say there was some sort of pairing system going on.

That being said, the  food WAS pretty good.  Some plates obviously better than others, here&#39;s what we ordered from best to meh:
Beijing Duck Roll
Shanghai Rice Cakes
Husband and Wife Salad
Steamed Eggplant
Bone Marrow Fried Rice
Pork Belly (always yummy, but this was not unique at all)
Lazi Ji Fried Chicken

The first few were really good, getting down to the bottom was pretty mediocre.  Nothing bad, but all very meaty and heavy.

Lastly, it seemed a little strange that they don&#39;t have any dessert, but oh well.  I&#39;m not going to hold a restaurant to the service of one individual so I&#39;ll definitely go back, but there is some real room for improvement to take this from good to great."

The bar menu is outstanding, with many innovative Cocktails, a good selection of beers, and a small but interesting wine list that pairs well with the food. 

The atmosphere is another standout. We have friends who are looking for a designer and we sent them to hop alley to ask who they used. We go out a lot and Hop alley is the coolest design we&#39;ve seen.

The food was spectacular and unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had!We were a party of 8 and our server encouraged us to embrace the restaurant&#39;s family-style atmosphere, which we did by ordering lots of dishes. You&#39;re able to spin them on the round glass in the center for easy passing ability (if you&#39;re sat at that particular type of table). Everything was phenomenal and we all had a difficult time discussing what we&#39;d order when we come back (because we definitely will!) Our server was a great guide in the ordering process for food and drinks. Dishes I&#39;d definitely order again next time: beef soup, duck rolls, soft-shell crab, pork belly, fried chicken, and pork chop. The chicken was very spicy and (which I love), the duck rolls were large and almost like burritos in a tortilla-like wrap, the crab was slightly crispy and came with fixings for a lettuce wrap if you so choose, the pork belly was cut in chunks for easy sharing and had a delicious sauce, the noodles tasted homemade in the soup and I could easily slurp the broth on its own (it was that good), and the pork chop was sliced in long strips to share and was incredible too! The bone marrow fried rice was good but didn&#39;t have much bone marrow in it and needed a little something extra, like a spice/herb of some sort. All drinks were great too and very unique ingredients and combinations, the Pig (I believe that was the name) was our favorite; it&#39;s at the bottom of the menu and was scotch-based.

Look, if you&#39;re going to participate in delivery services, adhere to your business hours, and if you&#39;re going to cancel, do it within, I don&#39;t know, fifteen minutes of someone ordering food.

I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and 2 tacos al pastor, which should have been around $11.00 including tax.  I was charged $27.30 for these 5 tacos.  I was on the phone, having just answered a call while paying, and wasn&#39;t fully paying attention while the transaction was in progress (my fault??), so was paying, and gave a $50 bill and was given $22.70 in change at the time.

I immediately came to my senses while still in the restaurant and having just received my order in a plastic bag.  I opened the light-looking bag and Styrofoam container, and had only received FOUR tacos.  When I saw this, and had realized what I had been charged ($27.30!!!!!!), I stated I hadn&#39;t received my entire order, and had asked why it had been $27.30 for 5 tacos.

At the time, a woman who was taking an order on the phone for their shared BBQ business started screaming at me like I was a derelict crack head, making her life miserable while she was attempting to accept an order via the phone.  The guy who had taken my order and processed the transaction while I was on the phone and preparing a couple of salsa takeout containers started acting like I was &#34;on medication&#34; (his words) when I tried to talk to him about the mix-up/overcharge/short order combo.  His reaction was WAAAAAAYYYY overboard for my behavior (sober at 10:30 PM on a Sunday.)

Another customer had just placed an order and was awaiting their food, while this was occurring, and the staff there was treating me like I was a crazy person for trying to ascertain why I was charged $27.30 for 4 tacos, all the while glancing and rolling his eyes at the other customer for an approving/understanding nod of approval??!!

I became agitated at this point, starting to raise my voice and asking what was happening, and why I hadn&#39;t received a receipt...and the situation immediately became waaaayyy too intense and confrontational for me.  I decided to just leave before anything else escalated, and came home to write this right away.  Am I suddenly in some sort of alternate reality, where I&#39;m a nutcase in a sea of Aurora sensibility?  REALLY.  I&#39;ve NEVER experienced anything like this in my 53 years on this planet; and hopefully, will never again.

These people are insane.  I&#39;m saying this, having been a satisfied customer of theirs on 5 previous visits.  For future reference, please don&#39;t patronize these clowns, but, instead, go to http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-selene-aurora-2 for the best tacos in Aurora (too bad they closed too early tonight for them to get my business.)"

Literally meaning basket tacos, tacos de canasta are a version of steamed tacos that are available with a variety of fillings like refried beans, chicharrones, pollo con mole, barbacoa, and papas con chorizo.  While I have heard of these steamed tacos before, this was my first time trying them - and let me tell you - it was not what I was used to.  I was at a lost whether I should grab a fork or get my hands dirty - so I combo ate these suckas.  The flavors were fantastic, though the sogginess was something that took me a few bites to get used to.  The papas con chorizo came as a mash; like an incredibly flavorful baby food consistency.  The barbacoa was bursting with flavor.  The mole - I could have lived without it.  All in all, I liked the food here, but my vote is swinging between a 3 and a 4.

Usually when Mexican joints deliver it is very &#34;El Paso-ish&#34; food (boxed taco shells, ground beef filling and mass produced green chili from restaurant supply).  I was so happy to see that El Costeno had street tacos and all of the traditional cuts of meats available.

First the good.  
The service was great, delivery driver was great, he was communicative and arrived on time.  The food was hot and everything was exactly what I had ordered and how I had ordered it. When I opened up my takeout boxes it looked great, prepared nicely and portions were good and fairly priced.

Veggies looked fresh, the green chili had a &#34;decent&#34; heat and good flavor.  The price was right.

Now the bad.
I ordered the Asada tacos served traditional style.  With onions and cilantro.  The Asada was just okay, better than Casa Bonita but not even near the sumptious juicy deliciousness of let&#39;s say El Taco or even the inconsistent Taco Mex.  No flavorful char on the meats, no special spices....just cooked meat, slighty dry, nothing special.  A bonus is that the meat was not fatty at all, very lean, but this can be a down-side when it comes to flavor, and in this case it was.  I barely saw an onion, much less tasted one.  The cilantro was fine.

Ordering online they do not give you an option to add the usual &#34;Taco Bar&#34; sides.  I like my street Taco dressed with lime, some pickled onions and an option of salsas.  This was simply meat on tortillas with one wedge of lime to squirt on 4 tacos.  

I am doing a DELIVERY review, perhaps when you eat at the restaurant you have options.  My tacos were just average meat on corn tortillas.

We also oredered a Chicharron Burrito.  I am a chicharron fan.  Little bits of fried pork skin that add a delicious crunch to a burrito = heaven.  Chicharrons are bacons chubby cousin.  This was NOT a typical burrito stuffed with fluffy rice, grandmas refried beans and some crackly pieces of  pork in every bite.  This was (maybe?) unfried, possibly boiled pigskin with a gelatinous texture mixed in with buffet style rice (not mi abuelitas rice!)  and again, just average beans.  It was not anything I would EVER order again.  The pigskin prepared in that manner was off-putting .  It was smothered in pork green chile that had nice heat, but strange cuts of meat (almost resembling sliced ham) in it.  We each took three bites (the second one just to make sure the first one wasn&#39;t a fluke, the third to make this review valid - that we really gave it a try).  Maybe this method of stuffing gelatinous pigskin into a tortilla is a regional or even a family favorite, I will say that it is not for everyone.

So, I will never order here again based on the taste alone.  Could have been the cook on shift and I know everyones tastes differ (heck Casa Bonita has managed to stay open for 40 years???! yuck).  If you are just looking for something to fill your gut and you aren&#39;t cancerned with the nuances of spices, or the cuts of the meat and you are fine with buffet style rice and beans, then I think you might want to give this place a chance.  If you look forward to the carmelization in your Pastor, the shimmer of perfect referitos and the balanced bite of meat, pickled onion and limon, then I would pass."

Bumping up to 4 stars because I&#39;m blown away by their stellar customer service. Within minutes of posting my review, they reached out and messaged me with an apology, an explanation, and an offer to try them again. Most businesses don&#39;t even read their Yelp page, let alone act upon opportunities to improve service. Way to go! Can&#39;t wait to try Lunch Wired again (and will cross my fingers they find a way to keep the chips crunchy while still keeping in mind the environment and reducing plastic packaging!) 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

I wanted this to be SO GOOD, but sadly the way they packaged my delivery order made it less than enjoyable. My chips were packaged in the container with my sandwich, leaving me soggy, floppy potato pieces rather than the crunchy chips I was expecting. 

Turkey Tom sandwich is tasty- lots of meat, almost to the point of too much :) Nice thick bacon, though a little chewy/rubbery. Really sad about the chips- the flavor is tasty, can&#39;t get over the limp texture though. 

With delivery, it was almost $19 for lunch that I ate less than half of. Ouch."

I have come across Lunch Wired&#39;s yelp multiple times but could never decide what to have... Finally today I got on their website and made an order to pick up. A friend of mine at work told me to hit the &#34;free stuff&#34; option especially since it was my first time in. 
At 12 I went to pick up my order, definitely an odd location but the little strip mall development is only so big eventually you will run into it. 
I walked in, and paid for my meal. I mentioned that it seems like there was some items that were posted on yelp but not on their online menu (spicy rare, and blt). The man who took my order just said he didn&#39;t know and that was that. Not over the top friendly but no big I understand its a lunchtime rush. 
Got back to my office and saw the missing &#34;free stuff&#34; (drink and a cookie). Being that it was free I didn&#39;t care all that much. 
I started digging into my &#34;Kickin Tom&#34; and bbq chips. SOOOO yummy. The bread is fantastic, not usually a huge fan of chipotle flavors but the mayo is such a nice touch and over all a really great sammich. The chips are light, crunch, not greasy, and I can&#39;t stop snacking them. Mid bite I get a phone call from Lunch Wired. The gentleman on the phone let me know they accidentally mis-packed my lunch and left out my drink and cookie and offered to send someone out right away to deliver them. As gracious as the offer was it was the thought that really counted and I let him know it was no biggy, and he let me know he will make sure to hook me up next time.

They have been awesome to work these last two years since our office moved to the DTC.  And, if you order breakfast catering, you MUST order the individual quiche.

They really don&#39;t have a storefront as they are more so a catering co.  The front space is very narrow with just a register.  We tried the Mother Clucker and also the Kickin Tom.  Both sandwiches were on fresh French bread and were fully loaded with tons of meat and the sandwich was really the size of 2 burgers.  Both were delicious...the Mother Clucker is a warm sandwich and the Kickin Tom is a cold sandwich.  Both came with homemade potato chips which I don&#39;t know how they did it but they weren&#39;t greasy and were still crispy...we had both bbq and parmesan garlic (my favorite of the 2).  They also threw in 2 free cookies...pumpkin and snickerdoodle which both were large and delicious.  Will be back for sure.  I do recommend ordering ahead for pick up.

I don&#39;t really say many sandwiches are worth a whole $12, but this thing IS.  I ordered the horseradish on the side for my to-go order. The chips are homemade to perfection.  I prefer the plain chips over the parm garlic.

On the other end of the spectrum, the chicken noodle soup is horrible.  Like the worst I&#39;ve ever had. The main issue?  The store-bought noodles.  They were either elbow or cavatappi (think spiral elbow noodle).  Noodles are really not hard to make... and make all the difference in the world!  Maybe they didn&#39;t get the memo, but we Coloradans really like our soup... especially during the winter months!

And right in between, the mac &amp; cheese is good, but not amazing.  Definitely not worth $9-10.

The first time we ordered, we tried to do delivery but were given an estimate of 1 1/2 hrs.  I did opt to pick it up and it is a bit confusing the first time you go there.  It&#39;s in a DTC-like business complex.  The front is like a strip-mall with various businesses and restaurants.  There&#39;s a little drive down the middle of the complex and Lunch Wired is located towards the back.  It&#39;d be completely lost if you don&#39;t see the A-frame sign in a parking place directly out front.  Don&#39;t be surprised that you are walking directly into the kitchen and there is no seating - they mainly specialize in catering orders."

We didn&#39;t order in advance, though probably should have. Since they don&#39;t have any tables or anything - it&#39;s kind of awkward to wait around for your food to be prepared. Thankfully it was a nice day, and they&#39;re fast - so we just puttered around for a few minutes (10?) while they prepared our lunch.

I had the grilled cheese with bacon and avocado and shared the Santa Fresh salad with the hubby. The salad wasn&#39;t my fave, but I loved the grilled cheese. It really called out to me from my first glance at the menu, and totally hit the spot so I&#39;m glad I went for it. And they aren&#39;t messing around with their bacon! They seriously had some of the thickest bacon I&#39;ve ever had on a grilled cheese sandwich. Kudos fellow bacon lovers.

They even gave us free cookies! Twice!"

Like many of the other reviews, my favorite is definitely the Big Mother Clucker. The chipotle mayo in the sandwich along with the juicy chicken breast and smoked bacon makes this sandwich so tasty! Get it on the french bread. Once again, portions are huge. I can only eat half. Their freshly made chips are addicting to eat. I like the parm chips the most. Very crispy and fresh. Sometimes if they aren&#39;t really busy they&#39;ll throw in a free cookie for you as well. Score! :)

It  had way too much chicken in it (like, a whole chicken. seriously) and not much of anything else.  It was hard to eat because they stuffed so much chicken in it so it just kinda fell apart.  There was barely any Caesar dressing so it was way too dry.  Mostly chicken and pita bread.  Their BBQ chips are good though, I think they&#39;re made in house."

No big, the staff was friendly and quick to give us a suggestion of somewhere nice to eat. Service was quick and like I said, staff was friendly. I ordered the Southwest Salad and added chicken and was a little dismayed with the price - $10 for the salad was fine (it was HUGE) but $4 or $5 more to add chicken? Yikes. The salad was huge (I ended up eating it for 2 meals) but had I not been able to put it in the fridge after lunch, I would&#39;ve felt cheated. For the most part, I was happy with the salad. It had a nice kick to it with the fresh jalapeños. I was less happy with the avocados which had noticeable brown spots. And even less happy with the cheese which looked and taste like slices of cheap Kraft - ick. Everything else was delicious - the corn was sweet, the lettuce was crisp, and the tortilla strips were crunchy. After reading the other reviews, I&#39;m a little sad that we didn&#39;t find out about the free stuff. Free cookie and drink? What? How do we get that? No big, our problem, not theirs. Might go back if I&#39;m ever the area and craving a good salad or sandwich but don&#39;t think I&#39;d go out of my way for it. Definitely some solid food with good amount of choices."

Just like other yelps said it is difficult to find but well worth it once you find it. It had no seating as they mostly do catering and delivery. We walked in and where greeted by all the staff that helped us in choosing our meals it being our first time. My girlfriend had the gyro hero and I ordered the mother clucker it took about 5 minutes for us to receive our sandwiches. All the ingredients where very fresh and I knew it was all good when we didn&#39;t say a word to each other for about 15 minutes while we enjoyed our meal. The guys even gave us 2 free cookies that they cook fresh every morning. If you haven&#39;t had a experience with these guys make a point to it will be a trip well worth it. 

It kinda made me feel special that they don&#39;t have a sign or a place to sit like I knew about something other people don&#39;t although I know plenty of people know about these guys it was still a cool hole in the wall vibe.

In addition to the food, the service was amazing. Four separate employees spoke with us and were incredibly friendly and cordial. They also offered us complimentary desert as well! Whenever I come back to the area I will make a point of stopping at Lunch Wired to grab a meal.

This place has some of the best food in the area. The quality of the ingredients is phenomenal- you can really taste how fresh everything is. Not to mention, the staff are always really nice.

Why four stars?

Go look at their prices. A $13.25 salad, $11 sandwich, and $2.25 soda. No, there&#39;s no gold in your food, but yes, you might have to mortgage your house to eat at this place, folks. 

The second reason is their delivery. Try ordering and you have to set a requested time of almost 2 hours ahead. They are 5 miles away from me. This is crazy. 

In the end, I just order pick up, and the food is really great, so most of the time it is worth eating a pricey salad sprinkled with pricer overdraft fees."

THERE is NO Seating but go anyway for pick-up.  Most of their business is catering and lunch delivery to business customers, so this isn&#39;t set-up as as a retail establishment.  The location is literally their kitchen, with a register as you enter.

BUT don&#39;t let that stop you from experiencing the deliciousness!

As others have said, it&#39;s hard to find as it is tucked away in a business park. Locate the C building and you&#39;ll find it.

We were looking for a lunch place on the way to a meeting.  I saw the great yelp reviews and thought, 5-stars for a sandwich place, really? I gotta try this.

The owner and manager were very, very nice.  They let us order right there -- but you&#39;ll call ahead since you actually read the yelp reviews.  Once our order was ready we had a picnic in the parking lot.  Worth it!

There were 4 in our group and ALL loved their sandwiches.  No one cared that we ate in a parking lot.  Between bites I hear &#34;This is killer!&#34;  I had the Secret Club on their homemade French bread.  Another person had the kicken Tom.  The bread is truly fantastic.. Also, the freshness of all ingredients and the flavor combinations were great.  We tried the Parmesan potato chips and the homemade cookies.   fabulous.  We passed a lot of other lunch places to get here and we were glad we did.  There is a Quiznos around the corner . . . No comparison!  You might as well compare putt putt to a round of golf at the Masters.  Sandwich amateurs vs. the artisans at Lunch Wired. 

If you&#39;re looking for a caterer for an event or ordering-in lunch at the office, place the order.  

If it&#39;s just you and some friends, call ahead and go pick it up.  There is a park nearby and you can eat your lunch there vs the parking lot like we did.

Indeed, a sandwich place earned 5-stars."

I went with a coworker a few weeks ago here for lunch and was definitely not dissapointed. I got the turkey tom from an employees recommendation and hey, they should know what&#39;s good right? The gentlemen that took our orders must have been the owner. He was very courteous. They definitely sell their brand well. He asked if we were first timers there and being first timers, we got free cookies (which were great). He said they&#39;ll deliver and even if we want them to deliver elsewhere like a park, they&#39;d do it.

Now back to the sandwich. I ordered it on their french white bread since they make it in house vs their sourdough which they get from a local bakery. The turkey was moist and smooth. It didn&#39;t have patches of rough untearable meat like some storebought turkey and lunchmeat has. The gouda was a nice change of pace from the typical american/cheddar that most people get. Visually the sandwich was awesome looking. It had a nice egg wash on the top and was as soft as it could be while still being able to hold the sandwich together. I&#39;m usually a big eater and just the sandwich and free cookie were enough to fill me up.

This is absolutely a hidden gem in Centennial that you may not find due to not having a storefront that you can see from Arapahoe but maybe that&#39;s good since that means more sandwiches for the rest of us!"

I was officially welcomed into the club today by Jordan (the owner) and a complimentary cookie.

I thought about giving this place 4 stars because my sandwich was good, but not blowing my mind. I had The Cubicle (roast beef) and as I was eating it I was thinking &#34;I could make this myself&#34;, yet I also had a real rational thought that by the time it would take to buy the grocery items, including tasty bread not the bagged crap, made sure to keep my veggies crisp and fresh, and liberally applied the aoili and large portion of meat, that actually I would be better off letting Lunch Wired do what they do best! The sandwich was huge. The veggies were fresh. And all the flavors were there, though I would have loved a little more horseradish kick (noted for next time to request). I realized I actually can&#39;t make myself a sandwich that delicious, and it&#39;s totally worth my $8, and 5 stars because there&#39;s really nothing else to compare it to. 

I love the concept of this place basically being a commercial kitchen that cranks out delivery, catering and pick-up. They have an awesome menu, and obviously a sense of humor, both of which will bring me back. The Paleo Pal salad sounds amazing, and is definitely on my &#34;next to try&#34; list! Check out their website to get free stuff when ordering.

All in all, a great quick lunch option for those days when your sad sandwich in the office fridge isn&#39;t cutting it, or the boss is springing for lunch during the next boring staff meeting. Thanks Lunch Wired!"

My first experience with Lunch Wired was a little confusing (online ordering wasn&#39;t working for me, so I ended up ordering on my phone&#39;s Yelp app) as was finding the storefront. However, when I arrived back at my desk I was no longer confused. Lunch Wired is now one of my top lunch spots in DTC. 

I ordered the D.B.A. BLT on sourdough, which was packed with fresh veggies, perfectly ripe avocado, and a generous amount of thick-cut bacon. I stopped myself from eating the entire thing so I could be this happy again later today. 

I also got a side of the homemade sweet potato chips. They&#39;re thin, crispy and sweet. Wasn&#39;t expecting this last element. Tasty, but not the savory chips I&#39;d hoped for. 

The seasonal cookie (cranberry cinnamon chip) is currently having a staring contest with me from an arms-length away. I know I&#39;ll win."

I will definitely be trying more. I brought it back to my office to eat and everyone was asking what I was eating. I had them try the fresh made garlic Parmesan chips and they want to get some lunch next time I order. So excited I found this place!!

The food is killer, you will not be disappointed.  Stop looking for another sandwich place, this is as good as your going to find!

I ordered the Mother clicker and I think it&#39;s now my goto sandwich.  The home made potato chips alone are worth the effort to find this place.

I&#39;d recommend calling in your order otherwise, you&#39;re hanging in the kitchen watching your sandwich being made, which for me was a perfect experience.  The staff was friendly and welcomed us into their world. 

Can&#39;t wait to go back."

I usually eat their food when they deliver to our work functions. The quality of their food is so much better than Panera or what King Soopers&#39; catering would be! They have so many options that you can choose from. We ordered 20 sandwiches (wraps &amp; regular sandwiches), pasta salad, and chips. The sandwiches were so big that we decided to cut them in half and we were able to have some leftovers. They delivered the food on-time and didn&#39;t have any trouble finding our location. All of the people at the party kept asking us where we got the food and telling us how much they enjoyed it. The next time I need food catered, I will think of them first and would like to try something other than the sandwiches. I&#39;m sure it will be equally delicious."

They&#39;re way better than the Perfect Landing Restaurant, plus their prices are very reasonable.  Very quick to deliver to the airport which helps for our regular pop-up trips.  

I was walking by their location off Arapahoe when I noticed their sign and decided to pop in to check them out in person.  

The whole place is clean and looks well organized.  The owner even remembered my order from the previous day and took the opportunity to get feedback.

My only real criticism is that some passengers on private jets lean more towards form over function and demand a better presentation of their food.  I would recommend there be an option to pay more for having your catering delivered on nicer serving trays, possibly with silverware.  

All in all I&#39;m very impressed with Lunch Wired and would highly recommend them to any operator flying in and out of Centennial."

To find it, you&#39;ll search over the storefronts of the stores facing Arapahoe a couple times, however it&#39;s one of the units in the back and the front door faces east if that helps.  Note:  It&#39;s all take out and delivery, there are no spots to sit and eat on the property.

No real lobby or waiting area to speak of, they do most of their business on a catering and delivery basis.  But they were super super friendly and wanted to make me happy so anytime that happens I&#39;m game.  I ordered the D.B.A. BLT (it&#39;s a BLAT for those who know) and it was awesome.  Prefect temp, flavor balance was right on point, and they put a healthy amount of butter on the sourdough.  It took about 12 minutes to get my sandwich which isn&#39;t bad at 12:30pm, and it was only $8 after taxes.  They threw in a free bag of chips and a cookie (which they put underneath the warm sandwich so it warms up perfectly by the time you get home) for being a first-timer.  Sweet deal!  

They have a 3-mile delivery radius so I&#39;d take advantage of that if you can."

It is basically focused on catering so when you go there it&#39;s literally putting in an order and taking it to go while seeing everyone rushing around putting together big orders. It&#39;s actually interesting to watch while you&#39;re waiting.

I&#39;ve had a couple of their sandwiches and really liked what I had. The owner was really nice and explained the different popular sandwiches and he threw in chips and a cookie as well. For me, this is a great spot for a quick, good sandwich since it&#39;s only blocks from my office."

Over the years I have eaten my fair share of flightless birds and not until today did I realize the full potential of this clucking creature. To raise the sophistication of this blue collar meat Lunch Wired accompanied the roasted bird with homemade soft french roll, thick cut bacon, fresh tomato/spinach, gooey cheese and Chipotle mayo. I knew I was in for something good when my sandwich was wrapped up foil and when I opened it the cheese was melting out every side of the sandwich. That chicken sandwich got clucked up!! Enough about this unbelievable sandwich, how about the place and the service. Now, don&#39;t get frustrated, but you will have a hard time finding this joint. Lunch Wired is a catering company as well so the space isn&#39;t set up for dining in. This is strickly get your sammich and go! Service is phenomenal, people who are happy for your business!!

Yes sandwiches are $10, but please don&#39;t say you want the best quality, and you want it super cheap. You can not have both. Here the service is fast, the bread is fresh and soft, the meat is thick, the chips are home made, and everything is a delicious.

Generous portion sizes with fantastic mouth watering flavors.  If you&#39;re tired of the &#34;regular&#34; lunches you typically eat, order from Lunch Wired.  You&#39;ll be happy you did!

I&#39;ll probably get the Ribeye Steak Sammich next time. Hot wiches take longer so order online in advance. Prices range around $8-12. Lots of vegetarian options and good looking burgers and salads. 

Buy a $2 taco from Sabor&#39;s next door if you need a place to sit and eat, but wiring the lunch is more convenient."

While I have tried a large variety of items, my go-to favorites are the Kicking Tom sandwich on a croissant or the Are You Cobbing Me a Liar salad.  For a salad to be a favorite item for a tubby guy like me is an amazing accomplishment!  Keep up the good work, Lunch Wired!"

Fresh toasted bread, thick bacon, fresh lettuce... I give it a 10. 
 I usually pick up, to get out of the office and save a little. Today they were getting slammed and offered me a cookie for waiting. (When you pick up it seems like they always offer a little something extra.) I got back to the office and no chips were in the bag. They say they are included in the special....boo.

There is no place to eat, whether sitting down or standing up.  It&#39;s a commercial kitchen that cranks out food.  Today, I stopped by to grab a sandwich, based upon Yelp reviews.  I suggest ordering ahead and picking up your food; they reserve a couple pickup spots.  Their store front is super small.  I ordered a &#34;Spicy Rare&#34; sandwich, on one of their fresh-baked rolls, and it was big and delicious.  The owner, Jordan, was kind enough to throw in a bag of excellent homemade chips and a chocolate chip cookie.  I gave Lunch Wired four stars rather than five for two reasons.  First, they need somewhere for people to order and eat.  I understand the delivery/catering premise but I don&#39;t work nearby but would still enjoy stopping by for a really good sandwich once-in-a-while.  For me, and maybe others, I don&#39;t want to eat in my car.  Secondly, while the sandwich I had was large, it was $10.00 ($9.90 to be exact) and comes with no sides.  If I had ordered my sandwich, a bag of chips and a drink, the total would have been $14.30 plus tax.  If all this is being delivered to my desk for free, this is reasonable.  If I&#39;m stopping by to grab a sandwich, I think I might prefer a sit-down meal somewhere for $14.00.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, Lunch Wired seems to be a wonderful choice for those wanting good food but not having the time to go get it.  However, if you can get out for lunch, I think there are lots of reasonable alternatives."

I came across it while just browsing through Yelp looking for a good place to eat. Sounds like what you may be doing, right? Well look no further, just do yourself a favor and EAT HERE!! You wanna talk about bang for your buck? This place stuffs more food between two pieces of bread then I eat in a week. It ROCKS! So many places take portion size as a joke nowadays, but not lunch wired. Very fairly priced and you really get what you pay for. Oh, and let&#39;s not forget the awesome taste accompanied with the mountain of food. I made my own hot sammie from a customizable menu they offer and it was hands down one of the best sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner of this establishment during my visit and he was a very cool, nice, and attentive guy. He took our order with accuracy and care. This guy knows what he&#39;s doing. I applaud you lunch wired! Well done and keep up the good work :)"

I just randomly yelped for a late lunch and lunch wired came up so I basically drove to it. Im from california so i was only in the city for a day for busniess. Walking in the door I didn&#39;t know it was more of a catering shop but they also do walk in. Secondly apparently they&#39;ve been closed for about 10 mins and still took my order. I was like wow that&#39;s awesome. Secondly they even made my order even when the kitchen was closed and completely cleaned up. It&#39;s was like omg!!! That&#39;s so freaking nice!!! Was completely in shocked and had small talk with the owner which is a humble man and was really generous even gave me my first Denver hospitality and gave me a free cookie. Like I said amazing and friendly people... I got a turkey spinach wrap and it was to die for. I&#39;m glad I was able to randomly stop buy and give them business even though they were closed. I Will definitely come back ever time I&#39;m in town

Liang&#39;s is quiet easy to fine as it is located at the end of the 16th Street Mall and it was only about a block away from our hotel room. We knew he closed pretty early so we had made it a priority to stop by after checking into the hotel. Yes it is just a single man cooking with a single pan in the world&#39;s smallest kitchen, but boy does he know how to whip up some of the best Thai food I&#39;ve had in a while. 

There is one simple rule to ordering at Liang&#39;s. 1 person = 1 dish or 1 person = 2 of the same dishes. So no, you cannot come down and order for everyone in the office. This rule was put in place because it takes him about 5-10 minutes per order to cook. Please respect this rule or the people behind you will want your head! 

The wife and I ordered 2 chicken Pad Thai&#39;s (no egg of course). The cook got to work right away, first by cleaning the pan thoroughly before making our order. The chef interacts with you while he cooks and will answer any questions you may have or requests. He is very humble and it looks like he actually enjoys bring good Thai food to the people of Denver. 

The food was steaming hot and the flavors were def very fresh. The portion sizes were spot on to what I have always been used to when it comes to Thai food. Liang&#39;s Pad Thai has a distinct tamarind taste to it that I enjoy, especially when I grew up eating a lot of tamarind flavored candies. I had to order my Pad Thai with no spice to it as the wife does not enjoy spicy food like I do, but it was still delicious and well worth the 5 stars."

However, they were not kidding about that line! I got here at 11:30am and had to wait 1 hour! Usually I have no patients for lines and end up going somewhere else, but decided to stick this one out. I have to say, I would do it again. 
The work ethic of this place is exceptional and you can tell they care about each dish and want their customers happy. I ordered the spicy basil chicken. Great decision. I promise you will not go wrong with this one. It comes with a lot more food than I thought it would. Not only that, but it looks great. If you check out the pictures on Yelp you will see what I mean. Awesome looking plate for under $10! 
As far as the taste, it had just the right amount of spice, a nice amount of juicy chicken, tasty veggies, and the rice was delicious. The combination of all of it together is absolutely scrumptious! 
I really do have to tip my hat to the man running this food stand. One of the hardest working food stands I have ever seen. Makes a lot of sense why they have so much business. The only negative to this place is the wait. But if you stick through it you will be one happy camper."

And it definitely was. The pad thai was incredibly delicious. I also highly recommend the crab wontons. But I think what makes this place even more amazing is how friendly the service is! The guy making the food is so hard working and friendly and you can tell he puts so much passion and pride into his food. I&#39;m sad that I won&#39;t get to eat here more often since I don&#39;t live in Denver, but if I am

Everything is so good and packs so much flavor! And the spice will hit you if you ask for anything above medium.

My visit here was after 7 pm on a Friday and this man said he has been working all day with hardly any breaks and that his arms were hurting. Btw, we only found out about this because of questions we specifically asked him, not because he was complaining.

My BF usually comes here for lunch when he&#39;s at work and says the line here can get crazy because people love this man&#39;s food. It&#39;s worth it.

He is usually out of stuff towards the end of the day. When we went up to the cart, he said he was only serving pad Thai but because he knows that drunken noodles is my BF&#39;s favorite dish, he said he could whip it up just with a little less veggies. We were so thankful he did this for us! So personable and friendly.

His hours are weird too. Even though Yelp says he&#39;s closed, he still makes food for people if you walk up to the cart. Like I said, he is very hardworking and kind.

Give this place your business because he deserves it, and you won&#39;t regret it!! :)"

Located at the corner of 16th and Tremont, next to the 7 eleven.  We tried the pad thai, drunken noodles, basil chicken, panang curry, dumplings, crab ragoon and egg roll... so most of the menu :)

Here&#39;s the break down:
Pad thai: Yummy.  The best.  Get it spicy, with chicken.  It&#39;s even good cold the next day.
Drunken noodle and panang curry tied for second best.  My drunken noodle had a bit too much sauce in it but the flavor was wonderful.
Wasn&#39;t a fan of the basil stir fry.  It had ground chicken in it instead of pieces of chicken and we didn&#39;t like the flavor.
Dumplings, egg roll and crab ragoons were all great.  They apparently make their egg rolls fresh by hand so that&#39;s always a plus.  Every entree is btw $7.50--$9.00 (You can choose between chicken, tofu, veggie, pork or beef. No shrimp option)  The appetizers are only a buck.

Now about that wait time...  There seem to always be a lengthy wait.  I&#39;ve tried stopping by at 1230pm and 230pm.  My husband swung by once on a Saturday but they are only open M--F.  The wait at 12:30pm was about an hour and even at 230 after the typical lunch rush, the wait was 1.5 hr.  At the 1 hour 20 min mark, I started to question if the food was worth it but damn it I&#39;ve been in line this long... can&#39;t give up now.

I&#39;ve heard they take credit cards but today there&#39;s a cash only sign so probably safest to come here with cash ready.  And come after 3pm for shorter wait time."

And stand. And stand. And stand. And shuffle their feet, check their social media accounts, eye the nearby cops on motorcycles, and stand.|

I am not saying that as a bad thing against Liang&#39;s *personally* -- it&#39;s just the care the cook shows and the passion he infuses his cooking with, it takes maybe 6-8 mins a meal to whip up -- and if you&#39;re behind 5-6 people in line? You&#39;re losing all but a few shreds of your lunch hour.

That being said, Liang&#39;s gets top marks for: *) food quality *) food QUANTITY , *) presentation -- you might not think that&#39;d be a factor in food cart prep; and yet it is so here and you WILL see what I mean if you have your eyes open and don&#39;t have an entitled attitude, and *) value.  I was gonna give him 4 stars -- but I seriously can&#39;t fault someone for kicking so much ass at what they do that they&#39;re successful and have a line of devotees.  So back up to 5. ;) I had the pad see ewe which was delectable, and threw in a few dumplings -- also worth it.  Nailed it accurately on the spice level, and I had enough to take home for dinner that night, so...yeah.  If you&#39;re in a hurry, this isn&#39;t your place.  if you want flavorful, inexpensive food and have a little time to kill, you owe it to yourself to check out Liang&#39;s.  Yummy. :)"

Every element of this dish, from the rice noodles to the peanut topping comes together to make a remarkable meal. Warning: if you&#39;re in a hurry, this isn&#39;t the place for you, but the wait time here is not a negative- it&#39;s due to the fact that he cooks customer&#39;s orders one at time (or two orders of the same).

I was fourth in line and my wait was about fifteen minutes, but it was absolutely worth it. I had the Tofu Pad Thai, extra spicy, and it tasted exactly how Pad Thai should. The serving was generous and loaded with sauce, vegetables, and crispy tofu. The balance of salt, sweet, sour, and spice was exactly where I wanted it.

This is as good and authentic as you get, someone handcrafting your order right in front of you. Watching the chef pour your morels into the plastic to-go container has got to be one of the most euphoric feelings in the world!

Sure it takes about 10 min for each order, and if you double-down, then add another 5 min, and yes if there are 5 people ahead of you, you wait for over an hour but it&#39;s SO worth it!

The day we trekked here (35 min walk from our B&amp;B, but again I&#39;d do it again in a heartbeat!), he (Liang&#39;s son) was out of green curry. Not phased, as this made my decision on what to order a lot easier. They have the staples that you&#39;d find on any Thai menu, pad thai, pad see ew, green and panang curry, as well as fried wontons, egg rolls for appetizers. 

We ordered the Pad see ew with beef ($9) and Pad Thai with Tofu ($7.50) and some wontons. The noodles were cooked perfectly, slippery on your chopsticks and coated evenly with sauce. There were so many vegetables and meats in our dish, it was a great value for the money. The wontons were hand wrapped, 2 for $1. The cream cheese filling was ever present, and did not dissipate in the frying process. 

The Son was very nice and clearly a hard-worker, be sure to tip as he has to wear many hats!   

Talking with the other patrons in line, we learned of their reputation as the go to place for comfort food Thai. Even captains and their crew take a special cab ride here.

I ordered the pad Thai with tofu and the chicken drunken noodles. The pad Thai was just okay and didn&#39;t taste very authentic to me. The drunken noodles were fantastic. All in all, I enjoyed my lunch. But, was it worth waiting 90 minutes in line in the heat? Probably not..."

The food was great, not my top pick, but in my top 5 for sure. He was out of cilantro, but sprinkled a few extra peanut crumbles to compensate. Overall, I would return.

I got the drunken noodles with chicken. The string beans were so so good. I never tasted string beans so sweet in my life.  The broccoli and carrots are super duper! They&#39;re crunchy and fresh.

I had to wait for this, as I had extremely disappointing Thai food from another restaurant the night before. 

Pro: Delicious. Amazing. Don&#39;t get in line here because you&#39;re taking my spot. Flavorful, TONS of vegetables. I got the tofu pad thai and you can tell it&#39;s quality because the tofu is freshly pan fried, unlike pre-fried tofu you can commercially buy. The lady in line in front of me, a Denver local, said it was even better than Thai places she visited in Thailand. I&#39;ve never been to Thailand, but it seems like quite a compliment! The price is also extremely reasonable. 

Con: The wait. You have to be willing to spend time to get good food, so it&#39;s worth it for me. But budget a good hour to chill with a buddy, meditate on life or keep browsing Yelp. I feel like they should expand (and probably put every other Thai place out of business in this neighborhood), but since Mama Liang&#39;s cooking herself the quality control would be harder with more cooks."

I came in from out of town to board, and happened to have a few hours to burn before the rest of my party flew in. Fired up my Yelp app to see what I could do to pass the time, and this came up. It was about lunch time, and the reviews seemed promising, and thought I&#39;d give it a shot - and boy, am I gad I did!

Skimming the reviews, I knew that I had to expect a line, and to my pleasant surprise there were only 5 people in front of me....but then I realized that she spends between 5-15 minutes on each customer depending on how much is ordered. Robin P hits the nail on the head - even if there are only three people already in front of you, be prepared for a wait! But here&#39;s the thing - she is making everything from scratch as you order; you&#39;ll find it is sooo worth the wait when you see the painstaking effort she puts into preparing each dish. She is so incredibly nice as well. I ordered the pad see-ew (drunken noodles) and the panang curry. She asked me how spicy I wanted it, and I said hot hot hot! When she told me how much money i owed her i couldn&#39;t believe how cheap it was for the amount of food she was giving me.

I opened the boxes and my mouth was watering as I dug into the food. The pad see-ew was amazing - just the right amount of sweetness, fresh noodles with perfect consistency, piping hot, and SPICY, just the way I like it. The panang was hands down the best I&#39;ve had - it was much thicker than other places I&#39;ve been to, and the balance of flavor between coconut, curry, and basil was dead on. I scarfed it down like a wild animal. I threw my low-carb diet out the window as I ate every single bit of rice that came with it. And the spiciness(!); most Thai restaurants I go to, I ask them to make their food as spicy as possible and for me it&#39;s always so weak sauce - but Liang&#39;s is legit Thai spicy. I loved it!

Liang&#39;s is now in my my top three Thai dining experiences in the US so far...the other two being SriPraPhai in Queens (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sripraphai-thai-restaurant-woodside) and Thai X-ing in DC (http://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-x-ing-washington).

The food is made hit and fresh. It&#39;s a mom who does the cooking and her son taking the orders. Both were very friendly. 
The only thing was it was a long wait. About an hour and there were about 5 people in front of me, but it was worth the wait. The food is like I said hot and fresh, and perfect portion. I contemplated leaving because it was a wait, but it smelled so good and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t leave. I had the drunken noodles cooked spicey with chicken. It was perfect!

Absolutely great Pad See Ew - those noodles are soft and wide and wonderful coated with tasty sauce and egg and fresh steamed broccoli (not frozen!). 

The panang curry was also addictive - that coconut milk flavor was bold and beautiful along with a nice kick from the chili pepper paste (when she puts it in the wok, and you dare inhale while waiting at the window, you&#39;ll be sent into a coughing fit that signals: &#34;you&#39;re in my town, now, tread lightly - order &#39;medium&#39;&#34;). 

In a slight mix up of ordering (apparently my pronunciation of &#39;pad see ew&#39; is terrible and was heard as &#39;pad basil&#39;), I also got the basil beef. It was good but was far outranked by its predecessors (noodles and curry).

If I&#39;m going to get my loupe out and nit pick, the sauces all run a touch sweet and the meat is a little dry and rough. 

The wait is averages about 6-7 minutes per entree (which, when you think about it, is insanely fast for a meal cooked just about from scratch - homegirl should consider going on one of those Top Chef cooking competitions). So count how many people are in line in front of you and do the math.

Pretty decent prices at $6 for tofu option, $7 for chicken, and $8 for beef. I ordered a Pad see-ew (drunken noodles) and decided to go vegetarian and opted for the tofu option. She asked if I wanted it to be spicy and I confidently said &#34;yes!&#34;

The food is sooooo good. Yes, it was so so spicy because she took my words literally and gave excellent customer service by making sure it was spicy. It was filled with pepper spice and I had tears while saying &#34;so good and so spicy.&#34; The servings were generous, with plenty of vegetables and sufficient tofu in it. They tasted exactly like the ones I had in authentic Thai places I have been. I wanted to try the tom-yam soup but from what I observed, it wasn&#39;t made from scratch and instead made from a pre-made mix that I have at home (and that you can get from Asian supermarkets).

Don&#39;t get me wrong... it is worth the wait because dag nabbit, that&#39;s some good Thai food!  

The chicken pad thai is my standby meal, but I really dig the green curry.  TONS of jasmine rice smothered with a green curry sauce and TONS of veggies.  So filling, but I keep eating and eating, and before I know it, there&#39;s none left for later.  Technically, the portions are big enough to be split into two meals, but hey, girl&#39;s gotta eat!

Plan on a minimum of 6-7 minutes for each person in line, and then yourself.  As you&#39;ve probably heard, she cooks each dish individually, one at a time.

She keeps gradually raising the prices.  Used to be about $5, now it&#39;s increasing to $7.50-8.  But it is worth it for some quality Thai food.

It&#39;s only one person cooking, so be prepared to wait. If you have the time, it&#39;s well worth it, trust me. The noodles were flavorful and chewy, the tofu absorbed the delicious sauce, and the veggies were cooked to perfection. I went with medium spice, and I definitely could have ordered it much hotter. If you like spice, definitely tell them specifically. I ordered to Asian restaurant standards of spicy, and could hardly taste it. The flavor of the noodles were still solid though, so I didn&#39;t mind. Honestly, the food 

When I stopped by, the son was running the show because his mom was home with a headache, and I was immediately sold. I love family businesses, and the fact that the son fills in for his mom when she &#34;calls in sick&#34; is adorable. Cash only, as others have pointed out, but really affordable.

One woman with one wok makes your food, and the food is very good.  I tried the pad see ew with tofu and the papaya salad.  The pad see ew&#39;s sauce had a nice balance of sweet and salty.  The papaya salad was refreshing and had a good mix of flavors.  I thought that the salad would be pre-made, but it wasn&#39;t, so I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again because of the added wait time.

I ordered both dishes hot.  Both dishes were nice and spicy, especially the papaya salad, but not so spicy that I couldn&#39;t enjoy the flavors.  

As others have noted, you&#39;ll have to wait for your food, probably about five minutes per dish.  Go early to avoid a really long wait."

I felt a bit guilty for cheating on my regular place, but I needed a fix of Pad See Ew. 

Customer Service: The chef and her order taker were both very friendly and polite.  

The Wait: About 20min with 2 entrees ahead of me.  I heeded all the warnings about the wait and went at about 1:30 after the downtown lunch rush.  

Food Quality &amp; Taste: I&#39;m sorry to say the food was very underwhelming and did not live up to the hype.  The Pad See Ew noodles were good, but the sauce was extremely bland with no notes of spice, saltiness, or sweetness.  I ordered extra veggies as my main item and got some pieces or regular broccoli (not Chinese broccoli like the best Thai places use) and some carrots that looked and tasted like they may have been pre-sliced.  I don&#39;t know this for sure though, but they had an off taste.

The portion size was generous, but not crazy big as some described.  The prices are no longer as low as some reviews have stated, but everyone has raised prices so you can&#39;t blame this place.  

If you want a good Thai meal and have the option of going anywhere, there are better places in the area.  Aurora has the best.  I like supporting 1 chef businesses and this chef seems to be prideful of her work.   I mean no disrespect to her and maybe she was having an off day, but personally felt there were too many elements missing of a good Thai dish to give a better review.  I may go back and will update the review if fair to do so."

Nice old lady, who enjoys chatting and seeing how you can handle the heat in her food. I chose hot as I am from NM and each hot chile all the time, this was comparable to much of the heat found at home in new mexican/mexican food. Great taste, texture and as we ordered 2 orders at once, was quick, and she gave us the additional plate she overcooked best damn meal this trip and at only $16 for a full and happy belly, well worth the wait, and time.

I ordered hot spicy Pad Thai and 4 pork dumplings 

Pad thai: Not Spicy, tasted like motor oil 

Dumplings: 1 out 10 compared to dumplings I get literally anywhere else, but much better than the pad thai.

Every other review on yelp was so great so when I walked up to 4 people in line I was like, It will be worth the 45 minutes I waited to get my food.

Perfectly cooked mahi with some fresh tomato&#39;s, onions, cilantro, avocado and a squeeze of citrusy lime these were to die for.  I would order these every time, if I didn&#39;t want to try the rest of the menu.  It&#39;s a must try.

We also were able to try a sample of the fish ceviche and this could definitely be the next order.  If you want to try amazing food and you like fish I highly recommend the fish ceviche, it had the perfect kick to the end and I could eat a bowl of that.

Although I prefer al a cart taco pricing (in the $1 to $2 range), and although the decor was uber-garish, the food here was excellent.  A friend and I split an order of the carne asada tacos.  You received 4 for $7.50, and it was a healthy serving.  There was a lot of tender and flavorful beef.  The onions were grilled nicely, and there service was good.  What they really need here is a condiment/salsa station.  Beers with served with both a lime and shrimp in the neck.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the food."

Since the taco truck tour got derailed, I decided to go with things that weren&#39;t exactly tacos, which meant it was tostado time.  Specifically, tostadas de ceviche mixto y tostadas de ceviche pescado.  I loved them both, tart, tangy, fresh, tender, with smack of salt and a hint of spice, these tostadas were delish.  Their menu is quite huge, so I&#39;ll have to come back to give a more thorough review."

Went for Saturday lunch. The interior is very clean and modern, and the cashier was very polite. I ordered the Mediterranean salad and a bowl of lime chili soup. My husband had the meatball sandwich (on pita) and my mother had the French dip. The minimum price per dish is $4, but we happily paid more for such a great cause. 

While we were waiting for our food, a family came in and began working (cleaning the restaurant) in exchange for their meals, which was really heart-warming. The quality of the food was great, and although the flavors weren&#39;t off-the-chart-delicious, everything was good and we will definitely be coming back!"

Cafe 180 does amazing things for community and is a wonderful charity that helps many people. On top of all this awesomeness, their food is fabulous!

I frequent Cafe 180 for lunch a lot. Their menu is seasonal and they serve up some delicious lunch items that are unbeatable. From soups and salads to sandwiches and pizza, Cafe 180 has a great spread of healthy, tasty meals to choose from. 

The price system is simple here. Pay what you can, pay what lunch would normally cost, pay a little extra or pay by donating 1 hour of your time to the cafe. This beautiful concept helps many get a full belly.

I absolutely LOVE the baked potato soup. It is creamy, cheesy and filled with bacon! All of their salads are totally delish and you can add chicken to any of them! I highly recommend their homemade cookies and milkshakes too, yum!

The staff here is kind, friendly and very helpful. This wonderful nonprofit organization benefits so many people and their food is excellent. If you are looking for a good spot for lunch and want to help people out too, this is your restaurant."

The mission of Cafe180 is here: &#34;http://cafe180.org/ourstory&#34; - in essence, they want to help and feed the community - via however much they can pay.  You order what you want and then offer what you feel is a fair price for the food.  It *can* go down as low as $4 -- if you can&#39;t afford that, you can volunteer and  &#34;exchange some time and energy for a nutritious meal.&#34;  As they say, they aren&#39;t looking to supply handouts; they&#39;re offering &#34;hand ups&#34; - giving a break to people who for whatever reason maybe can&#39;t afford a market average price for some quality/non-fast food.  Another reviewer said the kiosk supports the University of Colorado&#39;s catering training program. Whatever the mission or reason, you&#39;re assured of 4 things here:

1) Limited operating hours :) - hey, it is what it is...11a-2p usually
2) Quality food - their wraps are pretty substantial; salads are as good or better than I&#39;ve had in some places, and their cookies are a real treat.  Contrary to my check-in comments, I found out their mini white choc macadamia nut ones are returning in September...I raised my fists in victory when I heard *that*.
3) Truly, truly respectful service - always with a smile too.  When you realize it&#39;s not a typical commerce-based eatery, it kinda hits you and really touches your heart - and they do it uniformly: whether you&#39;re like me, or elderly, or destitute, or have some medical condition going on -- they *serve* you here, and
4) This place and your meal isn&#39;t going to bust your wallet/purse.

So check em out someday when you have time for lunch -- 11a-2p T-Sat.  You won&#39;t regret it.  And you&#39;ll be passively doing some societal good by giving these good folk your patronage."

Cafe 180 is definitely a place to go if you want to eat well and feel better. The restaurant operates as a nonprofit organization, so they can afford to take whatever you feel like paying for a HUGE lunch. Or if you have a spare couple hours - you can volunteer your time to cover the bill. Even when offered three choices from soups, salads, sandwiches, and pizzas I could only choose two without feeling like I was going to roll out of the place. 

Shockingly for the concept, but not for the neighborhood, Cafe 180 looks like your normal quickserv bistro lunch spot. The clientele ranges from the straight up homeless with cart to white collar office folk - with us DU students in the middle. The food is very tasty, although the pizza was a bit cold. Then again, because of the concept I am inclined to cut them some slack. The metal cups for drinks was kinda weird - but metal does wash easily, it doesn&#39;t break, and is almost infinitely reusable - so again I cut them some slack.

It is definitely worth a visit, especially if you have some time..."

I love this place, love the idea, its a cute hip lunch spot.  I also love seeing all the different people volunteering. I have also seen the idea of &#34;if you can&#39;t pay give an hour of service&#34; every time I&#39;m there and I think its such a wonderful idea.

*  Pay what you can
*  Pay what you would typically pay
*  Pay what you would typically pay, plus a bit more to &#34;pay it forward&#34;
*  Pay by giving one hour of service

My friend an I arrived a few minutes after opening.  The space (once a Spicy Pickle) is nice.  They also have outdoor seating with removable sections to let in light and air.  I must say, one can feel a little put on the spot trying to estimate what your meal is worth, plus a bit more.  It is helpful that they have a sign showing the average.

I enjoyed a Mediterranean Salad, Buffalo Chicken Pizza, and Shrimp Gumbo soup.  The salad was of the quality one would associate with a fine restaurant, and better than many would offer.  The Buffalo Chicken Pizza was very fresh (they told me about milling their own flour).  The Chicken was flavorful and looked like real chicken (not processed cubes), the crumbled blue cheese was intensely pungent, and there was a decent amount of heat to the buffalo sauce.  I am kind of picky about pizza crust, and although this may have not been exactly to my preference, it was rather good, and not at all soggy.  The pizza was well cooked.  The gumbo had generous amounts of sausage, shrimp and rice.  The flavors were good, and it was not at all &#34;fishy&#34;.  They also threw in a small (and tasty) chocolate chip cookie for dessert.  Water and tea are free.  I don&#39;t really like drinking water out of a metal cup.  But, the water was clean and cold and I assume it is better for the environment to use metal cups.

I would consider this meal to be a close to perfect &#34;fast casual&#34; dining experience.  The place is very clean.  I assume this is due to the large number of volunteers who actually outnumbered the diners while I was there.   I am eager to visit again, because the Meatball Sandwich I spotted on the way out looked amazing."

My boyfriend and I did not know that it was a non-profit when we ordered our food and were confused when we counted our &#34;change&#34; and realized that it was just the same amount that we had given her, but in smaller denominations. Even more confusion came over us once we realized that there were no prices and we hadn&#39;t even thought to ask. I think we were conversing whilst ordering so we just got confused on all fronts, but donated because we could afford our meal. 

I had the seafood and sausage jambalaya (soup like) dish and it was soooooo yummy, ended up getting a second cup. Surprisingly good. Loved how it had a nice spicy kick to it. Boyfriend had a pita sandwich with some fresh fruit on the side and he enjoyed it as well. The children they had volunteering were all very polite and in good spirits, which was refreshing to see.

I love that minds are changing and businesses are interested in feeding everyone. rich or poor.

Inspired by SAME cafe, cafe 180 is a heart felt organization with the intent to feed everyone, which i LOVED, along with the following things:

-the staff. so friendly, informative, and genuinely interested in making a difference. everyone had a smile on their face :)
-the food! all organic, locally grown, and prepared to perfection. I ate the Mediterranean salad, and a side of tomato bisque soup...yum! at any rate, you can load up your plate with anything, all handmade :)
-the &#34;prices&#34;...are actually not prices at all. &#34;donations&#34; are accepted, in the amount you can afford or want to donate. if money is an issue, payment in the form of time is greatly appreciated.
-the decor. bright pastel colors create an automatic smile as soon as you walk in, followed by an open kitchen, and fresh flowers on the tables.


overall, LOVE LOVE LOVE it here and will def return, and not just to eat :)"

Food: fresh and healthy. I had a salad and a piece of pizza to go. Both were tasty. 

Price: well, you can&#39;t beat the &#39;pay what you want&#39; plan! I decided $10 was an ok price (plus an additional $2 tip). I might take that down just a little bit next time (only based on size of salad).

The service was fast and friendly. You can tell everyone there is glad to be there and believes in what they&#39;re doing.

This is the second &#34;pay what you can&#34; restaurant I&#39;ve been to in Denver. The mission of both, affiliated restaurants, is to eliminate hunger and provide community members with the skills needed to work in the restaurant business.

Cafe 180 can always use donations of money and volunteer time. Please give generously. You will be doing something really important.

Now, to the restaurant and its food.

As others wrote, this is a bright breath of fresh air on Broadway, just north of Highway 285. It&#39;s next door to Starbucks, and offers both indoor and outdoor dining. 

I love the lightly colored earth tones inside, and I think you will too. It&#39;s a very nifty, smart design. You order at the counter, pay what you feel you should (if you have money, kick in a decent amount to help them pay for the space... and please try to pay cash so they don&#39;t have to compensate the credit card companies for using plastic), and moments later, you have some of the best, organic and natural cuisine available in that and maybe the whole Denver Metro area, with Tokyo Joe&#39;s nearby a close second for the area. 

The recipes are simple and the food tastes amazing. I walked at about 2pm. They had run out of most lunch items, like pizza and sandwiches, so I had some of the chicken enchilada soup and a Mediterranean salad. About the only negative thing I have to say is the portions were awfully small. But, each tasted delicious. As I understand, I could have asked for seconds; sadly, I had another stop to make soon after, and had to ask for my order to go.

The volunteers are kind, conscientious, and friendly. They are also happy to explain the concept and describe all the goodies on the menu. 

A lot of heart went into conceiving and bringing Cafe 180 to Metro Denver. Please take this place to heart, stop in, and enjoy its awesome fare. You will not be disappointed, and the price is always right. 

Please note, the restaurant is only open Tuesday through Saturday for lunch, which is from 11 am to 2 pm. It is only open on evenings for special events and rentals. If you need to rent a nice space that could handle about 100 people, I&#39;m sure they will give you a great price.

Best of all, having lunch at Cafe 180 is good for the heart in more ways than one."

Its a great concept to serve lunch to all, regardless of ability to pay, in a place with integrity. Believe me people this is no soup kitchen. With the  bright Qdoba type decor/ concept you never feel like your broke, or serving the homeless. This is a pay what you can, pay what you would or pay it forward concept. Just order your plate and drop your donation in the box. Comes with cookie, free ice tea too! And if you&#39;re starving they&#39;ll even give you seconds!

They feature AMAZING salads, soups, daily items and flat breads made from wheat they mill there! The food is fresh and donated by local farmers and urban gardens. Lots of their food is organic and healthy. The chef really knows how to throw down! EVERY soup I&#39;ve had there is fine dining restaurant quality. The flat breads come in an array of combinations like greek, bbq pulled pork and more. The salads could be a fresh caeser or a apple and blue cheese! All fare is served on nice white dishes and glasses, so no slop on a tray or paper plate- remember integrity! 

Cafe 180 is only open Tue-Sat until 2 so beware of your urges on a Sun or a Mon. You can also Volunteer here as they are mostly ran by volunteers so sign up people!  Volunteers also get to eat before or after their shift! They also accept donations from all over!  

When the weather is nice they have a great patio! So go check em out! Not only a great cause but a slamming lunch!"

I ordered the Opa Combo. The kitchen staff didn&#39;t bother to give me one of the dishes listed with the combo AND the Greek Lasagna dish they served had no eggplant as advertised.  As if that wasn&#39;t enough, the late delivered dish tasted exactly like the Greek Lasagna they did plate for me... a spoonful of semi-creamy salt and nutmeg!    Between the tweaker that kept coming from the kitchen looking like sweaty death reheated more than once and the waitress, who was the great Houdini, disappearing half the night, it gets better.  The spanakopita my daughter nearly choked on was reminiscent of a flaky shriveled up pastry sandwiching a dill pickle infused string heap of spinach.  

If you have 2.5 hours to kill with painfully palatable food and you don&#39;t drink water with your meal, then the service won&#39;t bother you bit. 

If you enjoy more nutmeg than a hot fall pumpkin spice latte contains, salt and dill to season your dishes, this is the place for you!

Not so good on the service tonight. The hostess seemed frazzled even though the restaurant was only about 1/2 full. She did figure out how to get me seated but she had to buss the table to get it ready. 10 minutes passed no one acknowledged my presence at my table or took my drink order. The hostess bussing a table near me noticed I hadn&#39;t been helped and said she would send some one to take my drink order. 5 minutes a waitress came over and asked if I had been helped. She seemed unsure if this was her table. She took my order and brought me water quickly. While waiting a guy came out and started bussing tables. His clothes were dirty as his person seemed to be as well. He looked like a meth head. 5 more minutes have passed and no appetizer yet. I had originally started this review with two stars but the wait and the meth head caused me to reduce it to one. I&#39;m done as I don&#39;t care how good or bad the food is in relation to this review.

I just remembered the last time I was in here with my wife the waitresses were confused as to which of them was supposed to wait on us delaying getting our orders. When I asked about it they explained they don&#39;t have specific tables/sections. The divide up the patrons as they arrive. This seems to be what causes the slow/confused service so most of the issues are management related (including hiring a meth head to buss tables)."

The food is great, the service is good and the atmosphere is ok. We went for dinner and I would recommend trying a combo plate, you get more food and the opportunity to try a variety of different options for the same price as a dinner plate. All meals come with a soup or salad option. We didn&#39;t try the soup but the salads were great. Everything we had tasted very good, although the vegetables are a little soggy, the flavors were still good. They have a full bar and a ok wine list, I would like to see a little more options on the beer list...like some Greek beers...since it is a Greek restaurant. We will def be going back!"

The gyros were made with fresh pita and good quality meat. The tzaiki sauce had a bit of a bite. We really liked the soup and salad too.

-Excellent gyro meat. Taste &amp; texture are spot on! 
- Best tzatziki sauce I&#39;ve had ever. It&#39;s thicker than others and creamy full flavor.
-Excellent side Greek salad. Generous size. Dressing is the best. Katamala olives, red onion, cucumbers, spring mix lettuce, feta cheese.. Perfect! 

Oh, and the baklava so super sweet and crunchy it really hits the spot if you craving it. It&#39;s a decent portion."

It&#39;s a nice little sit down restaurant.  Good for everything from a romantic date to just a quick bite.  Very homestyle type feel. Had the Flaming cheese, saganaki I think it&#39;s called.  YUMMY!!!  If is your first time there...you must get this.  Don&#39;t forget to yell out &#34;OPA&#34; when it catches on fire...seriously.  :)
If is your first trip you should also try their baklava...home made all from scratch...very tasty, not to sweet, and the added cinnamon made it stand out for sure.
It was obvious that there items were homemade.  For example, their entrees come with soup or salad...I highly recommend the soup, definitely all made from scratch and very flavorful.  My wife got the salad and was jealous.  I got the steak kabobs, highly recommend as well.  The owner was even out on the floor, greeting people, very friendly and all smiles.  

We are absolutely coming back.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  The only reason it wasn&#39;t a full 5 stars was due to a slight delay in the beginning with our service as well as a couple small things with my wife&#39;s entree.  She got the battered fish, turned out to be more like fish sticks then a fillet.  The side items (green beans, rice,  beets) were good...but not great.  

Regardless of the small issues, it was obvious that there is pride of ownership here.  This was a busy Friday night also, and our first visit...based on what I&#39;ve seen, I expect I will be able to turn this into 5 stars soon."

I ordered the Gyro platter, which came as a couple of quartered pitas, shredded meat, rice, veggies, and tzatiki sauce. You assemble it as little bite-sized gyros which is a fun touch and makes for easy takeout. 

The drinks list is a bit spare, but I don&#39;t do a whole lot of drinking so I won&#39;t take off a star from that. Our server was extremely prompt about keeping our drinks topped off, and she kindly helped me with the spelling of tzatiki for this review!

It is the only Greek restaurant in Parker that I know of.  I got a Greek salad with gyro and dolmades.  The dressing on the salad was tasty.  Not the ordinary dressing you get from any Greek restaurant.  In Greece, I watched how they made their dressing.  It&#39;s basically oil, vinegar, oregano, salt and pepper.   The gyro was fresh with lots of seasoning.  Excellent gyros and dolmades.  Great option for residents of Parker."

We have a few favorite Greek restaurants back home and went into Opa planning to compare it to our old favorites. This place far exceeds any Greek food we&#39;ve had. We had the combo appetizer - dolmades, hummus, feisty feta (OMG!), tzatziki, olives. You won&#39;t find feisty feta anywhere else. Sooo good. We had the lemon chicken &amp; rice soup - what a treat. We both had gyros and spanakopita.  Don&#39;t be put off by the reviews stating the veggies are mushy. Greek veggies are stewed and have amazing flavor. They are obviously made with fresh veggies - no cans here! This will be our go-to Greek restaurant - found it first try thanks to yelp. Now to find our go-to Mexican restaurant - not having much luck there."

Wish they offered a couple more traditional Greek items, but it&#39;s not bad. More of Greek-American style than mama Sophia&#39;s traditional Greek style. My Greek salad with gyros was amazing as was the fresh pita bread. However, I felt that the &#34;Kebobs&#34; weren&#39;t actually grilled over a fire for that fabulous Souvlaki traditional flavor. They were like pre-cooked then seared on a flattop. Loss of a star. While the Saganaki was delicious, it was a rather small portion. Their side dish of rice was way over cooked and mushy as were the green beans. Loss of another star. C&#39;mon folks! It&#39;s not hard to make this food! I&#39;d like to see more authentic fire-grilled vegetables like zucchini and squash with eggplant and onions and tomatoes! THAT is how great Greek food should be! Not this soggy slop that came on our plates. See photos. I will say that the only terrific food we had was the gyro meat with tzaziki, the pita bread and the salads."

Both times it was difficult to get a servers attention to pick up our order and each time something was missing in the order.  Thankfully we checked the order before departing. As mentioned in another review the vegetables and rice were flavorful but over cooked.  The Greek salad, soup, Moussaka, Pastitisio and pita bread were delicious.

Over the past year or two every time I come in something goes wrong. 1st time I had 3 pieces of meat on my Gyro while my dad had the most stuffed one you have ever seen. Next I got soup. Cold, not lukewarm or room temp but cold, like refrigerator cold. Today? The soup was salty. And to top it off I ordered; cup of Soup and a Gyro with no tomatoes and fries. My dad ordered the same thing. Seriously tells the waitress &#34; I will have the same exact thing&#34;. My soup came out, his did not, had to get another one. Then the sandwiches came out at the same time and only one plate had fries. My boyfriends sandwich came out but he got a salad and it came out with his meal.

My husband and I particularly liked the hummus and pita bread appetizer, lemon rice soup, and the kabob platters. Their chicken and pork were deliciously seasoned.

I also tried the gyro meal, and while the gyro itself was good the fries were a bit lacking compared to their traditional sides. You&#39;re better off going with one of the kabob platters."

My only complaint is the hummus is kinda of grainy, they should make it in a blender and make sure its good and creamy. Love creamy hummus made with fresh lemon.

We love their gyro sandwich, which on the dinner menu comes with fries and a side Greek salad.  The meat is always flavored perfectly, the pita bread is hot and buttery, and the salad fresh.  Our only complaints are that the fries are soggy - you might want to ask them for crisp fries - and that the salad is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes with a triangle feta block, other times it doesn&#39;t.  Sometimes it comes with cucumbers, other times it doesn&#39;t.

Notwithstanding the small inconsistencies in food, the flavors are always spot on.  This is a great option in North Parker."

Some people do NOT want to be happy with anything. They love to complain and play victim.

That said...I have been to Opa Grill multiple times with my family, friends and just by myself. I have never been disappointed! Nor has anyone that I have been with. The food is delicious. The servers try hard....but one thing about restaurant staff....they try, but most people (not just peeps that work in restaurants).... Can&#39;t think themselves out of a box. I would say that is 95% of  employees. Outside of assertive, educated CEO types and business owners. 

I don&#39;t say that to be mean....but really, a little understanding goes a long way. They do care....to the best of their ability. Like any restaurant or business. 

As far as the food...I love it! It is always fresh and tasty. Definitely not canned. You can&#39;t go wrong here. They are friendly, and the food rocks! Give them a try.

Oh....and another thing about reviews on these review sites....I don&#39;t think the businesses &#34;pad&#34; the reviews or use email addy&#39;s to give themselves good reviews. I think that all businesses ask good customer&#39;s to review them. Nothing wrong with that. I really wish this country had fewer negative, Armageddon minded scrouges."

She&#39;d been here many times and insisted it was amazing. My husband and I met my family there and from the get go, everything was HORRIBLE. The hostess took our drink orders to try to help the server out. About 15 minutes later, the waitress finally appears seeming extremely annoyed only to tell us she needed our drink orders again. Ummm...ok. No need to be rude, lady. There were only 5 of us no I&#39;m not sure why it took another 15 minutes for her to get our drink orders out to us. Once we finally did, she just walked away. Not asking if we were ready to order anything. We had to flag her down once our drinks were empty to even get her to pay attention to us. We feel so rude flagging her down, but she was seriously completely avoiding us. Once she finally made her way over, she took our order and was very unhelpful when answering questions about the menu. We ordered the sampler for our appetizer and she brought out a giant plate of three different dips with four...I repeat FOUR small triangles of peta bread...remember that one time when I mentioned that there were FIVE of us?! Yea....So, once we were able to track our waitress down again, we politely asked for some more pita. Once again she brought us another FOUR triangles. What the hell???? When she finally brought out our soups and salads, mine was covered in red onions after I had specifically asked for NO onions as I&#39;m highly allergic. I mentioned it to her, but she just walked away because she clearly had no fucks to give. When she once again took her time coming back to us, we asked kindly for more pita bread and for some feta as they did not put any on any of our greek salads. So, she returns with a GIANT plate full of feta and yet again another 4 pieces of pita bread. 
Besides the HORRENDOUS service we received, I would say the food was slightly above fair. Nothing special about it. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but either way I will never be stepping foot in this place again. For what they charge, you deserve to treated like an actual human being. 
Side note....when we got our bill, the waitress had charged us for all the &#34;extra&#34; pita bread we asked for. Seriously ridiculous."

I was passed around to a couple of people before speaking with someone that was familiar with my order. I once again explained my order and the issue I was having, and she proceeded to tell me that I didn&#39;t place the order for the Gyros Sandwich??? I specially recall ordering what I intended to have for dinner and I even got the side that went along with it.

It was dinner time and the place was dead, not a soul but me and the host/bar tender. 

I asked for my tzatziki sauce on the sandwich instead of on the side. The bartender said it only came on the side and asking for it on the sandwich might be an inconvenience. But she asked and the cook put it on the sandwich. She gave me the bill for $9 which I thought was  a pretty good price for a sandwich, fries and a dinner salad. But then when she went to ring it up she said, &#34;I charged you for the lunch instead of dinner so it will be $12 instead.&#34; Still not a bad price lol, just convenient that it was my first time here and obviously dinner time....but perhaps she&#39;d also had a long day. 

The dinner was good. I think I could get the same type of sandwich at a Rubio&#39;s for a little less. But it&#39;s convenient and I&#39;ve wanted to try this place for a while. Just need a little tightening up of the customer service. Next time we might try dining in."

The eggplant was warm and yummy and came on bed of lettuce and tomatoes with a few triangles of feta cheese. I&#39;m a big fan of eggplant so I often order it when it&#39;s available without breading. The sandwiches come with a side of french fries, salad, or lemon chicken rice soup. I opted for the soup, which wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had, but the flavors of lemon and chicken stood out. It had a bit too much rice and salt for my liking.

The saganaki (imported melted Greek cheese flamed with brandy) is delicious. Their pita bread, hummus, tzatsiki, and tirokaftiri are also very good, with attractive presentations and decent portions. 

What I tend to find lacking is the service. You&#39;re hard pressed to get refills, the food sometimes takes up to 40 minutes to come out, and the servers generally seem rushed and distracted. They are always genuinely nice and apologetic about this, but of the 10 or so times that I&#39;ve visited for lunch, there isn&#39;t a whole lot of difference in service. (Which is strange, because besides the owners, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever seen the same server there twice). 

All in all, the food is worth it, if you have a little time to spare to wait."

Did a to-go order last night and was delighted. &#34;Heather&#34; took my order and was helpful and friendly. I picked it up after about 15 min and it was ready at the bar for me. 

A first-timer, so I ordered some standard items to give it a good compare:
Gyro Sandwich 
Hummus
Feta Cheese &amp; Olives
Chicken, Lemon, Rice Soup

I thought the gyro was really flavorful. Great meat (lots) and fresh bread.

I make my own hummus, so it better be good. And it was good and there was much rejoicing (yea).

The Feta and Olives were salty good as they should be.

The soup was a surprise. I make a cream of wild rice soup and this was a close proximity. Nicely done. I think the lemon in the title threw me off as it&#39;s not a sour soup.

All in all, great experience, We will come back and dine-in sometime. Really glad to have a Greek restaurant in Parker."

Kronos gyro meat is consistently good, so I&#39;m very happy with the food quality. Salad veggies weren&#39;t cut very well (I got 1/4 of a large tomato and 3 thick partially sliced pieces of Cucumber... Atleast they were fresh!). Not a big deal, perhaps I can get a discount next time for cutting my own veggies though. Meal showed signs of quality ingredients and had great flavor.

I can&#39;t imagine it getting any better.  I&#39;m already figuring out my next visit to Opa Grill.... and who will I will invite to share in this great tasting Greek food.

I only came here initially cause it&#39;s close to my job and I&#39;m so tired of to-go meals from Chipolte, Red Robin, etc...  I was excited to see Greek as an option in Parker, but somewhat hesitant when I saw less than 4 stars on Yelp!  I read the Yelp reviews and was happy to be able to review the menu 1st before my visit.  Veggie plate. Check.

On arrival, I was greeted by the owner (seemed like the owner?).  I told him I had to take my order to-go and proudly ordered the &#34;Athenian Veggie Plate&#34; as if I had it hundreds of times.  Plus a Baklava (why not?). My sweetie ordered a &#34;Gyros ...with rice ...and uh.. beans&#34; (he apparently had not reviewed the menu options -- but the owner made it work...&#34;ahh.. yes,  green beans, no problem&#34;).  We both had choice the Chicken-Lemon-Rice soup or Greek Salad.  We both opted for salads.

In the car ride to work, I peaked into the styrofoam containers and was very pleased with the presentation within.
One large box to contain a fresh looking salad with kalamata olives, feta, etc...
Second box housed my warmed pita bread (I think the bread belonged to sweetie but I kept it anyways). Third box with nicely arranged stuffed grape leaves on a bed of lettuce with a generous helping of hummus.
Fourth box with my triangle of Spinach pie, rice, green beans and potatoes.  Fifth (and last) box with a huge slice of Baklava.  I never suspected the Baklava would be this good... a bit different from what I&#39;m used to.
I want more."

My family and I ordered the flaming cheese appetizer to share which was lit table side by our very friendly and genial server.  It was yummy, yummy!

I ordered a gyros sandwich with a salad for the main course.  It&#39;s hard to really mess up a gyro, but this was above average - the slices of meat were thick and the meat wasn&#39;t crunchy or overcooked as sometimes can be.   

The decor was very nice inside the restaurant and they aren&#39;t afraid to run the A/C - something I very much appreciated given that it was over 100 degrees outside that day.

Pretty much the only negative was that someone was a little too heavy-handed with the oil in the oil and vinegar mix on the salad.

This place is definitely worth a try if you are in the Parker area."

This is a nice little place for Greek.  Visited for lunch. Had a simple Gyro, fries and salad.  Food was fresh and good. Gyro was packed with meat and everything tasted very good. 

This is another nice place for a change in menu that Parker has available. 

Although waitress was very friendly, she was a little inattentive.  Service tip.... A water glass, ice tea glass or soda glass should never run empty!! If you are only going to serve small glasses full of ice and a little beverage, then you need to take the time to keep the glass full.  Otherwise, serve in bigger glasses.  Or leave a pitcher or craft on the table so the patron can refill.  There is no excuse in restaurant business to be so busy that you cannot keep drinks filled.  It was lunch hour.  You should be prepared for this. 

Probably would have given the 4 star if not for this."

Another dish I recommend to friends who join me and that haven&#39;t eaten there before is the sampler appetizer dish.

We like it. But it only comes in a 10&#34; size and it is expensive, just under $14.

Here is the real issue though with Micis&#39;. If you buy a pizza for carryout or have one delivered, you better make sure that you open the box before leaving the store or paying the delivery person. Too many times we (and friends here in Stapleton) have been given a errant pizza order; forgetting to put on toppings or adding toppings we specifically did not order, or even once, making us a non-cheese pizza!

One time, our pizza was woefully undercooked. Easy enough to pop it into our oven but still, no excuse.

Yes, they will acknowledge their error but that&#39;s about it. Expect to wait at the store for 20 minutes while they remake the correct pizza or, 40 minutes to get the correct one delivered.

Getting a good pizza on a consistent basis in Denver is like Finding Waldo. We are not ardent fans of any one pizzeria but do like the fact that Patxi&#39;s offers Daiya Cheese substitute. Too bad Patxi&#39;s pizzas are like massive dough bombs that sit in one&#39;s digestive track for days!"

It is a little pricey, but worth it over chain pizza places. I&#39;d order again, but actually go in. Also, delivery person was kind.

Update: I went in yesterday and didn&#39;t realize it was a little place. The pizza is still great. My boyfriend had the calzone, it was good, but the sauce wasn&#39;t up my alley. They have Andes mint gelato, which I wanted with all my heart, but they were out. Needless to say I&#39;ll be back and I&#39;ll be having this gelato."

My normal inclination would have been to turn around and leave once I saw that it was counter service.  Turns out my initial reaction was largely correct.  Don&#39;t misunderstand, this place is awesome as a kid&#39;s pizza parlor and ice cream shop.  It makes a lot of sense in the neighborhood it is in to run this type of business.  But don&#39;t for a second try to convince yourself that this place is a fine Italian restaurant.  It is not and that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.  There are plenty of local pizza delivery places that have long, successful runs slinging pizza to satisfied customers year in, year out.  Nothing at all wrong with that.  In fact if Mici&#39;s would just do that and do that well, I would applaud them for understanding where to draw the line.      

Where I have a bone to pick with them is the attempt at real Italian food on the menu and a feeling of overreaching.  The salads are all made from obvious pre-mix which has the unfortunate tendency of going bad quickly.  What this results in is a salad lightly sprinkled with rotten pieces of lettuce that, once discovered, render the entire dish inedible.  Whatever happened to the craft of pantry work?  The prep cook who washes fresh lettuce daily to insure the customer has a crisp, fresh salad?  It must not be cost effective, is my guess.  The gigantic mural on the wall of the extended family - would they have bought pre-mix lettuces to serve customers and called it their own culinary creation? 

The panini sandwiches are also a bit of a miss.  The beauty of the panini is the forced fusing of taste elements via the press.  The other beauty is starting with high quality bread.  Mici did seem to get that part right, but the fusing didn&#39;t take, so what gets served is a pile of &#34;stuff&#34; on almost completely dry ciabatta.  Fresh tomatoes are kind of a big deal if tomatoes are one of the main ingredients in the sandwich.  In my case, the tomatoes were not fresh, but mealy.  The lasagna was odd.  I swear I tasted olive oil, which isn&#39;t necessarily &#34;wrong&#34;, just strange for this dish.  The whole plate was overly oily.  The flavors weren&#39;t bad and again, the garlic bread was probably the best part of the dish.  That shouldn&#39;t be the case.  I get it.  If you want to run a family place you have to offer something besides just pizza.  But execution is key.  

For around thirty dollars for two people, this is not what I would describe as a good value for money.  At that price point, things need to be fresh and correct the large majority of the time.    On the positive side, the staff was very welcoming, responsive to complaints and generally present, so that goes a long way, but it does not overcome the food issues.    

After the kids&#39; soccer game a few pies and some gelato for dessert is about the speed of Mici&#39;s, so go with that flow and resist your grown-up feelings for the more nuanced cuisines presented on the menu.  If I return to find a much abridged menu I will consider that a good start."

That being said it is a tad overpriced...you&#39;ll end up spending $40-50 to feed a family, where you could easily do it for $25 having pizza delivered from elsewhere. 

The other bummer for us was they don&#39;t have breadsticks but charge $8 for a side of garlic bread, and ours was dried out and so no one touched it. Don&#39;t waste you money on that. 

The crust is good and I appreciate all the veggie option and unique combos they offer."

This recent visit was on Thursday July 24th 2014.  Time was about 20:00hrs ish.  When we came to this establishment, man this establishment is jam packed, with other patrons alike.  Yes, you order at the counter, and they will send your order to where you are seating with the NUMBER TOKEN.

From the Menu, we opt to have the following items :

*  Panini Chicken Parm ($8.00)
*  LARGE Antipasta Salad ($9.25)
*  10&#34; Create Your Own Pizza, my option being Anchovies and Artichoke ($10.00)
*  2 Soft Drink (@1.75) each, hence it was ($3.50)  

Yes, they have Decent options.  But since the WEATHER is TOO hot, Hubs opt to have the Salad, but he FORGOT to inform the staff to remove all the PORK OR HAM products that comes along with this salad.  *SIGH*

Decent Dinner.  The staff sent our food to the table we are seating.  Hubs had to remove all the PORK OR HAM products from the Salad.  The ANTIPASTA SALAD contains Mixed greens, Salami, Ham, Provolone, Mozzarella, Olives, Artichoke hearts, Roasted Red Peppers, Pepperoncini, Pepperoni and Tomatoes.  Hubs opt to have Blue Cheese for his Salad too.

Hubs also had the Pollo Parmigiana aka Chicken Parmesan with Breaded Chicken Breast, Marinara Sauce and Mozzarella baked on an Italian Roll. 

I cannot deny the Anchovies on my Pizza was a little too salty for my taste bud but those Pizza was indeed additive.  Now if only they can offer other shellfish as well, that would definitely be my kind of Pizza Heaven!

Later after our Dinner we opt to purchase 2 Sorbets TO GO.  Decent Sorbet I must add, coz it MELT WAY TO FAST due to the weather??  Hubs even like the sorbet he had.  I could not recall what we had for the Sorbet but it was like about $3.35 for a Small and $4.35 for the Medium Sorbet, I think.  We might return when needed since its near to our hood.

They need to keep the &#34;flies&#34; away at this establishment.  Coz while dining away, I need to &#34;SWAP&#34; a couple of those nasty flies away from the food we are having.  Maybe since one, a lot of people come in and out of the door and perhaps the &#34;INSECT/FLY&#34; SWAPPER or &#34;Detector&#34; DO NOT WORK.  *SIGH*

There are plenty to seat outside too, AKA the PATIO when the weather permits.  This was my observation since many more Patrons came in dining in, taking the opportunity to seat at the Patio, while having their Wine and Dinner away.  Another observation, many more Patrons decide to have SORBETs or Gelatos from this establishment that evening too.

Opening hours of this MICI is as following :

Monday - Wednesday : 11 AM - 9 PM
Thursday - Saturday : 11 AM - 10 PM
Sunday : 11 AM - 9 PM

We ordered a sausage and mush pizza and some pasta and paid about 25 bucks with tip. 10 inch pizza and a single order of pasta filled 2 hungry people with a leftover slice for breakfast for me. The pizza was good but the pasta really stuck out to me. I was happy over all, other things stuck out about this place was the lady at the front was so nice, and it was seriously clean. I really wish they offered higher quality soda. I love having pizza with some jones soda from the fountain. This place had Coke products I believe which I just don&#39;t enjoy nearly as much."

Unfortunately, I can only vouch for two menu items because once I find something I like, I tend to stick with it.  But what I can tell you is this:  the Palermo Panini on foccacia bread is hands down the best sandwich I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life!!  It&#39;s melt-in-your mouth savory, the veggies add the perfect hint of bitterness, and the bread soaks up a wonderful extra virgin olive oil that lingers after the sandwich has been devoured. 

The other out-of-this-world, ridiculously delicious item at Mici&#39;s are the pignoli cookies.  They are sweet without being too sweet, moist, soft, and made savory by the pine nuts on top.  They are very pricey at $1 apiece, but worth every single penny.  I typically order 6-12 to savor over the week.  

Prices are very reasonable for the size and quantity you get.  Yes, it&#39;s an $8 sandwich, but half will fill you up and leave you impatiently waiting until enough time has passed that you can justify eating the second half as another meal.

Delivery has always been prompt and typically accurate.  The only time they made a mistake they admitted it proactively and corrected it right away.  

Try out Mici&#39;s.  It&#39;s such a step up from pizza!"

I was craving a salad and somehow ended up here and ordering past - like I said, bad decision from the get go.  

Location is convenient for me, right in my hood close to my doggie daycare place.  Everything is clean or the inside and outside and they have some beautiful outdoor patio seating which I took advantage of.  

I ordered the tortellini with prosciutto de parma and peas I think with a side Cesar Salad to start.  The Cesar Salad was the best thing I had not including the water.  It was lightly dressed and had fresh Parmesan shaved on top, I added some pepper and I was one happy girl.  Then the tortellini, frozen or refrigerated pasta from King Soopers in a bland cream sauce.  The prosciutto did not taste or look fresh at all and overall the whole thing lacked flavor.  I only ate about 1/4 of my pasta and left disappointed.  

I like the concept of this place, maybe their pizza is better.  I&#39;m probably not returning to find out."

I had the lunch special. Half sandwich, half salad. THEY WERE DELICIOUS. Loved the sandwich (turkey with pesto) and the salad (house salad with balsamic, grapes, walnuts). 

Everyone else ate their plates clean too. The kid had a slice of pizza and a salad. My friend had a sandwich (I can&#39;t remember which one). Then the kid got some gelato for dessert.

I have pretty high standards when it comes to Italian. I come from an Italian family who makes pasta, sauces, cheeses, and desserts completely from scratch. I feel that my Italian family could teach Mici a thing or two about how to handcraft a true Italian meal. 

Unfortunately, I find Mici&#39;s food bland and underwhelming. The pasta tastes like what you would buy in the refrigerated pasta section at Safeway. It&#39;s not good. We had the cheese tortellini and the consistency was just off. We got the pesto sauce on top. Disappointing pesto showing, lacking in flavor and freshness. We have tried other dishes in the past as well and have felt the same.  We also ordered the Piatto Antipasti, which was supposed to have artichokes in it. It had none. I was very disappointed as this was one of my reasons for ordering this salad.  It was very small for the price. I ordered this before at one of their other locations and it was bigger and tastier, so I am confused as to why it&#39;s different at this location. Lastly, the garlic bread was super hard and there was not much of a garlic taste present. 

Overall, I am just not impressed with Mici. After giving it a couple chances, I&#39;m just not feeling this place and likely won&#39;t revisit."

I think the food is overall great, decent pizza and super convenient for me. I love the Mici&#39;s downtown and would grab lunch there often. But the past two orders have been messed up in some way. 

First, a couple of months ago - I called in an order and when I got there to pick it up they had just sent my pizza out with someone else. It is an honest mistake and they offered to remake the pizza. I declined, because I didn&#39;t want to wait for another pizza. I took it home. It was ok, although room temperature by the time I got it back from the other people and made it home. I chalked it up to an accident, but didn&#39;t let it sway my love of Mici&#39;s. 

Last night, I put in an order and ran to pick it up. I ordered a Cristofiori, Insalada Mista, and The bruschetta with mozzarella. I had added some veggies to the pizza and when I got home - all the veggies where there but no chicken. They forgot to give my salad all together and the bread was pretty bad. I called and they offered to remake the pizza and deliver it, but I thought it would be quicker to just run an grab it. The pizza was great and the salad was good (what I expected). But the bread was not even worth it a little. It was garlic bread with cheese just melted as if they stuck it in the microwave. It wasn&#39;t crisped up or broiled. It looked pretty lifeless. It didn&#39;t have a great garlic punch or anything. I ended up throwing it away, I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to eat it. 

I think the customer service is good and they always try to right their mistakes! Overall atmosphere is nice and the food is good. It is on the pricey side, but that&#39;s what you get for gourmet pizza. I will likely give them one more try, but triple check my order before I leave this time."

The good (sort of): I ordered delivery, the delivery person was nice, and got my food fast. Too fast. I ordered at 5PM on a weekend. They knocked on my door 16 minutes after I received the order confirmation email (and Google said the drive was 6 minutes). Although I normally appreciate a speedy delivery, this was suspiciously quick. Combined with the cold pasta (see below), it looks like they had it precooked.  

The bad: My pasta was cold, and the lettuce in my salad was pretty disgusting. The flavor of the pasta actually wasn&#39;t bad. At least, it didn&#39;t taste microwaved. But despite the 16 minute delivery (or because of it...) my pasta was mostly cold - some shells were lukewarm, but most were cold (as though it sat under a heat lamp for awhile, and the top shells got warmed up a bit). I got a side salad and just threw it away. About a third of the lettuce was browning and had that slimy moist consistency that happens just before it starts to rot. And the zucchini slices were so dry they had the consistency of construction paper. 

I&#39;ll keep looking for my go-to Italian place near Park Hill, and I suggest you do the same unless you are just looking for fast food. 

(Since I see that the manager likes to call and offer gift cards or free meals - I can save you the trouble and tell you that I don&#39;t want any more meals here, even free ones. Instead of always apologizing after the fact, put your energy into fixing the problems.)"

Oh, and that wasn&#39;t Applebee&#39;s.  The client was a bit annoyed at first that he had had to drive into a &#34;neighborhood&#34; to get there, but he was not at all disappointed once the food arrived.  Thick tomato basil soup with big hunks of crusty bread, delicious tortellini with prosciutto, and a glass of wine totally changed his mood.  I had a gluten-free pizza that was a bit hard of crust, but the delightful sauce totally made up for it.  Best of all, we were in and out in half an hour.  Perfecto!

Our estimated delivery time was about 40 minutes. After probably an hour, I used the chat option on GrubHub&#39;s site because there was no sign of our food and Mici hadn&#39;t contacted us to report any issues. I can&#39;t say enough about GrubHub&#39;s customer service - they called called the restaurant, let me know that they were running late, and then offered me a $25 credit to make up for an issue that wasn&#39;t really even their fault.

Mici FINALLY delivered (50 minutes late, and they&#39;re literally a 4 minute drive from me), and the food was...meh. My pasta was pretty good, but I could&#39;ve made the same at home cheaper and faster. My husband said he only ate his because he was so hungry by the time we got it. Our garlic bread was kind of a joke, and it was cold. They gave us a card for a free entree, but we never bothered because we never wanted to wait that long for mediocre food. I could&#39;ve ordered Pizza Hut pasta - at least that&#39;s usually still hot when I get it."

The GM comped my meal as an additional apology, which was kindly appreciated.

I very much appreciate the extra effort, like I said in my original review, the staff is nice and attentive. And as you can see, the food is good enough that I keep going back, even if I call in my order first. 

____________

The food here is half-decent for Italian fast-casual. Fair bit of options between paninis, pizza, pasta, soups and salad. Italian ice cream available too. 

The staff is nice and attentive. I have been pleased with their interactions. 

The main problem I&#39;ve been having here is how long it takes to get food, even when they&#39;re slow. It always takes over 10 minutes, even if you&#39;re the only customer. 15+ during lunch. I&#39;ve taken to calling in my orders but even then they aren&#39;t always ready 10-15 minutes later. 

In fact, this review was written during my 21 minute wait for a salad today. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t call it in. 

This isn&#39;t fast-causal because there is nothing fast about the service. 

Prices feel about $0.50-$1.00 on the high end for most menu options."

The menu is posted in an tight space near the place you order, so you can get in the way of patrons as you read the BIG somewhat complex. I think they need to reposition the selection board.
Will go back as the family lives about a 10 minute drive."

Sure the parking is free and it&#39;s easier to access but it misses the mark.  I ordered a house salad.  It was a large portion but extremely pricey for the quality.  I expected an awesome salad for almost $10.  It was far from that.  It seemed as if bagged ingredients were quickly tossed together and the lettuce was ice cold (a pet peeve of mine).  If you can&#39;t add anything special to the basic ingredients of a salad don&#39;t tout that as a specialty item at your restaurant.  The salad was served with two generous pieces of bread.  That was a plus.

In all fairness, I didn&#39;t try the pizza at this location so I can&#39;t speak on that.  I was so disappointed with the salad that I don&#39;t feel the need to return to try it."

Went there for dinner with a couple people. I liked my pasta and liked that they gave us what seemed to be a good deal of bread. The portions seemed large to me. 

Atmosphere wise, there were a lot of families there with kids and the place was loud with all the commotion. Eventually, the families left and it was nice. I&#39;d say the seating was too basic and close. Not a lot of privacy. We had pizza eating kids watching us a couple feet away for about half the dinner. I like kids too, but there should be some space. I can see how this is a popular place to take kids for a pizza given all the families in the neighborhood. Lot closer than Anthony&#39;s for families. If you&#39;re looking for a calmer atmosphere, maybe come nearer closing, like 8, or go earlier in the day.

I returned another night to try the gelato. Really enjoyed the gelato in Italy and wanted to try theirs. I got the lemon. It was ok, but there was something not right about it... not sure how to explain it best... had a thickened taste, like something had been added to thicken it. And there was a soft, coagulated portion in it, so not sure what that was about. I spit that out. If you&#39;ve made stove top pudding before, and the issues with crust-like formations in it, it was sort of like that. Wasn&#39;t worth the price in my opinion. 

The service here was friendly and down to earth. They have a Noodles &amp; Company style set up, where you order the food from a cashier and they bring it to your table.  

I look forward to trying something else on their menu, like pizza, but will not do the gelato again. Just my experience. I&#39;m sure others will have different ones."

If you&#39;re looking for NY style pizza this is not the place for you.  

If you like a thinner flavorful crust with the perfect amount of toppings not overwhelmed by sauce then try it out.  We&#39;ve tried the formaggio, Giardino (my personal fave), Mediterrano and Caprarola.  All delicious and cooked to perfection.

I had a coupon for a $1 personal size pizza that was olive oil, cheese and zucchini.  It was pretty good--a little bland for my taste but it was good.  I also got a caesar salad and it was really good.  Not overly dressed and had a nice grating of parmesan cheese on top.

The place is clean and modern--great for lunch.  Not sure it has that cozy dinner time feel, but great for getting something to go if you live in the area.

Prices were medium high to me.  I will have to check them out for a large pepperoni pizza to see how they compare to other pizza joints.  The crust was pretty good though on my personal pizza.

This is not Olive Garden, the menu is full of traditional Italian dishes rather than cliched standards. All the sauces are very tasty, though you need to know what you&#39;re ordering or you might not like what you end up with. 

My only complaint would be the smallish servings of meat: they are add ons to the pasta dishes, a single serving of meat in the middle of a huge dish of pasta. 

The pizza is good if you like Italian style, the sandwiches are probably the best Italian sandwiches I&#39;ve had. Overall I highly recommend Micis."

Tonight, I ordered two personal pizzas online. Went to pick up and was told we had about 8-10 minutes to wait. No problem!!  Ten minutes later, a staff person approached to inform me that they made one of the pizzas wrong, did I just want to take it?  Ummmm. No. I want the pizza I ordered.  Wait another 15 minutes (declined the glass of wine offered). Pizzas come out with half hearted apology and an extra box - with the &#34;mistake&#34; pizza.   Didn&#39;t want it as a substitute -still don&#39;t!  Unfortunately, my pizza with artichoke hearts had more of a sprinkling of artichoke heart parts. Straight-from-the-can black olives and barely ripe tomatoes in September?  Not hand-crafted Italian in my book. The crust is decent, if a little heavy on the oil. I understand mistakes happen - but 40 minutes for two small mediocre pizzas??  Not again.  We will stick to Allegra&#39;s Pizza - their friendly service and  top quality ingredients are well worth the extra two minutes in the car!!

UPDATE:  The owner contacted me and apologized for the experience and offered either a refund or gift certificate.  I understand a bad night can happen and hope this will be a good opportunity to train staff to react better in the future!  CHEERS!"

This time the food arrived and one of the two salads we ordered was wrong and one of two dinners, the pasta creamy pesto, was dried out and quite honestly disgusting. Still, no big deal we contacted eat 24 for a refund on the two items ordered and we were informed that could not be done but offered us an $8.00 credit on $15 worth of unsatisfactory food. I called Mici&#39;s directly and spoke to a wait person who was very nice but it went downhill from there. Apparently a manager got on the phone and straight away they copped an attitude. Unfortunately, many restaurant managers are ill prepared to manage and don&#39;t possess the interpersonal skills to deal with customers. I was definitely hacked off after being treated rudely. We will never eat here again and in addition the pasta dish was plain, dry and devoid of taste and did not look fit  serve to the paying public."

I had tried both of their other locations and enjoyed it for the combination of price, quality and convenience.  When I worked downtown, I would order from that location quite often if I was in the office late (the calzones always hit the spot).

That being said, I was excited when I found out there was a Mici location going in only one block from my house!  I finally went there the other day and got exactly what I expected, fairly good food at a reasonable price that was ready when they said it would be.  I also realized they had gelato there (one of my favorites), which I hadn&#39;t noticed at the other locations (guess I wasn&#39;t looking close enough), and was excited to come back and try the various flavors. 

Overall, I would normally give Mici 3-4 starts.  The food isn&#39;t amazing, but it is good.  HOWEVER, when I ordered from Mici this time, I carried out my order.  Because of this I didn&#39;t leave a tip (I don&#39;t tip when I carry out, I know some people will disagree with this, but you have to draw the line somewhere).  When the purchase from that night posted on my credit card, I noticed the staff at Mici had added a 15% tip to the total.  This was after I had put a line through the tip line and written the original amount on the total line of the receipt.  

Because of this lack of integrity and respect for their customers, I will not be going back to Mici ever again.  Take it for what you will, but I refuse to support an establishment that operates in this manner.

EDIT:

After posting this review, one of the owners of Mici contacted me stating that the added tip was an employee error between my receipt and another of the same amount.  I have never worked in the restaurant industry, so I have no idea how easy or difficult it is to make this mistake.  Either way, the owner was very apologetic and ended up refunding the entire charge from that night.  I very much appreciate the follow-up and will most likely now be returning at some point in the future."

I alternate between the verdura panini and the gardino calzone (both are yummy vegetarian options). The kids get noodles with sauce on the side, and the server Keven remembers better than I do which kid gets which sauce. The Gelato is such a delicious treat, seeing which flavors are in the rotation is a fun surprise each visit. Mici has catered a few birthdays for my kids, a few larger community events for Stapleton&#39;s RNO SUN, and our department administrator at Anschutz has ordered from them a few times, always resulting in positive feedback.

Congrats on your year anniversary in my neighborhood - 
Funny it was last year and a few days after your grand opening that we came in -
I remember noticing the NY pizza sign as we passed and had to stop - 
We don&#39;t have many place in Denver that make NY style pizza and as rare as I am a (Denver Native) it&#39;s also hard to find real Italians that make it here- lol 
Being said that, 
Today I woke up with a NY style pizza craving that got only worst as the time passed- 
Was gonna try the usual spot just to get by, but really didn&#39;t want to drive across town, or deal with the usual crowd just to get my fix- 
I remembered this place and my special Yelp offer of garlic knots, I also remember I&#39;ve only eaten in here once last year- (delivery a couple of times)
So enough of the stories of how long and my monstrous craving that can&#39;t be tamed - 
After today I do believe this Italian found his way to my heart thru my stomach - 
I also feel like my sweet and charming self again ,.....see ya next craving -
To be continued ...."

Less than an hour later we had a giant meat pizza ( thin crust) , some pepperoni rolls and garlic knots.  The family loved everything.  The only thing I personally didn&#39;t like was that there were peppers in the rolls, but I ordered it without the second time and they were great!!

Now this is our first pick for pizza.  The price is fair, not cheap, but not over the top either."

I moved to Denver the day the snowstorm rolled in from Los Angeles. ( hold all wisecracks for now:) ..because we are still waiting for boxes to show up,i decided eating pizza would be the best bet. ..prior to calling Brooklyn&#39;s Finest, i placed online orders with Pizza Hut and Dominoes only to get to the final screen to be told - &#34; no delivery today&#34;

huh?  isn&#39;t this like..the whole point of those two companies? ..then i glance out my window and consider the almost foot of snow on the ground..

maybe this damn snow is getting in the way of my hunger... #losing...

so being the LA gal I am and still in full denial I CANT GET WHAT I WANT.. i find  delivery service which gives me approximately six pizzerias to select from.  after checking the Yelp reviews, the only choice worth the chance was Brooklyn&#39;s Finest. 

so i place my order. i get the confirmation of delivery in less than an hour..  what I didn&#39;t accont for was being LA transplant who gave the wrong address...

yes..thats me.. so fast forward to my mobile phone ringing off the hook, with zero reception as the driver confirmed and reconfirmed the address... while annoyed i respond..

&#34; yes..the address is correct. i don&#39;t know what to tell you..&#34; 

fade to my boyfriend looking outside seeing no driver and yelling up..&#34;you told them 3129 right?&#34;

silence. gulp.

deer in headlights look as i realize i didn&#39;t know my own address....

FINALLY we correct the issue, the ever so patient driver arrives with our food..no hint of attitude for looking up and down a block for an address that didn&#39;t exist...

we get food. we eat it. FAST. and quietly... the garlic knots had little chance of survival. 

DELISH.

pizza...so good i thought for a quick second i was back in NYC...

this will be the first of many orders..any company that can weather  my stupid... AND deliver great eats...more than deserves my business.:)"

I loved that he is involved in the kitchen and is up front to meet his customers and take phone orders.
Being a cook I know that this is what matters and is important , to have an involved and engaged chef .

He recommended the time square as a favorite so I had to. The jalapeño cream cheese was absolutely delicious it added so much richness and sweetness and really brought this pie together. 

Excellent pizza and excellent owner."

My friend and I ordered a pizza and got there a little early to pick it up but the main guy was on top of it to tell us how much time left we were looking out and was even nice enough to give us some desserts because he was training someone. Super cool and totally not necessary but really nice he went out of his way for us. We haven&#39;t even eaten the pizza yet and it smells so good! Can&#39;t wait to dig into the deliciousness!

We also got the classic meat stromboli. next time I would get without the ham.  the ham kind of overwhelmed the whole thing but still the best Stromboli I&#39;ve had in Colorado so far. Everything tasted fresh. if we were in the area again we would definitely hit this place up.

+ Hard liquor + beer and wine.
+ Very good pizza. Had the NYNY. The red sauce is fresh and slightly sweet. Decent amount of toppings The crust could have spend another 1-2 minutes in the oven.
+ Wi-Fi.

It is good pizza. But, not in my top 5. I can walk to 15 pizza places from my house so the choices are pretty amazing.

Good crust and topping distribution is the first thing I noticed. 

I ordered with extra sauce since most NY style pies are a little short on the red. 

The biggest standout for me was the topping quality. Sure the cheese was good, but the star of the pie was the Pepperoni, some of the most flavorful I&#39;ve tasted and really made the Za. 

While it may not take you back to Brooklyn, it&#39;s gets you pretty close to the Subway"

I pass by your pizza joint everyday and have always wanted to try it. The other day I was outta town and the wifey ordered some pies. Tonight she recommended this for dinner, and I said. &#34;You buy and I fly.&#34;

She was correct in her assessment. Your pies are damn good and the Yelp check-in garlic knots are killer too!

I ordered 6 toppings for a total of an additional 9 bucks (yes, nine...think about that!); at that price I expected one heavy-ass pizza and frankly, I&#39;m not even certain I got them all because they were so scant. $1.50 for garlic?

A little dry and tough to get the 5 stars here.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, this pizza is better than 98 percent of the za available locally, but the crust is a little on the tough and dry side to earn my five stars.

We just tried Brooklyns Finest a few days ago after reading reviews on yelp and we can&#39;t get enough! I&#39;m hooked. 
In three days..... two of us smashed two 18 inches, plus 12 knots, plus a salad and a slice and I honestly  could go for another pie tonight.
We tried 2 signature pies....Little Italy and Hell&#39;s Kitchen. 
The crust is perfectly crispy, a distinct crunch with everybite and the ingredients are fresh and tasty. Little italy has an olive oil base, fresh garlic, tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, topped with basil. Heaven to my taste buds. I recommend getting  the basil on the side that way when you reheat the pizza you can sprinkle it on fresh to avoid burning. 
Hell&#39;s Kitchen with sausage, garlic, cherry peppers and mozzarella has some heat with every mouthful! Can&#39;t wait to try more signature combos! 
Extremely great prices for the fresh quality you get. I have seen similar pizza but with a much higher price tag!

I&#39;ve eaten some weird weird weird stuff in my day, from horse to wild dog to raw rooster livers to gazelle, and a lot in between.  Random tangent there, my bad.

The girlfriend and I had been to the mainstream chain places (see Dae Gee), and we wanted to try something more authentic.  My sister had raved about the fried chicken here, and the fat kid in me knew it was only a matter of time before I was to taste it.  I cannot deprive myself of fried poultry for too long, or else bad things happen.

Came in STARVING.  Hangry as hell, and needing some food in my life.  Got it.

Dude, that fried chicken.  I was wondering why it took 20 damn minutes, but holy hell, it was burning hot, still glistening in the shimmering oil of some unknown fat, and too hot to touch.  The sweet sauce to dip was amazing.  The other sauce to dip was a&#39;ight, but nowhere near as good as the sweet sauce.

Also, corn cheese?  What the heck is that?  Awesome is what it is, try it.  DO IT.  A burning hot cast iron pan with cheese and corn and cheese and more cheese.  Not saying it won&#39;t back you up like a cork in a wine bottle, but worth it at least once.

Here&#39;s the thing: I have no idea how to pronounce 90% of their menu.  I sound like an ass trying to, so I won&#39;t even try.  But the knife-cut noodle soup was awesome.  The tofu rice was awesome.  The &#34;insert random white dude trying to pronounce Asian words with no linguistic background&#34; was awesome.

Seriously, the food is dope, bomb, cowabunga, whatever 90s term you want to use, it rocks.  Have yet to try the BBQ, but I bet it is killer too.

They&#39;re open late.  Like midnight or 1am late.  On weekdays.  YEP.

Staff is polite and fast, but not overly friendly.  I don&#39;t care, they get the job done, and bring me mountains of crazy food I would never have considered in the past.

WIll be back.

PS - Bathrooms are shared throughout the strip mall, smell awful, look awful, and may be from the 7th level of bathroom hell.  Be warned."

I usually don&#39;t frequent this restauant since they serve mostly alcoholic drinks and food that goes with it.  However, my recent visit proved me wrong. 

They have full dinner menu,  pretty good banchan and plenty of seating to stay away from noisy side.  

try their awesome fried chickens that comes in two different sauces.  my favorites are also spicy  hibach dishes.

Their fried chicken in korean sauce (yang nyum chicken) is SO good. I crave it almost every other day haha. 

Their other dishes are pretty good too.. but I usually just come for the fried chicken and soju/beer. 

Their peach soju is apparently delicious. Must try next time! :)

We were seated at the bar area and immediately I tried ordering a dos esquis lager from which the server either it was a culmination of perhaps it was his first day or language barrier but he had no idea what I was referring to even though I repeatedly pointed at the drink list.  Anyways after getting situated we ordered some budae jjigae which was always delicious here, gizzards, Korean BBQ, cheesy corn, and some fried chicken that I kept raving about.  We kept repeatedly having to ask for rice and never got our drinks refilled.  When we asked for a ladle for the budae jjigae it seemed like they were annoyed like it was so much to ask for.  Hours went by and we didn&#39;t even get our order of fried chicken...to add salt to the wound, I couldn&#39;t leave a shitty tip because gratuity was already included so I suppose this would have to do.

I love how it comes out hot and fresh. You can&#39;t ask for more than that. The side dishes are really good too. I would suggest ordering Tofu soup or Seafood soup on cold days, it really hits the spot. The only reason I didn&#39;t go 5 stars is because of cleanliness. As a first timer.

Thumbs down for not giving any white meat (no wings? Wah~). I usually prefer white meat over dark meat, regardless of the preparation style (fried, grilled, stewed, etc). The batter is crispy and yummy and the sweet and spicy sauce for the other half isn&#39;t overly sweet with the right amount of tanginess. 

The spicy rice cakes () is yummy. A bit different in that it is a huge pan with ramen noodles, three boiled eggs, rice cakes, fish cakes, and dumplings. All the components were good except the dumplings. Thumbs down for the dumplings. These were not good dumplings. Thumbs down for not offering any other size except the huge $23 portion meant for 4+ people. It was just two of us so we had to order it knowing we are overpaying to have leftovers. Different size should be offered for the smaller tables. 

Overall, would return. Probably won&#39;t order the spicy rice cakes here again though. Just not practical to only offer a massive pan size for larger parties. 

Here on a Wednesday night, service is prompt and friendly and they checked on us often without being intrusive."

We ordered Galbraith and an order of half and half chicken. The gabli was good but it was a little fatty. The chicken was great if we could if eaten another order of them we would of gotten them. I also had Soju which was also good. The only bad part of this place is that if you are tall it a bit uncountable with your knees hitting the bottom part of the grill tables.

Most of the times I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve ordered a budaejjigae (camp stew) along with the yangnyum fried chicken which is definitely enough food to feed around 5 people. The chicken is admittedly cut strangely...with some pieces/chunks not really having much meat - just bone and batter. But who cares because it&#39;s SO GOOD and if you&#39;ve ever tried the Thai sweet chili sauce (Mae Ploy brand), it&#39;s a very similar flavor. The budaejjigae can be quite spicy, but the ramen, dumplings, rice cakes, and plenty of water refills balance out the spice :)

The side dishes are quite limited, but the cabbage salad and cubed pickled daikon are really good and pair really well with the chicken.

I&#39;ve also ordered the spicy seafood stew which is smaller than the budaejjigae, but really good. It has udon noodles and a variety of seafood which gives the broth a better depth of flavor. Their KBBQ which you grill yourself is also decent.

Service is hit or miss which might be a real bummer for some people. It can take a while to get your water refilled when it&#39;s busy and sometimes you need to go to the station in the back to get your check, but as a server, I understand that things can get hectic so I&#39;ve never complained.

Anyway, 4 stars because as much as I want it to, it doesn&#39;t quite match up to the caliber of Korean bar food in LA, but it&#39;s pretty close so I&#39;ll definitely keep coming back!"

We ordered a lot of it--probably too much. The fried chicken was a hit, and my husband was excited to have leftovers to take home.

Everyone in our large group ordered with the intention of sharing, and share we did! We still had far too much food left over. Portions are generous and meant to be shared, so order simply and know that you can always order more.

The cheesy spicy chicken was sort of like chicken parm with Korean spices. The seafood soup was a hit, but our group noted that you need to eat it quickly or the noodles become one large mass. The spicy chicken feet were...very saucy. None of us would order those again.

We did get one dish to cook at the table--bulgogi. It was just fine, not very excitng.

The pork belly and tofu dish was a little disappointing. The tofu was very plain, though the kimchi with it was really good.

Beers are generous in size. 

Service was painfully slow. It was hard to get someone to take our order and, later, to take our money to pay. Also, our group recommends that you avoid the rest rooms (which they share with the whole strip mall)."

Had our first waitress stuck with us, her complete indifference to helping us would have put a huge damper on the evening. She didn&#39;t even ask if we wanted anything to drink. 

For an app, we went for the shrimp dumplings and the shrimp tempura. Both were fantastic and the tempura batter was crispy and perfectly salty. 

Of course we had to order the fried chicken and ordered a full plate of each (regular and sweet chili). The table was split on which was the preferred; for me the winner was the plain. 

We also ordered the &#34;army stew&#34; which is a hot pot filled with rice cake, dumpling, noodles, hot dog, beef and onions. The menu says for two and maybe if you eat nothing else this could be handled by two. We had four adults and a kid and still took home loads of leftovers.

I went tonight and this restaurant close at 2am. I went at 12am and if it was with other waiter they would have let me wait for a little bit or clear two tables for me. I went with 9 people and he said he could assist me because they didn&#39;t have table available when i clearly saw two tables dirty and open for service. He didn&#39;t have the desire to assist us he completely close our options and said he couldn&#39;t do anything. 
I bet! Everything that with the last administration would have treated us with respect. I totally won&#39;t recommend this place.

I tried both the sweet one and the plain one and just dip it in the sauce they provide and it&#39;s a flavor explosion in your mouth. 

Also tried the rice cake with noodles and fish cake which is just super heartwarming and hits the spot. I also appreciated the miso soup that is given to everyone. The pickles that are given as a free side are to die for I think i probably ate the whole plate. They are a great palate cleanser and they complement the fried food so perfectly. 

The service is alright. The restaurant itself is a bit run down. The chair I sat on had a giant hole in it but otherwise everything seemed somewhat clean overall. I want to come back and try more yummy korean food!"

Opens at 4pm till late (can be variable). The bar has beers, sake, soju, and other alcohol... No idea why they decided to call their establishment Funny Plus.

it was very busy when we got there around 8pm. Full of Korean customers, so you know it is good. The waitstaff speak Korean and English very well so there is no lost in translation there. We had the Army Stew, Spiced Chicken with Cheese, and the Half Original Fried and Half Yangnyeom Chicken.

The Army Stew was great! Perfect level of spiciness, had Spam, hotdog, dumpling, rice cake, kimchi, and a block of ramen noodle. It is served in a big pot on top of a portable gas stove, so it stays hot and boiling while you eat it. Says it serves 2 people, but I think it can probably be good for at least 3. The Cheese Buldak, was good too, there was a nice layer of melty mozzarella cheese atop the spiced chicken chunks which were on top a bed of onions. The Korean Fried Chicken was amazing, it was a different kind of crispy, and I really enjoyed the Yangnyeom version of it... reminded me of fried chicken with sesame chicken sauce on it.

Highly recommend this place. It is great place to hang out with friends/family and experience the food. I felt like I was in a restaurant in South Korea due to the atmosphere, though I have no idea what it&#39;s really like in S. Korea. I would definitely return to Funny Plus.

I say no as she frantically finds us a normal table on the other side. Sit down and she comes back with water and menus. Waited 25 minutes to order. Ordered half/half fried chicken $14.99 and the tofu, pork and kimchi dish $19.99. We got a supposed banchan dish of shredded iceburg lettuce and thousand island dressing and little tiny squares of pickled white radish. Tofu dish came out first. Good but not worth $19.99 wow!! Our chicken came and highly dissapointed. With all the Yelp reviews of it being delicious and also being that I&#39;m Korean...it was def not yangnyum chicken. Yangnyum chicken usually consists of fermented red chili paste aka gochujang, honey or corn syrup, garlic, etc. It was a make-shift bbq, ketchup with nutmeg or cinnamon seasoning blend...not good at all and warm, not even hot. The original chicken was moist but crispy crunch like its been re-fried 2 to 3x as if it has been sitting out and greasy. Waited 30 minutes to even flag down 1 of 3 waitresses working to get the check. It was busy for a Monday night which Yelp has the place being Closed today. I do not blame the poor waitress who looked 15 yo with glasses because she was run ragged and she looked miserably worn out. It is now 810pm and finally got the check and a box for leftover chicken. Also dishes do not come with rice. That is an extra $1.50. Very dissapointing and well, we can say we tried it but won&#39;t be back because of the lack of customer service and over-pricing.

It is located to the right corner of the H Mart market, look for the Korean words with a plus sign after it. 

I was here with a group of 11 people to celebrate a friend&#39;s birthday. We tried calling ahead, but they didn&#39;t take reservations. Fortunately, we didn&#39;t have too much issue with getting seated. We ordered some pork belly, bulgogi, a noodle soup with vegetables and mussels, a spicy chicken dish, a giant pot with fish cakes, rice cakes and dumplings, and some fried chicken. 

I personally thought some of the dishes were a little too spicy, but my friends seemed to enjoy them without too much trouble. My favorite things of the night would have to be the meat (which you bbq yourself) as well as the fried chicken. Because some of the dishes are huge and good for sharing, we did family-style and the total came out to be about $20 per person. 

The only complaint I have is that the table space is really limited, especially when the waitress keeps bringing out our dishes. I felt like it was really crowded and stressful when the waitress expects us to clear the table for them when she bring out a new dish. Some of my friends also found the waitresses to be rude because they demanded us to help them take the plates off their hands because they were too hot. But I would definitely come back for some Korean style yummy fried chicken and Korean BBQ!"

We decided to try their mussel soup and there&#39;s no spicy symbol on the menu indicating this soup is spicy, it comes very spicy with jalapeños and red peppers.  My husband can&#39;t eat too spicy.  We told our waiter this and he tried to communicate this to the chef.  When our waiter returned with our soup, it was more spicy than before.  We were just going to eat the mussels and not drink the soup.  We told our waiter about this not expecting them to change it.  They apologized several times and comped us this entree without us asking.  It surprised me in how well they took care of us.

You can order half and half, where half of the chicken are sauced and the other half is plain but still well-seasoned.  Or you can do just spicy or just plain.  The spicy is not too spicy with sweet and spicy sauce covered on the outside of the chicken like Buffalo wings.  

We&#39;ve had the rice cake dishes, some mussels soup, and some other dishes but we always come back for the fried chicken.  There is always Korean shows playing on the TV and Korean music.

I loveee going here although it&#39;s on the pricier end but my friends and I always have a good time eating and drinking bottles of soju and pitchers of beer. 

Things you must inevitably try:

-Their fried chicken, you can get half and half (half with sauce, half without) but the sauce is a must!! If you don&#39;t like sauces, just get in on the side but seriously their chicken is fried to perfection. Perfectly crispy on the outside and nice and moist on the inside. 

-The stir fried squid in gochujang and veggies

-Budae jjigae. There&#39;s so much culture behind this dish! It&#39;s also known as Army Base Stew for it&#39;s importance after the Korean War. It was a dish people often ate after the war since food was scarce. The food that was available became the ingredients for this very popular dish, that includes, hot dogs, spam or ham with gochujang, kimchi, onion boiled in a pot with Tteok and or ramen. 

-The chicken gizzards are nice if you like that sort of thing. 

-Their Tteokbokki is also decent and a hugeeeeee portion so it&#39;s enough to feed two as is their Army Base soup. 

-My all time favorite dish other than the super delicious ones i&#39;ve listed above was something my friend introduced me to, Jaeyook Kimchi Bokum. It&#39;s pretty much marinated pork belly stir fried, with tofu on the side and stir fried kimchi with gochujang. They reallyyyyy nailed the stir fried kimchi here and it definitely makes the dish but you pretty much eat the three together in a bite and it&#39;s just so delicious. It doesn&#39;t stay on the table for long and sometimes with my friends we have to order two!"

THE BEST Fried Chicken in Colorado hands down!! Their fried chicken wings are also AMAZING!! I like to get the sauce (sweet and spicy) on the side because I love my chicken crispy. I am a pretty big fan of friend chicken and have had the opportunity to try it at some of the most popular or hometown favorites in many places around the US and this is NOT your typical FRIED CHICKEN. These guy have taken fried chicken to another level!  I&#39;ve also ordered the Cheese Corn that is that comes out on a hot plate with lots of corn and melted cheese. I&#39;ve had this at other places and there&#39;s is by far the best I&#39;ve had.  Soups and Kbbq are also fantastic.

Food prices are right where they should be for the portions you get.  

The staff is very friendly and on top of it.  

Their bar carries mid to upper end liquor, saki, along with beer at very reasonable prices. Bottle service is cheaper then any place I&#39;ve ever been to. 

It is I fun place to come hang for hours.  
The place is by no means a fancy restautant it is laid back and always a fun time to go with friends to drink, eat and have a good time. Choose to sit at a regular table, a table with built in BBQ grill or at the bar. 
(Great for FIRST DATES) 

 I would recommend this place to ANYONE that likes fried Chicken, AUTHENTIC Korean FOOD or just looking to have a good time. 

Not sure about when they open but I believe their kitchen usually stays open until 12 or 1am."

I have never felt so unwelcomed before in this restaurant till now. Before I came in alone sometimes with her. This is a Korean bar type of restaurant and I can understand a little bit here and there but she over heard the waiters and the customers talking about how they get upset or mad when they see Mexicans. I&#39;m not over reacting or anything it was clearly said Mexicans. Now obviously I felt offended because I am Mexican, I come and eat here with my family, friends,and girl friend  frequently and many other Korean restaurants in this area and it&#39;s sad to hear this kind of statement. I clean after my self I&#39;m polite I tip and I&#39;m not difficult but to be talked behind my back and to have a group of Koreans agree with that statement is sad. I don&#39;t mind racist remarks to my face or racist jokes because they are direct to me, but they have Mexican staff, Mexican customers. I don&#39;t see why they have to say that. I don&#39;t understand why a group of Koreans that I see frequently agrees. i won&#39;t name the waitress, waiter, and business owners name that made these statements but I will pass on this review to many other Mexicans friends and family friends because this is not the type of place I want to support."

They have a great selection of everything from the kbbq to soups and intestines if your heart desires. 

The prices are a bit on the high end, but you always get a pretty large portion meant to share family style. 

This place opens at 4pm and opens til late into the wee hours. Service is decent. Unlike your typical American restaurant, if you need anything you better make sure you waive the waiter down otherwise you&#39;ll be waiting for a while. They are always busy, but always friendly. 

The food is always on point. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been disappointed with anything I&#39;ve ordered thus far.  

If you&#39;ve never had Korean fried chicken, DO IT! Once you have this chicken you won&#39;t ever wanna have kfc ever again. 

Some of my favs:

Budae jigae (army stew) huge pot of ramen loaded with spam, sausage, hot dogs, rice cakes, etc to share with the fam. The broth is light yet flavorful  with just a teeny tiny kick. 

Pork belly with tofu and stir fried kimchi- three of my favs all in one bite. Tip** stack the meat on the bottom, tofu and then kimchi on top. You&#39;ll be able to pick it up better and stuff it in your mouth. Hahaha 

Cheese buldak- semi spicy chicken cooked in an earthenware bowl with yummy gooey cheese on top. This dish takes a bit to cook, but all worth the wait. The combo sounds a bit weird, but the taste is pretty out of this world. 

Baeksaeju- (ginseng infused corn wine) this is an alternative to soju. It&#39;s def high priced but if you&#39;re not a big fan of soju, this is sweeter and even after sitting for 15 mins at the table the taste is still as delicious."

The fried chicken here is hit or miss... some days it is amazing... and then some days it is just &#34;eh...&#34;. They must have it pre-fried cause there are times when it comes out within 5 minutes of ordering and it&#39;s just luke-warm inside.  There is NO WAY you can fry up a chicken that quick.  The spicy pork here is OK, the corn cheese here is OK, the fried calamari is nothing to rave over, the bbq is what you&#39;ll find anywhere else in denver (not good not bad)... the mediocre food would have still gotten them 3 stars on my book but the service definitely has gone down the last couple of times.  They are quick to greet you when you walk in but that&#39;s where the service usually stops.

I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve never had Korean friend chicken before here but have only heard amazing things. A true Korean fried chicken takes a lot of time to make, so when our food took 25+ minutes, I was getting more and more excited every minute I had to wait. I have to say it was the best fried chicken I&#39;ve ever had. The crispy thick texture was amazing and everything I was expecting..and more. The meat was incredibly juicy and tender.  I would give this experience five stars just off of the yang nyum alone, however, the sides (kimchi and other niblets) and service was average. I wish I could give 4.5 stars because the chicken really blew me away. Would love to come back to try the other dishes and hope to update my review and potentially give this place 5 stars in the future. By the way, the fried chicken is an amazing value of 10 pieces of huge chicken for $15. Will definitely be back."

As i walked in to do a to go order, i notice the place is quite busy (7pm) and is very much a reminder of many street restaurants in korea.  Staff is friendly and busy.  I looked over the menu and ordered the yang nyum chicken (korean style fried chicken) and the funny meal (bulgogi, fried white fish, and tonkatsu).  It was about a 20-25 minute wait, but they do cook to order.  
It was definitely worth the wait!  Its the closest i have found yet to my fave street dish in korea!!  Score!  The funny meal was also good but for $13 i couldve used a little more than a few strips of tonkastu...

For the price, they sure gives you a whole lotta chicken! We usually go with a group of friends so we&#39;ll order at least a plate or two. The chicken is moist on the inside, crispy on the outside, with great flavors (not too salty). Their soups are great too! We order their seafood soup a lot (comes with udon noodles). Be careful when order and make sure to specify the spicy level when you order the soups. FYI, their fried chicken wings are made similarly as their fried chicken, so if there&#39;s just the two of you and you can&#39;t finish a big plate of fried chicken, you can always order their wings appetizer to satisfy the fried chicken cravings. 

Try their Korean beer while you&#39;re there, it goes great with the fried chicken. 

Only thing we didn&#39;t quite like is the galbi. The taste just isn&#39;t all that great, but other than that, everything else we&#39;ve had, we&#39;ve liked it. I&#39;d say this is one of my favorite place to get fried chicken (and I&#39;ve tried a lot of fried chickens in Denver).

We ate some of the chicken and a maybe a few ribs.  The fried chicken is something we would order again but not the ribs.  Also 4 people could dine on just the chicken.  
Service was great and our Mojito was very good but expensive.  
I might go back now that I have had some advise on what to order next time.  Thanks Marc."

A plate piled high of fried chicken, what more can you ask for? The chicken was moist and packed full of flavor. We also had the beef short rib BBQ which was also superb. Great flavor and huge portions. We had a to go box full of goodies to take home with us. The BBQ dinners come with tons of sauces and sides. Everything is absolutely delicious.

It&#39;s a nice, small family-style restaurant. There are booths that are kind of reminiscent of restaurants in Korea, with dining areas set on upraised platforms, though you sit in chairs and not on the floor. There are also tables with built-in grills if you want to get your BBQ on.

We chose to share the champpong and the kalbi-style chicken.  Both were very good - the kalbi was flavorful and spicy, with perfectly cooked vegetables. I can only speak for the yumminess of the kalbi since I avoid most seafood dishes, but apparently the champpong is also good! I also hear the fried chicken and ddeokboggi are popular choices as well.

We were here for an early dinner, so did not get a chance to see it as a night place.  Apparently there is a bar next door (or connected??) that gets quite lively later on. Overall, it seems like a good place to share a family-style meal, though I think the prices are a bit expensive (most of the family-style portions are upwards of $15).  Also water service could be better.

Still, it was a decent place, and we had a pleasant dining experience."

It was overpriced for mediocre quality food.  The galbi pieces were low quality with an excessive amount of fat, two of the pieces were completely fat --no detectable meat!  Not only that, they charged an extra $3 for lettuce!  It came with the side dishes so we thought it was a free refill, so we got another refill...but didn&#39;t find out that it an extra $3 charge.  Furthermore, the number of side dishes were limited...there were no fish cakes or cucumbers, to name a few.  I was so disappointed when the dishes came out, and there were like 5....this falls short of any korean place.  The stew dish was salty.  The spicy chicken tasted like fake chicken.  Not only were the food a disappointment, the servers were terrible...they did not inform us that there are extra charges for certain refills, they did not smile.

I decided to search for a nearby restaurant that was open at the time. I didn&#39;t want to eat at a fast food chain, so I drove around the city. I saw an emitted open sign light coming from a dark parking lot behind H-mart and went to go check. I came across a Korean restaurant called Funny Plus that somehow managed to snugly fit itself between a few small stores. I&#39;m not really into Korean food but I was willing to try. When I walked in, a young lady wearing a reddish orange dress greeted me and gave me the menu. It had a variety of dishes, but what caught my eye was a picture of their Nang Nyum Fried Chicken. I went ahead and ordered it.
 As I eagerly waited for the fried chicken to arrive I began to gaze around. Red walls with dim yellow lights shined on my face.  I saw an interesting advertisement of a girl holding a beer on the wall right across from me. This place was very clean and tidy but it didn&#39;t really matter as long as I find the food good. Minutes later, side dishes came out: cooked beansprouts with a strong sesame flavor, kimchi, cubed horseradish. As I began tasting all the side dishes, I over hear a guy talking about his past relationship with a group of friends. That&#39;s when my night became more interesting. He talked about how his past relationship was a bust and how he wanted to kill himself many times, but seeing that&#39;s he&#39;s here, I guess he pulled through. Midway into their conversation, my eyes lit up as the aroma of the chicken filled my nostrils. It was beautifully glazed in a secret sauce and had sesame seeds plastered all over it. I couldn&#39;t wait to dig in. This wasn&#39;t just any ordinary night; it was a wonderful experience. Every bite of the fried chicken was magnificent. It was juicy, tender, and amazingly crispy. The first bite like experiencing rain in a desert, my taste buds were satisfied.  I found myself becoming a regular after this."

This is a Korean restaurant for those familiar with Korean food.  It is not for the novice, which I&#39;m not.  The prices were reasonable and the LA-style galbi (again, if you&#39;re familiar with Korean food, you&#39;d understand) was moist and not overly sweet, which seems to be the trend at a lot of Korean BBQ places.  Our family is definitely coming back to this place.

It&#39;s a Korean restaurant people not a five star restaurant where they have to stand by your table at all time. Their baby squid dish is amazing too!

Ridiculously long wait times to get in there one day had me back at the Outback. The price point is slightly higher (12 oz new york strip is about $22 vs about $19) and the quality is the same to slightly lower. Like their competitors they sometimes overcook my medium rare but unlike the competition when it&#39;s over cooked it&#39;s to around a medium so I don&#39;t really feel the need to ask for another. Outback seems to be proud of the various seasonings they throw on their steak, and it&#39;s OK, but I&#39;m pretty simple and prefer my steak done with some butter (that&#39;s the secret right there if you&#39;re grilling at home) and a bit of salt and pepper. The seasonings don&#39;t steer me away, I just think it&#39;s wasted on me and that might be part of where the slightly higher price tag comes from. What keeps bringing me back to the Outback though is that often there is no line to get in and my new personal favorite, online ordering with curb side to go. I&#39;ve found myself more than once stuck in traffic on 225 heading home from work when a steak craving hits. My wife can quickly order online or call ahead and by the time we get through traffic our steaks are ready for pickup without more than a couple of minutes added to the commute. Sure I could just grill up a steak at home but when I feel like I&#39;m going to be short on time Outback&#39;s online ordering is a fast and convenient option that sets them apart from the competition."

I asked why, my food should be ready by now. &#34; oh, just a minute while I bag it&#34;.  15 min later she brought my food out.  Again I asked why it took so long. All she would say is that she was busy.
When I got home and opened the bag, I found the order wasn&#39;t correct. 
I called, voiced my complaint to the manager. The manager apologized, and offered to take $20 off of my $107 bill. To do this , she voided one transaction and added a new one.
The only problem is that 4 days later my money hasn&#39;t been refunded yet, and I&#39;m left with 2 charges after terrible service. So I called again. Spoke to a different manager, and all he would do is say &#34;sorry, there is nothing I can do&#34;

It took us 45 minutes to get seated, we were served our Shrimp and Lobster appetizer was lacking flavor, and served without SILVERWARE AND NAPKINS come on....the steak, lobster and baked potato all had FAIR flavor not great flavor. 

I remember when your food at this place was fantastic and you left wanting more. That is not the case any longer. The food looked thrown hastily on the plate, part of food service is presentation. I remember when the food that came to your table actually looked like the food on the commercials...not any longer. I now understand why so many are closing in this area. With the competition out there if you don&#39;t get it together asap Outback will be a thing of the past."

After giving up on the wait for another nearby steakhouse, the girlfriend and I decided to try the Aurora Outback Steakhouse (normally we go to the Centennial location).  We should have stayed at the other steakhouse.

We ordered a couple of steaks, potatoes, soup, salad, and a sangria.  To start, her sangria was surprisingly light on alcohol.  Although we both ordered our steaks well done (let&#39;s just say we don&#39;t handle undercooked meat very well!), only my steak came out cooked to order.  Hers ended up medium well.  Her baked potato and my mashed potatoes were very good though.

I realized when we were almost finished with the meal that we had never received our soup and salad.  I assume it was because she was flirting with the guys at the table behind us.  When we notified the server, here response was &#34;Oh, I thought another person had already delivered them to your table.  Well, I could grab my manager and see if we can comp something if you want.&#34;  Customer Service 101: Don&#39;t put the burden of making it right on the customer.  Take charge of the situation and make it right.  We eventually just settled on two soups to go instead of having the soup and salad at the end of the meal.

In short, the food was decent but the service definitely needs some improvement.  It is pretty unlikely we will be back to that location."

I REALLY wanted a steak (the large porterhouse to be exact) and to my disappointment it wasn&#39;t available during lunchtime. I decided to go with the unlimited soup and salad and I must say I was impressed. The clam chowder was damn good and the salad was.... a salad. I had about four servings of clam chowder and was as full as a tick by the time I left!

The food is pretty much always the same at these chain restaurant so no complaints on the Food. The Service is what gives this outback 4 Stars. Andrea went above and beyond for us. We always split a steak and we got 16oz prime rib seasoned and seared, Cesar salad , baked potato and crab legs.

Andrea was on top of our drinks making sure we had refills (and of the right drink-- once she wasn&#39;t sure the grenadine wasn&#39;t in my drink and had me check and make sure) She took the extra effort to split our salad into to plates , totally sweet and not necessary we were fine splitting the way we generally do. She had the kitchen make us 2 8oz Prime Ribs so we each had our own steak ( I generally prefer the 16oz because of the thickness and I usually only take a few bites anyways) but the extra effort she put to make the meal special was really nice.

THe kitchen messed up on the baked potato it had no sour cream or butter so she brought out the sour cream and butter and I told her I really prefer a new one with it already on there; because that&#39;s what makes it good (for me anyways) where the butter is melting in the potato.. Yumm and she brought 2! that was so nice of her."

I looked up the local one on the website and noticed the curbside had an order online feature.  I have heard mixed reviews on any place with an order online feature.  I decided what the heck; I will give it a shot.  

I signed up and signed in and got to ordering.  It&#39;s not terrible, you just have to remember to &#34;add to order&#34; to get to the next step.  The next step could be as simple as what do you want on your potato.  It was a bit confusing at first because it gives a place for special instructions at each step.  I finally figured it out and completed my order.   Lets you even pick date and time you want to be there to pick up, which was great because I was ordering while we still had a customer in the office.  

I decided to try their new Wood Grilled steaks instead of the traditional overly salty seasoned seared, baked potato loaded and salad with no tomatoes.  

Arrived a bit before my order was to be completed and someone immediately came out with my diet coke in hand to greet me.  This was nice, and unexpected.  She advised that it was not complete yet as I was a little early, but it would be shortly.  She wasn&#39;t kidding; my steak dinner was delivered to my car at exactly 4:45 as I ordered it.  

I got home and started to unpack my dinner, the bread was still even warm.  Steak and potato were still hot and both cooked and packed correctly.  They even got my salad right!! Not a tomato to be found at all.  

I am now a fan of the wood grilled and will never go back to their other preparation.  I like that I can taste the actual steak and not just salt.  Very happy with my dinner and will use this method again as it worked well for me."

The Outback Special steak was sufficiently bloody and tender. just as I like it. Had the blue cheese wedge salad as well, was a  Lovely combination of blue cheese and balsamic vinegar.

First off, when we decided to go here for dinner our daughter had said the last time we ate at Outback she got a stomach ache. However, because neither my husband or I had had a problem we went ahead anyway.
We were sat and our server was at our table quickly.  We ordered ice tea with no lemon. He did not return for what seemed like a very long time. When he did, our drinks had lemon. We immediately removed them and our server didn&#39;t seem to care. I know that seems petty but I was in the industry for a long time and I am just not down with fruit that had been touched by multiple people in my drinks. 
Once we got our food it was just eh. My husband and daughter each had burgers that looked like the patties had been sitting under a heat lamp. Not juicy or fresh looking at all. My daughter&#39;s friend ordered a filet with mashed potatoes.  We noticed that she had only eaten a couple of bites of the steak and she showed us it was because it was almost all fat. 
I ordered tilapia topped with crab meat stuffing and mushrooms. After getting to the actual fish the middle was under cooked.
When our server came back to clear some plates I asked for the check. Without even questioning why our plates still had more than half the meals on them he collected them and my credit card.  It even took him too long to bring the check back.
Finally when we got home, my daughter immediately went for the bathroom.  Shortly after, my husband. They both complained about not feelimg well and I have had a stomach ache since we got home. The only one not in distress is our daughter&#39;s friend because she didnt really eat anything. 
I doubt that we&#39;ll be returning to this Outback anytime soon."

I was in the area for a managers conference, and we decided to check out a restaurant name that we were familiar with. Our server seemed very new and nervous; he never told us his name, otherwise I would definitely be suggesting that he is not fit for a serving position. He was very forgetful, and it caused many delays in our meals: such as, not bringing silverware, or napkins, and bringing out the wrong entrees. Very careless and unapologetic. We had the manager, or proprietor woman, come by and ask if everything was okay because she had noticed we hadn&#39;t touched our food. We told her that the service was despicable, and that we were just ready to leave. One of the ladies dining with us was served completely black chicken tenders...was that not noticed before they left the kitchen? How did the server not see an issue with serving food that is clearly unappealing looking? During our conversation with the manager/proprietor she commented, &#34;If I comped everyone&#39;s food that complained, we would make no money&#34; and just laughed it off. Absolutely horrendous for a manager to make a comment like that- especially to a table of all managers, we were astonished by her lack of empathy. She didn&#39;t offer us anything to ever want to come back; this was the worst hospitable experience I&#39;ve ever experienced. I hope this Outback takes a good look at what they&#39;re doing wrong and how they come off to their paying customers."

I&#39;ve always had consistently good experiences with the food. It&#39;s a great place to get a steak also. Their salads are some of my favorite, I love the balsamic vinaigrette dressing here.

He never did get us any silverware, nor did he show any surprise that we were no longer sitting waiting because we had none.  But then, we did have to ask him twice if we could order.  For $96.00 tab, he could have at least pretended to be interested .  Once arrived, the food was average at best and had obviously spent significant time under a heat lamp.  I&#39;m not sure why they think the tag team approach to serving a table is better., but when one has to ask each subsequent server for the same thing (silverware) one is left believing that the diner is NOT their first priority.

We have been here many times in the past and it was a fine experience. Not this time! We walked in and the &#34;mood&#34; was as if someone had just died, you could feel it in the air. I requested a large booth so we could spread ourselves out. Not busy and had many open tables. The host said something that none of us could make out as we were seated. Odd. We looked for a happy hour menu and wasn&#39;t able to find one. When our waitress came we ask about happy hour. She said it was there, where there? Am I expected to hunt down a list?  She said it&#39;s from 3 to 7 pm. Ok....what does it include? list? anything? She had no idea. We ordered drinks anyway. We decided to have the special 3 course meals. We ordered, very clearly stating what each of us wanted. 3 Salads (I say I know the wedge is a $1 add on but I&#39;ll take it anyway when she asked about it) and one soup to start, 2 steaks and 2 pork chops, 2 carrot cakes and 2 cheesecakes. Easy stuff. As we waited for our drinks (still) we noticed the customers had caught the vibe. No one seems to talk or enjoying themselves. One couple got and left with hardly any food touched. Another had her head on the table as if sleeping. Drinks came! Then soup and salads. Mine was wrong, it was a chopped salad which she said I ordered. Hubby&#39;s was wrong and she put ranch dressing on it which he hates! It pissed her off that we immediately said take them back and do it right. That&#39;s when we noticed no spoon for the soup! I seen her so I said excuse me just loud enough to make sure she heard me, not rude but louder than normal. Asked for a spoon for the soup and I kid you not, this is what she said. &#34;I&#39;ll get one and the manager will be over here to speak to you!&#34; Ok. Odd again. She was really bitchy. As my friend is eating his salad he noticed a long black hair under the lettuce stuck to the bowl! Enough. We will pay for our drinks and just go! Bad vibes big time now! We seen a man walk by with a different color shirt, stopped him, asked if he was the manager, he said yes. We explained all so far and just want to leave. He seemed stressed out and we commented on that also. All the staff was angry! He said he was there to make it right but he was a little rude also. He said if we give the restaurant a chance to make it right would we stay? We agreed since we were hungry. He took the hair salad back and brought another one, when I said were are our other salads! Still no salads! I also told him the bread and butter they give tasted like it had cleanser in it! It burned our lips and tongues, just a bitter fowl taste, but he didn&#39;t care. He brought our corrected salads out. Then our meals. Which were ok but not special. We asked why our waitress needed the manager over for a spoon but he couldn&#39;t answer. We hadn&#39;t seen her for quite awhile. About half way through the meal she came by checking on us. We waited a long time for dessert because no one had ordered them again for us with the kitchen. We asked for to go boxes and I was given one but the manager took my friend&#39;s plate back to the kitchen to box. Odd. When he came back it was a whole new meal, packaged up nice and neat! Cool for my friend but really what about mine I had to do myself? Not fair since we sat at the same table. The manager brought the check and gave a talk on how he hopes we come again, blah, blah. I sat there shaking my head NO. We open the billed and it had been comped. Zero owed. Cool but NO! I wanted a nice evening out with friends not this joke. It took almost 2 hours for dinner! Great now I still have that gift card, who&#39;s birthday is coming up that I don&#39;t care much for....."

My husband, who normally rolls his eyes at my Yelp reviews, was like &#34;I hope you&#39;re going to Yelp about this!&#34;

From the minute we were seated we felt like our waiter was really, really pissed off at us.  We started racking our brains to find out what the problem was.  Was it the fact that our Outback giftcard was sitting on the table and he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d get a tip?  Was it because we asked to sit in a booth instead of at a table on the aisle?  The restaurant was relatively empty and my husband&#39;s leg is presently out of commission (as though his limp weren&#39;t obvious), so we didn&#39;t think it would be a big deal to switch.

Our waiter rarely made eye contact with us and came by only to drop more drinks off saying, &#34;I&#39;ll get more cokes.&#34;  I&#39;m not expecting 5-star treatment, but friendliness helps.  The bloomin&#39; onion alone took forever to come out of the kitchen and although that&#39;s not his fault, he made absolutely no mention of it while we sipped our cokes in near silence.  After the onion, the entrees themselves took forever to come out.  He managed to say, &#34;they should be right out,&#34; and we were like, &#34;thanks!&#34;  When they finally came, he placed them in front of us and walked away.  My food was plated pretty horrendously with the rice tossed onto the plate, the shrimp scrambled around in the threadbare rice, and my steak had apparently slid all over the place because there was juice all over the sides of the plate.  Not to mention the sour cream from the potato smeared along the sides of the plate as well.  Again, this is the kitchen&#39;s fault, but we were like, what the hell??  Who lets food go out looking like this??

My husband&#39;s medium steak was cooked unevenly with the inside so rare that it was still bleeding.  He shoved it aside and pronounced, &#34;I&#39;m not sending it back because clearly they&#39;re pissed at us.&#34;  Considering we made no special requests besides the booth, and no special orders besides the way we wanted our steaks cooked (medium and well done), I&#39;m still clueless.

It really seemed like everyone in the restaurant from the server to the kitchen had given up.  If you&#39;re going to take that long with the food, at least wipe the side of the plate off.

I think the last straw for me was when I left my debit card with our giftcard so I could actually give him an okay tip.  He came back and said the giftcard more than covered it and thanked us.  I sat there stunned.  Really?  You don&#39;t want a tip over $3.00 on an almost $50 meal??  Our theme became &#34;whatever&#34; and I quickly signed the receipt and helped my husband hobble out of there.  Really, Outback...you&#39;ve just given up, haven&#39;t you?"

But their new wood fired menu lures me like a young slamon to a flailing june bug. Its good, oh so goooooooooood. And their baked potatoes with their salted skins. And the prompt well trained help. DAMN YOU OUTBACK ~ DAMN YOU FOR BEING SO FRIKKIN GOOD. 

After I&#39;ve eaten here, I do the bloated walk of shame back to my car, like that time in 1992 when, in a drunken stupor of gargantuan proportions,  I nailed the 43 year old horse trainer woman who had more wrinkles than Shelly Long after a three hour bath  and smelled llike Velveeta and Glade Country Melon, only mustier and with a hint of urine.

Order anything else, they are likely to fuck something up. I&#39;ve been to several Outbacks in Colorado, and this one is no exception to my rule that they all pretty much suck. 

Of the five orders at my table, two were messed up due to an incompetent waitress so that&#39;s what, 40% accuracy? From the perfectly formed steaks to the seemingly smaller portions than I remember from many years ago my best advice is... SAVE YOUR MONEY.

It was 9:30 PM when I walked through the door of the Outback. I was greeted by three host/hostesses who brought me to a table in the bar area. There was still a late dinner crowd at a dozen or so tables and almost all the stools at the bar were occupied. On the TV, the Rockies were hosting the Giants.

I took a moment to review the menu and when the waitress arrived, I was ready with my drink order and dinner order. She seemed surprised I was ready. She brought the bread loaf and my drinks, following a few minutes later with the salad and before I was halfway done with the salad, my steak. It seemed a little rushed. I didn&#39;t tolerate any that and took my time with the meal.

The salad was their blue cheese wedge. It was a good sized slice of lettuce topped with a reasonable amount of blue cheese and bacon, plus halved grape tomatoes and onions. Different, but good.

When my steak arrived, it was (like Heather&#39;s review) well cooked on the outside, but still red on the inside. I had ordered medium rare and maybe this was a little closer to rare but I didn&#39;t mind. The 6 ounce size perfectly hit the spot. I also had the steamed veggies; I was pleased with how crisp and crunchy they were. Not just squash and broccoli, there were carrots and peas in there too. Nicely done!

I opted to skip dessert, which disappointed the waitress. After I paid my check, I sat and watched the end of the game - the Rockies lost.

Would I return? I&#39;m not usually a chain restaurant eater, but this Outback seemed to stick with their formula and wasn&#39;t obtrusive with their Aussie-ness. Yes, I would be back."

It was good.  Nothing super, but nothing terrible.  I am sure it would have been better to eat it the steak there while it was hot off the grill.  While waiting I had a Fosters (when in Rome, er the outback) and I swear I have always thought Outback has the best cold drafts anywhere.  I usually like beer in the bottle better as drafts tend to be flat and not as cold as I like.  Every Outback I have been to really has cold draft beer!!!

So all-in-all it was good.  I like the restaurant for a chain but just don&#39;t go all that often and I don&#39;t really know why."

All I heard last night were NO!!!! Anyways I had that chicken parmesan, it was very dry no real flavors to it, I could of cooked a dish like that way way better. My partner had sirloin with lobster tail best part of that dish was the lobster tail. The steak had no flavor and was somewhat bitter. I use to love outback and now it just seems that they are focus more on the way it looks then the flavor of their dishes. Worst experience ever. And if we didn&#39;t say anything to the manager was because I rather for people to know than just get my good discounted and call it even."

It was later so pretty slow inside but when I went to the hostess to put our name in he seemed pretty frazzled and overwhelmed which was weird because it was slow and there were many open tables (only 2 people in the waiting area).  We eventually got seated but had slow service.  We determined that the wait staff weren&#39;t to blame, but that they were way under-staffed.  The food took a while but luckily it came out delicious.  Needless to say, when it was all said and done, we determined we wouldn&#39;t go back."

Our first time visiting this location - or any in Denver - we called ahead since it was already after 7pm by the time we hit the road. 

Surprised to find the restaurant full, but with no apparent wait, we were seated (two of us to an 8-top booth) within 5 minutes. I was shocked to find that they&#39;ve stopped leaving menus on the table - interesting, not that I ever minded either way. Our server seemed a little weeded, but at least recognized us before he finished with the table he was at, then promptly turned around to take our order. 

I was worried we&#39;d be waiting a while, but he was soon on his way with our water, and then the bottle of wine we&#39;d ordered. Our cheese fries followed within a few minutes, and my salad arrived just after we&#39;d finished the fries. Finally, my husband&#39;s filet, though a bit charred on the outside, was cooked perfectly for our taste. My tilapia topped with lump crab meat was also quite yummy, although I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the mushrooms and would up picking most of them off. 

Overall, we had a great experience. The only reason I&#39;m not giving this location 5 stars is because we didn&#39;t walk out thinking &#34;Wow, that was awesome&#34;, which DOES happen on occasion :) Otherwise, we had a great dinner with good service and will probably visit again."

But this place has some awesome burgers for a decent price.  For about $10, you get a grande burger (thin seasoned hamburger patty) and fries.  I forgot the name of my burger but it was huge and was filled with an assortment of deliciousness.  Cheese, ham, and I believe a bacon wrapped hot dog.  Yes, a BACON WRAPPED HOT DOG!  Let that sink in for a bit.  And yes, it was pure blissful awesomeness!

Come give it a chance... you won&#39;t be disappointed....... I&#39;m still thinking about that bacon wrapped hot dog on top of the burger."

There was no shortage of suggestions, but the one peeked my curiousity the most was for Hamburguesas Don Jesus.  I wish you could have heard the needle scratch in my head when I put two and two together that this was a Mexican burger joint.  Yes, please on every level.  

When we pulled in, the smells got me first and I knew that I was not going to regret my decision.  I bounced all over the menu, trying to decide between all of the unique offereings.  I landed on the straight up &#39;Don Jesus&#39;, which was a burger with ham, cheese, lettuce, ketchup, avocado, mayo, tomato, onion, mustard, and jalapeno.  It sounds weird, I know, but it was the perfection.  The burger patty was thin, but not in a bad way, and the burger itself was massive.  It was served along some perfectly season, hot fries.  I wish I could say that I ate every bite, but I can say that I gave it my best effort.  Did I mention that it was massive?

If you are in Denver and looking for something off of the beaten path or just a damn good burger, make your way to Hamburguesas Don Jesus.  It&#39;s legit."

It&#39;s a dive in an obscure place that you wouldn&#39;t normal find or give the time of day to.  That is of course unless you are a Yelper that reads reviews to get a sense of what a place is all about.

You can form your own opinions.  I am going to stop just shy of 5 star because I simply have to try it again.  There are many combinations of burgers to try but I have dialed in on a couple of combos that interest me.  We first tried the Texana burger which is the cheeseburger with a bacon wrapped hot dog and avocado.  Fresh, made to order fast, and seasoned well.  I almost have to recommend you enjoy your burger there.  There is so much going on that I think it cools the burger down pretty quick.  Also, I tend to be a bit of a purist with burgers.  The add ons like chilis and hot dogs are awesome, but ketchup and mayonnaise on top of those flavors takes away from it a bit.  3 burgers with fries for $27 bucks....can&#39;t beat that.  On my visit, the fries were a little underdone but that may just be a matter of preference.  I like a little more crunch but still enjoyed them.

Next visit, I intend on trying one of the burgers with Anaheim chili which I understand they roast themselves.   Overall great first impression and we will definitely be back.  Give them a try and find your favorite!"

I am a huge fan of burgers and after trying a majority of the burger places in and around Denver, I would have to say that these burgers are straight from Jesus! Prepare yourself to have a religious experience when you stuff these tasty burgers in your face. You don&#39;t go here to have a standard burger with beef and cheese. You go here to eat unique burgers. Ones with sour cream, Bologna, and green chilies. 

Do your self a favor and order out of your comfort zone. You won&#39;t be disappointed. The burgers taste so fresh you could swear there is a farm right next door. And for the price your belly will be full and wallet will be happy. These burgers are some of the best in Denver! Straight from the hands of Jesus. Hallelujah!"

They have a number of hamburgers you can choose from on their wall as you walk in. I went with the cheeseburger, which was really good and I loved their fries, too!

The interior had a diner vibe to it. I didn&#39;t know what to expect and it was a little bit intimidating from the outside but I found several families having dinner around me watching some Mexican soap opera. There is also a patio for nicer days. The staff was really nice but everything is made to order so expect a bit of a wait for your burger.

I am so skeptic of chains, gone are the days of true corner delis and butchers. So, I walked in here, thinking, here we go again, another sandwich in the trash. WOW, was I wrong. First off, the place was immaculate, which is hard to find in this part of town. So, I decided to go for it. As a pastrami and corned beef lover, I went for the Big and Bold New Yorker.

Must say, the rye bread was great, meats tender and lean ( hate fatty, chewy meats), over all best darn sandwich I&#39;ve had in Denver, beats any pub I&#39;ve been to. 

I got it to go, they are thinkers, they put the awesome pickle under the sandwich wrap to prevent sogginess. Ingenious!  This truly tasted like a boutique deli place, regardless of all the national locations. The dining area was very comfortable, clean, and bright.

Could only eat half of this monster, can&#39;t wait for dinner or breakfast.

I&#39;ll be back!

We just moved to the neighborhood, and I decided to treat myself to lunch and try something in our new neighborhood. I went in at lunch hour, and I should&#39;ve gotten the hint when there were only two people in the restaurant. I ordered the half-and-half; half a salad and half a sandwich combination; Cesar salad and half a grilled veggie sandwich. I got it to go so I could eat at home. When I got home I found that the lettuce in the Caesar salad was slimy and rotted. The whole salad looked as if it had come out of a lawnmower bag. Totally inedible! The sandwich, was on half a baguette and had one small strip of red pepper, one small strip of onion, and one what I think was a mushroom. There was no cheese, the bread was cold... need I go on?

I called the restaurant and asked for the manager. He got on the phone and I explained the situation to him and asked if I could come in to get a refund as the entire lunch was not edible. His response and I quote, was that he will not give me a refund. He told me if I do not like their food then I should not come back to the restaurant. I was shocked! I actually asked him if he was joking! He repeated that I should not return if I did not like the food. I was appalled! I posted this review on my Facebook page as well. I myself, I am a chef and a foodie so people take my food recommendations pretty seriously. I am friends with over 400 people who will never set foot in this restaurant."

I ordered the soup, which was chicken and dumpling and I ordered it in a bread bowl. The soup was very dense and not soupy at all. The ratio of dumplings to soup to chicken was very off- mostly all dumplings. The bread bowl was very dry and it wasn&#39;t toasted (I would probably have enjoyed it a little bit more if it was) and there was no butter offered (which also would have made the bread taste a bit better).

I tried to be super kind and polite to the young lady at the register to try and get some kind of personable response from her and wasn&#39;t able to. They were out of stock on most cup sizes for drinks so she probably was sick of explaining all the stores downfalls to customers. My 4 year old got the choice of a kids drink in a huge big gulp size or a coffee cup, so she drank fruit punch from a coffee cup.When we got our food the carrot cake was dry, my hot beef and cheese sandwich was somewhere between Luke warm, cold and warm depending on which bite I got. Probably not very food-safe... The veggie chili was pretty good and so was my four year olds macaroni and cheese. They do have a great selection for kids meals. The outside seating area was a mess with food from previous  diners left there and not picked up the whole time we were there.

It was bland and overcooked. Their cheesecake was amazingly creamy good. And the wraps are also a great choice. This is definitely a healthier choice over any other &#34;fast food&#34; joint.

I saw this place the other day and opted to give it a try for Friday lunch.  Thanks to Brady K. I knew exactly what to expect, a Panera wanna be.  I haven&#39;t been to a Schlotzsky&#39;s yet so I can&#39;t talk to that.  I walked in and was looking up at their sizable menu staring back at me.

On this particular day I was looking for a salad, although their sandwich options look delectable.  The Savannah Chopped Salad called to me and I just had to get it.  Grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Gorgonzola cheese, honey roasted almonds, tomatoes, cucumbers served with a sherry shallot dressing.  Pair this salad with a large sweet tea (what their known for) and this is a well rounded lunch.

I must have loved the salad because I inhaled it once I got back to the office.  The honey roasted almonds added a great crunch to the salad and the sherry shallot vinaigrette was the perfect accompaniment making this a very refreshing salad.  The sweet tea is like drinking a pound of sugar through a straw, not an every day drink but one of those splurge items every once and a while.  

McAlisters will definitely be on the lunch excursion list in Aurora."

Love of sandwiches? Let me start with this...4-CHEESE-GRILLER.  4 cheeses.  Four! Provolone (best cheese ever!), Swiss (no comment), American (C&#39;mon, we&#39;re in America!), and Parmesan (Makes everything better) on Ciabatta (soft, thick, moist, perfect sandwich) bread!"

The Service and Price are up to par with any other delis in the area.  However, the food is subpar. The sandwich is half the size of Jason&#39;s Deli, and there is no &#39;ump!&#39; about it.

When I mention the bread they ask me to pay for the bread because the cashier charge me a bowl of soup not a soup on a bread bowl.  I get it but when I order 3 items and all 3 have an issue I think you can go with out charging me the extra $1.23 for the bread. The ice tea was good. The location was clean, restrooms as well, staff was not the best. I still prefer the Denver location. The food could be a little cheaper but I guess that is not in their control.

I tried them when they first opened and it was a terrible experience. Today I tried them again and yet again it was awful. There was a long line of customers to place their orders. The woman placing an order was getting a really big order. The person taking the order doesn&#39;t tell anyone she needs help. The manager comes out to deliver food to a table, walks by the lineof customers and then goes back into the kitchen and ignores the line of customers waiting. I then asked the tea bar employee if she could ring people up instead of standing their watching us wait. When I got to the counter I asked to talk to the manager and all she says is she&#39;s sorry she didn&#39;t mean to upset me. Obviously she doesn&#39;t care to actually fix the problem.

Dinner-Lots to choose from-salads, soups/chilis, sandwiches, and any combo there of. 2 things annoy me about their menu- No list of soups, and no lists of sides. So you have to ask what the soups are today and what sides they carry. Which could change up your whole plan if you hear they have a great soup or side. Good food, great portions. I recommend you get lunch or dinner from here. 

I had super spud which at first I thought was a genetic experiment gone wrong. This potato was HUGE. like small toddler huge. Then I realized it was 2 potatoes put together. Tasty toppings on the potato. 

Breakfast-Don&#39;t do it its not worth it. Super small portions, kinda pricey. They only have 8 things to order-french toast, fruit, potatoes, eggs, bacon/sausage, and a few other things. I felt like I could have stayed home and made breakfast myself. 

They are still working out the kinks here and once they get all their ordering system down, and all their staff fully trained its gonna be a rocking place that I will go get my gigantic potato baby from on the regular."

On a cold day I want hot soup in a warm bread bowl. Today, I had the broccoli cheese soup. I opted for it in a regular bowl. The soup was still lukewarm.

Now that Mccalisters is near by, I find a comfort with this brand.  Maybe I need something that sounds a little unhealthy to eat.  If you feel the same, then Mcalisters is the place for you.  They have a niche where they have some good deli sandwiches and some pretty decent soup and salads.  Nothing out of this world, but very reliable fast casual restaurant.  My personal favorite is the sweet tea.  Strange how hard this is to find in Denver, but they have a good one.  Also the grilled cheese is amazing.  If your in the mood for something sweet, they have a very nice dessert section too.  Service is very nice and responsive.  Not sure if there are many around, but it fits the bill for me."

However, I have to throw a mini-wrench in the gears when it comes to portions; I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese ($15.00) with the house-made egg spaghetti and, when the server brought the plate, my eyes bugged out of my head. Did I order from the children&#39;s menu? I must have, because the potion on my plate looked like it would barely satisfy an 11-year old. Absolutely brutal, but very tasty, as was the bread they provided at the beginning of the meal. 

Earlier we almost went to an Italian restaurant down the way with inflated prices, but took a chance with Stella and was surprised to see such a modestly-priced menu - well, there&#39;s a reason for that, and it&#39;s a small, small one. 

However, overall I am giving it four stars because it was quality. If the spaghetti was not made in house I may have complained about the portion because, friends, this was not a dinner portion - this would barely count as lunch. I would even suggest they change the name on the menu to &#34;Stella Presents: A Fistful of Spaghetti.&#34;

My advice is to definitely check it out but don&#39;t come hungry - you&#39;ll only leave wanting more, which, as an East Coast native, is a cardinal sin at an Italian restaurant."

WOW. This meal was not only the best meal I had the whole trip, but maybe even the best Italian meal I&#39;ve had in a long time. And that&#39;s saying a lot, considering I grew up and lived in an Italian neighborhood in NYC for 30 years. 
From the bison meatballs and the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer (omg) to the asparagus and fresh pasta to the deserts (dont even get me started on the bread pudding) it was amazing from front to back.

I would give this place less stars (just for the parking situation) but i&#39;m not! Not to mention I had to walk two blocks in 20 degree weather to get there...but onto the food:

Truffle fondue appetizer: ehhh kind of wish I opted for the pork belly app instead. This was good..But barely tasted any truffle oil and thought the green apple pairing with the fondue was a little off. It was too savory and garlicky to pair with any fresh fruit. Even at that the fondue was pretty tasty but maybe a french bread and more truffle would help.

32nd street pasta: AMAAAAZING. The shrimp was plentiful and juicy! Cooked perfectly. I hate when seafood pasta has the shrimp/scallops overcooked and can barely absorb the flavor from the sauce. The lemon olive oil sauce was soooo delicious and spicy! The overall presentation of this dish was impressive. 

Loved their desert menu-I want to come back to try that pumpkin bread pudding..mmm. Tiramisu was great and very creamy. 

I loved the interior of this restaurant. It was very homely and relaxing. Great chic date-night spot for sure. The servers were inviting and very attentive without being overbearing.

I brought back my husband a spaghetti and meatballs which was bison and the sauce was bland and the meatballs were really dry and kind of tough. I will say their desserts are great! I had the tiramisu and it was so good!!!! I might come back if I&#39;m feeling a patio, wine and dessert day."

We called at 6:30 and asked for a 7:00 seating on a beautiful Saturday night.  We arrived on time and were seated immediately at an awesome four-top on the 2nd level of the patio.  Amazing!

Pro Tip #2- The very 1st time you see your wait person, say &#34;Bread please.&#34;  As others have said, for some weird reason they don&#39;t bring it automatically.  

There must be tens of thousands of Italian restaurants across the country and this one stands out for quality and value.  What a pleasure it is to have a fine Italian meal without taking out a second mortgage,

Our party of four began with the daily special bruschetta.  As you can see from my picture it was unique and delicious and the focaccia was warm.  The toppings were not evenly distributed which was a bit annoying if you are sharing.

Note that the wine list is small but gets the job done.  I was sipping on a very pleasant Malbec.  

I passed on a salad as I knew my entrée was going to be heavy and filling.  What entrée was that you ask?  Stella Crack!  It&#39;s otherwise known as Creamy Sausage Rigate and goes for $12.95.  The sausage is very spicy so be prepared.  The rigate was not overcooked and the overall dish knocked my socks off.  It&#39;s a heavy dish so if you are going for it make sure you are hungry.  The other members of my party were also very pleased with their choices.

Our waiter for the evening was OK.  He was personable but not as attentive as we would have liked. 

This was a solid four star experience for me.  I especially enjoyed the outside patio."

We were actually planning on going to Chipotle up the street for dinner, but had a hard time finding parking. After a few trips around the block, we found a parking spot that happened to be in front of Trattoria Stella. The food smelled great, and it looked like a nice place for dinner so we decided to give it a try. 

The restaurant is intimate, with an &#34;indoor&#34; and &#34;outdoor&#34; section. This moreso just refers to the covered patio portion. We split one of the entrees and had the bruscheta that was on special that evening, then topped it off with vanilla cheesecake. 

As some of the other yelpers mentioned, you need to request bread, it&#39;s not brought out automatically (originally I thought maybe our server just forgot). We also had to follow up and ask for butter as well.

The food was pretty good. I was hoping they had an eggplant entree, or more vegetarian options, but the server told us they only have eggplant as a specialty sometimes. 

There were no real complaints.. Our server was very friendly and I liked my dinner. I would like to try this place again."

There can be a wait on weekends, but there is a great little bar next door (Prost) to get a drink and the hostess will call when the table is ready. Points for giving guests 5-10 mins to get there and finish up their drinks. Will definitely go back!"

This is meant to be constructive and really don&#39;t want to be hypercritical..( maybe I am.)

Overall a  good/mixed experience. 

 I like the casual feel and the patio. Very nice waitress. I&#39;m sort of addicted to the pasta arrabiatta and it had a bit more kick tonight than I recall in the past.. Good by me! Pasta was perfect. The portion size was fine.
 
Have concerns though that I&#39;ll have to consider ,though, before I return (and,as an arrabitta addict must). 
   
Should have said something at the time , I know that, but... a few things lop off a star, maybe 1 1/2

Most revolved around the mussel app. Had my heart set on mussels for some reason and so ignored that, as an app, they were more , at 15 $ , than my 13 $ entrée. This was a first for me. 

Mussels in broth demand bread. Had to ask for it and it was quickly provided but this is a dish where you absolutely shouldn&#39;t have to ask. Also, let&#39;s just say , these PEI mussels should have spent a LOT more time on their oceanic farm vines.... The broth flavor was delicious but wildly over-salted ( I see others have noted this ....anyone paying attention?)    Made me long for the now gone Le Central where ,at lunch , could get better at about 1/3 the cost with crusty  bread and frittes to boot.

Price ? My dining companions seared salmon dish was delicious. Mild, perfectly cooked fish with a great glazed crust. But 22 $ ?  This was ~6 oz of salmon.

 Ordered a glass of red wine for my friend before she arrived arrived . She enjoyed the wine but blinked at the scant pour. Maybe 4 oz, for 9 $. Maybe I&#39;m living in the past but 7-8$ sounds as reasonable as you might expect. She then got a half-bottle (to me rather laughable in size but a whole different issue ! ) rather than another glass or two at that price.

We got a big meal for two I suppose. An app ,two entrees, 3 beers ,a glass and a half bottle of wine and a shared dessert (an OK bread pudding) but 60$ apiece before taxes/tip...

Will go back but will drink water. 

Am I expecting too much? Curious to hear what others have to add.

PS--my friend had a bit of wine left over and couldn&#39;t find the bottle cap. The waitress found her a spare cork tout suite. She was a gem !"

We&#39;ve been wanting to try this place for quite a while now. I was expecting limited seating for a February, as half their summer seating is an open porch, but they have enclosed the porch and have added overhead heating - very tosty, nice.

Our waitress was attentive and brought us focaccia bread right away. I&#39;ve had better bread, but the oil and vinegar on the table helped it out. The tomato vodka pasta, with Italian sausage was spicy, but very good. The lazagna with Alfredo sauce was way too salty. It was the sauce. I&#39;m sure this must have been an error in the kitchen. However, the lazagna and tomato bisque was delicious."

They give you a very generous serving of the most delicious cheese ever served with fruit and warm bread. When your plate runs out of bread they will bring you more so you can mop up every last morsel of the ooey gooey cheese.

This place is a perfect date location. The 2 tops out on the patio are adorable and what is more romantic than Italian food and wine?? The homey setting makes the place feel really cozy and intimate.

As for the food, I was blown away. The prices were very reasonable and the specials all looked so good. I had a ravioli with a honey sage sauce and it was so unique and delicious.

On top of the food, the service is always fantastic and welcoming, and the ambiance is both cozy and upscale. Prices are also completely reasonable and portions are a great size. We keep trying new places around Denver and almost every time the consensus is &#34;we should have just gone to Stella.&#34;

UPDATE: Service and food at Stella is still top notch, but was very disappointed to see that prices have risen across the board and our beloved Stella is now too expensive for a casual drop in and is now more in the date night range. Portions got smaller too. Very bummed and will return, but not in any rush."

They don&#39;t take reservations but they do allow call-ahead to get on the wait list....but on a Friday at 5pm, you don&#39;t really need it.

I was very pleased with our experience. Our server was attentive and friendly enough. They serve some fabulous foccaccia bread with olive oil and balsamic before your meal...and as soon as the basket was empty, it was replaced with a full one (love when that happens!).

Most of their entrees sounded so good, it was hard to choose...but I landed on the Spaghetti Arrabiata - spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce, cooked with applewood smoked bacon, chipotle peppers, olive oil and garlic and finished with crispy pancetta. It was absolutely perfection! Nice portions. Nothing obscene (which I actually appreciate) but certainly filling. I chose not to add an additional protein, but I imagine if you have a large appetite adding some sausage or chicken might be the way to go. 

It seems that their desserts rotate but we shared a slice of Bailey&#39;s-topped chocolate cake. It was divine. Another sweet that caught my eye was the chile chocolate pot de creme. Next time, if they have it, I&#39;ll be trying that!"

We&#39;ve been several times and the service is great, the wine selection is (relatively) cheap and good, and the food is out of this world. Definitely get the fondue appetizer. 

For entrees, I&#39;ve tried a few different things but the Shrimp pesto gnocchi has to be the pick. The gnocchis are cooked slightly crispy and the pesto is unreal. Even if you aren&#39;t into seafood, I&#39;d recommend picking around the shrimp. So, so good."

We opted to sit inside next to a window. It was quieter and next to the kitchen so we could smell all the amazing smells!

For dinner I chose the truffle asparagus pasta. It was good but could have used a bit more salt and sauce. The pasta is homemade and quite tasty. I ate the whole plate without hesitation.

I had the lasagna special. It was not your traditional lasagna; it had a lot more texture and complexity to it. 

The truffle asparagus spaghetti was good but not great. The truffle was a bit overwhelming and the spaghetti a bit dry. But this is me searching for flaws, it was still a very tasty dish.

Stella&#39;s left me stoopid with food bliss. Can&#39;t believe I doubted it&#39;s deliciousness for even a second.

The lady and I were visiting from SoCal and were told to come to Stella&#39;s since we were staying in the Highlands area. We arrived around 1pm and were seated immediately. Upon looking at the menu, I got all Negative Natalie about the display of words in front of me. Yelp had some people say the portions were small and the items seemed to be more than I&#39;d like to pay for what seemed like &#39;simple dishes&#39;.

The lady saw my dismay and said - &#39;Just order something. You don&#39;t like it, we&#39;ll go across the street for something else.&#39; I honed my eyes in to start reading what I was blankly staring at. &#39;Black Tiger Shrimp... Spinach spaghetti....&#39; Dang.. this 32nd Street Pasta actually looks pretty good. She decides to order something simple and basic - Fresh Tomato &amp; Basil Spaghetti

15-20 minutes pass and the food arrives. Still doubting and unimpressed, I take a good fork full sample of all the items. Spaghetti, piece of shrimp, cranberries, pecan, and goat cheese - check. Deposit into mouth - check.

HOOOOO LEEEEE KAO!

My eyes light up and I&#39;m pretty sure a tear began forming. The lady asked what&#39;s up. More like - what happened? What&#39;s wrong? 

My reply? This tastes incredible.

Balance of flavor, freshness of ingredients, richness of sauces, the like. Beautiful harmony of all things delicious and precious. It was great. Likely one of the top 3 pasta dishes I&#39;ve ever had in my life. This was just amazing stuff.

My wife essentially said the same of her dish, saying how the tomatoes were amazing, the olive oil was super delicious, and everything just sang like angels&#39; choruses in her mouth and tummy.

We were both thoroughly please and satisfied with our meals. We couldn&#39;t stop talking about it. So yes - delicious. We loved it. 

The servers were kind and pretty attentive to our table. Since we walked there, parking was not an issue, but I can see where it is potentially problematic. Another plus is that this is across the street from the Sweet Cow, so an amazing meal can be followed up by some amazing ice cream! SCORE!"

We ran into some friends there and decided to combine to make a party of 4. 

The reason for the lack of one star is for the wait, we were standing on the stairs which was very awkward for patrons coming and going from the restaurant. This place is so small it took about an hour to be seated, I could understand this for a large party but for 4 people? Even though the staff was well aware of us standing there for a very long time, no one came around to reassure us that a party was leaving soon, or it wouldn&#39;t be much longer..etc, etc. The host/busser was very apologetic and thanked us for waiting, but I was honestly starving by the time we were seated.

The food was FANTASTIC! I ordered the spaghetti with the apple wood bacon in it, amazing! My date had the vodka cream pasta. They were both incredible. The bread filled us up quite a bit so we took leftovers home. 

The service was very good, our server was a young brunette, I think her name was Jordan. Waters were constantly refilled, we were constantly checked on, etc.

We ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and they were the best I&#39;ve ever had. Amazing. Good accompanying sauce too.

For the entree I ordered the 32nd st pasta and it was also amazing. Delicious spinach pasta with goat cheese, dried cherries, pecans, and shrimp. I could eat that every single day. My stepmom got the same entree but with the zucchini pasta and it was also great. I am looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other dishes!"

I had the 32nd St Paste- unique flavors of goat cheese, cranberries, nuts, and tiger shrimp. I would definitely order the dish again. My husband has the Spaghetti Arrabiata and his was good too. Smokey and spicy. If you get dessert, have the Kahlua Bread Pudding - OMG. Most things are made in house. Our server Sarah was wonderful as well We were there around 6:30 on a Friday night and only had to wait a few minutes, but the restaurant started to fill up as we were there."

Hidden in plain sight on 32nd, I walked by it once, while looking for it, but missed the giant &#34;Stella&#34; at the top of the house.  And when I say house, I mean it.  The restaurant is an old home, converted into quaint modern dining  I walked in and immediately wanted to yell &#34;Honey, I&#39;m home!&#34;.  That&#39;s the kindof vibe you get upon entering: old wooden stairs leading to a landing with a few frames hung on the walls.  

Cut to the left immediately, and you will see a glass display in the foreground, filled with Sweet potato casserole and other deserts that I eyed for a quick second.  Behind the glass display and stretching the length of the back wall of the home (about 20 feet) is an open kitchen, which has a flurry of activity going on with chefs working hurridly, but comfortably.  The rest of the home/restaurant is warm, welcoming, low-lit.   

As I scanned the restaurant, looking for my wife, the brick on the back walls leaps out at me.  It is mixed brick of dark cherry and red sandstone, rough and crumbly looking, reminding me of my recent brick exposure in my own home (which, if you own an old home in Denver is worth investigating if you have one of those walls~ it did wonderss for my place), 

Finding her and the second half of our party I go to join them at the table towards the front of the restaurant.  During a day with more sunshine, I imagine this would be a quaint, little porch, as  it was fully windowed, so sun would stream in.  As it&#39;s the middle of winter, we didn&#39;t get that luxury, and had to do with low-lighting.  It wasn&#39;t too dark though ( I wasn&#39;t straining to see anyone or look at my food).

Scanning the menu, it has several Italian classics like Risotto in Vodka Sauce or Spaghetti with Bolognesse, and then had a &#34;Chef&#39;s Specials&#34; selection, which I ordered off..... Fall Ravioli.  This dish was king.  Pumpkin and gorgonzola stuffed raviolli, topped with dried cranberries, candied walnuts, and Pancetta (which is like bacon, only covered in crust).  I had 4 raviolli, each about the size of my palm, all topped with that and some sweet glaze.  I can not begin to describe the flavors going on inside my mouth.  All I can say is that the sweet and salty were a perfect combinaton.

Everyone else had amazing looking dishes as well: Pasta with vodka, flank steak   bacon-topped bruschetta.   The food was incredible.  

Dessert topped off the night, and I will just leave it at this: Chocolate chip, kahlua-soaked, bread pudding!!!"

The server never told us his name, never asked if it was our first time, never asked how we were doing. I was a server for almost a decade and these are small things to expect. The ONLY time he talked to us was to ask our drink and food order. To which he quickly walked away with no input or suggestions. He also never came back to check on the food..which was just ok. I would avoid this place at all cost."

After hemming and hawing over what to order since I&#39;m avoiding runny eggs these days (pregnancy is such a joy), I settled on the French Toast Sandwich - which was advertised as two pieces of french toast stuffed with melted cheese and hard-fried eggs.  My friend ordered one of the specials, which was a Breakfast Panzanella Salad.  After a good 15 minutes, our food finally came out...

Holy moly, the French Toast Sandwich was almost comically enormous!  Everything was stacked so it was SO TALL - and everyone else in the restaurant by that point stared as it was delivered to our table, complete with a smirk on the waitress&#39;s face!  I unstacked the &#34;sandwich&#34; and found two extremely runny eggs, so we flagged down the waitress and let her know that the eggs did not come out as advertised.  I figured she&#39;d just have the kitchen replace the eggs, but they actually re-made the entire dish - which took another 15 minutes at least.  My friend, in the meantime, picked at her breakfast but didn&#39;t want to be rude and eat it while I had nothing.

By the time the remade dish came out, it was at least 10:45a... so obviously I was really hungry... but it was SO GOOD, I didn&#39;t really care.  I could still only eat half!  I highly recommend this dish.  My friend seemed to like her breakfast as well - I tried one of the pieces of bread in her dish and it was super tasty.  I think they were also lucky that we had a lot to talk about, so we didn&#39;t completely mind the more leisurely timing (to put it nicely).  The waitress was also really apologetic.  If they had offered a discount (or anything) to make up for it, I would have given my experience 5 stars.  But again, the food was so good and I still wouldn&#39;t hesitate going back (I&#39;ll just be super clear up front about those eggs, regardless of what the menu says!), so I can&#39;t give it less than 4.

I used to live in the Highlands and never made it here... now I actually live closer to the other location, so I&#39;ll be sure to check that out soon since I&#39;ve heard such lovely things about the pastas!  So far though, this is a winner for brunch in my book!"

I would give it two stars solely based on food but the atmosphere bumps it up to three stars for me. I had the broccoli pesto spaghetti... first off it looked just like stir fry (skinny, wavy noodles- NOT traditional spaghetti noodles). The flavor was extremely bland, I ended up adding tons of salt which I never do at a restaurant. Thirdly it was soaked in olive oil, drenched. Lastly, the asparagus in this dish were so undercooked it was inedible, I literally had to pick each piece out because I couldn&#39;t even bite through them. We also had the tomato vodka cream pasta which was very bland as well. Probably won&#39;t be back."

shrimp pesto gnocchi was... mhmaZzzZzZzing.. ;D the gnocchi was so soft. sauce was full of flavor. 32nd street pasta was superb as well! both pastas had tiger shrimp which was cooked to perfection -- buttery, smooth and soft.

if you love creamy white sauce pastas, the gnocchi will not disappoint.

food coma ensued so i zZZZzz afterwards... ( :

3 stars for my second time
- pesto gnocchi was disappointing. gnocchi was overcooked and fried to oily crispness. sauce was less flavorful and creamy. it tasted much different from the soft gnocchi i had the first time. 

however, LOVE the service here. they happily remade my order. tasted good but not on par to the first time.

YELPERS! my tip to you:
order the TOMATO BASIL BISQUE SOUP. it&#39;s so YUMMY. i thought it was just going to be a typical tomato soup, but it was so creamy and flavorful. will definitely be ordering this again.

4 stars overall because 
-i love the service here
-reasonably priced &amp; great portions
-tasty pasta and tomato basil soup :)

minus star for:
- consistency

p.s. (personally) wish the bread was warmed up. it&#39;s brought out cold but still tasty"

If you&#39;re expecting traditional Italian food, though, I wouldn&#39;t say you&#39;ll find it here--although there are so many options! Instead, many of the menu items are quirky and unusual but I mean that in a good way! You&#39;ll find yourself craving their dishes and you always have to go back because no one else has a lot of their more unique items anywhere else. I like the 32nd street pasta the best.

first of all, it&#39;s a very small space, which you may interpret as cozy and intimate.. or as cramped and slightly annoying- especially if it&#39;s a chilly weekend evening, and standing outside to wait for your table is not an option. literally you are standing there (for nearly an hour- no joke- and yes, i called ahead), awkwardly squeezed in with others in the tiny entry way, waiting.. the hostess handed me the drink list- i ordered a glass of wine in hopes of easing the pain- it never arrived.

anyway, once seated, our waitress was super sweet and fairly attentive (not to mention a dead ringer for an actress on &#34;OITNB&#34;- irrelevant, i know, but secretly amusing).. i ordered that glass of wine again. they were out. so i went with the next option on the list.

i ordered the &#34;truffle asparagus spaghetti.&#34; it was good- but not mind-blowing. and i could have used another third of a serving to feel complete. my friends at the table complained that their plates lacked flavor and kept reaching for the salt.

i don&#39;t know. i liked this restaurant, i did.. but just didn&#39;t love it. no massive complaints, but it didn&#39;t overly &#34;wow&#34; me. we went elsewhere for dessert. and i hate to bring it up, but when there&#39;s flies in the bathroom, i always get a little freaked out."

This is a good restaurant, They have friendly staff, the food is really well prepared with different twists on classic dishes, presentation is also very good. 

I am not apposed to going back, though I wont on my own. Several reasons, the main one is that I left still hungry, the portion size is rather small for an &#34;Italian&#34; joint. There was not the traditional basket of bread or something to snack on while waiting for your food. dinner salad does not come with your meal, so I ordered one. Like I said about, great flavor, nice presentation, just very small.

Now the sizes are probably what we should be eating, but I don&#39;t want a restaurant deciding that for me, I like having a lunch left over for the next day as well. that will not happen here."

I&#39;ve always walked past this place and seen it very crowded, and now I know why. All four at the table got something that looked great and I even enjoyed my wife&#39;s vegetable sandwich... and that type of thing is a very tough sell for me since I&#39;m about as far from a vegetarian as they come.

We&#39;re both strict vegetarians and when we walked in, we noticed &#39;Vegetarian Lasagna&#39; was one of the specials for the night. She loves lasagna and the fact that they went out of their way to label it as vegetarian had her sold. 

After waiting at the front door for 40 minutes (even though we called 15 minutes ahead which was supposed to assure us of getting a table shortly after arriving), we were seated.

After all of us placed our orders, I asked for some bread since in the past they&#39;ve always brought some out upon being seated. A few minutes later a basket of hard stale bread comes out. After waiting for a while longer, our food finally comes out. We dig in and my fiancé&#39;s face goes blank, when she thinks she found some chicken in the &#39;Vegetarian Lasagna&#39;. Her brother tries a bite and assures us there&#39;s chicken in there. We get the waitress and she takes it away, neither confirming nor denying there&#39;s meat in the lasagna. 

A few minutes later she comes out apologizing, saying it was labeled completely wrong. At this point my fiancé has lost her appetite but she gets some basic pasta and has a few bites. The waitress offered to remove the lasagna from the bill (...thanks?) but at this point her birthday dinner was a bust. I&#39;m curious how many other people that night thought they were eating &#34;vegetarian&#34; lasagna?!

We understand that mistakes happen, but it&#39;s all in how you handle it and this was a pretty major one. They should have given us a bottle of wine on the house or something to make up for it, since eating meat when you&#39;re a strict vegetarian is a pretty big buzzkill."

What I love: the ambience and the waitstaff.  Super friendly and funny staff that always greets you with a smile, even when the small space is packed and they are running around to keep everyone&#39;s wine glass full!  Perfect for smaller group dinners - I would stick to 4 - and date nights.

Food and ambiance was good and fun. We decided to take other friends a couple weeks later telling them the nice time we had had previously.  Anticipation was high, but we were let down. Our waitress was inattentive and seemed to be wishing she were somewhere else. I ordered  spaghetti bolognese. When my plate arrived, I discovered a plate with a small mound of noodles with a light sprinkling of meat pieces interspersed here and there, not easily found. No sauce, none! When we were able to (finally) attract the attention of our waitress, I requested &#34;a little more sauce please?&#34;.  She said &#34;oh, sure&#34;. Then went back to the wait stand and proceeded to wrap flatware and napkins for 10 minutes before picking up a (small) ramekin and scooping sauce into it and bringing it to me. Dinner now cold, I said thank you and we finished our meals and asked for our check. Did I mention I was charged for extra sauce?  Gimme a break! Really? Unfortunately that did it.

The kitchen smell/oder wafts over the restaurant and we left completely stinking of fried food. Don&#39;t ask me why there is such a fried smell in an Italian restaurant...

The place is also extremely loud with no acoustic panels, it&#39;s impossible to hold a decent conversation.

The food was mediocre at best and something was &#34;off&#34; in the salad special so I didn&#39;t eat mine but my friend did and told me she went home and got extremely ill from her dinner. #foodpoisioning

I&#39;m only giving Stella 2 stars because our waitress was nice and the location is great. But if you want to eat tasty food or enjoy a conversation with someone I would look elsewhere."

Chick with the glasses sucks and needs to be fired. Another waitress offered desert to another table while our server said register was closed and couldn&#39;t ring it up. She clearly wanted to go home and doesn&#39;t have the businesses best interest in mind from one business owner to another. It was extremely unprofessional.

We order these as an appetizer whenever we visit and I love them more each time.  I could probably just order this for myself as a meal and would be completely satisfied.  I have been here a few times and always order the pumpkin ravioli.  It is one of the few restaurants I know of that serves it year round.   It is also excellent.

We wanted to grab a bite at Uncle, but it was super packed and had to find a place for our special night out ASAP. I called Stella&#39;s and they had a table so we rushed right over!

For last minute decision, this was some really great food. We had an awesome waiter that explained everything thoroughly and presented their specials in a quick, well spoken way, so much so that we jumped right on the bruschetta specials that night. 

We had the zucchini fries and the bruschetta to start. Parmesan encrusted zucchini with the aioli was amazing, fresh, great idea. The bruschetta looked underwhelming, but it was very fresh and light, perfect for a summer&#39;s night. 

I had the flank steak fettuccine. It was great, tender steak mixed in with portabello mushrooms, spinach and a wonderful cream sauce. It was perfectly lush and tasty. The meat and the cream sauce really made it. My partner got the 32nd street pasta, I tried it, and although it was great, I felt that flank steak fettuccine knocked it out of the park! Would recommend to my friends!"

The place looked cozy, with its outdoor seating and festive lights, so we decided to go back that night for dinner.

We started with a grilled vegetable salad, that we split. It was delicious - perfectly grilled veggies over a bed of spinach, served with a mustard balsamic. They even split it for us without us asking for that. Very nice.

For entrees, we ordered the Beef Tips over fettuccine and the Wild Boar ragu pasta dish. 

The beef tip platter was quite tasty, a perfect combination of beef, porcini mushrooms, carmelized onions, cherry tomatoes, herbs and egg noodles.

On the other hand, the Wild Boar dish, the most expensive item on the menu btw, came to the table cold. Not lukewarm. Cold. Not sure if that&#39;s an indication that nuking dishes is part of the preparation, or if basically sat too long in the kitchen waiting to be picked up and taken to the table. Which leads to the next point, which was our waiter service.

If he had bothered to stop by the table to check on how everything was, we would have told him, and perhaps the problem could have been remedied. Not to mention, we could have ordered a second glass of wine. But from the moment the waiter took our order for our entrees, until he came by with the check, we did not see him once. How is the food? More wine? Not even a &#34;how was it?&#34; once he brought the check. 

We&#39;re willing to go back and try this place again. But not with the same waiter."

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t make it over that often anymore and this weekend&#39;s brunch convinced me that I should amend that.

First of all, they were incredibly accomodating with our group of six plus a baby, especially since I called frantically a half hour before during prime brunch hour.  And by squeeze, I mean squeeze.  This place is in a house and it&#39;s tiny.

Everyone in our group seemed to really dig what they were eating.  I had a fried green tomato benedict with spinach and squash and chipotle hollandaise and it pretty much ruled.  The boyfriend had a creamed corn benedict on corn muffins with mushrooms and it also ruled.  They also have really tasty, heavily seasoned potatoes and entree prices aren&#39;t outrageous given the quality of the food (about $8-$10).

I recall dinner being delicious as well.  My favorite dish was mustard brie pasta with broccoli and portabella mushrooms as a teenager.  I&#39;m not certain but they may still be able to make this if you ask really nicely.  As mentioned, it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve had dinner here, but I need to amend that.

Most importantly though, save room for dessert.  I usually don&#39;t, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s why to go containers were invented.  Notably, they have awesome bread pudding (flavors rotate) with a caramelly buttter sauce.  If you get it to go, they&#39;ll dish the sauce up separately so it can be melted and drizzled later.  They also have some other stuff (tiramisu and whatnot) but the bread pudding wins my heart everytime.

A true Highland Square gem!"

- Bad service - slow, inattentive.
- Undercooked pasta. I like al dente, not crunchy.

Waited awkwardly in the door while people came in after us were seated. We could see the table we were to be seated at, yet were made to wait.
Ordered 4 different menu items. Had to change TWO of them because the kitchen had run out of ingredients and ONE was completely forgotten.
Our entire, experience took the time of two lunches, or one 5-course meal even though we ordered basic sandwiches right off the menu.
Saw people come in after us be seated, order, pay their check and leave in the time we were waiting for our food to come. 

I really loved this place and had zero problems with it until lunch today. It was like a comedy of errors. We were  a group of 4, and were greeted by a guy dressed in a plaid shirt and a baseball cap to seat us. OK, not the typical style for this place, but I didn&#39;t think anything of it. 

It was very busy for a lunch on Monday, so he told us to wait while a table was cleared for us. And we waited. And waited. A single patron came in for lunch for one, and she was immediately seated, and we still waited for a table. We could see the table he was going to seat us at, but it seemed like he was doing everything else on his to-do list first before seating us as we all stood awkwardly in the doorway. 

Finally seated, the waitress came by with waters and menus. Then we didn&#39;t see her for a long time. The baseball cap guy came by to tell us about todays specials, but instead of reading the board 5 feet from our table, he took the board off the hook on the wall, carried it to us and proceeded to misread all the menu items on it. Unorthodox approach, but we were still just happy to be seated and on our way to eating.

Waitress finally comes by to take our order, and we are all chomping at the bit since we are so hungry. We order three different sandwiches off the menu and the special sandwich of the day. Our waitress comes back after 10 minutes and is apologetic, but says that the kitchen has run out of salmon, could we please choose a different sandwich. OK...we are at lunch at 12:30, and they&#39;re already out of a key ingredient in one of their menu staples? Whatever, I quickly chose my second option and she scampers off. We really only care about getting food as quickly as possible. 

5 minutes later, she comes back with another menu, and THIS time they are out of Italian sausage. Another menu staple they are mysteriously out of in mid-lunch time. Ummmm, OKAY. So my fiance ordered the same sandwich as me. At this point, we have 3 of the same sandwich, and one sandwich special.

Another 10 minutes, the people next to us receive their food and promptly send it back because it is too cold. A table in sight is seated with 4 people. We are anxiously awaiting our food. Finally, 3 chicken bacon and brie sandwiches appear. We are positive that the fourth meal will be arriving shortly. And we wait, and wait and wait. Finally, after ANOTHER 10 minutes we are able to track down the baseball cap guy, who at this point seems bewildered to be working in a restaurant. Instead of taking care of it, the waitress is sent over, and she apologizes profusely. In another 5 minutes, a sandwich appears. In the meantime, the people I saw seated had ordered, gotten drinks, and were served their food. 

At this point, we are all fed up with our experience. The not having key menu ingredients, the forgetting our order completely, the awful service, and bewildered baseball cap guy. At this point, you would think the staff would be bending over backwards to ensure we were happy since they made themselves look absolutely silly from the moment we walked in the door with mishap after mishap. But instead, we were ignored for another 10 minutes until finally the waitress came around to clear our plates. We promptly asked for a check, and were told we were going to be comped the sandwich she forgot. But again, we were left waiting to even receive the check. By this time, the restaurant was not even busy, and the people I saw seated while we waited for our food had already paid their tab and left. 

We decided we will NOT be back to Stella for a VERY long time."

Street parking isn&#39;t too bad and at around 11am on a Sunday there were open tables inside AND on the patio! Score! Sitting on the patio was really nice because it is all covered so you don&#39;t get burned. It has a very European/San Francisco vibe to it: with a tiny inside space &amp; bigger outside space with a bistro feel (not very fancy). They also had 3 for $10 mimosas!

As far as their brunch menu is concerned, I was really impressed. My brother &amp; I are gluten free and easily half to two thirds of the menu items were orderable. Their breakfast choices are really sophisticated and more meaty. They had salmon, steak, duck, shrimp, and pork choices which was awesome. My whole party was so impressed that we thought it was the best breakfast place we&#39;ve been to in a while (we are Snooze &amp; Jelly regulars) and will definitely come back since there are multiple things we each want to try, especially since none of us shared our dishes with each other, they were that good!

This place is truly a hidden breakfast gem! So hopefully it won&#39;t get discovered and develop a huge line like all the other good breakfast places....  

Bummer side note: Happy Cakes cupcakes is closed on Sundays so no GF cupcakes for dessert after :("

During my first visit, with my wife and another couple, I did what I am apt to do: asked the server to surprise me. Typically, this involves a bit of reluctance and questions like &#34;what do you like&#34;, or &#34;are you allergic to anything&#34; or &#34;how about this&#34;, but at Stella our server just said &#34;really? OK!&#34;. 

About 20 minutes later, my food came out accompanied by the chef, Joe, who pleasantly described what he had concocted just for me: a spicy seafood pasta in a light cream sauce - and it was AMAZING! One of my favorite meals I&#39;ve ever had in Denver. 

But wait, there&#39;s more.... they only charged me $13 for it. Double awesome. 

My wife and friends each also enjoyed their meals immensely and we could not wait to return. Not a group that typically orders desert, we were so impressed we had to have some. We ended up with a selection of deserts but what I remember best is the chili chocolate mousse. Definitely a stand out. Be warned though: Stella does run out of their most popular desserts and often something you spot on the chalkboard when you come in to the restaurant is gone by the time you are ready for dessert. A true testament to their popularity and freshness. No endless freezer of desserts here. 

At the time, my wife and I were looking for property and hadn&#39;t really considered the highlands. While at dinner we were so impressed by Stella, my wife opened up Redfin and took a look for what existed. A month or so later, we had put an offer on a place a few blocks away. 

Needless to say, we have been back many times. For dinner, for brunch, for lunch - we always come away impressed."

I don&#39;t know what kind of cheeses, but they were yummy. Then it was time for a new cocktail and I opted for a gin cocktail, because if anyone can make a life changing gin cocktail, it&#39;s the talented folks at W&amp;G.

Ok, there&#39;s a bar across the street that the three of us can wait at. I get the call about 20 min later that our table is ready. I come in to find out they only seat majority of the parties. 
I&#39;m escorted downstairs to a dimly lit setting with tables, bar, and community table in the middle. First round comes out in acceptable time. 
Stood for another 15 min until we were directed to a table. Second round was an Irish coffee, a staple and simple request. The flavors were exceptional but highly disappointed in the presentation. It was served in the same glasses that water is being poured into. Hot coffee drinks should be in a handled glass at least. 
Third drink was the &#34;Grapeful Dead&#34; very overpowering basil flavor and not enough structure. 
Service is a 3.7 for lack of bussing empty glasses. In this small of an establishment I expect to wait very little as there are less tables to attend to."

Yet I wish the music inside would be jazz or at least something of the more sophisticated, prohibition era type. It&#39;s your basic mix of pop rock and Indy, played on a moderately high volume. Therefore I couldn&#39;t call it a speakeasy. 
 As for the drinks, I highly recommended the &#34;treat yo self&#34; fall 2016 cocktail. It smells like nutmeg and pumpkin spice, but it&#39;s actually peanut butter powder, egg whites, amoretto, lemon and some other ingredients.

Like many kid&#39;s my age, I have a thing for the whole speakeasy concept, it&#39;s cool and nostalgic, right? Those of you grumbling &#34;damn millennial&#34; under your breath, don&#39;t judge me. I like these types of bars for more than just the ambiance, speakeasy joints are supposed to have personalized service, and high quality drinks. 

Williams and Graham at least had 1/3 of those ideals. Like other reviewers have said you walk into the building and there is someone at a front desk and a wall with a  bookshelf that opens into the bar.

This concept got me as being cheesy and clearly a set up for the bar entrance. Other speakeasy&#39;s I have been to were more subtle in their hiding of the bar. Like it was actually a surprise when you found it. Bars in California where they have a regular bar and then a hidden bar in the back behind a stack of kegs....I&#39;m not there for the speakeasy I just happens to find it or I am there and I just know the password (way cooler with exclusivity). 

We got in and there was standing room only behind this bookshelf thing, it was an awkward placement, a weird place to stand. I would rearrange the interior and make it less cutoff- standing there I felt like my business was unwanted and they were very regimented about which side of the bookshelf and etc. Just weird. If you don&#39;t have seats, fine let ppl wait. Or have a bar that has more standing room. After about 25 minutes they did move us to the bar, but at that point I was over it. 

The drinks were good don&#39;t get me wrong, but they didn&#39;t come across as being &#39;personally crafted&#39;. When I sit down at a bar and I&#39;m paying $15+ for a drink I expect my bartender to talk to me like a friend. You need to be friendly and at least be good at acting like you give a damn about the customer. The bartenders were so busy talking to each other that they barely acknowledged when my drink was empty (strike 2). I was curious if they could make something peppery and spicy, but with a kick of ginger (craft bartenders should be able to right?) Wrong.....I got something with grape in it..basically a drink that was already on the menu. If I wanted that, I would have ordered it? I wanted to see your creativity and give you a chance as a professional to highlight your skill. 

Over-all I don&#39;t think I will be returning. Great concept, but poor execution. If they could step up the staff&#39;s game and maybe the ambiance, I would consider a second visit. However, for now I&#39;ll stick to other local haunts."

Wow that place was fun.  Just the speakeasy atmosphere makes it worth a look.  Drinks were off the charts.  The service was great.  Our experience with the server Chad was actually great and positively different than someone else&#39;s review here.  I asked Chad if they could make my favorite drink which was off the menu.  A perfect Brooklyn cocktail was what he brought back, nice.  The only food that we ordered were the pretzel bites which were really good with two dips which were hot mustard and some dip made of fancy cheese the name of which escapes me in the middle of this run on sentence on this hung over Saturday AM.  I will definitely go again.  See you there.  Cheers."

From the speakeasy-esque entrance (behind a bookshelf?!) to the excellent service we received. Everything about this place was awesome. I went with a friend on July 5th and was expecting a ridiculously long wait. However, we only had to wait maybe 5 minutes. 

We were seated at the bar and our bartender was incredibly helpful and friendly. She took the time to introduce herself, shake our hands, and then proceeded to call us by our first names for the rest of the night. Extremely professional and answered all our questions. She would make sure our water was full the whole night and he even gave us an extra toasted marshmallow when we somewhat sheepishly asked.

The drinks were delightful. I ordered The New-Old Fashioned and a Blackberry Sage Smash. The cocktail menu is extensive so there is bound to be something for everyone. The New-Old Fashioned was a refreshing, summery take on the old fashioned (my go-to drink of choice). I was worried the Blackberry Sage Smash would taste too much like juice, but it was a pleasant middle-of-the-road type drink. I did not find it too sugary at all. The pretzel bites were tasty and the atmosphere was top-notch. I absolutely want to go here again the next time I&#39;m in town."

Ha.  Guess I should&#39;ve paid closer attention.   When I finally went inside I had a great experience.  Staff was very welcoming and actually plays along with the whole &#34;speakeasy&#34; atmosphere.  

Their mixed drink menu is very extensive and they have tons of interesting choices.  Some drinks are their own creations.  The food menu is not that large but everything we ate was very tasty.  The pork belly appetizer was my favorite.  The steak was actually well done as well.  Only slight negative is the price-- food items are deffinatly on the the expensive side.  We spent a good $100 for two people and we each had only 2 drinks. 

Entering the bar through a bookcase is a nice touch!"

Had tried to come here a few months ago, but the wait was over two hours. Decided to come a little earlier this time which was the right move. The wait was still 45 minutes, but that allowed us enough time to go grab a drink at Recess next door. When they finally called, I appreciated that they were giving us a ten minutes heads up, to allow us to finish our drinks and make our way back. At the host stand, they asked for all of our IDs and asked what names we went by. They slid a card in a hole in the wall, and there was someone waiting for us on the other side of the wall. 

I cannot say better things about our server, Lauren. She was amazing. Seemed to know something about every drink on the menu and provided great insight. Menu was about 24 pages long, with only 2 of those being food items. We started with the pretzels and deviled eggs and both were a great selection. Everyone at my table ordered something different (burger, Panzanella, steak), and all had great things to say. I had the Mac and Cheese and added the bacon jam. It was so incredibly flavorful and just the right portion, even though it was on the little plates menu.

The bathrooms were covered with notes from previous patrons about what they liked about the place, was a nice touch. Altogether, the place was very small but I know that was probably on purpose. 

We had such a great time there. My friends were in from out of town, and this by far was their favorite place we went. Will definitely return!"

Although, we had a 2.5 hour wait, and during that time we went to Postino for wine, the drinks here are fantastic. The atmosphere is just what you think, speakeasy. I have the Pygmy&#39;s Lumbotomy, and it was delicious. I highly recommend the new old fashion, mint julep and the drink above. Just prepare ahead of time with reservations."

Suggested by friends as &#34;a Speakeasy that takes its food seriously&#34; Williams &amp; Graham has been impressing Mile High City citizens since 2011 and although rumors of long waits as a marketing tactic have been espoused by some a 5:30pm arrival granted almost immediate entry to the bar behind a bookcase where service was nothing short of exemplary.

No doubt a place that takes its concept seriously, the barmen including owner Sean Kenyon exceedingly educated about their booze and happy to create any drink a guest can conceive, Williams &amp; Graham features just the right mix of ambiance and intelligence to avoid feeling contrived or pretentious, the low lighting and leather perhaps expected while the vibe is actually far more &#34;chill&#34; than trendy.

Seated at the bar where guests are greeted with a gift of Pear Brandy, Lime Juice and fizz while a substantial drink list is explained as divided by spirit, those easily intimidated are encouraged to discuss preferences with one of three bartenders and although the classics are low-hanging fruit for such a skilled team there is never really a push to up-sell, a few elderly &#34;Jack and Coke&#34; types as well suited to Sean&#39;s sense of hospitality as others ordering things more innovative.  

Eventually settling on Gin for my drink of choice, the &#34;Harlot&#39;s Halo&#34; featuring a cloud of Lemon Curd and Citrus Syrup atop a stiff and sizable pour of Leopold Brothers&#39; best, it turns out that Kenyon knows several Vegas acquaintances and although the bar was quick to fill his check-ins were friendly and frequent, orders from the kitchen rolling out slowly as I chatted with a young intern who seemed well on his way to becoming an excellent mixologist.

Already well fed at Bar Dough, but interested in seeing just how good the &#34;Bar Bites&#34; might be, a duo of appetizers arrived perhaps twenty minutes after seating, the freshly baked Pretzel Bites pretty much par for the course despite excellent beer cheese while the Croquettes reminisced of a November trip to Bilbao with great flavor added by smooth aioli.

Surprisingly offering three desserts, a boozy cake roll ordered nearby appearing quite nice, a sudden surge in traffic saw orders notably delayed and considering tickets to the Avalanche game at 8:00pm my order was expedited, the unfortunate effect being far too much oil on each Fritter and the bowl originally being served almost flavorless without Anglaise, the sidecar only brought forth on request and still not enough to cover the greasiness up."

First of all, you enter through a bookshelf and you have to &#34;sign in.&#34; The one of the walls of the bookshelf opens up and you enter this dimly lit, velvety atmosphere. One side is the bar seating, the other the booths. 

The menu is broken down into 2 pages of food and 12931203820938 pages of drinks, each classified and sorted by liquor. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING and the drinks definitely had their fair share of alcohol. For started, ordered the plaintain chips, mac n&#39; cheese with bacon jam (OMG TO DIE FOR), and the watermelon salad. The plaintain chips were AMAZING and covered in some sort of coconutty, limey drizzle with an avocado dip. The mac n&#39; cheese ( I drool just typing this up) but was so perfectly cheesy and mixed BEAUTIFULLY with the richness and slight sweetness of the bacon jam. Love love love it. The watermelon salad was of course, refreshing, and the citrus vinaigrette was the perfect light/heavy combo for the plate. 

For mains, ordered the W&amp;G burger with caramelized onions, the scallops (WOW AMAZING), the lamb skewers and the risotto. EVERYTHING was VERY delicious and the flavors were immaculate for the ingredient it was paired with. My two favorites have to be the scallops -- amazing, amazing, amazing flavor with the best pairing of corn and veggies and the risotto which was the perfect texture and amount of richness in terms of creaminess. 

For desserts, tried all three - the brownie with salted caramel ice cream (DROOL), the white chocolate coffee mouse with cocoa powder tuile, and the key lime pie with shortbread. Really cute presentations for the dishes and the brownie was breathtaking with the saltiness of the ice cream. Wasn&#39;t in love with the coffee mouse but really enjoyed the extra garnishes they had with it like the cocoa powder tuile (Almost like cocoa nibbles or crumbles) and the key lime was deliciously sour and sweet. Come try everything - you won&#39;t be disappointed!!"

So one of my friends suggested a ladies night here on a Friday night. We somehow managed to scoop up 11 people to join us. Since I arrived first, I put our name down and phone number taken but was told that we wouldn&#39;t be guaranteed to get in.

About one hour later, I got a phone call letting me know that there was enough space for us to enjoy their specialty drinks. You enter thru a secret door via a bookcase and low and behold &#34;welcome to this speakeasy bar!&#34; It was quite small and dark so they had all 11 of us standing at the bookshelf between the bar and booths. I&#39;m quite short so the bookshelf tabletop was up to my nose; therefore, due to drunkenness throughout the night, I ended up standing on several books from the bookshelf haha. 

The drinks are quite pricey but they are very strong. They have an extensive drink list and they serve food as well. Since I&#39;ve been drinking gin beforehand, I asked the waitress for her suggestion and she pointed me in the direction of two of their gin cocktails. I decided on harlot&#39;s halo and it was very delicious. Strong in the sense of it&#39;ll sneak up on you because you can barely taste the alcohol. I was completely gone and done after 2. So proceed with caution. 

I cannot wait to come back here because the atmosphere really transports you to a time where alcohol consumption was illegal. There is no happy hour but this is a bar that you should definitely visit for the experience and delicious drinks."

Yes it&#39;s a bit small - but by design. There&#39;s going to be some waiting around - but that&#39;s what the bar next door is for. It&#39;s on the pricier side of things - but I don&#39;t feel bad at all about it.

The seasonal drinks change out... every season - so they&#39;re not exactly &#34;known for anything&#34; but it doesn&#39;t matter - everything is great.

The room is small, hence a speak easy, and the service very personalized as they ask your name and then fully use it throughout your experience. If you don&#39;t find something on the menu you like the bartenders are exceptionally talented and can somehow through a few questions create the exact drink you wanted. With this experience though you must go in knowing:

1. There will be a two hour wait so plan accordingly
2. This is a small venue so large parties is not what it is really meant for
3. Your in Denver, yes you can dress up but you can walk into any 5 star place and still see people in jeans.

Chose two seats at the bar and happy we did; the service was fantastic and i appreciated seeing how much care goes into the crafting of the cocktails. 

Crafty summer cocktail list and a great cheese plate (bread from Grateful bread was insanely delicious). The ambiance gives the impression of an escape and while I would certainly not be happy to wait for a seat (entrance doesn&#39;t allow for a lot of comfortable standing area), I am happy I didn&#39;t have to wait for my first experience.  Next time I would probably be willing to wait a bit. Will definitely be back.

I will add that the cocktails are pricey. However, considering the taste, restaurant atmosphere, and care taken to create the concoctions, I feel it&#39;s worth the occasional splurge."

Being from out of town, we went here on a recommendation... I was little iffy, as I have had experiences at Speakeasy type places like this that carry a pretentious attitude and try to be &#34;exclusive.&#34; This place was the complete opposite. The girl at the front was so kind, we were greeted right when we walked in by a nice man who sat us and explained the entire menu.... we put our orders in with our waitress... They don&#39;t keep the place crowded, that is why there is always a wait. It is well worth it. Moscow mules are a must from here as they make their own ginger beer daily.

FYI: My review is strictly based on my drinks and overall experience, which does not include food.

I love Williams &amp; Graham&#39;s bookstore theme. I love how the bar is hidden behind bookshelves.  At first glance, W&amp;G looks like an old school bookstore. The speakeasy reminds me a lot of the movie, The King&#39;s Men. It&#39;s hard not be lured by the theme and exclusivity of the speakeasy. Based on my experience, I don&#39;t think it is worth waiting more than half an hour. Luckily for me, I came on a Sunday night and only had to wait for 10 min. And if you are okay with waiting, they&#39;ll take down your # and call you when they are ready. Don&#39;t worry, you can buy some time and enjoy ice cream at Little Man down the street.

Drinks: 4

W&amp;G has a big drink menu that is organized by specials and type of liquor. If you&#39;re going to wait 1+ hour for this place, I recommend trying their specials. I got the Harvey Doppelganger, which was good, but nothing too impressive. My boyfriend got the Johnny Appleseed, which kind of tasted like a Long Island Ice Tea. 

Service: 3

Nowadays speakeasies are more known for their mixologists &amp; cocktails and less for their illicitness. Every time I&#39;ve been to a speakeasy, a big part of my experience is watching the bartender or mixologist make my drink. This is when the bartenders showcase their mixology skills. However, it wasn&#39;t like that at W&amp;G. I was pretty disappointed with the service we received. The bartenders were more focused on talking with each other than on making our drinks and talking to us. It could be that I came during an off night. Regardless, I hope that this experience was an exception!

Food: TBD

I hear the food here is good, so I recommend eating dinner here while enjoying some drinks, especially if you&#39;re going to wait!"

It&#39;s certainly a unique experience - a dark little speakeasy disguised by a bookstore. Our wait was pretty short, but I was told that you can put your name on a list, leave and then they will call you when they have a table. The drinks were definitely expensive, it was around $10-12 for a drink, so in the words of Tom Haverford - Treat yo self. They have a huge selection of liquor, but since I am not creative, I ordered a pisco sour (yum) and a old cuban. Both were excellent. In addition to drinks, I also ordered an apple pie. Theirs is a little different, as it is deconstructed so essentially they bring fried dough, apples and cinnamon and a vanilla dipping sauce, it was really good. I would like to come back, it&#39;s a neat experience."

Looked like there were a few people waiting and bigger groups were being turned away because the wait time was too long. We checked with the two hostesses and they said they can accommodate 2 without a wait!

The place looks like a legit speakeasy (and more legit than a few I know in Philly), and I was not sure if it&#39;s going to be one of those snobby cocktail bars with bartenders that only care about &#39;sophisticated&#39; patrons. (I was wearing sneakers, jeans and an untucked shirt, and you could get turned away for that attire at some Philly speakeasies). But my fears were completely wrong. A gentleman seated us at the bar and the female bartender who served us (not sure of her name, Christina?) was one of the best with her craft! Not only was she attentive and friendly but she was genuinely interested in finding out the tastes of the customer she&#39;s serving and customizing a cocktail to it. She gave samples of some of the ingredients used and took the time to describe the cocktail as well! She was one of the best bartenders in all respects!

We also ordered some food, and the Mac and cheese was amazing! I loved the dimly lit and windowless space, as a speakeasy is expected to be. I highly recommend you checkout this place, even if you don&#39;t know anything about cocktails, the bartenders will educate you while they mix a great drink for you! I will definitely return if I&#39;m in Denver again."

My husband and I spent a few days in Denver and had amazing service everywhere, and this was by far the worst service we had on our trip, and some of the worst service overall we have ever experienced.

A group of 4 of us went here and sat at a booth to order some drinks and an app or two. It was about 10:30pm on a Saturday when we got there. Chad took a bit to get to us, but it was busy so that didn&#39;t bother us much. Then after the 1st round, we honestly were in the mood to order a lot of their specialty drinks, however being that our drinks would sit empty, or near empty for at least 10 minutes before Chad would acknowledge us again, we didn&#39;t have many opportunities to order too much. 

Then when he brought us the bill, we were putting it on 2 credit cards. We clearly wrote on the receipt how much to put on each card. That was completely ignored and he split it 50/50. Again, not a huge deal. However before he could make that mistake, after us waiting to pay for about 10-15 minutes, with the cards clearly sitting there ready to go, I went to find him at the bar as we wanted to get somewhere else before it closed. He was hanging out at the bar with friends, taking shots, even looked over at me waiting for him, continued to talk and take shots for another minute or 2 before he acknowledged me.

And now, we have a 2nd pending charge from the place because he obviously accidentally ran our card for the full amount first, then re-ran it for half. I&#39;m sure that will be resolved, but honestly, after years or experience working in bars and restaurants I can say I would NEVER hire this guy."

Not that we minded but at a more sociable hour and night I can imagine the wait is long. 

We had a standing area which was fine as we had only planned on a drink. I ordered the old Cuban, our friend ordered the blackberry smash and the hubs ordered a Japanese whiskey. 

From start to finish, the whole experience was too notch customer service. This is not your regular bar but rather an elevated adult experience. It is so lovely to enjoy a cocktail and the lovely setting for the experience and not with the goal of getting wasted. Definitely going to come back!"

The inside feels so authentic and cozy. I had a drink called the &#34;Harvey Doppleganger&#34; which was probably one of the best drinks I&#39;ve ever had.  I also tried the Blackberry Sage drink which I heard is the most popular. It was also good and I enjoyed how it wasn&#39;t syrupy sweet but had actual blackberry flavor. I also got a cheese plate which felt pretty overpriced for the amount of cheese that we got. 

Make sure you have plenty of time when you come here you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to have a wait with how popular this place and the small amount of room on the inside. It&#39;s worth it though to visit one of the best bars in Denver."

I found this place on accident one night after getting uber&#39;ed to LoHi Steak Bar late one night. I thought &#34;huh, what type of bookstore is open until 1am?&#34;

Walked to the &#34;bookstore&#34; and asked if I wanted to be added to the &#39;list&#39;. Sure!? They said they&#39;d call me in an hour. Alright, sweet? I think.

Once I got my call I immediately powerwalked back to this &#39;bookstore&#39; at a painfully slow pace. I open the door. I&#39;m in? &#34;Great to see you Mr. onelove8721, welcome to Williams and Graham.&#34; The bookshelf opens."

Be prepared to wait, lest you get there at 5 when they open. Even though it was pretty packed at a Tue night at 11 PM, we were able to get two seats at the bar. We were so well taken care by our bartender - Jason , that it was evening to remember. Jason also happens to be one of the most experienced there, his hands do have some magic.

I got the vieux carre and asked Jason for smoky scotch instead of the traditional rye and it was hands down , one of the best cocktails I&#39;ve ever had. My friend had a mezcal old fashioned and it was spectacular too. We had some more mezcal cocktails.

What an experience in terms of sevice, drinks and ambiance. You will never look at a  speakeasy or cocktail bar the same way if you visit W&amp;G."

But understand first that one doesn&#39;t just walk in to W&amp;G and order. There is a bit of a process which is one of the many qualities of the unique place. 
The experience starts when you open the door. You get greeted by polite hostess who informs you how the place works.  You sort of &#39;earn&#39; your way in. 
Once you are in, it is sort of like a walk back in time. But not just the design of the place. I&#39;m talking old school service that is very, very rare in this day. The entire staff were friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and attended to our every need. The bartender made some tasty drinks from a full menu of choices. 
The ambiance was so comfortable and realistic, I honestly thought Capone was going to walk in and order. 
My favorite thing was then entire staff remembered my name.

The bar itself was so loud it was difficult to hear anyone in our party who wasn&#39;t directly sitting next to me as well. A lot of people love this place because it&#39;s a speakeasy theme but the bar is so popular you lose that element of surprise.

We only drank, we didn&#39;t eat, but they serve sparkling rose which is my fave, and the atmosphere is really unlike anywhere else I&#39;ve been. The place is tiny, only accessible through the bookshelf and exited through the back to keep the speakeasy feel. While you wait, there is another bar/restaurant down the hall, I recommend going there for some apps and drinks, it makes the wait much more manageable.

When we arrived we expected to wait a bit since the information we had gleaned on Williams &amp; Graham stated that it would be busy. Luckily it wasn&#39;t and after less than five minutes of waiting we were escorted back to a standing table because it was all that was available at that time. We were promptly greeted by Ty who gave us a quick rundown of the menu and then returned a few minutes later to take our drink orders. In the short period of time between our order being placed and our drinks being ready a spot at the bar opened up so we were moved into comfy chairs right at the bar. We were greeted by two wonderful bartenders Whitney and Jake. I won&#39;t bore you with more details of the night but it tuned out to be a great one filled with great drinks, a ton of water refills (what, I was dehydrated), several laughs, and a good memory for the trip. All of the staff was friendly and knowledgable; they were more than ready to answer our silly questions but didn&#39;t make us feel dumb for asking them and seriously our water glasses were never empty and neither were our cocktail glasses until we finally called it quits for the night. Oh did I mention that the cocktails were pretty awesome? Well they were.

Thanks again Williams &amp; Graham! If we ever make it back up there I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be one of our first stops!"

For example, we have attempted to go here 3 times and have only been successful once. Our first two tries, they gave us an estimated waiting time of 2 hrs, which we expected, so we put our names on the list and went to dinner. After an hour, they called us to tell us that we can come, but we were in the middle of dinner and said that they gave a 2 hr estimate. We were then told that our names would be put at the bottom of the list, which is another 2 hr wait, if we didn&#39;t arrive in the next 10 min. 

For our third attempt, we were given a 1.5 hr estimate. We were eating dinner when they called and all we had to do was pay our check and walk over. The lady who called my husband was really rude and said that we needed to get there in 10 min and refused to extend it to 15 min. My husband spoke to the manager who agreed to give us a 15 min window.

Once inside, I was pleased by the decor and ambience. The drinks were amazing. Although we had just eaten, the foie gras looked so yummy, so I decided to order it and I am so glad I did! It was decadent and so delicious.

Although, I was happy with our overall experience, I think they get a 3 for their service on getting into the door. If you give me a 2 hr estimate and call me 1 hr later, you can&#39;t be rude about it when I ask to come at the 2 hr mark. I understand that there is always a wait and a list, and an estimate is an estimate, but you can&#39;t be rude about it with the undertone about my business being replaceable. I&#39;m ambivalent about wanting to come back to this place because it seems you have to work so hard at getting in and plan your night around their convenience."

It&#39;s really great if you&#39;re looking to wow your date, try something different, or just sit in a cool, romantic space; but this place has some issues.

I had the good fortune to stop by while they were hosting other mixologists, but I still couldn&#39;t get a decent Old Fashioned. Something about the balance was off, and it isn&#39;t too difficult to pull this drink off. I really like the Arvada Tavern and they&#39;re one of the few places that goes above and beyond drinks in Colorado. Closest to here is probably The Kitchen.

One thing I never struggle with is being too cold; but this place is an ice chest. Seriously, guys, lay off the A/C."

The husband and I stopped in on a Thursday to celebrate our wedding anniversary and arrived early enough to have just a few minutes in the book store. From there we were escorted inside and had one drink standing until a spot opened at the bar. 

Every drink recommendation was spot on and exactly what we were looking for. The risotto was so good that we couldn&#39;t contain ourselves and the couple next to us, seeing our joy, ordered it as well. We also had the arugula salad with fresh peaches and the burger, which was perfectly cooked. We topped all of this off with a salted caramel brownie with ice cream.

So be prepared to go to another bar for over an hour. We were sat at a table they referred to as &#34;the wall.&#34;  Basically we had a ledge that served as a table (for 4!). So when we ordered food the plates didn&#39;t fit on the ledge and we had to hold the plates while eating off of them so they didn&#39;t fall off. 

Food was good. Drinks were too bitter for my taste. And pricey. 

Overall the vibe is very cool but since we couldn&#39;t use the table it made it less sweet."

The Barramundi dish was above average, with the only downside of it being a bit too salty. The orzo with this dish was excellent - al dente to just the right degree with a lightly drizzled creamy sauce.

The dark &amp; stormy was hands-down amazing. I learned from the bartender that the ginger beer was manufactured by the owners using their own custom recipe, and he took a moment to explain the high-level process and thanked me for my appreciation.  I&#39;ve ordered this drink at several bars in other cities and prepared many with friends over the last 8 years. The sharpness and flavor of ginger in this drink beats out store varieties and other bars&#39; drinks by a very large margin.

My girlfriend who accompanied me had the &#34;plummet with me&#34; cocktail. She described it as sweet, yummy, and just the right degree of a raw sake/vodka mixed with the somewhat more dominant flavors of plum and lemon.

The atmosphere was very nice, with a moderate noise level that still made casual conversation pleasant. The bartenders and hostess at the front were polite, and spent some time explaining the bar and it&#39;s history to us newcomers which is a pleasant surprise for a bar that was almost at capacity. The bartenders were attentive and conscientious in explaining their drinks as well.

I highly recommend this establishment and will likely go back the next time I&#39;m in town."

Came here last minute with some friends so we couldn&#39;t get reservations for dinner so just had drinks. First, the space is super cute. Small entry way with a hidden bookcase that swings open to a darkly lit &#34;speakeasy&#34;. It may be too dark for dinner but still, a very cool ambiance. 

I didn&#39;t like where they sat us - 4 stools next to each other at the end of the bar across from the bussing station. It made conversing hard as we were all next to each other as opposed to facing one another. Plus I don&#39;t really want to sit near the dirty bussing area where the waiters pick up/drop off stuff. Fine for a solo person or couple but not a group. 

The cocktails menu is very extensive with seasonal and standard drinks plus all the spirits you can think of and more. I had the bootsy collins which was vodka based. Strong but not too much - made well. Some drinks were creative but others were simple. I like that they had both kinds and they did them well.

This isn&#39;t like some other speakeasies I&#39;ve visited where there&#39;s a cool hidden door - it&#39;s much more than that. A hostess greets you in front of some bookshelves and takes your name down. From there, she slips the card with your names to the back while you wait for seating. As clandestine as something out of a spy novel, the bookshelf rotates open and you are whisked away to a small bar in the back. 

So this is what it feels like to be in a prohibition-era bar. The cool mood was set with dim lighting. We sat down at the bar where the bartender was already crafting some skillfully made drinks. The blackberry sage smash was a popular drink so I tried that first. This bourbon drink was quite balanced as other reviewers have mentioned - it didn&#39;t taste too sweet or strong, but I really felt it later. We snacked on some small bites including the deviled eggs and the beer nuts while enjoying our time. After finishing my first drink, I ordered a second. The bartender had been making several of these coffee drinks called the coffee &amp; cigarettes, which was another bourbon concoction. This was a bourbon version of Bailey&#39;s, which was tasty, but after a few sips, I was done. I couldn&#39;t even finish as I later realized that these drinks are strong, but you don&#39;t notice because of how well-crafted they are. 

The exit is actually completely separate from the secret entrance, which adds to the cool atmosphere. Before leaving, I did manage to drunkenly stumble into the restroom and check out the cool notes that were plastered on the walls from prior patrons. Williams &amp; Graham is easily one of the coolest bars I&#39;ve seen and is worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area."

Steak presented in thin slices - which is nice for presentation - but the steaks temperature drops instantly when cut this way. Disappointing to eat cold $25 steak.

I love the decor and the bar.  I expected more from the menu. They get 4 stars for the food and the drinks. They have a big variety of drinks but to call a place a &#34;good bar&#34;you have to have combinations of drinks that are rare and unique. I have been to places where your Bloody Mary is a &#34;salad of fresh produce&#34; or the drinks are combo of a tea and alcohol. Nothing like this on the menu. I tried the scallops and they were well cooked but the rest of the dish was unimpressive. The appetizers selection  was small and I tried  one  new dish but again the sides in the plate were uneatable. Too much oil maybe  or deep fried? Anyway the experience was good but I would never wait for 3 hours to get in. We went on a weekday and it was nice.   I waiting time. I would go back only if there were no lines to get in and just  to have a  plain alcoholic drink with  a snack. By the way the place is not cheap!"

Perhaps that is part of the cache of the place, and perhaps it&#39;s what has me coming back to see what is occurring behind those solid walls.

Atmosphere is the reason you go to Williams &amp; Graham. It&#39;s just plain awesome, and unlike most anything you can find in Denver without live music. After the 15 to 30 minute wait, and likely longer on the weekends, you can be let into a stand room only location or wait a little longer for a booth or bar seat. 

Again, you go here for a fun time not to have a meal, a drink, and a light to be able to see both. It&#39;s all about dark, mysterious and anything to hide slightly steep prices.

All of that said, it&#39;s still a 4 star place. It&#39;s awesome to sit back, relax and enjoy a drink and a conversation without music blaring and people whining about their food. Make it a priority to go here soon."

Very cool experience, even though we had to wait in line outside at 5 p.m. before the place even opened. The bartenders are true artists and a specialty cocktail is only around $12, which is cheaper than other places with a similar spin. I asked the bartender for vodka, grapefruit, and a citrus flavor without being sweet. He delivered a perfectly crafted beverage that had yummy undertones of spice and earth. My husband had a unique tequila drink with hints of jalapeno and agave. Overall, this is a fun, dark place to chill out for a few hours, just expect to wait a bit."

&#34;What&#39;s the password?&#34;
&#34;New England Clam Chowder.&#34;
&#34;Is that the red, or the white?&#34;
- Ace Ventura, Pet Detective

In advance of my already-scheduled trip to Denver, I read about this place in not one, but two magazines: TIME and Entrepreneur. So I made it a point to go while I was in town.

I made a reservation for 6 of us 4 days ahead of time, which my friend recommended I do because of how quickly they fill up. I suggest you do the same.

We had to wait a few minutes to get in, even with our reservation, but our server, &#34;Sparkles,&#34; came over right away and took our first of many cocktail orders to come. We were definitely the community cocktail table. Everyone tried everyone else&#39;s drink.

We caught the tail end of the summer cocktail menu; I appreciate the seasonal changes. I ordered these 3 drinks for myself:
-Blackberry Sage Smash (Johnny Drum Private Stock bourbon , fresh blackberries, sage, lemon, sugar)
-Mango mojito
-Sidecar

All were made perfectly. You can definitely tell they put a lot of work into these drinks. That said, you may wait a while, but it&#39;s worth it. As for the prices, at $12-13 each, I was elated. A similar place in NYC could easily get away with charging $15+.

Just when I thought the drinks couldn&#39;t get any better, our table ordered some fries and mac and cheese. Each are hands down in my top 3.

I love the ambience of a speakeasy: the &#34;bookstore&#34; storefront, the bookshelf entrance, the dark atmosphere downstairs, and the exit out the backdoor.

Oh, but don&#39;t worry. They don&#39;t ask you for a password here."

Fourth of July, decided to start off the evening here before looking for fireworks.  As luck would have it, there wasn&#39;t a line, and I got to immediately go in with my friends.

The walk to your seats is an experience in itself.  As a first-timer, I had no idea what was behind the bookshelf, and it&#39;s something that you only picture in movies, and something that Denver doesn&#39;t have anywhere else.  Best atmosphere for a bar I&#39;ve ever been in.

The drinks, albeit pricey, are crafted to perfection.  Strong AND enjoyable.  

The place was full, but there was not a problem hearing from across the table.  

We moved on afterwards, but I&#39;ll definitely be back to try the food and show friends that there are some great bars in Denver."

To put it simply, Williams &amp; Graham is just straight up cool. &amp; the drinks/bartenders are top notch.

We were incredibly lucky and walked-in on a Friday night at 11PM due to a cancellation. So thank you strangers! 

We made our way through the bookshelf and were transformed into a candle lit roaring 1920s bar. We scored seats at the bar and had front row seats to the outstanding artistry of the bartenders. Our bartender was very patient. He took the time to explain the menu which often felt like it was in a different language due to our top shelf liquor naiveness. You mean you don&#39;t have McCormick&#39;s?! 

Jokes aside, we came just in time for the summer cocktail menu. We ordered the Dancing with Daggers and the Reverend. Forgive me father because I will continue to sin with these drinks. They were: 1. esthetically beautiful 
          2. constructed by a true craftsman
          3. could put an elephant to sleep. 

After the first round and the altitude adjustment, we were in desperate need of some food. At this point, the conversation was quickly becoming giggly and unintelligible. So we ordered the W&amp;G burger and were not disappointed. Now we couldn&#39;t quite figure out the mystery white sauce that came with the plate because it neither was good with the burger or fries. That aside, it was plenty for two. Overall, great experience and made our night in Denver."

This game, available by reservation only for limited dates and times, at Williams &amp; Graham is the coolest adventure I had on my recent trip to Denver. 

I expected Decipher to be somewhat of a standard team trivia game (with multiple teams). I was wrong. Rather, your one team competes against the clock in a unique space to see if you can decipher answers from clues. Kudos to my host, Kevin, for allowing me to play alone, explaining the rules,and for sheperding me when I was at a disadvantage for being solo. The game was exhilirating. I can&#39;t say enough good things about my host. I had an incredible time, but I&#39;d recommend going with a small group.

Afterwards, I was escorted into Williams &amp; Graham, which was an unbelievable honor considering there was a 3 hour wait otherwise.

The staff here were incredibly friendly, despite having the rough task of informing hoards of people of a multi-hour wait (at best) due to the popularity and media coverage of this very small establishment. Many thanks to each staff member for being so welcoming and accommodating.

I had two distinct drinks and the bone marrow. I was delighted by all....everything was so unique.

 I hope that Williams &amp; Graham will continue to offer and to develop Decipher. I&#39;m on the edge of my seat awaiting the next challenge."

I moved less than a block away recently, so now it is really convenient place to grab a quick meal and a cocktail. Will I go back? No, based on principle alone. There are several great bars and restaurants in this neighborhood that I would much rather visit after my awful experience. 

When I arrived with a friend, there were two parties ahead of us and the hostess ensured us that we wouldn&#39;t have to wait more than 5-10 minutes at the max. I saw her mark a table on her seating chart for us. The two parties ahead of us went in. Then two groups that showed up after us were taken in as well. At this point we had been waiting over 30 minutes. I knew we had been skipped, so I politely confronted the hostess on this issue. I asked if they do call aheads, she said no. Then I asked why two groups that showed up after us were let in before us? She gave me a deer in headlights look and started to mumble some excuse. I told her it&#39;s not a big deal, but asked her to please get us in next. 

When we were finally taken inside (almost 45 minutes after we arrived, not 5-10), we were taken to the stables (a staging area at a bookshelf to wait for a seat at the bar), not to the table that I clearly saw the hostess mark on the seating chart. 

When our server at the stables came to take our drink order, he said that he is sorry that we thought we might have been skipped, and ensured that we would take care of us. He brought us a sip of white wine that was on the house. Wow! Thank you for a sip of wine after severely inconveniencing me and for putting me behind schedule for the rest of the evening!

My theory for why we got skipped? My friend and I were wearing jeans, t-shirts, and baseball caps. Mine was backwards. Apparently, this isn&#39;t appropriate attire to wear into their establishment. I think they intentionally skipped us, because they thought we would become disinterested and would go elsewhere. We were stubborn and decided to stick it out though. We look like young people that don&#39;t belong there, but we happen to actually be really successful young professionals.

We ended up only having time to stay for one cocktail. I had an old fashioned and my friend had a Moscow mule. They were both pretty decent. The Moscow mule was especially good. After our ridiculously unprofessional experience, we ended up leaving a generous tip just to make a point ."

We shared four cocktails here, all from the winter menu.  They were all delicious.  Old Man Winter was easily our favorite, with a nice initial flavor and many complex lingering notes in the finish that made us want to slow down and enjoy each sip.  We also enjoyed Dem Apples, Sloe Down, and La Belle Helene.  We also shared an order of fries.

The atmosphere is really cool.  It is a speak easy and you do enter through a book shelf. 

After that, it&#39;s not that great.

Even after you wait an exorbitant period of time to enter the dining area, you may still be forced to take your initial drinks and appetizers while standing; hoping that someone leaves their table for you to be seated.

The food was pretty good, but not that amazing.  I mean, I&#39;ve had better pork loin at a friend&#39;s house.

The service was abysmal.  The server was completely disengaged.  This guy totally fit the &#34;disengaged hipster&#34; stereotype.

Ambiance. This place is way cool and they&#39;ve really thought about the whole speakeasy experience. Two thumbs up.

Cocktails. Reasonably priced and an extensive amount of options. I liked that they had the classics on there (or could make them if you asked) since a lot of places don&#39;t know what a French 75, or a Sidecar, or a Vesper is anymore. The cocktails were good and creative, but I can&#39;t say they were the best I&#39;d ever had.

Reservations. You really kind of do need reservations....for a bar. The place is just so tiny and so popular that you really need to think ahead or you&#39;ll be asked to wait for 3 hours as other Yelpers have mentioned. Good news on that point is that when I did call for a reservation, they had some the very next day and day after. So plan ahead people!

Does it live up to the hype? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m glad we went and It&#39;s a place we&#39;ll revisit when we have out of towners visiting, or if we&#39;re craving a classic cocktail, but it&#39;s certainly not going to be our everyday watering hole.

Side note - they are opening a new joint next door. They&#39;ve been rennovating the adjacent building and will be opening a new lower-key concept hopefully sometime in August 2015. It&#39;s supposed to have a patio, but will only be as large as the existing W&amp;G."

The smell was coming from the back. And when leaving you had to pass through the worst of the sewage smell. And they have the nerve to sell such overpriced items. 

The going behind the bookshelf isn&#39;t as elaborate as one may think. It wasn&#39;t very exciting. It was just someone opening a door with books on it. It didn&#39;t feel top secret or special. I went to a &#34;secret&#34; bar like this in NYC which was amazing, but this one was a total let down.

I also had the Mac and Cheese with Bacon Jam. It was perfectly proportioned, definitely on the larger side of a &#34;Small Plate&#34; which is excellent!

This is an acceptable time to take a strange drink from a stranger dressed like they are from the 1800s (I failed history). The reason I don&#39;t bestow 5 stars?

It was also open for breakfast so SAHMs would get the kids off to school and meet their friends for coffee and snacks.  I think it hurts McAlister&#39;s that it&#39;s not open earlier."

Food is decent,  wait time was brief,  but the hidden cost of the bread bowl (price was not listed in the menu) seems very sketchy to me.  How hard is it to put the cost on the menu or have your staff explain that it is extra for the bread.  I get that is only a dollar.

If reviews were on service alone, I&#39;d petition to give them 10 stars. Our server made sure we had everything we needed and even brought us free rice pudding desserts, we had a table of 3. 

Our food on the other hand, was only okay. The menu is extremely enticing with plates like meat samosas and chicken saag, which I&#39;ve never seen before. However, the meals weren&#39;t quite executed right. The meat samosas we ordered where salty, but overall, they were pretty good. The chicken saag was really oily and lacked flavor. The same is true for chicken tikka masala that we ordered. The best dish was probably the chicken vindaloo. The spices were much more noticeable in this dish. We also ordered a naan basket. Some of our naan were slightly burned, but good overall. We ordered the cheese stuffed naan and the cheese was very mild. I&#39;m interested in what their other stuffed naans are like. This is another interesting dish that&#39;s offered that you&#39;re unlikely to see anywhere else."

2nd time here, the first time I came I was ready to rave about this place, but decided to hold on for the second visit.
They&#39;re chicken masala is still pretty good, the yogurt is just not good, which I use to eat to help ease the spices on my stomach. Species on their food have kind of lost its flare, not as spiced up as other traditional Indian food which I guess is good for those who aren&#39;t too tolerant. 
The service was good, can&#39;t rate the service because it was a lunch buffet. And, as I write the review with my first plate they dropped the check... -1 star, I do hate when the check is dropped without me asking. 

I&#39;m surprised there&#39;s no samosas on the buffet line, the veggie samosas are a staple of Indian food why not make them, I don&#39;t get it. Also, very sad they don&#39;t offer garlic naan when you&#39;re sat at the table.

Star of India surpassed all expectations and I can say without hesitation they have the best Indian food I have ever had, and considering the amount I travel and different places I am afforded the opportunity to try, that is saying a lot. 

The tandoori wings(drumstucks) are absolutely incredible, and the rub(?) or sauce(?) that covers them is very unique and very flavorful! When you ask for spicy, it comes spicy! The chicken tikka masala is the best I have ever tried! Such tender chicken and delicious thick sauce that you can literally dip and cover any other part of the meal in it and it will continue to impress. The naan, rice, even the lunch buffet are all spot on and perfectly prepared and delightful! 

So, Great food(!), Great staff(!), easy to find, and the owner,  Gar, all contribute to make this one place that should not be overlooked!

Star of India catered my wedding this past June. Everything was perfect. The leftover samosas were delicious the next night just as promised.

When I asked  Our server Shryia what she would recommend for me she pointed out two dishes that I might like. I took her first recommend suggestion and she was right on. My company (nephew  knows India food ) Also tried something else on the menu.  Said it was some of the best India food he has had in awhile.  
What really made our visit here enjoyable was our server  Shryia who suggested other items to try. And she kept coming back to make sure everything was great. Great attitude Shryia.  

Also we had the pleasure of meeting the owner GAR.  What a nice person. He really made sure we where taken care of.  
GAR has been at this location for almost 20 years  but the place was well kept and very clean.  And from seeing the other guest and there happy faces it looks like he knows how to keep them coming back.

My standards for Indian food are probably a bit higher than the average person, since I am as Indian as it gets and my tastebuds can distinguish spices like nobody&#39;s business.

I went here for dinner with a few gfs this past weekend. Surprisingly, they had a dinner buffet/&#34;all-you-can-eat&#34; option. I say surprisingly, because Indian food buffets are usually a lunch thing. I was happy to have the option to have a few items on my plate than I would have had I just ordered a dinner plate.

The minute I took a bite of the cauliflower sabji (sabji = stew in Hindi), I could tell it was reheated from either earlier in the day or the previous day. The Saag paneer also taste a little &#34;un-fresh&#34;. Thankfully, the garlic naan was made fresh and served hot when we ordered it.

Overall, I would probably not go back to this place for a dinner buffet. I have been to lots of Indian restaurants and eat homemade Indian food quite frequently, and unfortunately, I would say that this place did not meet my standards. 

The servers were extremely friendly and for that, I would give this place a higher rating, but I just can&#39;t help give them 2 stars after having tasted their semi-old &#34;all-you-can-eat&#34; dinner.  I may have a different opinion if I go just for their regular restaurant hours (hence why they probably have a high rating on Yelp)."

Upon entering the restaurant, a man cheerfully greeted us and took us to a booth, where we were immediately served complimentary papad. We were asked for our drink orders and appetizer orders very soon after. Our server was attentive and even offered to put our main course order in along with our drinks orders to expedite the process. 

Our drinks were delicious (and strong!) and the appetizers were great. Our main courses came out as soon as we finished our appetizers. The lamb masala and butter chicken were fantastic.

Every time we go whether it&#39;s for dine in or pick up, we always get greeted with the warmest hello. We are always checked on when we dine in and we never have a problem. The owner Gar, comes up and ask how we&#39;re doing, how&#39;s the food taste, and makes sure we&#39;re happy. He&#39;s wonderful and so if the whole staff! This place will always have our business.

How do you make Indian food with no flavor?!  I smelled the spices when I walked in, and my clothes smelled like Indian food when I left, but the food on my plate had little to no spice.  I don&#39;t necessarily want blisteringly spicy-hot food, but this stuff was boring.  I tried a little of almost everything they offered, but nada.  Frankly, the Indian-ish food I make at home with spice mixes I&#39;ve bought from Indian markets has way more punch.  This place has so many good reviews that either I went on an off day (or maybe ordering from the menu is the way to go here) or people have no clue what good food tastes like.  Needless to say, I won&#39;t be back for the lunch buffet."

We have only been for the buffet at lunch but we eat until we are STUFFED. Everything is always fresh, lots of flavor and hot. I am normally not a fan of buffets because I fell things sit there too long and they aren&#39;t kept at temp but this place does not have that problem. The staff is on top of things. We like our naan without butter/oil and some places seem to be annoyed when we ask for it that way but it is not an issue here. The service is always friendly and attentive. The owner is constantly there and so friendly as well. He has given us his card a couple of times and told us to let him know the day before we come in, if we have an special requests for the buffet. 

Last time we went we took my 4 year old son (who also loves this place) and the waiter got him some rice pudding topped with a little mango custard from the bar and suggested my son try it. My son LOVED it so then the server brought us each over a mango yogurt drink to try which was SOOOOOO good. I am seriously getting hungry just thinking about their food. 

Don&#39;t judge them by the shopping center, we have tried (or at least walked into and looked at the food) every indian place in the area and we always come back to this one. As a matter of fact, now because we are so spoiled by their great quality, a lot of time we go in, are seated and then look at the buffet only to leave and drive back to Star of India. I don&#39;t know why we even try to go elsewhere."

I hate it when Indian restaurants think they can use the same tomato purée based sauce for all their dishes. Honestly there was nothing on the buffet which I thought was edible. Left the food on my plate untouched. The search continues for an authentic Indian restaurant."

The wait staff is all very friendly and will do their absolute best to make sure everyone is happy. They are always bringing you extra papa dams, naan and rice pudding for free! 

The prices are reasonable, especially considering their portions. A group of four could easily share three dishes and still have leftovers to take home.

I was definitely missing my Chana masala - However, I will say out of the few Indian buffets I have been to - Star of India has the best flavors!

Personally, I like buffets because I like a little of everything, so we tried Star of India on a Saturday night.  

This place is awesome.  The food was great. Everything was very fresh looking and delicious.  However, what I really want to talk about is the service.  This is one of the few places that practices that old fashioned trend of having the owner/manager visit all the tables.  We talked with the owner for a good 10 minutes about how these were all his old family recipes and how happy he was that we liked it.  He seemed very genuine and friendly and it was just nice to relax and enjoy great food with someone who takes real pride in it.  

Just a warning, their garlic naan could kill a whole horde of vampires.  We love garlic so it&#39;s no problem for us, but holy cats was it potent.  Delicious and potent."

My family  and I purchased two orders of chicken Tikka Masala along with an order of chicken biriyani and some other items to take home.  For me after having India food from a cross the country I find that Star of India compares to place I have visited in Illinois, California and Colorado.  The staffs very friendly and helpful. Gar the owner/Manger was very friendly and really wants to know  if the food mets your expectations.  My advice would be to make sure that what ever you order is spicy.  We order one of each of the Tikka Masala  and I preferred the spicy.  

One thing that we do as a family is to ask would you eat their food again.  All four of us said yes.   Next I want to try their Saturday buffet."

The naan, traditional ($1.95) &amp; garlic ($3.95), were good though the traditional was a bit doughy. I liked that chutney that came with the poppidum at the start of the meal.

Not something I have ever had in a samosa before.  It completely overpowered the delicate spicing of the potatoes and peas.  I was also surprised to see the samosas taken off the buffet table.  That&#39;s all right when you need raita, rice or the different sauces.  Not so much with a prepared dish.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t order the samosas again.  Very disappointing.

The Chicken Tikka Masala was not as disappointing and the naan was puffy, hot and quite tasty.  However, there was some gristle in the meat, breast meat rarely is, so does that mean dark meat crept in?  It did end my dining experience on a down note.

The service was what one expects: negligible.   Too bad or I would have gotten the raita I had requested.  At least it wasn&#39;t added to my bill.

I am a huge fan of Indian food, from my first experience of it at the world&#39;s best Indian restaurant,  Tandoor India in Philadelphia.   I am afraid Star of India doesn&#39;t come close to that restaurant; and, I haven&#39;t lived in Philly since 2001.  Perhaps I am too picky; or, maybe it was the kerosene smell coming from the table lamp.  My search continues."

I came across this place and thought, Indian sounds really yummy right now.  Sam never tried Indian food so a little convincing was in order, he agreed and off we went.

The place is in a strip mall, don&#39;t let that scare you away, some really great restaurants are in strip malls.  We entered and the place is a lot bigger than what I thought from the outside.  The place was a little on the quiet side, it was a Sunday evening though.  There was a Birthday party being set up in the back room which looked nice.  We were immediately greeted and sat in a booth.  

Our waiter was absolutely fantastic!  Once I told him that Sam was new to the whole Indian food experience, he was very helpful with recommendations, how it worked and what meat went best with what sauce.

We decided on:

Garlic Naan - Very tasty, just enough garlic
Chicken Vindloo - Huge pieces of chicken with potato&#39;s, I loved it
Lamb Korma - Sam loved this dish.  He had the surprised look on his face of &#34;Wow, this is great and I didn&#39;t expect it&#34;.  I love that the Korma has coconut milk in it.
Basmati Rice - Great compliment to both the dishes and helped to scoop up the sauce with the naan bread.

This was a top notch dinner for us and the food had great flavor and spice.  You can pick your spicy level, we both went with medium which was just right.  I think if we went hot it would&#39;ve been too much.  

If we&#39;re in the area again I would definitely stop in.  The lunch buffet sounds nice, maybe I&#39;ll have to plan a trip.  :)"

Don&#39;t know how to pronounce something? not sure what it is? have a special request? They listen and act on it without hesitation. 

The people: Gar (sp?), the owner, came around to each table and introduced himself, made recommendations, and engaged in personal conversation. He shared not only his restaurant and food, but himself with us. He told us how the recipes are all from his mother&#39;s kitchen and how she personally trained the cooks to cook food properly. And that was wholly evident, as it felt like we were eating in his home. 

The food: was nothing short of phenomenal. Unlike other Indian places in the area, not was very flavorful and not at all salty or oily. We had the bread basket, the saag paneer, the lamb biriyani, and the paneer makhani.  The portions were enormous, especially the biriyani.  And as a gesture of hospitality and passion for sharing his food and culture with us, Gar gave us a wonderful--and complimentary--serving of rice pudding with mango puree.

On a recent night after a movie at the Esquire, we decided to walk north and we wandered past Potager.  On a whim we decided to see whether we might be able to find a table.  It was a good time to revisit Potager after swearing it off many years ago as too crowded or too expensive.  We were surprised to find that Potager is still cruising along as one of the best restaurants in Denver. 

Potager was winding up the busiest end of dinner service and there were many tables open to us, so they seated us quickly in the back area by the garden.  It was very quiet and intimate, but they didn&#39;t forget about us; the service was always attentive and friendly.  My wife and I shared a grilled squid salad, the cucumber soup, the sweet corn ravioli and a wood roasted chicken and panzanella salad.  All the dishes were fresh and locally sourced, even down to the Colorado chicken.   Very delicious and well composed on the plate.  The chicken could have rested a bit more--it was juicy but rubbery--but they warned us that it takes an extra 20 minutes to serve the chicken, and they may have rushed it to get it served to us after we finished off all our appetizers.   The ravioli were inspired, with both the sweet corn and pistachio garnish adding a unique take to a classic perfectly al dente pasta.  We finished off our meal with a nice peach crumble and ice cream.  

I am glad to have rediscovered this classic Denver neighborhood restaurant."

We asked if they would slice up the roast chicken family style - NO!
Instead they bring us cheapie steak knives.

We ask if we can sit down before the rest of our party arrives so we can order wine and appetizers?  No!  We ended up spending $300 for four people.

Can we put on name on the list while we walk over?  No!

The roast chicken was undercooked, greasy, and bland!

Go to Plimoth or Acorn for the best roast chicken for the same price!

Oops. I should have read the reviews more carefully. Fresh food, wine, gardens, and leisurely conversation? Well, no. They do have lovely gardens.

As others mentioned, the service was strangely off-putting, like they didn&#39;t want you there. The weird blips just piled up as the dinner progressed, though we tried hard to shrug it off and just enjoy our celebration. My Cabernet had been left uncorked for too long and was sour. The $29 lamb shoulder was all fat - and cold. My dirty plate sat in front of me long after I was finished. My daughter enjoyed her pizza, but then they brought the check while we were still eating. The fresh peach-apricot crisp was delicious, as was the raspberry tart she ordered, but by that point, I&#39;d had my fill of the sour vibe. I was beginning to wonder if I&#39;d somehow offended.(?) Don&#39;t worry, I left 20% tip and extra for the kitchen anyway, because that&#39;s what you do. 

There are definitely other farm-to-table restaurants in Denver/Boulder that enthusiastically help you celebrate the joy of good food, for this nonsense. I wish I&#39;d eaten at the same place some of the five-star reviewers mentioned! I guess I met his evil twin instead."

GTFO. Look, I get that it&#39;s farm to table and all that crap, but unless you&#39;re sourcing the food from your farm in the back located in Denver where land is kind of pricey, I don&#39;t think you should be charging such prices.

Food: Decent. I wish the menu was more expansive but I guess since it&#39;s seasonal and local, selection is limited. I do, however, like that the menu changes every season. 

I got the cod which was decent. It came with noodles and a beet sauce. A little too gingery for my tastes but can&#39;t really complain. BF got the pork chop. The pork chop itself was cooked to perfect and was succulent but the side that came with it wasn&#39;t that good in my opinion. 

Service: Terrible service. I understand that it&#39;s a Friday night and you&#39;re busy but something about this place just screams inefficient. First off, there was no hostess to greet us so BF + I just kind of stood around waiting confused. Second, when the (supposed?) hostess greeted us, he had to check whether or not he had anyone else waiting at the bar. Why can&#39;t you just install a system where you take parties by name like a regular restaurant? He took us over to a table for two and then told us that he made a mistake and that he wanted to keep that table for another party and he&#39;d put together another table for us. WTF? Then, after waiting for a couple of minutes, he puts together this corner table where BF + I would be FACING THE WALL while we ate. DOUBLE. WHAT. THE. EFF? So I asked to wait for another table. Sorry if I actually want to face my BF when I converse and eat. 

It also took FOREVER to get our water and to order. For some reason, the waitress just did not come by often. It also pissed me off that other tables that sat down significantly AFTER us got their water first, got to put in their orders first, and got their food first (if not around the same time). 

Another note, this restaurant was a little pretentious, which I didn&#39;t like. On their menu, they mention NO CELL PHONES PLEASE. Uhh, excuse me? I think I&#39;m going to do what I want and what I want is to not come back here."

A staple of Denver&#39;s dining scene for nearly twenty years, featuring &#34;farm to table&#34; cuisine before the concept was a &#39;trend,&#39; walk-in only Potager was targeted for dinner during day one in Denver, a 5:30pm arrival scoring my choice of tables while those arriving after seven o&#39;clock were assured a thirty minute wait, or longer.

Owned by Teri Rippeto and her father, the current culinary direction described as a collaboration between herslf, Chefs Chris Bell and Luke Hendricks plus sommelier Natalie Guinovart - who also doubles as a server - Potager occupies a shabby-chic corner lot and with the L-shaped dining room and lounge wrapping around the open kitchen and bar those lucky enough to score a seat are are treated to a continually updated menu while additional daily specials are featured on a chalk-board hung above the pass.

Opting for a table in the lounge, a comfy chair and lamp lighting favored over wood and linen in the proper dining room, it was not long before Ms. Guinovart greeted me and offering the menu without describing specials a four course dinner was decided upon, a demi-portion of gnocchi added gratis when I noted the chalkboard en route to the restroom and informed her that I&#39;d have ordered it in place of the pizza had I been previously informed.

Opting against wine, though suggested pairings were certainly not the typical white-with-fish and red-with-meat sort, it was with a few bites of crusty housemade bread and benign butter that the meal began, and after a short delay thanks to the rapidly filling restaurant the first course was presented in the form of an inverted cheese &#34;souffle&#34; reminiscing the flavors of French Onion Soup, the ever-evolving signature as  light as a cloud but rife with flavor sitting in a broth for which the bread seems made to sop.

Having heard good things of the wood-fired pizzas, the sharable appetizer&#39;s seasonal interpretation today topped in housemade sausage plus whipped local cream, mozzarella and a bit of fennel pollen, suffice it to say that although thin, crisp and pleasantly smoky the dish is far too rich for one and opting to take more than half back home it was not long before the aforementioned potato dumplings were presented, each hand-rolled noodle a melt-in-your-mouth experience with earthy musrooms and saline cheese finding a perfect foil in pickled shallots.

Not specifically an Italian restaurant, though my order may seem as such, the final savory arrived just minutes past 6:45 and as much as I loved the presentation of the gnocchi it would be hard to say the Housemade Saffron Noodles were any less exemplary, a confit of Lamb Shoulder joining sundried tomatoes, black olives and an aromatic butter sauce with each bite offering a different melange of flavors that never grew dull.

Impressed enough by savories to assume desserts would offer more of the same, suspicions were confirmed by a menu from which a &#34;one of each&#34; order would have been perfectly justified had the pizza not been so filling, and therefor limiting myself to just two options the theme of balance was once again noteworthy, neither the crisp nor the cake overly sweet despite the combination of fresh fruits and ice cream, the former particularly memorable for the toasty almond topping while the cake was the definition of moist, chock-a-block full of fibrous shredded fruit."

I tried the blue cheese soufflé and carrot fritters. The soufflé was light without the taste of blue cheese that I expected and would have welcomed. The beets were a good addition, but I would have like more of them. 

Three carrot fritters were served with whipped feta, pickled beets, and pistachios with a beet vinaigrette. Lovely intense flavors! Pickled beets contrasted with salty feta was great! Although I added extra feta as there was just a small drizzle initially."

The food is... good. My expectations happily weren&#39;t sky high based off reviews. First off, they were out of the mussels and the chicken - the 2 things I really wanted. I understand maybe being out of the mussels because you can&#39;t predict whether or not it will be popular but are you really going to run out of chicken?? On a Saturday night? Seems a little ridiculous. My husband got the last pork loin and I was happy he did. It was a proper sized piece of meat and flavored very well. It was slightly overcooked but still very enjoyable. The problem was what it was served with. It came with a small amount of sauteed apples and it was on a very flat, dry, sweet potato pancake. The whole plate was just rather dry. 

The pumpkin ravioli appetizer was really excellent. It was just a fabulous bite. If it&#39;s on the menu, I recommend it. We also got the blue cheese souffle - now, temper your expectations. It is REALLY TINY. It was good but nothing to be blown away by. It was a little eggy. The beets and candied walnuts were a good complement though. I love a good beet. 

Because they had run out of the mussels, the waiter brought out an appetizer on the house - very sweet of him. It was the watermelon and radish carpaccio. Suffice it to say that we only enjoyed it because it was free. Still, it was very lovely of the waiter who was truly delightful all evening. 

The tilefish was very good. Perfectly cooked and swimming in a savory chorizo broth. It came with a spicy aioli that was very good but overpowered the fish a little bit. It&#39;s a very meaty fish but it wasn&#39;t really able to stand up to all the flavors that were bombarding it. Still, a good plate. 

I got the vegetarian dish because I always think that the quality of a vegetarian dish in restaurants like this truly speaks to the chef&#39;s creativity and ability. It was a squash and spinach gratin and I think the word gratin may be used loosely. It was good but a very small portion for a vegetarian dish. Come on guys, it costs like NOTHING to make this dish - at least make it a little substantive. I finished it in minutes and I am a very small person who already had 2 beers waiting for our table. 

My friend ordered the lamb shoulder confit and while I did not try it, the table concluded that it was a very successful dish. It was also a proper sized portion. 

Overall, it&#39;s rather pricey - we walked out wondering how we had spent what we did for the amount of food we got. I won&#39;t gripe about the price because I definitely want to encourage restaurants to follow a farm to table model. Still, it&#39;s not a great value. I doubt we&#39;ll return but that&#39;s mostly because I refuse to wait for a table anywhere."

To start, the appetizers were amazing, and I would be amiss if I didn&#39;t mention how good they were.  Goat cheese and honey soufflé was like nothing I&#39;ve ever tasted, but it was downhill from there.  Entree was very bland. Dessert missed the mark.  So what if it is farm fresh, organic, whatever.  For the price, I want it to taste good too.

Perhaps I am in an minority in hipsterville (read: denver) I can&#39;t stand it when restaurants place so many adjectives placed before their dishes that have nothing to do with how they taste (farm-to-table, organic, sustainably sourced, etc), and this place falls into that trap.  

My group also didn&#39;t feel like we were welcome.  Snarky comments by our waitress and weird looks from other diners made us feel like we missed a memo that everyone needed to look like they just came from the country club."

potager-denver,Melissa N.,JX4iEzZmjUdNOjTKN3B_Bg,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,0,9,9UFhHItFlTe0PSC8YyejOQ,5.0,2016-10-27,"This is the best restaurant in Denver, full stop. When my partner &amp; I are feeling a romantic dinner out, we always want to try a new spot, but keep returning to Potager. Their wine list is fantastic and if the waiter can&#39;t make a solid recommendation, they will check with the bartender for one. Our most recent visit, we got a really good wine rec to try out a California Zinfandel that we never would have even looked at otherwise. 

But the food. The FOOD! That&#39;s why you come to Potager. We had roasted grapes (YES) with a squash &amp; yogurt sauce topped with a goat cheese &amp; a balsamic reduction. It was revelatory. Straight into top 5 dishes I have ever had, and it was so simple! And the potato gnocchi with apple sauce (not applesauce, but kind of like applesauce) and a cider gastrique .... dude. Heaven is inside of a pillowy gnocchi. LOTS of butter. This place takes it&#39;s food very, VERY seriously, and it shows.

Will you wait for a table? Probably, because it&#39;s not like this is a special secret. Folks know about this place. Are the portions huge? I think they&#39;re totally reasonable (I&#39;d easily fill up on one entree alone) but don&#39;t expect to order a small plate to munch on and be full, because that&#39;s not what they are for. Does it still deserve five stars? HECK YES. The people leaving bad reviews aren&#39;t coming here for what Potager does. DO NOT GO TO POTAGER IF: you aren&#39;t willing to wait for a table or you need hypercourteous squeaky-smiling handholding from your waiter / host; you aren&#39;t an adventurous eater; you NEED meat to be the centerpiece of every dish you eat; you are the kind of person who always modifies their food from what&#39;s listed on the menu; you are afraid of butter; you are afraid of fat on your meat (cmon now); you aren&#39;t willing to pay a premium for high-quality local produce &amp; humanely raised meats; or you require enormous Applebees-sized portions. No judgement, but you will not enjoy yourself. This is not a restaurant that makes concessions; there is no hamburger &amp; fries for your picky kid and there are no well-done steak tips for your grandma. And that&#39;s exactly what I love about it."

     Period. 
     Go see Jacob, or Anthony, or any of the other impeccable staff, because they get it. The food is always fresh, uniquely prepared and beautifully presented. Everything is delicious. The room is an improvised wreck, the warmth and lighting so welcoming and inviting. The garden patio is its own world. This is an elegant and stylish destination spot with neighborhood couples on date night, office people, and singles grabbing dinner at the bar. I don&#39;t afford dining this way often, so when I do, this is where I go because I know I will love it.

It has a great reputation but I Ieft scratching my head and wondering why.  The no reservation policy and the lack of a full liquor license were the first two things that irked me.  Had the food been good, those two things could have easily been overlooked.  After waiting for nearly 45 minutes on a wednesday night, we ordered apps, entrees and desserts.  The menu was creative, but the food was not good.  Some dishes were cold, one was overcooked, one was under seasoned and the portion sizes were oh so small.  To make it all worse, the service was snooty and rushed.  This place is merely resting on its laurels at this point.  There is MUCH better dining to be had in Denver."

Their food is as inventive as it is delicious. I&#39;ve yet to order something that was anything less than spectacular. The beer and wine list is phenomenal as well.

My absolute favorite thing about this place is the service, though. I&#39;ve never met a staff that seems so happy and fulfilled. They&#39;re friendly and talkative, caring and happy to offer advice and recommendations. Once, on a slow night, our server stood and talked to us for ten-or-so minutes about Harmonica lessons that my girlfriend was taking. They give a crap and you can tell.

Don&#39;t be scared by the price. This place is worth every penny. Give it a shot: I promise you won&#39;t regret it."

Potager does not take reservations. I&#39;m not a huge fan of this, but I understand some diners don&#39;t respect their part of the obligation and tables can go unused. In any case, Saturday evening a party of 4 was able to walk in with no wait around 6:30. That was great.

Service was exceptional. The staff understood and described the food and wine menus very well. They were also attentive throughout dinner service. I would put Potager service up in the same class as Barolo and Fruition. Flawless without being fussy.

The food menu changes monthly, so your individual dishes will certainly vary. Cherries were featured all over the June menu. If that ingredient is any indication, the kitchen knows how to make seasonal ingredients shine. Our table had fish, pork, lamb and a pizza. All were expertly crafted dishes. One unexpected highlight of the meal was the roasted radish appetizer, served simply with softened, salted butter. Great ingredients don&#39;t need smoke and mirrors, Potager understands this.

With exposed ceilings and a concrete floor, the ambiance is certainly boisterous, bordering loud at times; but you cannot help catch the staff&#39;s excitement for the food coming out of the kitchen. Truly first rate."

It feels like a cozy home with a warm lounge area with overstuffed chairs, and a moderate size dining room dimly lit offering a romantic atmosphere.  Potager offers a highly seasonal menu that changes every month.  

I keep coming back more and more frequently to try all the new creations coming out of the phenomenal kitchen.  I&#39;ve had some truly innovative and tasty dishes at Potager including scallops with a ginger rice cake, homemade noodles with pulled pork, oysters with homemade kimchee, trout with pan roasted radish, beef tartar with capers and pickled mushrooms, ravioli with a kale pesto, and buttermilk gnocchi with hazelnuts and a warm cider reduction.  

I&#39;ve saved the best for last...

There is one mandatory requirement when dining at Potager - you must have the soufflé.  No need to look at the menu, sit down and tell your server that you would like the soufflé.  There is always a seasonal soufflé on the menu and it&#39;s by far my favorite thing to order when dining here.  The two soufflés I continue to dream about are:

Lemon, Parmesan, and quinoa soufflé with shaved fennel

Cheddar and quinoa soufflé, with currants, apples, and walnuts

Are you drooling yet?  You should be!

The service is friendly and the entire staff is well educated on the entire menu so feel free to ask all the questions you like.  They offer beer and wine only; I highly recommend a wine flight or a bottle of wine to share.

Potager is the neighborhood restaurant I crave on date night, special occasions, or a quick stop for the seasonal soufflé and a glass of wine.  I instantly feel relaxed and happy when I walk in Potager and the food takes me over the top and I walk out with wonderful memories of magical evenings to remember."

A simple serving of Cure Farm Pumpkin Ravioli followed reminding us this was a Fall menu.  Our surprise this evening was the Radish &amp; Beet Carpaccio!  An awesome salad of razor thin sliced radish &amp; beets, dressed in a lemon accented dressing with walnuts &amp; chèvre!  Lastly were the carrot fritters accompanied by the Lamb Confit.  Truly a luxurious taste, rich with velvet goodness of lamb cooked low &amp; slow in duck fat.

We visited Denver this time last year and ate there having a fantastic meal, so when I had the good fortune to accompany him to Denver again this year, I was dreaming about our return to this wonderful restaurant.

And, I was not let down. My lamb was great, husband&#39;s fish was great and the rhubarb ice cream and rhubarb tart( yes, we ate two desserts) was fantastic. The whole way  back to our hotel was discussion about the fantastic dessert and how rhubarb is such an under appreciated vegetable. 

What keep me from giving them five stars? Only one criticism: their portions  are a bit too small. My husband&#39;s fish was about six bites and for the price, it should have been bigger. My lamb was borderline,
 too small. 

Increase the portions and Potager would be a five star restaurant but this certainly won&#39;t keep me from coming back next year if I am lucky enough to be able to do so!"

The concept is so unique, changing the menu every 4 weeks to ensure everything they have is in season &amp; delicious. Our dinner items were delicious, I had the pork and the mango sauce on top was so perfect! My boyfriend had the steak and it was okay, my mom had the chicken and it was pretty good as well. The mussels were good but nothing crazy. The thing holding me back for the most part was the service. I don&#39;t know if she had too many tables, but she was incredibly slow. She kept apologizing for continuously getting side tracked and would say &#34;ok I promise I&#39;ll be better this time&#34; and then would take forever once again. It took her 15 minutes to bring us our bottle of wine. Even before that she hadn&#39;t greeted us nor taken our drink order for 10 minutes. She was way too relaxed about how slow she was. The table behind us had the same problem &amp; even said &#34;wish us luck&#34; when we left. Although the food was good, this was just too much of an annoyance to keep us coming back."

Amazing!  We went the other night and were told it was the first night of their brand new seasonal menu.  Our server was very nice and knew the menu well.  We ordered the mussels as an appetizer and they were extremely fresh and delicious.  We also paired the mussels, and all our other dishes, with their recommended wines and they all paired perfectly.

For entrees we shared the pork shoulder and chicken mole, which both had generous portions and were also amazing.  The pork shoulder was moist and flavorful.  

We split the bread pudding for dessert which was interesting.  The bread pudding itself wasn&#39;t too sweet but it was topped with candied nuts, which gave a burst of sweetness when eaten with the cake and whipped topping.

This place is amazing and you can tell it is run by a passionate and inventive chef.  The detour is beautiful too."

Now, normally I&#39;d give a restaurant with the kind of food Potager serves at least three stars, but because of the poor value, it ended up with two.   

We went recently with a party of three.  Our meal consisted of a shared mussel hors d&#39;oevre, followed by entrees.  One of us had a grass-fed burger and beer special, another a smoked pork chop, and the third a roasted cod entree.  The flavor on the pork chop, with its dressing of roasted vegetables was amazing, but the corn pancake that it sat on only detracted.  Amazingly the pancake sat directly under the chop, and that was all that was on the plate.  The chop was like an oasis in a desert and though a hearty chunk of meat it needed accompanyment.  In particular some stewed greens or the fried green tomatoes that were on the small plate menu would have been great.  So, after paying $26 for a single chop and only the chop, I felt cheated.     My mother in law, next to me, had the cod.  She liked it but complained that it needed more flavor.  I tasted the sauce and have to agree.  Cod needs either to be fried or put in hearty sauce or compote.  It wasn&#39;t.  At $29 with only the code and a little dressing, it too was a terrible value.  A dish, not an entree.   Lastly my partner had the burger with beer.  The beer was fine, but the burger was one-noted in its flavor and had a sauce on it that tasted identical to the tomato soup that was beside it on the plate.  He asked for real tomato, onion, and lettuce to dress up the burger but was told they were out of lettuce and tomato.  At $16, even given the inflated prices for burgers in Denver since they seem to be often mistaken for &#39;haute cuisine&#39; here, it was still overpriced.

All this was accompanied with slow service and slow production from the kitchen; the restaurant was only half full.

The conclusion: flashes of brilliance, but overall the value is terrible.  In fact, the small-plates with veggie dishes that are usually very imaginative, should be on the plates with the entrees.  Charging another $14 for a side that belongs with the entree seems craven.    

The meal for the three of us including a couple iced teas came to over $110.  And then there was the bill that had a place to tip the kitchen staff.   I didn&#39;t, because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to divide the tip up.   I assumed that Potager splits the front of the house tips with the kitchen, but maybe they don&#39;t.  I shouldn&#39;t have to worry about it, or about how much the staff make: get rid of tipping and pay a living wage and your customers will be more comfortable.  It works great in Europe, let&#39;s do it here, instead of guilt-tripping the customer into tipping double or worrying that her chef or prep cook is going hungry.   Sustainable food isn&#39;t really sustainable if the staffing isn&#39;t sustainable too."

It&#39;s a neighborhood restaurant in that it&#39;s perched in the middle of Cap Hill, and seems like the sort of place you stop by when you don&#39;t want to cook, but it&#39;s much more than that - an upscale, very well prepared and seasonal restaurant.  It is friendly to both solo diners, with a huge bar that is in the middle of the dining room, as well as couples or more, with huge windows overlooking the neighborhood.  They are very wine focused and work on pairing their food with wines, but for what could be a pretentious place, has very reasonable prices and good service.

The only problems were that they do not take reservations, making a weekend visit somewhat impractical at times.  The other was an odd tipping system in which you can tip both the server and the back kitchen staff, which makes it very unclear how much is being taken from either one or if it&#39;s additive.  Even the staff had trouble explaining that system.

But in terms of a great neighborhood restaurant, somewhat in the vein of other similar places like Atticus and Tables, this is a very good choice."

I was not impressed by the food. I had the steak, which was excellent, but smothered in fried onions. Why smothering something that is so good with that? The gratin on the side was not cooked enough and did not have that much flavor to it.
My friend took the special of the rabbit. It was like patties and all your could taste was the mushiness of something, and never the rabbit.
The portions of salads are less than small, yet have the price of a regular dinner salad.
Overall, I think their price do not reflect the taste of their food."

The servers are knowledgeable and passionate about the menu and local food they serve - and the food tastes great!  BUT... I was here the other night and had an off-putting experience which just... frustrated me.  I was there with a good friend - both of us prefer quieter spaces and the dining area was very busy - there were some tables up where the bar was that seemed quaint and a bit quieter or out of the super busy area - I asked the host who also seemed to be the manager of some sort - if we could just order an appetizer and some drinks from the bar and sit in that area since I knew they didn&#39;t have a dedicated server there... he said absolutely.  But when it came down to ordering an appetizer, I walked up to the bar to order, and the bartender said no.  Everyone sitting at the bar had ordered food... so it seemed odd that I couldn&#39;t order and just walk it to the table 3 feet away myself.  On top of that - they served a table right next to us with food even though they had sat down after we had.  It felt really wrong and left a bad taste in my mouth as though we were being pushed out - like they just didn&#39;t want to serve US.  I&#39;m not the person to say something when I feel uncomfortable especially in a crowded busy place... so Yelp it is.  I was mostly sad because I really do love this place, and was disheartened that I felt so pushed aside and as if my business wasn&#39;t wanted but other&#39;s was... which is a sad feeling to leave a place with."

The Food!  - Innovative, tasty and decent sized portions
Service - Friendly (when you could get her attention)
Prices - Reasonable for this caliber of space and food

Negatives
No reservations.  Although we arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday eve and were 
seated in about 10 minutes.  
Service.  Not the best attention, but when you got it, it was great
Parking - Parking in this area is impossible!  I may not go back only because it took SO LONG to find parking.

Not because there was anything wrong with it at all, but rather because the food isn&#39;t my kind of food. It probably is a 4 star place for most people.

The place was very clean, and the decor very nice, and service was both prompt and incredibly friendly. 

The food is a lot of farm to table, local sourced, organic fruits and vegetables and grass fed beef type foods. We started with a pizza, which had amazing crust, but I didn&#39;t really like the toppings. It had no sauce, and a lot of fruits and veggies. Wasn&#39;t especially tasty. My main was a grass fed steak, which was perfectly cooked, but otherwise nothing special. I genuinely think I enjoyed the cherry tomatoes more, which were some of the sweetest tasting tomatoes I&#39;ve ever had. My co-workers had pulled pork on corn pancakes which tasted ok, but I&#39;ve made better pulled pork myself.

Dessert was probably the highlight, I had creme brulee which was very good. Once again, absolutely nothing wrong with the place, quality ingredients, just not my type of menu. Nothing &#34;jumped out at me&#34;. Service was excellent. I encourage you to try it if the menu appeals."

Potager&#39;s interior isn&#39;t something to write home about, but its raw aesthetic is surely a reflection of the philosophies its built on. That is, true food comes first, the decor only should complement such a fine offering."

Most of the food is served tapas style, with some entrees available as well. It is remarkably easy to drop a big load of cash here, especially if you like wine.

Menu selections are always seasonal. My first visit in March featured nice radishes and peas. My second visit in July featured cherry soup. Yes, cherry soup! It was good!

Judging by the reviews, I guess they have an off night every now and then, but for me, Potager was an awesome farm-to-table experience. The staff was understanding and very kind about accommodating my food sensitivities."

The menu changes quite frequently with what is in season, or what the local farmers have. You will not be disappointed. This place is great for girls night, date night or to take friends from out of town. The last time I went I ordered the braised lamb shank and the goat cheese souffle with beet oil.

I told the server it was my first time at Potager. She was extremely friendly, pleasant, polished and knowledgeable. 

1. ATMOSPHERE = trendy, fun, great vibe

2. SERVICE = not worth a 20% tip (we had to walk over to our server to get her to give us more bread after waiting 15 minutes...on a midweek evening). 

3. FOOD PORTIONS = you&#39;ll need to order A LOT in order to feel full. Despite all the raving the server did about the halibut (which was NOT my first choice), she did nothing to explain the portion size.

4. PRICE = over priced, under delivered (my filet of halibut was smaller than a 3x5 card) and cost $29. The most reasonably priced item on the menu was dessert. Our overall bill was $75 and I left hungry. 

5. MENU = No distinction between appetizers and entres on the menu. So it&#39;s hard to decipher what to order based on how hungry you are. My server finally clarified that 3/4 of the menu were appetizer...which she also said were very small in portion size. 

Can an individual person dine at Potager and feel full on under $60? Not unless they&#39;re accustomed to eating the food portion for a 3 yr old child. 

...based on the extremely small yet over priced portion of halibut I received, I can only guess the appetizers and salads were infinitesimally small. 

6. QUALITY OF FOOD = I ordered the halibut which my server raved about in detail. It was average at best, not filling, hardly had any flavor and was smaller than a 3x5 index card. You pay for the &#34;quality&#34;. Yes, it&#39;s home grown, yes its healthy, yes its fished in Colorado, yadda yadda...and yes, you&#39;ll be spending your entire pay check quite easily if you&#39;re not careful. 

Honestly, I won&#39;t be going back because honestly, there&#39;s better food at better prices in Denver that&#39;s just as healthy."

I recently went to dinner here with a friend of mine. We went by on a Sunday night and arrived right at 5:30 (when they open) to a pretty long line of people. We were easily seated though while not everyone was quite as lucky and there was certainly a good wait once we were seated (they do not take reservations).

We started with small plates - the pork sausage and apples and the pumpkin ravioli. Both were incredibly delicious and perfect for two people to split. I seriously could have eaten another 1 or two of the sausages :) The menu rotates every 3-4 weeks we were informed by our server, so not sure how long those will last on the menu but definitely worth trying if you are lucky enough to have the option. 

For dinner, I had the wood fired chicken served over polenta and my friend had the lamb shoulder served over chard gratin. While my chicken was just divine, I did not care for the polenta but that is not Potager&#39;s fault - it was a texture issue for me however my friend thought it was delicious. Her lamb was very good and tender but neither of us are a huge fan of chard and the gratin was greatly lacking - as in, there really was no cheese at all which I think would have helped her at least attempt to eat it. 

For dessert, we had the apple tarte tatin and applebutter spiced buttermilk cake. While the tarte was very good, the buttermilk cake was a bit dry which was surprising as buttermilk to me implies that it would be moist. That was about the only negative to our meal. 

I definitely look forward to returning in the future when the menu changes as I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here."

However, I&#39;m not the most adventurous eater and I found an appetiser and entree that I loved. The best part of dining here was the service. My boyfriend and I went here on a special night out. Our waitress didn&#39;t talk down to us (even though we didn&#39;t know what some of the foods and wines were). She was extremely helpful and made us totally at ease. She also assisted us with our selections which was much appreciated. 

The second best part is the food. It&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s the little details that separates this restaurant from others. Even the butter served with the bread was better! It tasted fresh churned and unlike anything I&#39;ve had before. There is a rotating menu so I would suggest checking it out before you go as it changes with the season. 

Lastly, I love this concept. I love that they do farm to table right and support these local, Colorado ranches, farms, and business."

I am so glad I ran into this restaurant because it is amazing!

The atmosphere is relaxing and cozy. They do not take reservations so be mindful of what night of the week you are coming here as you can find yourself waiting for a table for up to an hour according to our waitress. 

The wine list is extensive so you won&#39;t have an issue pairing your food. It is also worth mentioning that this place gets almost all of its food locally so the veggies are seasonal and thus, the menu changes every 4 weeks. 

We split a bottle of rose pinot, bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer, soy glazed pork belly and a lamb cassoulet. I honestly can&#39;t find anything bad to say about any of the food. I never tried bacon wrapped dates and if you haven&#39;t either...they are delicious. The pork belly came on a bed of apple slices dipped in cinnamon I think. It was a very good mix of flavors. The cassoulet was served with white beans and ham slices all mixed together. None of the food we ordered came with starch which I find refreshing and a good step away from the standard practice in America where the restaurant will pour on the starch to make your serving of food look bigger while holding back on veggies and meats. 

A great dining experience, fantastic food, excellent ambiance. Highly recommended."

I came in for a date night with my gf. Everything we had was delicious. The attention to detail was great.  Even the butter that came with the bread was top-notch. The dishes here are deceptively simple and really showcase the natural flavor of the seasonal ingredients rather than simply overloading with garlic or butter.  The souffle we split was decadent.  My chicken dish was perfectly cooked--crispy skin, tender juicy meat--and the pan sauce was great.  My gf&#39;s lamb ragu was hearty and really captured the subtle flavors that make lamb so special. The fresh pasta was well made and perfectly al dente.

The service was equally good.  Sometimes a small upscale place like this can be pretentious, particularly if you are a younger looking diner or do not know your way around the wine list. That was not my experience at Potager.  The server made this a special night.  She was attentive, genuine, knew the menu inside and out, and I got the feeling she could have tactfully handled even the stupidest question about wines or ingredients without making the diner feel awkward."
potager-denver,Chill V.,mwVkf9IS7-wCjc9Po9QYYQ,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,15,4,6832Yua1wCz1l3kPwWpATg,1.0,2013-11-30,"So here we are 2+ years after my Yelping no more &#34;chances&#34; for Potager.
Recently though a friend asked me to dinner there yet after hesitation and fond recollection of my (now too distant) memories of heavenly food comas under the spell of the old Potager, I agreed.

Fast forward to the day after--this place has slipped beyond beyond--and still arrogantly attempting to cling to the multiple stars it held for so long.   However now there are way too many five star places in Denver to deal with this obvious &#34;deathwatch&#34; scene.
It was not crowded on a Thurs. night...probably in part thanks to Yelpers and bloggers posting honest reviews of this continued nonsense.

This final Potager meal was hands down the most over priced, under flavored, smallest portioned, mediocre food experience I&#39;ve had since...ah yes, my previous visit here in 2011.

The best thing we had between us were 2 small plates of simple sautéed greens
(which I know well as I make them at home using organic Super Greens, a touch of garlic and sea salt--almost identical).
Only problem-- here at Potager this small plate is $9.00. 
Yes you read correctly $9.00 each!  I have paid $8.00 in NYC for amazing greens but seriously, this is Denver and these were not amazing.  In my opinion, a $7.00 price tag would be bold here.

We also ordered gnocchi which used to be one of the most heavenly items on the anticipated seasonal menus but this batch tasted like flavorless white playdough--toothy, squishy balls of dough, that&#39;s it.  Not even prepared correctly, as many know there is a fine line with gnocchi-this offering was too thick and seriously lacking any flavor.  Another major disappointment.

I ordered soup that arrived lukewarm and so horribly bitter and off-tasting that I sent it back.  Our server was gracious yet we could tell this had happened more than not.  It was returned to me with a lot of salt added yet still very sour and bitter-obviously the squash was off-impossible to actually &#34;fix&#34; so it was returned again.  I could see the owner tasting the soup and glaring at our table-nice.  No apology, just the glare. (the truth is not as bitter as that soup or her obvious increased lack of attention to details in Potagers once glory-filled kitchen. It would not surprise me if she is getting ready to sell)

My friend had the fish which she said was &#34;ok&#34; and generously donated a third of because I had nothing in front of me as the kitchen struggled to &#34;fix&#34; the soup.  The $29.00 fish was incredibly thin and mediocre and mind you I was very hungry at this point but after 2 bites, left it on the plate-dry and unappealing.

We also had the soufflé which was prepared beautifully yet tasted plain, milky and lacking overall flavor, like a budget soufflé.  lol-is there such a thing?!

Last but not least, our server raved about the spice cake dessert which we both found to be meh at best, also barely offering any actual REAL flavor.  It mimicked childhood memories of Betty Crocker imitation spice loaf with some canned icing thrown on top by a monkey. Worth $7.50?  No, not when you can buy the mix, a can o&#39;frosting and rent the monkey for less!

ONE HUNDRED plus dollars later (only one glass of wine between us--so mostly food charges) I was still hungry, and after splitting the bill, was left only with $60 less and another bad memory of this place. Completely UNACCEPTABLE and quite sad.

For many many YEARS Potager was THE destination, the can&#39;t stop talking about it, can&#39;t wait to go back night after night after night super special spot. No more.

As a once incredibly loyal fan who knows what you used-to-be capable of, I ask Potager to please return to it&#39;s ways of yore or for the love of all things culinary, hang it up--take the monkey and run."

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the intention of the chef to abstain from using fats as a point of health concern, but every dish we ordered seemed to be out of a weight watchers cook book. The lentils gratin (on special) completely lacked cheese or bread crumbs, which is the point of a gratin, and the fried egg on top was overcooked and disproportionate to the amount of lentils. The mushroom crepes were good, but forgettable and the creme fraiche seemed absent in the dish.  the pumpkin ravioli, however, was delicious - even though the pumpkin filling could have packed more flavor. 

The main course was really disappointing. Instead of the chef&#39;s cut of beef which they ran out of, they delivered pot roast that was severely overcooked and, again - had no fatty delicious juice to make the piece of meat the luxurious meal you want it to be (for 30 dollars).  

Service was good everyone was really nice and inviting. But all in all, If you want great new american cuisine in the same price bucket, I think there are much better options in Denver to check out. Sorry Potager! We really wanted to like it."

The ravioli were probably some of the best I have ever had.  Covered in apples, beets and crunchy pistachios I wished the portion was much larger.

First off, I think their staff is amazing. So friendly and knowledgeable. I won&#39;t comment on the food too much because it is always good and mostly GREAT. I dont know what it was last time but it was blander than usual and the mussels came out cold. 

The first time we ever ate their they had Monk fish on the menu. I&#39;m telling you, this was one of the best meals I have ever had. Fast forward to a week ago and they had sea bass on the menu. Ordered it and they were out but had monk fish in stock due to the transition of the menu going to happen in the next day or so. I could not eat the dish . . . I was pretty bummed. Went from my favorite ever to me not wanting to take a 3rd bite. 

Off night perhaps, switching from Bass to Monk? Who knows. I will eat there again because I love the atmosphere, the fairly priced decent wine (they always have a bottle for $32 on the menu) and the food is usually to die for."

Potager is the complete picture: from the farmers and ranchers that they get their meat and produce from, to the staff that cares.  You simply CAN NOT beat a better restaurant!!!

Price - pricey, but SO worth it! Go for a special occasion, we do.  

Atmosphere - wonderful!  fancy, but not fancy (go see for yourself). I LOVE the way the kitchen &#34;flows&#34; into the dining area. The patio is a MUST when the weather is nice. I live in the neighborhood, and I never knew the patio was even there! Go see for yourself.

Menu - EXCELLENT!!!!  I CAN&#39;T say more!
It changes monthly, or at least seasonally.    I read other reviews and yes, the portions are smaller, but who needs HUGE portions today. The food is prepared so you actually &#34;taste&#34; the seasonings, and can appreciate the time and effort that went into actually preparing the food, and finally getting it to you. This is NOT a restaurant for those that think Chili&#39;s (or similiar restaurants) are the best there is out there. The meals are not mass produced. This restaurant is for the person who can truly appreciate everything that goes into preparing a fabulous meal.  

Bar - yes, although small, it isn&#39;t obtrusive either. It is not the first thing that you notice when you walk into the restaurant. 

Wait Staff - EXCELLENT!  Must admit, their entire staff is the best, no, the BEST that we have ever encountered! They are not in your face, but you know they are there, and they really CARE!!!

The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and they seem to truly enjoy their work place because they stick around for years. It is comforting to come back to a place 9 months later and have a waiter remember all the details of your previous meal - This happened to me recently at Potager. And then there is the food, which is soulful, simple, not overdone- just perfectly balanced in every way. I have been to Potager many times and every single time I order the cheese souffle, the mussels, and the chicken. Every seasonal variation of these is a hit.

How I never heard about this place until now is beyond me, but I can&#39;t wait to go back. Their menu is original and new, and it changes on a seasonal basis depending on what the local farms are producing. The chef that owns it actually runs it and creates the menu as well, which isn&#39;t always the case with chefs that become successful. I think the chef&#39;s presence is what makes this place so unique. It is not overbearing in its decor and keeps things simple but elegant at the same time. Additionally, we went on a Friday night and were immediately seated, another very pleasant surprise.

The service was phenomenal as well. Damita (spelling?) was our server, and she was incredibly knowledgeable, professional, friendly and prompt...everything one would hope for in a server. We were also greeted and helped by Nicole, another server who delivered our food at one point. Both ladies were spectacular, as I have no doubt the rest of the staff is as well (these girls really set the precedence!). 

It&#39;s always so fun to go to a new restaurant to taste a new menu, so to have found a restaurant that I can continue to go back to and know that I will find something new, original, playful AND delicious again and again while also supporting local farmers pleases me beyond belief.

Awesome decoration and the outdoor porch was super nice and great atmosphere. 

Not so much on the entree. maybe it was just on that day .. 
pork was too dry and beef was a bit too tough or over cooked as what i thought it would be. 
BUT They use great vegetables. 
I would definitely go back.

Parking could be tricky so you need to go around to find a spot!"

My friend took me here for a quick bite. 

We waited 15 mins for a seat at the bar and ordered the gnocchi. WOW! I could eat that everyday. It literally melts in your mouth! And the fig and cheese are just that extra something that makes the dish FABULOUS!

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I ordered a Parmesan risotto, which I expected to be creamy and cheesy, but instead it was very bland and watery. I let the server know and fortunately she took it back and let us get something different. She suggested a pork dish that was double the price and while it was better than the risotto, it was kind of chewy and not worth the $28. There are far better restaurants in Denver to visit than is one, especially at the high end price."

Really like the setting, rustic, warm, and inviting with an organic farm fresh to table approach. Had the Pesto with garden tomatoes - very flavorful dish. Others had the Lobster and the Zucchini &#34;noodles&#34; small plate. Lamb meatballs also got the thumbs up as unique and tasty. Wines were good, with a bent toward French. Finished up with a chocolate torte and pudding.

Service was friendly and pleasant, but our waiter clearly had too many tables as he wasn&#39;t able give us the attention I would have expected. Portions were definitely on the small side and prices were a bit more than would have expected...$100 for 4 of us and we split!

After reading some reviews, I went to Fruition instead (don&#39;t get me started on how awesome Fruition is). Earlier this month, I decided to give Potager a shot.

My partner and I walked in and some woman who I guess was the hostess walked up to us and just stared...didn&#39;t say &#39;Hi&#34;, didn&#39;t welcome us, nothing....so we said &#34;2 please&#34; and still just said &#39;Okay&#39; and walked us to our table.....I asked if they had a gluten free menu and she simply said &#34;Your waitress will do that&#34; and left. Right off the bat we both thought what the hell did we do to be treated like turds?

After browsing the menu, our waitress came over and was so awesome. I wish I could give her 5 stars. She was great. So helpful with the gluten free options, made suggestions, answered all our questions, she was great. 

We each ordered an appetizer and an entree.

To start I had the gnocchi and he had the squash soup....If the chef would&#39;ve told me he tasted the dishes before they went out I would&#39;ve laughed in his face. My gnocchi tasted like....like....well nothing, just dough. And the curry squash soup was basically orange curry puree. The soup was so overpowering with curry. I don&#39;t even think there was squash in there. And my gnocchi were basically dough balls with some apple slices on the plate. Terrible.

For our entrees we had the haddock and pork belly. The only reason this rating is 2 stars is the pork. I love pork, and this didn&#39;t disappoint. I don&#39;t know why they call the cabbage a gratin because it definitely is not a gratin. The few bites I had of the haddock were very meh...

I hope to go back and give it another shot, but I was definitely turned off by the hostess and lack of seasoning on most dishes. It&#39;s a shame the wait staff is so amazing when the management doesn&#39;t seem to be focusing on the big picture. For the prices they charge, I felt ripped off."

The menu changes seasonally and everything is good, so no specific examples are needed to give it a great review!  Whether it&#39;s the fish, fresh pasta with spring vegetables, chicken, pork, apps or desserts, the food is always fresh and simple yet refined.  And don&#39;t forget to save room for dessert!  The wine and beer selection is great.  The overall ambience (especially the adorable, outdoor, vine-covered patio) feels like a little bit of farm right in the city.

The decor was beautiful and the outside patio area, with its lush vegetation and lighting, is like heaven!  However, our appetizers and entrees were just okay.  Little flavor overall.  Also our server did not engage with us at all.  She rarely checked on us, was aloof, and (like others have pointed out) just seemed like we were annoying her :(   On the other hand, one of the bartenders was very sweet and helpful and my chocolate, cherry, hazelnut cream pie was very delicious!!

There are so many mixed reviews here on yelp (including mine!) that I would give this place another try, but Denver has so many other wonderful restaurants it seems unlikely.  The one exception to my not returning would be to have another chocolate cream pie, if I could take it to go!"

goat cheese ravioli
potato cheese soup
potato pancake with duck
grilled shrimp
blue cheese souffle

Of all the above dishes, the blue cheese souffle was the best. But, overall, the food was ok. It was on the bland side, and I usually like my food to be very flavorful. 

I sat at the bar, and Jerry (who&#39;s the manager and wine buyer) was very nice. He introduced us to some nice new wines.

We did have to sit at the bar, and I don&#39;t remember what we had, but the food was good and the service was also.  Being a veggie, I don&#39;t always expect a lot of choices, but there were enough to satisfy.  The atmosphere was pleasant and it was an overall win.

Fast forward to Saturday.  My GF and I stopped by on our way to Romeo &amp; Juliet.  Again, no expectations, but we did find a couple chairs at the bar, so that seemed like good fortune... wrong.  Unlike last time (but unfortunately similar to some other Yelper&#39;s experiences) service was poor.  The menu changed, and there were less choices for me.  I asked if they could make a dish without bacon and the bartender said yes.  We ordered some wine too and were excited.  A minute later the bartender came back and explained that bacon was cooked into the sauce, and my request could not be accommodated.  At that point, we may as well have been dead to her, because that&#39;s where her helpfulness ended.  I received no alternate suggestions, so I asked her what veggie options I had.  She said: &#34;I&#39;ll have to look,&#34; and proceeded to walk to the end of the bar and fix drinks for another customer.  WTF???

She may as well have said: &#34;Go F yourself.&#34;  Wow.  Also, it&#39;s not like I was the first vegetarian to ever enter their hallowed door.  From reading the reviews, and my own experience, this place is really hit or miss.  At that point, I knew our time here was done, so we decided to leave.  I gave two stars because my first dinner was good, but my second try confirmed there will not be a third."

This week I&#39;m happy to say I&#39;ve accomplished that goal.

My night at Potager started off with a delightfully bubbling rose and it only got better. My boyfriend and I sat outside on the charming patio after a small wait. We ate bread and goat cheese ravioli and risotto cakes and mahi-mahi and pork and a mix of vegetables and ended it with coffee and a grown-up version of strawberry shortcake. All of it on the menu because it was in season.

Yes, this is a seasonal menu and our server told us the one we had will only be around until the end of June. No doubt it&#39;ll be replaced by something equally fresh and delicious. And no doubt that I&#39;ll be back to try it again."

My dad still raves about mussels that we had there years ago, they were a special and will never be made again but the memory is enough. 
The greatest things about Potager is that they aren&#39;t trying to be the next big thing - they are just making good food for people who can find it. They don&#39;t participate in restaurant week, they close for the holidays and a bit in the summer, they don&#39;t advertise at all.

From the outside, it appears to be a bit rough around the edges.  It is directly across the street from a local dive bar, and shares a parking lot with a (cough) dispensary (cough).  I would think with those neighbors, that they would be busy, but they were not.
Walking through the door you can tell immediately that this is not the best decorated restaurant, but I care more about food than decor, so I sat.  The server was so polite when she brought some wonderfully fragrant jasmine tea, that my worries faded away.  In fact, the service was spectacular.
I ordered the combination noodle bowl, and beef pho.  The flavor of the noodle bowl was acceptable and the meat was cooked well.  The vegetables were fresh.  The noodles on the other hand were broken into tiny pieces.  This makes the chopsticks completely useless, and eating this dish with tiny shards of wet noodle flowing in all directions was much less pleasing.  The pho was a bit underwhelming as the broth was watery.
I may give the restaurant another try, but I think I will give it some time to develop (that&#39;s also good advice for whomever makes the pho)."

I also got 2 free egg rolls with my order of $15 or more. All in all, I was very happy with my order and I will be ordering again in the future."

However, the waitress was polite and quick to come to my table to give us water and take our order. 

I ordered their beef brisket pho and shrimp noodle bowl. The pho broth was very watery and did not have the depth of flavor a bowl of pho should have. The soup was also not very hot, it was bordering lukewarm. The shrimp noodle bowl came on a plate. The plate had noodles in the center, and the noodles came broken like the leftover noodles at the bottom of the pot. On top of that were a couple pieces of sauteed shrimp. They were well seasoned but WAY too salty. On the side was a small pile of shredded lettuce. Usually a noodle bowl comes in a bowl with more lettuce and veggies to mix and eat together.

Overall, the service was great, but the food was a great disappointment. If you&#39;re looking for authentic Asian food, I would skip on this restaurant."

Usually, there&#39;s always something more I might have ordered wherever I go.  This was in my mind when I went to Spicy Chili Pho yesterday for an early dinner.  Other Pho places have left me still hungry if I didn&#39;t order more than an entree.
 I hadn&#39;t eaten all day and was starving.  I&#39;m on a budget and so decided just to order a Pho dish and eat a sandwich when I got home. shortly, my server walks out with a bowl the size of Donald Trump&#39;s ego! A smaller plate of sprouts, lime, mint and peppers came beside it. I was STUFFED when I left. I did not need that sandwich!

The broth was tasty, and noodles were perfect. The suggestion I might have would be to put more meat, and less noodles in the bowl, and offer more vegetables on the side.  It only had a few pieces of meat, but enough noodles to fill even my appetite.  The veggie tray might be better with some carrots, greens, etc.
When my server came to collect my bowl, she said, &#34;Wow, you almost finish!&#34; Obviously, they&#39;re used to seeing their customers full and happy.
Nothing fancy here, no hoity-toity overhead, just a mom-and-pop serving good food.

Best of all, with drink and including my 20% tip, I paid less than $11! 

I&#39;ll definitely return, they have a full variety menu of Asian food from several different regions, i&#39;m hoping to try."

However if was not to be. The gal who server was nice enough. But the food was definitely not up to par. Broth was not very flavorful and appeared to be a bit too oily. Could even place it in a top 10 ranking even if I had to. Probably won&#39;t ever be back.

Coming from NYC I know my Pho! I was SHOCKED to learn they are more Chinese than Vietnamese or Thai BUT they are doing a great job! 

Meat for the rare steak was sliced right so it cooks in the soup (EXACTLY how it should be done!). Soup was not overly salty. Veggies were crisp and fresh and basil was served on the stick! I ordered extra veggies and it made three meals! 

I know this place has had a lot of bad reviews and I&#39;m truly not sure why. We have never been let down! They del. super fast also and are very kind! 

Never had bad meat, limp veggies, or mushy noodles and have always had wonderful service! 

Oh, and during the week kids eat free if you dine in! (at least ours always have lol)

My hubby has also had their more &#34;Chinese&#34; dishes and found them not overly sweet and great tasting.

They were not del. in the spring blizzard (completely understandable) and the owner was so apologetic and truly felt bad. I give her a LOT of credit for not endangering her employees by having them drive in those conditions also!

Again, not the best you will find but for 9 bucks and in Colorado I think it&#39;s WONDERFUL!"

We had the chicken satay, chicken lettuce wraps, tom yum soup, and thai chili fish.  The tom yum soup only had tomatoes, onions, and shrimp, but the shrimp was sweet and the broth was the right taste.  The thai chili fish was well flavored, sweet and mildly spicy.  I&#39;m having a great time sampling everything.

Recently we ordered their takeout for a group of 20.  The shrimp in their spring rolls had no taste, but, other than that, everyone enjoyed the different entrees."

There is just something about the depth of the broth that really seems to make the difference.  So Spicy Pho in East Central Aurora is average pho.  Sorry but it just is.  
Spicy Chili Pho also is more than a pho restaurant and looking over the menu it seems to hit all the marks on whatever take out craving you are having with regards to Chinese, Indian, and Vietnamese cuisine.  I especially liked seeing the vegetarian chicken on the menu.  Maybe that is a little unfair to poke fun and the grammatical error but hey I didn&#39;t write the menu.  
So if your having a huge pho craving you could come here or get delivery, I&#39;d say it is just ok."

We went for Lunch, and we were surprised to see how cheap their meals are. We both ordered curry; mine was Green Chicken curry and hers the Beef Panang curry. 

Lunch came with a salad for myself with some strange dressing. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of my salad, however my girlfriend ordered the Hot &amp; Sour soup, and was pleasantly surprised. She normally HATES tofu, and she loved the soup, as did I. 

Next, the waitress brought us a couple of egg rolls. They weren&#39;t very large, but they were delicious. They were also included in our lunch price, which made them all the tastier. 

Next came out lunches which included a bowl of steamed white rice. My green chicken curry was absolutely fantastic. Granted, I have had near zero experience with curry before, so perhaps I have not yet had better curry. But damn was it good. 

My girlfriend&#39;s beef Panang curry was also quite delicious. We both left feeling quite full and quite content. 

Lunch cost us less than 15, not including tip. That is quite a lot of food for not a whole lot of money. We were very impressed, and will definitely be back."

The staff was very eager to please and the food was good. Portion sizes are large. Soda comes in a can, which bothers some people but not me. The menu said the Thai curry fried rice had raisins in it but I could not find any. Still a great meal with the curry flavor but not much heat. If you&#39;re looking for spicy try the drunk noodles. Very spicy and very good. The only negative I experienced was that it took an incredibly long time to pay, but this is probably due to how new the restaurant is. I noticed help wanted signs and between the take outs, delivery and keeping up with the walk ins one waitress could not keep up with it all."

My car died and I had to order delivery again. Order was 25$ for 2 lunch specials- vegtable and shrimp and green curry as well as spring rolls and an avocado boba. Originally I asked for a red bean boba something I never tried, but they called back to say they were out and if I wanted another flavor, I asked if they had avocado because i didn&#39;t see it on the menu and the lady said yes. Well I got my avocado boba, the plus size was it was bigger then a normal cup, but it did not taste anything like an avocado boba and the boba was nasty and hard. Also the shrimp and vegetables were not even eaten because they did not taste good and had a weird smell. The curry was pretty decent, but it had all these ingredients that were not on the menu. This time they did include the egg rolls, but with the delivery the menu says it comes with a salad as well. If delivery does not offer that they should clarify it on their website online order tool. Also I noticed they call vegetables and chicked, vegetarian chicken which they probably should fix."

The only thing that was bad was that something may have burned in the kitchen earlier because they covered up the smoke smell with air freshener which got on the way of the scent of the yummy food.

The Panda Express across the street got my business that day.

It is UNACCEPTABLE for a business such as this to completely close down because of a few inches of snow in Colorado. Period.

**UPDATE** This location was closed yet again on Tuesday, 2/2/16. The roads at the time were clear and the parking lot was plowed. Once again, every single business in that shopping complex was open except this one. Once again, Panda Express got my money. I presume the franchise owner is unaware that this is going on behind their back, because a responsible business owner would not allow their managers to sabotage their budget like this. I hope they come across this review, as well as the others posted here of the same nature, and value the input of their customer base."

Unbelievable! You cannot own a restaurant in COLORADO and close every time there is some snow on the ground.

I saw 3 other cars drive away. I guess they don&#39;t need or want the business THAT bad.

In particular, this location is consistently the best CFA I&#39;ve ever gone to. I get better service here than at most sit down restaurants. Go during lunch and you&#39;re likely to run into Marsha, the nicest, friendliest restaurant employee I have ever met, and the rest of the staff rounds out the always pleasant experience.

They have the best fried chicken sandwiches pretty much in the history of ever. Yeah, the grilled ones are not so great, but that&#39;s not their speciality. You should only be eating here like once a month, anyway. You can afford the extra 150 calories for the good one.

Spend another 10 minutes on the elliptical or eat salad for dinner if it&#39;s that big of a deal to you.

For a bonus, eat inside -- you can laugh at the cheesy Christian music. Where else can you get awesome fried chicken sandwiches AND cheesy Christian music? Nowhere, just right here.

For a double bonus, the girls say, &#34;How can I serve you?&#34; and finish with &#34;My pleasure.&#34; It&#39;s completely fake and robotic, but that&#39;s part of the charm.

I think the spicy chicken sandwich is maybe even better than the regular one, but it lights a fire on my insides that doesn&#39;t go out pleasantly. All I&#39;m saying is don&#39;t eat that one on a road trip when you&#39;re in a van with 6 people.

I am not sure if someone is actually reading the monitor or they just don&#39;t care. This last time I received 1 out of the 3 correct. I received a grilled sandwich and a sugar free lemonade. I am one to call the store to advise of the error or simply park and walk in. No one should be ok with what they  get if it is not what you paid for. You paid for a service, you expect it. I am now on my third comp from this store and it should serve as a hint when the manager on duty says &#34;AGAIN!?!?!&#34; then regaining his composure. If there is one thing that I can say for Chick-fil-A is that they train their employees in hospitality. The use of the phrase &#34;my pleasure&#34; extends well beyond a your welcome.

Good things:

-- I&#39;m not much of a tequila lady, but the Coco Fuego makes me want to change my ways. Blanco tequlia, Teakoe Irie Island spice-infused coconut water, lime, and three pepper agave--so gooooood. 

-- The patio! Dos Santos is in a fun and busy part of town, so I love snagging a seat on the patio and people watching with my cocktail. 

Just okay things:

-- I love love love their idea for a guac trio with three creative guacs--fresh fruit with bacon, pumpkin seed with nopal and roasted tomatillos, and classic. Brilliant. But the taste never lives up to the presentation for me and is always a bit of a let down. It&#39;s good for photos I guess?

-- Service is definitely hit or miss. When they get busy, it can get really difficult to check in with your server or get a check. If you can swing it, I suggest starting your happy hour early at 3 or 4 pm to get great service (and because that seems like a good idea either way). 

-- Parking. It&#39;s a thing in Uptown. I&#39;m not sure if the lot around back is for Dos Santos, but I don&#39;t think it is, so I always find street parking to be safe."

I didn&#39;t feel like our server was out to really impress us by being attentive or overly friendly, but that being said, he DID mix a mean margarita!

Overall, it&#39;s a fun vibe, with strong drinks that go down easy and good tacos -- the porky was by far my favorite, but I&#39;d probably pass on the O.M.F.G. -- so we&#39;ll probably make our way back."

I&#39;ve been to Tacos Tequila Whiskey and Las Margs so this was next on the list! The experience had some ups and downs.

+ I called ahead to make a reservation for 3 of us, but they don&#39;t take reservations. The girl on the phone told me it would be fine if we came in around 7 that night (a Wednesday). Alas, the place is super tiny and it was majorly packed when we arrived. We got seated at a bar after much confusion between the hostess, waitress, and one of the managers (I&#39;m guessing). Like, they told us we could sit there at the bar, then we couldn&#39;t, then we could again. We didn&#39;t get seated at a table for over half an hour! Which is annoying when you&#39;re on a tight schedule and just want to have a comfortable meal with your family on a week night. I completely understand they were busy and they cannot help that, I just wish they would have conveyed a more realistic experience with me over the phone. 

+ The prices in my opinion are slightly higher than the restaurants around. The PLAIN guac was almost $10 for 4 tablespoons. Queeee? For three of us our dinner was over $100! Obviously, they get away with this though if their popularity is any indication. 

+The tacos themselves were truly the winners this night. I had the &#34;porky&#34; which was melt-in-ya-mouth goodness and one of the tostados on special that night served with tuna and a yummy sauce. So, the food here truly is something special. If this review was based solely on the food it would be five stars all the way! 

+Honorable mention goes to my spicy marg. When they say spicy they mean SPICY! Which I love :)"

The interior is quite small, but they sure do pack in people.  They also have an outdoor gated patio.  I would never think to bring kids here, but soo many young couple brought their kids from tiny toddlers to about 10.... I mean it,.... So many kids here.  I was shocked!

Anyhow, I was dying to try their guac.  Unfortunately I did not find it enjoyable.  Mostly because the chips that accompany it have a smoky spicy taste.  I did ask the server if plain chips were available, but to no avail.  I really felt these smoky chips ruined the experience of both the salsa and the guac.  Ended  up eating the rest of the guac with a fork.  =(    Honestly the guac wasn&#39;t the impressive either.   

All the yelp photos I had been checking out looked amazing.  


Order 4 tacos:  Tinga, Del Mar (fried shrimp), Porky, and Arrachera (steak).   

Del Mar = AMAZING!!!!  Nom Nom!  
Tinga =  the most disappointing
Porky = pretty good

In the future I want to try the O.M.F.G.: Raw tuna, lime cilantro aioli, pickled onion, avocado, cabbage, bib lettuce tortilla.  Wish I wasn&#39;t so stuffed from the other tacos."

I had a Tommy&#39;s House Margarita, served in a jar with sugar not salt :) very good and strong. Ordered the chips and salsa with a side of guacamole to start with. Not a fan of the chips, weird seasoning that was all over them.... very spicy and not in a good way. Unfortunately no plain chips here, to bad cause the salsa and guacamole are really good. 

Had to get the tacos, went with the Porky, Tinga and the Del Mar (shrimp) They were all very good and tasty but the Del Mar was so good we had to order another one and split it!!  So much flavor packed into this taco.... yum yum yum."

We went there for dinner and got seated inside on a highboy. It was pretty dark inside so I didn&#39;t get good pictures on the food.

I loved the pork belly tacos and the Aquachille. These two were my favorite of the night. The restaurant was so busy but the service was pretty good. It was kinda too loud inside that I needed to speak loudly to my friend. The outside seating was packed with the nice weather. 

Overall, I like it and I will come back again."

I definitely recommend the Paloma. Made with San pelligrino sparkling white grapefruit juice and a salted rim. Delicious, strong, and easy to drink.

I&#39;m a big fan of their chips (thin, crispy, and heavily spiced with chili powder) and classic guacamole. So  good! Just needs a little salt. The tacos are so incredibly flavorful and beautifully presented. The chicken Tinga are out of this world tender and juicy and spicy. The steak taco has so many amazing flavors going on and tons of bright citrus. The vegetarian taco is always rich and earthy; the Del mar crisp and fresh. And the cotija cheese adds that perfect amount of salt and cool relief. Oh! Don&#39;t forget the eskites (little grilled corn on the cob pieces with tons of lime, cotija cheese, and spices). They&#39;re phenomenal every time.

Great little patio, comfy bar inside, stellar prices for food made with care. You can see for yourself that it&#39;s made with care because the kitchen is entirely exposed and you can watch the chefs cook. It&#39;s the best!!"

Favorites from the menu: lemonade, porky taco, cochinita pibil tostada, mexi doughnuts. We wondered why the chips all had spices on them, would have preferred plain.

I took my out of town friend here to showcase Denver&#39;s culinary scene and she was really impressed!  Being from NY, she said it reminded her of the hip eateries there.  We had the shrimp Del Mar, pork and curry carrot special tacos.  The shrimp was crunchy perfection with the crispy fried string onions and tangy sauce.  I really liked the curry carrot tacos with hummus!  The service was very attentive and friendly!  My only comment is that veg tacos should be at least the same price if not less than meat ones.

We were seated and I showed the Dos Santos page from the Denver Dining Passbook stating &#34;Buy One Entree, Get One Free.&#34; She was so fast to say they would only honor BOGO Free Tacos because all of their tacos are a la cart and that the deal was printed before they introduced the brunch menu (which is where the entrees are). She wasn&#39;t going for a resolution, instead, carried an attitude of &#34;do it or leave it.&#34; Because of this &#34;news&#34;, we took a little longer to go over the menu and she came by a few times as if pressuring us to make a decision. I could almost hear her think &#34;my restaurant is so popular it&#39;s got near perfect scores on Yelp and it doesn&#39;t even take reservations.&#34; OK, I am putting words in her head but as you can see, we really got turned off by this kind of behavior. 

But as soon as the food arrived, everything was forgotten. The presentation stole our hearts instantly. My Porky Egg Lechon Taco was to die for and my friend seemed to have really enjoyed her vegetarian taco as well. We also shared The Big Dilla which was recommended by the waitress (see, I am being fair and giving credit where it&#39;s due). We asked for the chorizo to be put on the side. The quesadilla was very comforting it would&#39;ve tasted great with or without the chorizo.

Dos Santos makes for a very photogenic environment. Everything from the wall to the fixtures to the tables and chairs, and even the serving plates and dishes, are rustic yet contemporary. I loved how all my photos turned out. If not for the nuisance mentioned before, it would be a solid 5 stars."

We arrived yesterday and due to the time change (east coast to mountain time), our schedules were a bit off. They started talking about tacos and guacamole and I suddenly realized that I was starving.

It was Sunday and brunch was available...some fabulous choices of egg-infused and other breakfast item taco situations. The tuna ahi tacos (served on lettuce instead of a tortilla shell) were highly recommended...so that&#39;s what I ordered. Delicious! A little hard to eat...I made a mess...but the aoli mixed with slaw and 2 nice slices of ahi tuna on each one was a flavor &#39;splosion. 

Two of us got the tuna tacos; one got a couple of breakfast-y ones and one had the steak tacos. Great reviews all around.

Oh - and we started out with 2 different kinds of guacamole and a pile of seasoned tortilla chips. So. Good.

If you like a really spicy bloody mary...get one here.

They have great happy hour offerings, too. If I lived in the area, I&#39;d be here often."

I rarely venture out of my comfort zone. And I only review the ones that legitimately stand out from the crowd.

I went into Dos Santos not expected to be blow away by the food or venue. For the Denver locals, this place is in the old D-Bar location. I didn&#39;t like this notion before actually seeing the remodel only because D-Bar was tiny and uncomfortable.

They&#39;ve ripped away walls and the place actually feels like a decent size. 

The food.... Listen, I&#39;m not going into detail on the food. Literally, ANYTHING you order will be satisfying. The chef packs the food with tons of flavor and I actually ordered a second helping of my primary order.

The service was absolutely amazing. We had Natalia. She knew about every item on the menu and her recommendations were spot on. We love her and if you have the chance to sit in her section, consider yourself lucky.

The owners are active in the restaurant and it&#39;s awesome to see them running around in the kitchen, serving, bussing tables, and interacting with their guests.

Good job Natalia, kitchen staff, and owners. Can&#39;t wait to go back and bring others!"

First time here and we both really enjoyed our tacos although the OMFG we both agreed was the best one. We also tried the Guac and chips with fruit. My husband enjoyed it but I thought the Guac needed more seasoning and more kick. I don&#39;t salt my food often but I thought it could really use some salt, garlic and lime juice.

The house margarita was good and strong. I wish it had been bigger. 

The flan was awesome. It came topped with a chocolate dipped macaroon that they really should have just left off as ours seems like it had been frozen and was still hard so not quite room temp and soft. The actual flan and sauce however was outa sight!

The service was quick and friendly. We will be back for the OMFG and the flan."

Thank you Dos Santos for hitting this one way out of the park. When I first walked in I knew this place was legit. The hostess was seating another party that walked in right before me so when I walked up I didn&#39;t know who to speak to since there was no host stand. But that&#39;s ok. The young lady quickly greeted me and sat my  party of 2 at a high-top near the bar. I&#39;m so happy she seated us there. You can see the whole restaurant and yet you&#39;re still in the bar area and can see all the food action in the kitchen. 

We didn&#39;t have to wait to long before Micah, our server and also the bartender came over to take our drink order. I asked him what his favorite is and he said the Coco Fuego. I went with it before knowing exactly what I was getting into. My friend ordered a local beer. My Coco Fuego was fantastic. I had to go back and read the menu after taking my first sip because I wasn&#39;t prepared for the spice that filled my taste buds. The 3-pepper infused rum is outstanding. And I love that the drink isn&#39;t too sweet. The coconut water really balances the spice of everything else. I also love that it comes with a chili coated slice of pineapple. It was superb. Great choice, Micah. 

Next we ordered appetizers. I couldn&#39;t pass up on the Eskites. It reminded me of the corn I used to eat at the carnival that would come to town for 2 weeks in the summer and near about kill you with their rinky-dink rides. It was so good. I habanero aioli was soooo good. I wish I could&#39;ve taken home a jar of that stuff.

My friend ordered the pumpkin seed guaK. It was delicious. Definitely one of the better quak&#39;s in town. I loved the bits of fried cilantro on the top.

For my first taco, I ordered a tostada-taco special for the night. I don&#39;t remember the name but it had ahi tuna, avocado, mango, and pickled cabbage on it. It was diving. Just like many other reviewers said, they pile on the filling. It was a little difficult to eat in bite sizes. I ended up breaking up the tostada and eating it with a fork. It was so good. 

My friend ordered the arrachera. Super simple, carne street taco-like. He said it was delicious. Again, super generous with the meat portions.

Our second tacos, we both go the Tinga. I asked for extra tortillas just to see if they would make a fuss giving it to me, and partially cuz the taco is so big. Emma, I believe was the other bartender, brought the extras with no attitude. I was super impressed. 

Probably my favorite part of the night was the super bomb music I know Micah had a hand in selecting. Micah was a super chill, down-to-Earth and right-to-the-point kind of server. I could see him dancing behind the bar when a jam would come over the radio. Great tunes man. You played a variety and pretty much all genres that are on my iPod Shuffle. I love when people are having fun at work. I also love good music when I dine. 

All in all, I really really loved Dos Santos. I can&#39;t wait to take my friends back here.

The food came quickly and was happy I ordered the guacamole.  There were a few guacamole options, but we had the pumpkin seed one with tomatillos, very good.  Their chips taste homemade as well.  We weren&#39;t a fan of the metal cups, made the water taste like metal, but asked for glass and that problem was fixed.  I had the ahi tuna tostado with a mango salsa and avocado, really good, piled high with fixings.  The chicken and pork tacos however were a little too saucy.  The meat was stirred in with the sauce, and we prefer slightly crisper meat and less sauce in the tacos.

It&#39;s hip and cool inside and the waitstaff was friendly.

The food was bland and expensive.  The guac and salsa needed salt.  Everything needed heat!  This is supposed to be tacos/Mexican food and there was nothing on the menu that could even be measured on the scoville scale.  Why is there not a hot salsa option or grilled jalapenos for those that want to spice things up?

Then the price... $4 for a street taco.  Yes, they were fancy, creative and even the tortillas were homemade.  Yes, they were a step above what you find on Federal, but still way over priced... and bland (I know I already mentioned that).

I kept telling myself &#39;you&#39;re not on Federal (or East Colfax, for that matter) any more&#39;.  It didn&#39;t help, I was disappointed."

So glad this place opened up and is doing something a little different in the tacos scene. How is it different you ask? Well, the tacos are inventive. My favorite is the OMFG which is fresh tuna with bib lettuce acting as the taco. The tuna is amazingly fresh, don&#39;t know who they source from but kudos on that. They also always have a rotating veggie taco option. I recently tried the roasted squash option. It was delightful. My sister had the cauliflower taco and said it was the favorite of what she ordered. Another inventie example, changing up the basic guac options, my fave: the bacon and fruit guac, a little salty, a little sweet, but just right. If you&#39;re looking for authentic Mexican you might not like this place but if you&#39;re looking for inventive nuevo Mexican, this place will speak to you.

Pronto!! I am so excited about the food here I had to write a review even before leaving the restaurant. 

The tacos were...spectacular!!! We ordered the chicken tinga taco, arrachera, porky, del mar with fish, aguachile tostada, chips and salsa, and finally...flan with caramel hibiscus reduction sauce topped with caramel popcorn. 

The chicken tinga was my favorite taco...so good I had to order a second one. It was so juicy, tender, and full of flavor. The poblano sauce added a nice smoky flavor. Order this taco!!

All of the tacos were so delicious you really can&#39;t go wrong with any of them. Here, Im ordering a taco but I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m just getting a taco. Instead, I&#39;m getting something more...something unique...something spectacular and full of umph with every bite. You will not be disappointed here! Well, I wasn&#39;t disappointed here at least.

Also, the flan really was a highlight of the meal. It was silky, creamy with a subtle richness; sweet, but not overpowering. The popcorn sprinkled on top gave a pleasant and complementary taste with a contrasting texture. I highly highly recommend getting the flan. 

The server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. When we ordered the flan, she even gave me some extra caramel popcorn since I am dairy and gluten free. So thoughtful!

The food was so good I&#39;m struggling to find words to describe it to the fullest. I can only say I&#39;m walking out the door giving thanks to Virgin de Guadalupe for such a heavenly meal and experience here. I wasn&#39;t religious before, but I am now. Gracias Dos Santos, gracias."

I ended up stopping here with friends on a drunken Friday evening, their first Friday they were open. Many tacos and margs later, we were all head over heels for the food/drinks, the ambiance, and Jason (owner/manager?) and his wife. 

Jason welcomed us with arms wide open and has remembered is the many times we&#39;ve been back. He&#39;s friendly, personable, and wants to make sure guests of the restaurant enjoy their experience. 

The space is decorated with some rustic flair, including two giant chandeliers, wooden planks on the walls, and even a bank of lockers. Minimal, easy style. 

Now: the best part, the tacos. To. Die. For. My personal favorite are the del mar with shrimp. I get them on Bibb lettuce. Nothing like them at any other taco joint. The sauces with the fried okra are on point. My husband prefers the chicken tacos. And make sure you start with the chips and salsa and/or guac. While they have a few varieties, our favorite is the bacon guac that comes with sliced fruit mixed in as well. If you&#39;re looking for a drink, the coin marg and Tommy&#39;s marg are winners. Last time we went, I went with their version of a mule, and i may stick with it!

Bottom line: we&#39;ll keep going back. Haven&#39;t ever had to wait and the tacos are well worthwhile. Can&#39;t wait for the patio to get finished!"

Both were good but the o.m.f.g. was AMAZING. the service was super fast - we got guacamole as an app and it came out almost immediately.

You choose the vessel of the taco: lettuce, tostada, corn or flour tortilla. Great inside ambiance and Chillin&#39; outside street front seating. The casual camping plates and cups are fun.

I come from LA, Mexican restaurants  either serve authentic, fusion,  or Baja style Mexican food but this joint is amazing! This is definitely top of my list!!! Imagine that, in Denver.  Impressive! We ordered Agua Chile ceviche (shrimp ceviche) with seasoned fried tortilla chips, Arrachera steak tacos, OMFG  carb free tacos (like a lettuce wrap) was OMG! ridiculously  delicious!!!
Eskites corn with  cotija cheese, pork, steak mini tacos and second orders of more meat tacos. Every dish has its own distinctive flavors which makes it very special. Of course we all enjoyed a glass of beer. We are skipping the margaritas today. Someone has to drive me safely to the airport...wink...
For dessert we had flan and some kind of dark chocolate mouse in a small mason jar with seeded brittle chips on the side. The desserts were so delicious I had to stop so I can share it with everyone.lol
Overall: this is the only Mexican restaurant that  I truly enjoyed everything on the table. The  contemporary approach to plating , portions, and flavors was a great dining experience!"

The staff is super engaging, the vibe is right on, and the food slays. Over three days we drank and ate here twice and had: Station 26&#39;s lager brewed just for Dos Santos, margs (house and spicy), chips and guak, and tons of tacos: OMFG, tinga, porky, aguachile, cochinita pibil, veg (both variations rocked: one cauliflower, poblanos, and corn and the other carrot mole - so so good), and duplicates of many of the above. Flan, a treat, was delish. Service is on point. If you can&#39;t ride the ebb and flow of busy places with the same grace that these great bartenders and servers do, then don&#39;t go.

In this strange universe where every second restaurant is serving the same tiny $4 &#34;street&#34; tacos, Dos Santos delivers exactly average from the kitchen. This review isn&#39;t about the kitchen though; it&#39;s about the abysmal service.

6 people on a Sunday afternoon arriving to a half-full restaurant ready to eat and drink shouldn&#39;t have any problem spending money, right? Wrong. The staff must have been on a bender the night before and/or gotten crushed that morning because they were tired, openly annoyed, and for the 2nd half of our visit, simply not around. Empty plates and drinks cluttered our table while we waited hoping to order a second round. We finally gave up, decided to change venue for a second drink, and went looking for someone who could give us our check. Even the payment process was a painful game of find someone who can fix our check and take our money.

It looked like a few people at our table enjoyed the OMFG, but I didn&#39;t get that one. Too bad; would have probably earned the place 2 stars instead of 1"

I had the Dos Santos Mule, which was quite tasty and flavorful. I had a sip of the coco Fuego, which had just a small kick of spice, but not overwhelming and I enjoyed a sip of Tommy&#39;s Margarita as well.

We split an order of guacamole with pumpkin seed, nopal and roasted tomatilllos. It was very good. Chips and salsa were also good. The salsa had just a little spice, but not overwhelming.

I had a Del Mar taco with battered shrimp, super yummy! As well as a taco special of the day which was a squash taco with a leek fondue. Holy mama, it was good! 2 tacos were more than enough to fill me up.

The only downer was the lack of dessert. The restaurant only had flan as a dessert, which was a bummer. But not the end of the world nor did it put a pall on the evening. I just like dessert. :-)"

Menu is pretty small so just know that you&#39;re only getting tacos. They should think about expanding this as Mexican is easy to do as everything is practically involving the same ingredients - just prepared a bit differently. But, I digress. The tacos are tasty, small and are about $4-$5 each. Easy to drop $16-$20 on tacos if you&#39;re a hungry guy. Qdoba is across the street if you&#39;re not feeling like dropping that kinda cash."

We were seated and told immediately by a server &#34;I don&#39;t know what time it is but if it&#39;s after 2, we aren&#39;t serving from the brunch menu.&#34; I had purposefully made the trip on an early weekend afternoon so I could try a couple of their brunch tacos which sounded so good- and also because their regular menu only has a handful of tacos and apps on it. I picked up my phone and looked at it and as I showed it to the server, it changed from 1:59 to 2:00. I asked if there was any way I could still get brunch and he said no.

Ordered the shrimp &#34;del mar&#34; taco and the tuna special which I think it like the OMFG. So much flavor and great amount of spice! 

The guak was great, as was the pumpkin seed dip, and the dos dip. All were very delicious, I think just that $9 for a pretty small portion is a little steep. I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it costs a lot to make...?

Excellent service, very spot on, manager is super friendly and personable. We met his wife as well, and both seem to make a great team. The table and I were really happy with our first experience there and will definitely be back!!"

I see a lot of people complaining about service but I did not experience anything bad at all! (ok actually for a second I did because I thought no one was bringing me a menu but I was actually just being an idiot because they were on the table)
We ordered the corn appetizer and it was delish! 5 bites sized pieces of corn on the cob soaked in gooooood cheese.
We also each got a margarita which was potentially my favorite I&#39;ve had in Denver but that is not definitive.

First, the food - we ordered the fruit &amp; bacon guacamole which seemed lacking in flavor. I love avocado but when I order some guacamole I would like some flavor. We also ordered the corn which was good except it was served cold - I&#39;m not sure we would have ordered it if we had known that it was cold. We also ordered tacos and weren&#39;t super impressed. I had the raw tuna and the beer battered tacos and there just wasn&#39;t much going on flavor wise. I felt the ratio of flavor/protein to other stuffing (i.e. Cabbage and slaw) was super low. We felt there was a lot of filler and not much substance.

Second, the service was alright. Our server seemed super out of it and kept coming by but didn&#39;t take out order. One plus though he did keep out water full which was wonderful. 

I doubt we&#39;ll be back - not our favorite taco place in Denver."

Saw one chef scratching his head and then go right into plating tacos, saw one chef playing with his phone (not washing his hands after) and using the same gloves over and over and over again...nasty. I almost said to the bartender (who was super sweet, probably the only positive part of the night) to cancel my food. I didn&#39;t want to embarrass my friends as they are not in the restaurant industry and don&#39;t notice these types of things.

We go to Pinche (Tacos, Tequila, Whiskey) a lot and have gotten bored with it - being a pescatarian limits our variety at any taco place - and were glad to see Dos Santos doing their own thing! I&#39;ve had Tacos Pescado almost any place that offers them, and they&#39;re the standard interpretation here, except the breading is much lighter and more like tempura.

I branched out from my usual and had a fried shrimp taco too (del mar) and the shrimp was delicious and not chewy (to be expected from a restaurant that offers shrimp ceviche (aguachile), which was one of our *favorites* bar none). I had the OMFG as well as the shrimp and fish del mar, and the OMFG really stood out, partly because it&#39;s Ahi, but mostly for the bib lettuce sub for the tortilla. 

I should also mention that the margaritas are good too, amd happy hour pricing is good.

The interior design didn&#39;t have a very ergonomic feel to it. Still intrigued to give this place a shot, my friends and I sat down. As we looked over the very small menu, we were served our water which might I add was warm. It was the first time I&#39;ve ever been served warm water in a restaurant. I was ecstatic when my ice cold Tecate arrived at the table. We ordered &#39;guak&#39; as they call it, and salsa for the appetizer. When our appetizer arrived, the guacamole was in a big hunk on top of a pile of chips. I&#39;ve also never been served guacamole in such a way, which was new to me as well. The green salsa that they served with the chips was fabulous, and my favorite thing to dip my chips in.

I decided to order the special for the night which was the tuna tostada. When our food arrived, the tacos and my tostada were piled HIGH with all of our toppings. It made it very difficult to consume the meal without making a giant mess. My tostada broke completely in half as soon as I took my first bite and I ended up finishing my &#39;tostada&#39; with a fork. The tuna that was on my tostada was absolutely amazing. It was so well cooked that it ended up making the cracked tostada experience a non-issue. Absolutely delicious!

I would love to wait a couple of months and try Dos Santos again. I&#39;m definitely not opposed, I just feel as if they need a bit more time adjusting the new restaurant. Best of luck Dos Santos, and I hope to visit you again in the near future!"

Each one had a completely different flavor profile and each one was absolutely delicious. The drinks are good too (I had a whiskey old fashioned). My only complaint is that for $12, they are kinda small and much of the room in the miniature preserves glass was taken up by the ice cube.

Food was delish with a rustic presentation. The drinks were very good as well. Everything was a la carte so you could order more/different tacos as your appetite changed. Price was very appropriate for the quality of food and service.

They don&#39;t have a huge menu but what they do have is really yummy! I heard it was which was the main reason I decided to go there with a friend of mine. The food came or quickly and the atmosphere is pretty cool. The decor is also very unique which made it feel more authentic. 

The bad: when we walked in the door, there was no host stand or any indication of if it was open seating or not. After about 2 minutes of standing there, the host said &#34;I&#39;ll be with you in a minute&#34; to which I understood that we were to be seated. We proceeded to stand there for another 5 minutes while the staff ran around like crazy, I get it. I work in the industry myself and it can get wild; Especially when I&#39;m not the only one who thought going out to a taco place on taco Tuesday was a good idea! After being seated, we had to wait another 5-10 minutes for the server to even come say hello. At which point we ordered a margarita, a coke and chips and quac (very yummy guac, bacon and fruit were delicious). The food came quickly. However we were finished with our appetizer, when the server stopped by again and said &#34;oh you didn&#39;t get your margarita&#34;. I was annoyed, because we didn&#39;t even have waters let alone the drinks we ordered. At that point I decided we should order the food when she came back with our drinks, because it felt like that was going to be our only opportunity. She dropped off water and glasses for us at this point with our other drinks except the water was warm, no ice. Tacos came they were great and they came out promptly, however the lack of attention was frustrating. They seem a little understaffed and quiet honestly seemed like we were bothering our server when she stopped by. I will say she comped my drink but even then I spent $25 on quac and 3 tacos (specialty taco was $7!!) before tip. Seemed a little pricey... 
Not sure I will be back, not on a Tuesday that&#39;s for sure."

We ordered taco&#39;s separately as some of us were vegan. They served them family style and struggled to tell us which was which. Then we went to pay. They refused to spilt our tab so we had to figure it out amongst the 4 of us. Then they double charged my one of the girls cards. She had to call and figure it out. They were not helpful."

I was pleased that there were some good vegetarian options, as that&#39;s often tough to find with tacos. I had a Tinga taco and one of their specials - a vegetarian taco with butternut squash and kale. Holy crap. The butternut squash taco was fantastic. The Tinga was really good too, but the squash one blew me away. I hope they have it next time I go.

I was a little disappointed that my Dining Out Denver Passbook - which has buy 1 entree get 1 free deals at many restaurants - didn&#39;t work as well here. Since there aren&#39;t really &#34;entree&#34; portions on the menu, a single taco just ended up counting as an entree.

Regardless, I look forward to coming back, and please keep making those squash tacos!"

The service was adequate and our server was pleasant and knowledgeable. The guacamole was about half an avocado with some veg piled on a stack of chips for $7. The tacos came family style, which makes sense for some things, but not for tacos. It&#39;s just awkward. They&#39;re asking $6 for a lager. It&#39;s just a slap in the face to spend $20 in a taco restaurant and walk out confused and hungry surrounded by white people. They don&#39;t split checks after the meal, and you find this out after the meal. Is this the new face of Denver?"

I mean the kind of service where you ask for the drink you&#39;ve ordered 3 times and it takes 20 minutes.  The food is over priced, not bad, but not warranting what is charged.  Drinks are a joke.  Is the party I&#39;m with the only ones who have figured out that the tall glasses for drinks, which are all ice and range from 8 to 12 dollars, are undersized?  This is a typical example of a mediocre restaurant in a high end neighborhood excessively overcharging for what is delivered.  Dos Santos, God, Jesus, and baby Jesus would not approved."

Their food is truly exceptional: fresh and superb quality ingredients with authentic flavors blended with new twists and fun presentations. By far the best tacos in Denver (hands down better then Pinche and Torchy&#39;s).

If you are in Denver and craving an amazing taco in a hip, cool venue, check out Dos Santos (be sure to get the Aguachile share plate as an appetizer!). Also, if the weather is nice and you&#39;re craving an amazing brunch, hit up Dos Santos patio on Saturday or Sunday mornings for their brunch menu."

The best one I tried was the Tinga (chicken), but it didn&#39;t come close to amazing. There was too much filler in all the tacos and the flavor balance was way off IMO. I&#39;m no expert on authentic Mexican food, but they didn&#39;t seem like Mexican tacos to me, more like trendy American tacos. We tried the Eskites appetizer for $6 and it turned out to be 5 tiny pieces of corn, and it was also served cold (not sure if that was intentional.) I don&#39;t recommend the place for date night because it was so loud we were practically yelling at each other across the table. The atmosphere is much more bar/club-like, so I&#39;d only recommend this place for drinks. Service was slow, though they were busy on a Friday night."

Every time we travel to Cozumel, which is once or twice per year, we make it a point to dine at both Kinta and Kondessa.  It&#39;s what we live for!!!

Last December, when we were speaking with the owner of Kinta, we were ecstatic to learn they were opening Dos Santos in Denver.  How lucky were we?  The food at Kinta and Kondessa is SO AMAZING, we couldn&#39;t wait to take our friends and family to a place local to Denver.

I waited on pins and needles for this place to open and scheduled a happy hour for my entire team so they could indulge in the same luxury of food I was able to enjoy in Cozumel.

I was sadly mistaken.....

We arrived at 5 pm on a Thursday to be turned away by the hostess who refused to seat us because one member of our party was missing (we were 6 waiting on a 7th to join us after work).  After the hostess gave us much grief, we said &#34;fine, we are a party of 6 then&#34;.  She explained to us that a 7th person would not be allowed to &#34;join&#34; us upon arrival (e.g. Apparently, they can&#39;t allow a 7th person to sit at the community picnic tables).  She walked away from us still refusing to seat us and started helping other customers....wait?  It&#39;s a Thursday, 5 pm, the restaurant is dead and you&#39;re refusing to seat a 6 top?  You haven&#39;t even been open in Denver long enough to have that kind of swagger!  Is this Pinche?

Finally, after speaking very loudly about spending our time waiting for the rest of our party writing bad reviews on social media, one of the waitresses agreed to let us sit down ... at the community style picnic tables....finally.  To add insult to injury, this is a corporate dinner where we would be spending boat loads of money and leaving rather large tips.

The food is a bad Machete replica.  If I have never been to Machete, I would think that this concept was amazing....but it&#39;s just a watered down version of Machete, with an atmosphere of egotistical hipsters who are willing to turn away business.  The worst part is that their tacos are not double bagged, so I basically have to kill a tree wasting paper (yes, paper!) napkins as the taco falls apart in my hands.  

Newsflash:  you just opened, you have no reputation in Denver, and your food (compared to Kinta and Kondessa) leaves much to be desired.  You haven&#39;t earned enough respect to treat your customers this way.

If you had replicated your amazing food from Mexico here in Denver, you would have a HIT on your hands.  Instead, you&#39;re just another americanized Taqueria with a slightly Mexican flair.

But you know what....I still tipped the waitress $60 on a $200 tab just because she was the only awesome part of your place.

If you&#39;re looking for excellent food, try their restaurants in Cozumel....they are worth it!!!"

I tried their spicy chicken sandwich and thought it was good but was rather plain because there were no vegetables or anything and the chicken was entirely too breaded. I did appreciate that the chicken had a good kick to it. Sometimes I&#39;m skeptical that something that&#39;s labeled spicy isn&#39;t spicy enough for me. I felt the heat with this sandwich though. 

What I do like about this place is their drive-thru &amp; location in a popular &amp; convenient shopping plaza. I tried the lemonade milkshake and thought it was fantastic.

Always with their Buffalo sauce and honey mustard. I rarely order their crinkly fries  but I hear they&#39;re  good. I had a chocolate milk shake one hot summer&#39;s  day after I pounded a lot of miles at Cherry Creek Reservoir and I swear, it was an entire meal, loaded with carbs and decent protein.  The sugars were a little high but after burning lots of calories, the shake went down smoothly and with no guilt. This location I recommend highly as the vibe is always uplifting  and the folks there, courteous and very accomodating."

I&#39;m from California, just came in from the airport and I&#39;m very big on costumer service, this place was awesome. Very clean and friendly staff. 

Who stood out the most was KURT. He was going around cleaning the tables and brought my son a high chair, cleaned it with a sanitary wipe and even had my son help him put a kid table mat to the table. 

Doesn&#39;t seem like much, but I appreciated him and his kind ways.

Anyway, I digress, Chick-Fil-A has the BEST lemonade I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s extra tart and always refreshing. The waffle fries are so lovely and crispy and they probably only last me a couple of miles on my journey home.

I love how they always say &#34;my pleasure&#34; after every thank you.

Fun Note!
Valentine &#39;s Day... Some locations will shut down and turn their restaurant into a fine dine restaurant!
You have to have reservation and they all dress up and show you to your seat.

About the time I was done eating a nice young man came over and offered to dispose of my tray and get me a drink refill for the road.  When was the last time THAT happened in a fast food place?

Ok, seriously, they is something so magical about Chick Fil A and their food, I can&#39;t put it into words. I don&#39;t know if they put crack in their Polynesian sauce (or their fat free honey mustard, some of the best in the world) or if they fry their delectable waffle fries in some other addicting substance but whatever they&#39;re doing, works.
 
My only complaint is the obvious-closed on Sundays and there aren&#39;t too many locations in the Denver area. I moved here from NC and it seemed like there was one on every corner there. This location is a great one--friendly employees who still say &#34;My pleasure&#34; and quick service. Quick tip, if you get their calendar you can use the coupons even if they&#39;re expired!"

I recently moved here from California and decided i&#39;d give it a go since i had never been to a chick-Fil-A before. The spicy chicken sandwich was good. when i say good i mean good for a fast food chicken sandwich.. if it had been from an actual restaurant it would have been not up to par. 
the waffle fries were not cooked long enough so they were a soggy potato waffle stack. no offense but if your looking for waffle fries from a fast food joint go to carls jr not this place. 

the food wasn&#39;t BAD... but it was just average fast food in my opinion. I really don&#39;t understand the 5 star rating on a fast food joint.. thats like giving taco bell 5 stars for mexican food.. lol it just doesn&#39;t happen.

Last night my boyfriend and I stopped by this location around 9:30 (closes at 10), an there were about 4 other customers in there, too. 

They told us the chicken sandwiches will take about 5 minutes, which is no biggie. My boyfriend and I were chit-chatting our heads off while waiting for our food, and one of the employees apologized to us for the wait-- Which again, we did not mind (it was probably a 10 minute wait); Since my bf and I work in retail, we understand how it&#39;s like and it wasn&#39;t a big deal at all.

Our food finally came out, we ate inside, and the employee who talked to us before went around to everyone&#39;s table asking if everything was alright.  He even came to our table and offered to refill my drink :) Not sure if they do that often, but NO FAST FOOD JOINT HAS EVER DONE THIS FOR ME!  I wish we caught his name, but he was really sweet and NONE of the employees were rushing the customers to leave, as it was past 10pm.  

After we were done eating, the same employee offered to give us a sample of a spicy chicken wrap.  Not sure if he gave us it because of the &#34;wait&#34; that we didn&#39;t mind, maybe he over-heard my bf and i bitching about our day at work, or maybe they gave it out before it went bad. Who knows?

Either way, thank you, sweet employee. You made my night and impressed me with customer service that was above and beyond.

On a different note, the food is always fresh and hot-- I&#39;ve never been disappointed!"

They defintly have fast service and and are very friendly. But forgetful I have had numerous encounters where they forgot fries, soup, dressing, sauce, even once my moms meal. They have okay food but delicious fries ! Always very hot ! No options really for vegan/ vegetarians but I can&#39;t blame them for that. I got a salad today with delicious berry dressing and fruit. But however disapointed that they are pre packaged so I could not ask for no blue cheese or chicken. Unfortuantly I tried to eat around it or pick it off which was a struggle.

Like many places this location started out good, but has now gone down hill.  It is OBVIOUS the managers at this store are not monitoring their children.

Do they think we can&#39;t hear them because we are in a car?  I can hear everything that&#39;s going on inside that place, and  what these uneducated (Cherry Creek Schools) students don&#39;t understand, is someone who might be connected to the owner could be in one of those cars?  That&#39;s why when you&#39;re at work, put on your work face (Customer friendly). Childish games are for after work.  And this place needs new managers.  Food is always cold, customer service is headed downhill.  Hope they improve!  Oh, by the way, I went to McDonald&#39;s down the street.  Night and day.

IT IS NEAR A MALL!

All ridiculousness aside, this Chick-Fil-A is the one that all the others should strive to be like. Yeah, it seems like a new location, so the folks working there haven&#39;t lost their will to live yet  or maybe -because- it&#39;s a new store, they flew in all the superstars from some other stores to really &#34;Wow&#34; you with their amazing customer service. I haven&#39;t been smiled at as much as this since my last trip to Disneyworldland.

I don&#39;t know what their cleaning schedules are for the playground or what they use to sanitize the tubes and slides, but something needs to change. We have never had a problem with Burger King, McDonalds (even though we don&#39;t eat the food) or Chucke Cheese playgrounds. I know it&#39;s mostly the parent&#39;s fault for letting their sick kids with snotty noses climb up and down the playground and infect the other non sick kids, but managers need to start managing that area a bit more. Back in October there was a mom trying to wipe her little girl&#39;s nose as the daughter was wiping snot all over... we left immediately. I couldn&#39;t believe it. What shocks me the most is it is more of an upper class neighborhood. I am just sending out a warning to all parents who use this chick fil a on those cold winter Colorado days to let their kids have a little fun. and PLEASE DO NOT let your kids go in and infect other children if they have cold- a simple runny nose for one child could mean the ER with Croup to another."

Best fast food around
Chicken biscuits for breakfast
Bring back the peach shake!

I try not to review fast food chains. He&#39;ll I try not to EAT ar fast food chains in general. But I had to make an exception for the best fast food in all the land!

First off let&#39;s start with breakfast.  Two words ... chicken biscuit. That&#39;s all you need to know. Golden brown pillows of fatty deliciousness. You have to trust me on this. You cannot do better than this at the ass crack of dawn when you don&#39;t want to get out of your car. 

Next let&#39;s go to the other meals. I am not one to endorse anything healthy. But this place has great salads and wraps. But who cares about that, tell me about the chicken! Just stick with one of two things. Either the original chicken sandwich or the chicken nuggets. Anything else is a waste of good Calories. And do not skimp on the  cris cut frys. Deliciosness. 

Finally, they have some of the best shakes in all of the land! My favorite is the peach. But it&#39;s a limited engagement item. The cookie and cream is damn good too. 

My only complaint is that they are closed on Sundays. That just doesn&#39;t so it for me. 

Still. If you have to eat at a place with a drive through, this is the best around!"

Since that time, the owner seemed to have taken a hands on approach and many things have changed for the better over the 2 years.  The quality of service and food have been superb. My favs are: fried chicken, catfish, cabbage, and mash potatoes. Note: the chicken and catfish are made up order (12 minutes) so I usually order in advance for pick up.

Last time I tried the meatloaf which was also delicious but I generally stick to my favs.

The dining area is pretty casual and there&#39;s a flat screen tv which shows sports and news. Sometimes old school R&amp;B  music is playing as well.

Based on my over all experience, I highly recommend this as the best home cooking option in the Aurora/Denver area."

Seriously. Just go. Everything is homemade, fresh and delicious. 

I came in for lunch with my coworkers. I got the catfish with two sides, yams and Mac and cheese. I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough. This place deserves 6 stars. The catfish was absolutely perfect. Thinly breaded, moist and flaky. All of my sides were excellent. I would get a catering size of the yams or Mac and cheese and take it to a thanksgiving dinner. My coworkers highly recommend the fried okra and the cabbage. 

The service was absolutely fantastic. This is a &#34;no frills&#34; place but that in no way effected the courtesy. There&#39;s no table service, you order at the counter. Even though they were extremely busy, the chef and cashier were extremely helpful and made us feel very welcome. 

We will absolutely be back. Kirk&#39;s has won its spot as our favorite restaurant in aurora/Denver."
kirks-soul-kitchen-aurora-2,Lauren P.,ZOTbPu08aTiFDmrNuNW4IQ,"Aurora, CO",0,1,0,0,249,ot9YM7gcuxuUBv4DEiueLA,1.0,2016-11-19,"UberEATS customers beware!!

I have had Kirk&#39;s Soul Kitchen (or The Soul Kitchen as they&#39;re known on UberEATS) for the past few years. The food has always been decent and I haven&#39;t had many complaints. So I was excited to see that there was soul food that would be delivered to me with very little effort on my part. 

My husband and I placed our orders and the total was almost $50. Not the cheapest meal, but worth it if it meant I didn&#39;t have to cook that night. After spending long hours at work, we sometimes appreciate not having to cook or go out to get food.

But our experience was little short of a nightmare. When our food arrived around 6:50 that night, a third of our food was missing. That meant - no gumbo, no cake, and no pie (roughly $16 worth of food). In addition, my husband order a breast, mac and cheese and fries and cornbread, but was given a leg/thigh, yams, mashed potatoes, a roll and fries. We got a note that said &#34;Ran out of mac &amp; cheese, mashed potatoes &amp; yams on us! Sorry about that! :)&#34;

UNFORTUNATELY the food that was &#34;on them&#34; are things we DID NOT want to eat. Also, how is it &#34;on you&#34; when we ended up paying $50 for an order that was completely screwed up? I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to a young woman who blamed the new guy for leaving a bulk of our order. I also told her they completely messed up our combo ($13) and gave us rolls instead of cornbread. Her solution: a free meal the next day. I told her we didn&#39;t want a free meal; we wanted a refund. I was told that she&#39;d have to talk to the manager the next day. So we called UberEATS and they were able to refund the food we didn&#39;t receive, but not the combo that was ruined. 

The next day we went to the Soul Kitchen, combo in hand. We didn&#39;t end up eating any of it. I asked that we be refunded our money. The young woman I had spoken to the night before stated that she would call the manager. The manager, Karen, I believe, only wanted to offer free food. But I was adamant about not wanting any food. After several minutes Karen said that she couldn&#39;t do anything on her end because everything had been done through UberEATS and that if we wanted our money, we&#39;d have to go through them. 

We call UberEATS and they just felt like we were disgruntled customers. They basically refuse to refund our money because they had already made an adjustment the night before. We explained that they could call the manager, but they wanted no part of that. They have us some credit and that was that. Long story short, it was an epic disaster, to say the least. We didn&#39;t get the food we wanted; we ended up having to run out and get a semi-respectable meal and we didn&#39;t get our money back. 

I highly recommend The Soul Kitchen if:
-You enjoy wasting and losing money to 
-You want to go get more food after you&#39;ve already waited an hour for your order
-Missing a third of your meal is your definition of a good night
-After carefully selecting your meal choices, you&#39;d rather have The Chef&#39;s Choice
-You hate excellent customer service. The fact that someone would have the decency to call you and tell you that your order was messed up makes your stomach turn. (Nordstrom, pish posh!)
-You enjoy wasting your weekend trying to get something that somewhat resembles an apology. 

Needless to say, I will NEVER be coming back to Kirk&#39;s (aka Soul Kitchen)...and neither will my UberEATS driver."

- Fried Catfish with two sides (Fried Okra &amp; Collard Greens were our choices).  The catfish was lightly breaded and perfectly cooked. The collard greens were crisp and fresh.  The fried okra was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside!  
- Meatloaf with two sides (Fried Okra &amp; Cole Slaw).  The meatloaf was scrumptious.  The okra (see above).  The Cole slaw was flavorful, seasoned well, and satisfying. 
- Smothered Chicken Breast with one side (Mac &amp; Cheese).  The large breast was covered in a smooth and tasty brown gravy.  The Mac &amp; Cheese was cheesy but not overly so.  Not like a Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese!  

All meals come with a roll or cornbread. We all had the cornbread. A large slice that was moist on the inside and not too flaky. 

Ambiance: Simple attempt at Diner decor, and the place was clean.  There are only about 8 tables, but it looks like they specialize in takeout.  

Service: The gentleman was courteous and communicated our order well. 

I rarely give 5-star reviews, but Kirk&#39;s Soul Food deserves 5 stars.  We will definitely return!"

First off it looks kind of scary on the outside, but the interior is very clean and smells delicious!! The staff was so personable and friendly!! 

 I wanted to try various delicious looking things on the menu but I decided in the leg/thigh fried chicken with 2 sides, mashed potatoes and gravy and red beans and rice.  The chicken portion was a bit small but when you looked at the heaping sides I left with more than enough food in my belly! They were very honest with the time- it took about 10 minutes to get my food but so worth the wait!! 

The mashed potatoes were so creamy and tasted like they were straight out of my grandmothers pot- and don&#39;t even get me started on the red beans and rice!! I want to buy a vat of the red beans and rice to take home! They had amazing flavor and we&#39;re just the right consistency!! 

The fried chicken came out piping hot so it took at bit to be able to dig in but it was so worth it! The chicken was so juicy and flavorful- every bite was amazing! I also splurged and also got a piece of cornbread, it was moist and flavorful and every part as amazing as everything on my plate. If you are in the area make sure to take the time to stop in! I will be back for sure!"

The catfish was fresh and cokes in oil only used for it so no cross taste thank god. The yams were sift and sweet with a hint of cinnamon. The cornbread was decent....the cabbage was amazing tho. The place is kinda small and not in the best neighborhood. You can order by phone and pick up. The staff were very professional and quick turnaround for food.

I&#39;ve tried several (nameless) restaurants in Denver and had given up on finding some good down home cooking in the Mile High. Consistent with previous reviews, the customer service was excellent, the place was clean and the food was the BOMB.COM!!! I had red beans and rice, fried catfish, collard greens, mac-and-cheese and a roll. My husband had fried chicken, yams and cabbage. The sides are pre-cooked, but the meats are cooked to order so you always get &#34;hot out the grease&#34; meats. My fave were red beans and rice, not sure how to describe them but they were AMAZING and the best I&#39;ve ever had!!! Like a Bloody Mary cocktail, the smoked turkey seasoned collard greens (great for those of us who don&#39;t eat pork) had a nice little kick to it and the mac-n-cheese was cheesy pleasy to perfection. Overall, a great dining experience."

It turned out to be a real diamond in the rough! The sign read only &#34;Soul Kitchen,&#34; but I had the right place. Almost hidden next to a liquor store and a questionable looking motel, the area may appear a little sketchy, but it&#39;s perfectly safe and fine. The interior of the restaurant appears as the most simple fast food joint, but the food is anything buy. In fact, the delicious fried chicken is made to order and was well worth the 10 minute wait. The crispy skin was delicious and the inside moist (and note that the leg and thigh will return more of that yummy fried skin than will a breast). The mac &#39;n cheese was excellent and the coleslaw was among the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. The banana pudding, complete with chunks of banana and deliciously soggy vanilla wafers made for a great dessert and is enough to feed two after chowing down on all of the sides. The gentlemen who I assume was Kirk, the owner, who took and delivered my order, was incredibly polite and welcoming. If I have one suggestion to offer them, it would be to add some other bottled beverage options besides the usual sugary fountain soft drinks."

There are plenty of places in Denver to get good fried catfish, however there is none like this place. The catfish crust was thin and super crispy, not soft and over breaded like most places.  And the inside was moist and flaky like you would hope.  Seasonings were on point, Cajun inspired but not spicy.  However, the real star of the show was the fried okra.  You can tell they make this on sight. The outside was very crispy and heavily seasoned in a good way.  You know it&#39;s a good place when their fried food doesn&#39;t taste like a fryer and their fish isn&#39;t fishy.  Coming back for the seafood gumbo and fried chicken!"

The food was filling but it could of been the four cokes i had whilst waiting. The portions were okay, my chicken strips were over cooked. The mac n cheese was good but not great. My son had the meatloaf which he liked, but he didnt care for the red beans and rice. The red beans and rice had alot of sausage and had good flavor,but they could use more bean juice and a little more kick.

It&#39;s clean, the food is authentically soul food quality, and the service is exceptional (with one slight imperfection noted in just a few).

My addiction at this place is the smothered chicken. It comes on a bed of rice w/ a side and is fairly priced. I try to come once or twice a week actually for it. Yeah, I got it bad... I&#39;ve also picked up the smothered pork chops for my significant other and it&#39;s hard to please as he is, even he is in love with them.

There have been a few hiccups in my orders over the course of the last couple of months. Once my chicken was undercooked, and another time they gave me baked instead of fried. Despite this, on these occasions I still left with a big smile on my face. Why? Well, in a word &#34;Mel&#34;. Mel owns this place and he is truly the salt of the earth. I presented him with the issues and not only did he remedy them, but he did so in a way that was absolutely stellar. He made no excuses, we didn&#39;t have to get into some debate. He simply made it right. And was so gracious.

The hiccup in the service was yesterday when I ordered my smothered chicken and mistakenly they failed to smother it. I was truly disappointed because I got all the way home, put on my PJs, opened my box and lo and behold... No gravy. :-(
I immediately called restaurant and asked to speak to Mel. A young lady answered the phone and when I asked for him she said , &#34;What is it that you want from him?&#34; I was a bit taken aback, but I told her there was an issue with my order and I wanted to talk to him about it. She says OK and goes to get him. In the meantime another phone in the restaurant was answered and a woman asked me what I needed and what the problem was. I told her I was looking to speak to Mel about a problem with my order. She said, &#34;Well, this is Karen what are you missing?&#34; I won&#39;t be able to truly portray the nastiness of this inquiry from her in text form. But it was the classic how-dare-you-call-here-to-complain-even-though-WE-made-the-error response. I was taken aback, but sadly not surprised. It represented the kind of attitude that gives us African-American women a bad name. I was extremely hurt more than anything because it was so stereotypical in the response. She spent a few moments trying to somehow make the issue MY fault, but ultimately Mel got on the phone. He apologized for the issue and just made it right. There was no accusatory tone, no attitude...Just a proprietor who prides himself in the running  of his establishment. He said that I could either come right back or he would make it right for me the next time. I elected to circle back to the restaurant and a younger gentleman was there and had been made aware of the situation. They were then out of chicken much to my disappointment. But upon returning to the store, it was the WAY that the young man handled it that still makes me a lifelong customer of this establishment. He was gracious, he was polite, we laughed and joked. And he simply just made it right. He apparently has been groomed well by Mel.

Karen&#39;s attitude not withstanding, I will continue to return to this place because of the service that I get. And the fact that the food is really, really good is simply the icing on the cake."

The sides look like they had been sitting in the warmers all day never to be changed per health codes. As for the meat selection it was minimal due too the menu day. The pork chops weren&#39;t fried but broiled, sadly they looked like they had been cooked in the warmer and were dried out. The other meats were in same poor conditions as well. With the site of the food and cleanliness I will pass on the version of Soul Food, still wondering who keeps this place open besides the RTD workers and construction workers. When the Waffle House was open the same location it was pretty nasty as well."

He was respectful and stayed very busy behind the counter filling &amp; taking orders. It looked like ther3 were only two people working. The guy in the front and a young lady in the back. 

Now for the food: The gumbo was pretty darn delicious. The rue was extremely flavorful and it was crowded with sausage, chicken &amp; whatever else they put in it. The shrimps were very small but the gumbo was so good, I really did not care and will definitely be back for another bowl in the future. Plus a very large bowl was only $7. I&#39;d pay that any day for some good gumbo that I don&#39;t have to cook.

The Mac n&#39;cheese, fried catfish, red beans &amp; rice and the cornbread was very good as well. I sampled them all from my daughter&#39;s plate (except red beans &amp; rice) but my daughter gobbled it all up and never ever complained about them so I know that they were good. If not, she would have complained and asked for another side item. 

The flavors are a little different from what I grew up eating but my family is from Louisiana and this family is from Alabama. However, this does not take away from how yummy everything was . 

Also, the sweet tea and the Kool-Aid was on point. 

Sweet potato pie tasted like a well made boxed pie. I would certainly order again. The peach cobbler was different from what I&#39;m use to but tasty nevertheless. 

The restaurant and furniture were clean &amp; sturdy. 

Don&#39;t let the location scare you away. These folks are doing it right so go by and check them out. 

2 dinners, 2 drinks, upgrade to cornbread and 2 desserts...$23 
Don&#39;t forget to leave a nice tip. We have to support the Mom &amp; Pops. 

I really hope you guys stay around forever!

Aptly named for the current owner&#39;s late stepfather, this family run, made-to-order soul food joint has quality cooking you cannot find anywhere else in Aurora or even the Denver area. 

I started off with fresh fried Swai, some mashed potatoes smothered in their famous gravy, and got some of the Mac and cheese. The fish was cooked to perfection, the potatoes were great. The Mac and cheese was a little dry but it may have been because we got there an hour before close. Each meal comes with a warm slice of cornbread.

The price for my meal was about $12, not bad for some good quality seafood. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area who&#39;s not afraid to try some real home cooking."

Although, I guess if you have to drive down Colfax it means you better be getting some good food! 

The food is made to order so it does take a little bit of time to get it. The prices are a little higher than KFC or Church&#39;s, but at those places I can feel my arteries giving me the finger. So, it is a small compromise.  I had an order of the catfish with mashed potatoes and gravy with a piece of cornbread. My partner in crime had the chicken breast, mashed potatoes and mac&#39;n cheese. My catfish was cooked perfectly. No overly dry pieces that I come across quite often at other joints. It was moist and was cut easily with a fork. The breading was a little salty, but put some mashed potatoes on it and it is golden. I tried some of the chicken breast and it was SO good. The breading around it gave it a great texture and taste. The chicken inside was soft and juicy. I wasn&#39;t able to try any of the mac&#39;n cheese, but maybe I will try it next time I visit. The only thing that I think needs work on is the cornbread. It is a little dry, but I took it home and reheated it with a few drops of water on it and it actually wasn&#39;t too bad. The owner is quite pleasant, so if you&#39;re looking for some soul food down Colfax, give this place a shot."

First I have to say.....OMG what is in that gravy. It is truly the best gravy I have ever had and I make some killer gravy. 
Secondly, the flavor on each items was different and exceptional, the potatoes were creamy and cooked perfectly. 
Third, for this place being an old building and them starting from the bottom, it was very clean, organized.

I felt very welcomed by the owner from the time we called to order it to go and the time I came in to pick it up. I hope they go far!
Oh and p.s. they will be delivering on campus soon."

Whenever someone so much as mentions Kirk&#39;s Soul Kitchen, my mouth begins to water.

As soon as you walk in the door at this family-run business, you are treated with the wonderful smells of an authentic southern kitchen accompanied by a fine example of Southern Hospitality. As soon as you order, the staff at Kirk&#39;s starts to whip-up whatever time-tested recipie you have requested. As you wait, you can see the steamy mashed potatoes and homemade gravy coming up first. &#34;Here you are honey.&#34; They say as your full order is delivered to your table. As soon as you feel that first satisfying crunch of fresh fried okra perfectly coupled with creamy mashed potatoes and the best fried catfish you have ever had, you know that Kirk&#39;s Soul Kitchen will have you coming back for more. Not for awhile, though, as the generous portion sizes will make sure you don&#39;t leave hungry. 

Kirk&#39;s Soul Kitchen is a great family environment. Without a doubt, you will leave this gem off Colfax completely satisfied. Make sure to tell your friends, you don&#39;t want anyone to miss out on this treat!"

I think ive been to just about every soul good restaurant in Denver and CANT BELIEVE we&#39;ve been sleepin on this place. We drive by almost everyday. Kirks doesnt have a bad dish on the menu! The catfish was perfect, the waffles and meat loaf were great, and the gumbo was excellent. All the sides were top notch and im even raving about the cornbread! Check it out, the music and atmosphere was even so good that we had to sit down and eat in. It may sound like im exaggerating but its that good."

Getting into the parking lot was more complicated than it should have been, as there is only entrance off of Colfax, accessible only if you are heading Westbound.  Unfortunately, there is also a popular bus-stop immediately adjacent to the entrance.  The RTD bus that was &#34;camping&#34; in front of the stop, for several minutes, was disrupting the traffic flow, and making it impossible to follow the recommended U-turn of my Google Maps.  Eventually I gave up, circled back, and took advantage of the ample parking.  The place does not open until noon, and the 15 minute wait (since I was early) make me realize how hungry I was.  Eventually, they let us in.  There were only two people working on this day, and one ran out to pick up some extra supplies right before they opened.  This did slow down the process a bit, but it was definitely worth the wait.  Fried chicken from scratch is not exactly &#34;fast&#34;, but there is a reason for this.

This was some of the best damn fried chicken I have ever had!  I went for a breast, which is not the safest choice.  This one was hot, moist, and tender on the inside, as I hoped.  The outside was crispy and flavorful.  I took advantage of the hot sauce selections, and thoroughly enjoyed this piece of bird.  They did not have the mac-n-cheese ready when I ordered, so I went with the collard greens.  They were a bit salty for my taste, but were well-cooked and tasty, with some nice meaty bits.  The roll was a good sponge to help eat the other food.  I also had a side of meatloaf, that I mostly took home for later.  It was solid, and did not have too much filler.  Texture and flavor-wise, it was a firm &#39;B&#34;. Lastly, I had a taste of someone&#39;s catfish as well.  Although I do not actively avoid catfish like I do with fishy fish, neither do I go out of my way to order it.  This was perfectly cooked, with a nice breading and tender catfish flesh within.  The next time I am craving fried chicken, this is where I will be going."

I ordered the Fried Chicken with Mac &amp; Cheese and Mashed Potatoes &amp; Gravy. The meal came with Cornbread.

The Mashers &amp; Gravy were awesome. Can&#39;t say the same for the rest of the meal. The Mac &amp; Cheese was OK, but nothing especially memorable.

You know that it is a bad sign when you take one bite of the Fried Chicken &amp; reach for the salt and hot sauce.  It had no flavor at all.  Zero. Zilch. None.  Nada...  and the Cornbread disintegrated when I picked it up... one piece of Cornbread became many many dry Cornbread pieces.

I felt like Jesus feeding the 5000... I turned one piece of food into many pieces of food... OK, enough of my warped sense of humor.

Bottom-Line:  I would try this place again, I just wouldn&#39;t order the Fried Chicken..."

I eventually ordered the two-meat-and-one-has-to-be-catfish dinner. I chose the smothered pork chops, macaroni and cheese, and garlic mashed potatoes. I&#39;m not a soul food expert, but I thought everything was delicious. Nothing was too salty. I&#39;d rather have to add salt to my food. Oh yeah. The peach cobbler is incredible. And I&#39;m not the biggest peach cobbler fan. But the texture and flakiness of the pastry in this peach cobbler is not something you often find. It&#39;s LOADED with cinnamon.

We took the drive out to Colfax from the complete opposite end of town based on the reviews. This is some of the f&amp;%$*@# best fried chicken I have ever had. Took about 10-15 minutes to receive the chicken but that&#39;s because it is freshly made so it&#39;s not sitting underneath some heat lamps or in a warmer. The seasoning was amazing as were the side dishes. Fresh corn bread!!! Also super friendly service, we will definitely make the drive out there again."

We were in search of some easy takeout to bring back to our airport hotel, and I am so happy we ran into Kirk&#39;s - it is amazing!  We ordered the catfish and the chicken, and two sides each.  The meat was delicious - I had white meat chicken, which can often be dry, but this wasn&#39;t at all. The catfish was in strips, which can often translate to dry, overcooked fish, but this was moist and flakey.

The real shining star of the meal, though, was the sides. Everything was delicious and some of the flavors were really surprising.  The mac n cheese was relatively basic (and delicious!), but the red beans and rice, collards, and black eyed peas were out of this world. There were little touches to everything that made them stand out. We ordered banana pudding for dessert and it too was delicious!"

Fast forward to living in the mid-west, and not getting Mom&#39;s recipes before she passed away means I need to find a close approximation of soul food. This place looked good on yelp, so...

Decent selection of southern/soul food items. I ended up with fried chicken with red beans and rice and cabbage as my sides. First and foremost, the &#39;red&#39; beans were actually pinto beans! WTF? Serious foul. Making up for that was that the chicken and cabbage were pretty damned good. There are several other menu items I&#39;d like to try, so 3 stars for now..."

I&#39;m from the south, so hospitality is a must. The service...awesome. The lady serving this day (with the tattoos) was a darling. Hubby and I ordered a meal for both of us, but as we were waiting, we picked up a menu and decided to add another meal and a bowl of gumbo. Wow!

1. Catfish, collards, mashed potatoes and gravy, and cornbread.
2. Catfish, collards, and banana pudding.
3. Meatloaf, red beans and rice, and sweet potato pie.
4. Small bowl (which is a big bowl) gumbo.

So, all the way home, the smell ju
st made me want to open the bag and dig in. I waited...

I ate the #1 meal listed above, but believe me, I tried all of it! Just what I needed to satisfy my soul food fix. I will be going back...again and again. Thank you for the history of Kirk&#39;s too!

Ruby N and I made our way past I-225 around noon o&#39;clock; thankfully we did because within minutes, Kirk&#39;s was hopping!  We both ordered the entrée + side + dessert dish and a drink for the ridiculous cheap price of only around $10.  What I loved about the menu is that you can create so many different combinations!  I opted for the fried chicken wings, mashed potatoes and gravy, corn bread, and banana pudding, all washed down with some sweet tea.

While the wait was a little long, the fried chicken is made to order, so it was expected.  And again, not to mention the enormous lunch rush!  After sipping on some tea, we finally received our orders and dug in.  Oh my dear god, this was indulgence at it&#39;s finest!  The chicken was awesome, the mashed potatoes were so tasty, and while the corn bread was a bit dry, I still enjoyed it.  I wasn&#39;t able to dig into the banana pudding until arriving back at work, but the OMG sentiment was still on my lips.

Why oh why does Kirk&#39;s have to be so close to the AMC?  So dangerous, yet so good!  I&#39;m a fan and will be back for the gumbo and peach cobbler soon!"

Kirk&#39;s Soul Kitchen also has a beautiful story; the restaurant is dedicated to owner Jay&#39;s stepfather.

Came here when the place was empty and was quoted a 10 minute wait for our order of 1) catfish, sides: Mac n cheese and collard greens 2) fried chicken, sides: cole slaw
The wait was actually more like 20 and when we received the food---very disappointed. First off, the meal came with 4 pieces of catfish the size of my fingers. it was more like a side. As for the 2 pieces of chicken--very small and SALTY! In fact, everything was salty, except for the cornbread. The cornbread was DRY. It was like eating bread that&#39;s been left out a day or so. We paid $20 for not very much food and probably got high blood pressure from all that salt. Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. I should have gone to Tom&#39;s Kitchen instead."

A very pleasant young man took the time to go through the whole menu with me. I thought choosing between the fried chicken and the catfish would be a dilemma, but it was my lucky day -- they had a chicken and fish special, so I got to try both.

Don&#39;t let the fast food look fool you; they fry the chicken and fish to order, so there&#39;s about a 10 minute wait. But man, was it worth the wait! The catfish was perfectly done, tender and flavorful. The chicken had a spicy, crispy, thin batter. And then the collard greens! That may have been the star of the meal. Tender, mild, with some nice chunks of fatty pork. Just perfect.

A hard question to answer, but all of us have home cooked favorites from mom that we enjoyed as a child or got in the school cafeteria.  Things generally not associated with fancy restaurants such as mac and cheese, fried chicken, meat loaf, and pork chops.  
Kirk&#39;s Soul Kitchen is a hidden gem located in Aurora in the Fitzsimmons area of Aurora.  Just on the east side of I225 and it can only be accessed on a right turn heading West.  If you are craving some soul food, its worth it.  Kirk&#39;s boasts a cafeteria/buffet style spread of all of the fixins so to speak.  I had the meat loaf the mac and cheese and the greens.  I think people can tell the difference between generic processed food and home made food.  Well everything Kirk&#39;s had tasted like it was homemade and made by some secret recipe from some legendary superhero grandma.  The meat loaf was amazing and the mac and cheese was the most unique tasting mac and cheese I&#39;ve tasted and it had a really addicting cheesy peppery taste to it.  
Kirk&#39;s gets 4 stars because service was pretty slow, but the people were generally helpful.  So if you want a good soul food fix on the east side of town, Kirk&#39;s is your place."

That being said, this is my 4th visit to each of the 5 soul food joints in Denver. I love Soul Food &amp; Southern food (yes, there IS a difference) so every visit is exciting for me as I compare &amp; contrast each place.

1. Parking is ample but access to the restaurant is frustrating; off I225 &amp; Colfax. One entrance off Colfax &amp; you gotta flip a bitch if you&#39;re coming from the other side. A bus stops right in front of the entrance &amp; makes it difficult to get in. When I went, the city garbage dudes were stopping every 2 feet doing stuff, so it took me a solid 5 mns to get in. I tried to sneak around the back of the place next door, but my plan was foiled since there is no back access. Dang. Girl need some fried chicken up in here.

2. Counter order with a big ol&#39; plexiglass divider that YOU BEST NOT TOUCH, sister. There are notes to back me up. Big menu on the wall, choose yo&#39; grub &amp; pay at the end. I love this set up. I ordered to-go &amp; at first, didn&#39;t see the chairs in the waiting area to the right of the door. Got up from 1 of the 7 four-top tables &amp; mosied on over &amp; sat next to another patron that smelled purty. Serenaded by my kind of music, R&amp;B, so I felt like my own Pandora was playing. 

3. Staff was courteous &amp; sweet as pie. Boy had some gorgeous straight teeth &amp; I found it hard not to flirt with him. Ordered some sweet tay when I was paying for my meal &amp; he said he made it himself, so it was real sweet. Asked him if he licked the rim too cuz you know it&#39;d be AAALLLL sweet. Yes. I. Did. Dang, I love me some brothers. And the tea was on point. But, his smile made it sweeter.

4. Ordered: fried chicken breast, mac &amp; cheese, cabbage, &amp; cornbread for one meal. Other was meatloaf with mashed &amp; gravy with a roll. Side of yellow cake with chocolate frosting. Heads up - if&#39;n you order fried chicken to go, the breading will be soggy by the time you get home, yo. That being said, chicken was alright; liked that it was a boneless breast and a huge portion. Mac &amp; cheese was a little peppery &amp; the cheese sauce is the sticky kind vs. actual cheddar. Cabbage tasted homemade &amp; good with bacon but I&#39;d skip the peppers if I was making it. Cornbread was moist with a hint of sweetness. Meatloaf was a ridiculous portion, make sure to get it smothered. Tasted like meatloaf, not a lot of filler, so I give it a thumbs up. Mashed were aight with some brown gravy. Roll was good if you wanna sop it all up. Thinking the desserts aren&#39;t the strong suit here: yellow cake tasted out of the box, at best. Chocolate frosting wasn&#39;t anything to brag about. Thinking I should offer to make their desserts for them.
Other heads up: some of the meats are made when you order them, so this isn&#39;t FAST food. Sides are prepped ahead of time and set up assemble line style behind the plexiglass. 

5. Interior: nondescript with white walls, which I am never a fan of, being a designer. Epoxy floors, swirly stainless steel laminate on the wall below the plexiglass, standard commercial dropped ceiling. Seven 4-top tables in the dining area; liked this coziness. I am super picky about interiors as a designer and have found that all of the Soul Food joints could handle some of my TLC but I also understand the food needs to be the focus but that&#39;s just how I am. It&#39;s an experience in my opinion, so I&#39;m always checking to see how it makes me FEEL. Love the tag line: &#34;Love with your soul. Cook with your soul.&#34; There is no other way.

6. Would I go back? Yep. Wanna try some other grub and love to support the Soul Food community."

Not only did the owner of the restaurant take the time to contact me and request that  I give his food another chance; the food was actually amazing!!  Now this wasn&#39;t a situation where we came in and they made everything we ordered right then and there as if we were in that type of restaurant.  We ate the food as if we were any other customer coming into to order their food and it was delicious.  Everything  that was on the menu was available for us to order and sample and man was it good. The collard greens were perfect and the mac and cheese was almost if not as good as my mothers (now that is a compliment)!!!  

My husband and I could not believe that we were tasting the same food that we had ordered before, it was like we were in a new restaurant!  Even the peach cobbler had me drooling for more.  The icing on the cake was the option of the best kool-aid I have ever had for a beverage, now that is true soul food!!  I strongly suggest that anyone looking for some real soul food give this place a try and I promise that you will be satisfied.  I know that my husband and I will definitely be going back for more and will try everything on the menu."

The pork chops and gravy were tender and very tasty.  The catfish had good flavor but were very long and thin.  More like catfish finger than filets.  The greens and okra were the favorites of the sides.  Everything else was good though.  We didn&#39;t try the corn bread, but the rolls were good.

After my second visit today, I&#39;m ready to review.
Food: I am really blown away by the quality of the catfish.  Light, clean, sweet flavor and the cornmeal breading is spot-on for seasoning.  They are now doing all chicken and catfish to order, which took about 6 minutes for my lunchtime order today.  Not only is it worth the short wait, it&#39;s a smart decision on their part to hit the mark on quality.  Even better, they fry up the filets just right; crispy and remarkably free of greasiness, even hard to find grease spots on the paper in the basket.  
The collard greens are cooked to what I would call &#34;medium&#34;; soft but not slimy and also seasoned well.  A hint of heat and tanginess that is perfect for me to eat as is, but there is hot sauce and vinegar available to add.  
The cornbread is slightly sweet and more on the bread side than the cake side that some people might prefer.
Those three items are so good, I can&#39;t bear to miss them by trying something else.  But one of these days I might have to grab a bigger order for dinner or on a Saturday.  (Or convince hubby to share)

Service and Ambience: Even on the outside the place is clean and bright.  Step inside and you&#39;ll see a cafeteria style counter where they dish up the sides and a few entrees.  Oh, and it doesn&#39;t smell like a fry bin, another good sign!
The service is very friendly and they go out of their way to ask how you enjoyed your meal before you leave.  They are very sincere people who are really putting their heart into the place.  Where they struggle is probably more about experience -- some might find them too casual with the order and pay process and not very proactive in giving you a cup for a drink, etc.  It also can feel a little chaotic because even now they still seem to be figuring out how they want to serve the food, who should take an order vs cashier, etc.  In my opinion, this is one of those rare instances where service and ambiance are easily overcome by the taste and quality of the food and the friendliness of the people.  
So in addition to checking out Kirk&#39;s ASAP, do yourself a favor and chat it up with the staff or ask the cook about his techniques.

P.S. if you find catfish anywhere else in Denver as crispy, light and fresh tasting as what they serve here, I wanna hear about it! Nothing wrong with having a few options around town."

Yelpers, you are all sleeping on the job.  While the Pretentious Douche Cafe has received over 500 useless reviews, this place is out in Aurora kicking ass and taking names.  Soul food people, check it out!  I had some smothered pork chops, amazing collard greens, and surprisingly delicious okra (warning: this is not for everyone) that left me licking my plate.  However, my wife outdid me by ordering their crispy, juicy, flavorful fried chicken that, unlike Colonel Sanders&#39; original recipe, is actually finger licking good.  Yeah, I got a taste, but I was really tempted to run off with her chicken, leaving her behind in the parking lot.  But I was a nice husband, stayed and let her devour her chicken while I watched longingly.  This meal was washed down with a wonderful cup of sweet tea and a mega serving of peach cobbler.  I need to come back to try their huge selection of sides, catfish, and banana pudding.  

If you aren&#39;t too familiar with this kind of atmosphere, don&#39;t fret.  The owners are sticky sweet and create a really comfortable atmosphere for people from all walks of life.  You can also tell that they take real pride in ownership and have great way of interacting with their customers.  So now you know...and knowing is half of the battle."

My Husband went back about an hour and a half later and was told that the cobbler was in the oven and would be ready in 15 minutes. He waited outside for 30 minutes and when he returned back inside, the employee that told him 15 minutes disappeared into the back while another female employee spoke to him at the counter. With a smile on her face, she told him &#34;Uh, I don&#39;t know what happened, the oven must not have been on&#34;. With no remorse, these child minded individuals allowed my Husband to leave their restaurant with no cobbler, no offer for anything else, no apology for keeping him waiting, no apology for wasting his time. I will never patronize this establishment again, I get better business at a corner taco truck! It&#39;s sad because Black owned restaurants are few and far between as is, but it&#39;s things like this that run customers away which forces them to close their doors. Not to mention that the food is salty, and the kool-aid is extremely sweet!

The service was prompt, and the owner even came out to make sure everything was up to standard.

Lulu&#39;s is really more of a bar than a restaurant so what is served here is basically bar food. The menu was pretty short. My wife ordered the Monday special of spaghetti and sausage and I ordered the BBQ nachos. She was pleased with the spaghetti but the sausage was raw and we returned it.  It was quickly replaced with one that was cooked.  The nachos were good. They were served on the thicker kettle potato chips. I would have preferred corn chips. They were indeed different which is what our server said they would be. The service was excellent and our waitress was friendly and efficient.

Do you need a good chicken friend steak? Lulu&#39;s Inn is the place. This is so worth the drive from Denver. Think of the Blues Brothers when they sang The Rawhide theme song and you think of Lulu&#39;s.  BTW, Watkin&#39;s is on your way to Kansas but only about a 30 minute drive from downtwon. 

They offer chicken fried steak, cook your own steak (they do it for $2.00 more), hamburgers, and specials. Of course a great bar and a great bartender who remembers me now. Could be because I have brought my colleagues from India here to get a true taste of the West (we drink beer and eat french fries and not the meat). The day I came with a friend from India, a group of bikers came in and one of them sauntered over to our table and said he had never met an Indian from India.....after a 30 minute conversation he was letting my friend sit on his Harley. You know that story is still circulating in Delhi.

Lulu&#39;s offers many things for many people. There are several horse shoe pits in the back yard along with tables for watching and drinking. The cook your own steak pit is out there too. The inside is divided into several sections:

1) The sports area....pool table and air hockey, 
2) The bar with those video games and the TVs
3) The dance floor and stage....the groups are always changing
4) The dining area (white table cloths) and Western decor and a decent view of DIA 

The clientele is vast: bikers, cowboys, ranchers, wanna be cowboys, and city people out for an interesting lunch or dinner with friends. If you know how to do the two step, you will dance the night away. Be sure to keep your beer bottle in your back pocket to look cool. 

5 star rating for the whole package."

The best thing about my pasta primavera dinner was the garlic bread. Instead of tasting heavy butter, they seem  to use mostly olive oil.

Mici reminds me of a Chipotle aesthetically, but the food is much better (and obviously a different type of cuisine). After reading others&#39; reviews I decided to give this place a shot. I ordered the tortalini with chicken which was pretty good, but not hot enough (I like piping hot food) nor did it have a lot of flavor (missing salt and garlic). My wife ordered Amatriciana with chicken which was actually really good (and super hot). Would give my dish a 3, but her&#39;s a 5 for the price point. Gelato was also pretty good for how expensive it was."

I opted for the pasta and had the TORTELLINI ALLA MICELI with sausage. It was pretty bomb, and it was paired with garlic bread - the kind you&#39;d get as an appetizer at a restaurant, dipped in olive oil. Ahhh yeah.

Needing to eat something before the GABF, a group of us stopped in here. The wait was around 25 minutes which the cashier who took our order had told us ahead of time. I split the Molto Carne and it was just the right amount of food for a snack. Upon your initial gander at the menu, one may assume this is the typical meat-a-palooza calzone that most Italian places would offer on their menu. For the most part, you&#39;d be right. However, this one had a light and crispy crust that was enjoyable. The inside had nice, melty cheese, Italian sausage, pepperoni and meatballs. It didn&#39;t have a lot of grease that would make you think you just struck oil. I&#39;d stop by this place again for sure whenever I&#39;m in the area and want a good calzone.

I asked for a pizza with capicolla, sausage and fresh basil, and a glass of pinot grigio.  I got lucky with the latter, they don&#39;t serve it by the glass (an Italian joint?) but they had an open bottle.  My pizza came out and the cook walked by and with a quick glance noticed that the basil had been left off, even before I had, and promptly corrected this.  The pizza itself overall was not terribly impressive.  The crust and sauce were bland, the toppings were generous but also lacking in flavor.

A good plus for a downtown spot like this is that they offer curbside service pick up, and also take and bake pies.

I had never heard of it before that.  I contacted them and was put in touch with one of the owners.  She was very nice, knowledgable and responsive.  She thought of things I hadn&#39;t thought of.  She was very helpful throughout the process.  My daughter and her fiance&#39; scheduled a tasting so they could decide exactly what dishes they wanted.  They prepared quite a spread for the couple to try things out, and they sent the leftovers home with them.  A few days before the wedding, we were firming up the details and I happened to mention that I can&#39;t eat any of the pasta due to my gluten and dairy allergies, and they insisted they bring me a gluten free, dairy free pizza when they deliver the rest of the food.  I thought that was very nice.  The delivery went smoothly and they helped to set it all up.  People at the wedding reception raved about the food and asked where we got it.  I also enjoyed the pizza made specially for me.  

I gave Mici&#39;s 4 instead of 5 stars because their new payment system wasn&#39;t great.  The contract had stated that I needed to put a percentage down when I signed.  However, they really weren&#39;t set up for that.  They tried to do something creative, and I saw the charge pending in my checking account, but it never actually went through.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t realize this until after the wedding when I was hit with a second charge that I hadn&#39;t been expecting because I didn&#39;t realize that the first charge hadn&#39;t actually gone through.  They were very nice and helped me to figure things out, but that didn&#39;t take away the inconvenience.

While the portions are quite large, the quality is quite poor.  I ordered the Amatriciana - Penne pasta in a marinara sauce with pancetta, onion and crushed red pepper, $9.25.  I ordered mine with extra chicken.  They are either very skimpy with their chicken portions, or they forgot my extra chicken that I paid for.  I only had a few strips of chicken throughout the entire thing.  The chicken tasted like it had been precooked and heated up in the microwave.  It was also very dry.  The marinara sauce was pretty good and had a nice kick of heat to it, but there was not enough of it.  I had about 3 servings of pasta, and about one big spoonful of sauce.  The pasta was overcooked and slightly mushy.  The bread was really bad.  It was soggy and chewy, and slimy with tons of butter.

I ordered takeout and the ordering process was very easy.  I was told when my order would be ready, and I actually showed up late, and then had to wait about 5 minutes longer for it to be ready.  It was nice and hot by the time I got back to my hotel room though.

If in Denver again, I would probably not go back.  But it was decent enough for a quick dinner that was close by."

I was expecting it to be a much better version of Noodles &amp; Co. Based on how they market themselves, I was expecting a really quality meal with &#34;exceptional&#34; ingredients. This is not  what we got. 

My boyfriend ordered the pesto pasta and I got the rosa. We both ordered our dishes with chicken in them. Have you ever gone to the grocery store and bought the giant bag of Tyson grilled chicken breast strips? Yea.... that&#39;s the chicken that was in this dish. Artificial grill marks and everything. It was rubbery and flavorless. I ended up pushing the chicken to the side... which is incredibly out of character for me as a die hard member of the clean plate club. The sauce was not very flavorful, but at least it was edible unlike the chicken so that I didn&#39;t leave completely hungry.

The one thing that did earn them two stars rather than one was the service. The woman working let me sample their wines to decide which one I wanted, and was very attentive to our needs. 

Maybe their pizza is where they shine, but I really think they should work on the quality of all of their products if they are going to claim to have quality, handcrafted ingredients. I&#39;d like to support a small business, but I think that next time I&#39;ll just go to Noodles &amp; Co. and get better quality and flavor."

Even when I thought they were having an off night, under loading their product, other considerations kept me coming back. Tonight changed that. Ordered online, got an automatic confirmation of the delivery time, waited. Waited. Traffic, maybe--even though the traffic between Stout and my apartment would not be bad. Phoned. Asked politely about where the order was. Got excuses. No apology. By this time, order was 20 minutes late. Asked again, politely, what would happen if the pizza arrived cold. Snippy order guy said he didn&#39;t want to make &#34;preemptive arrangements&#34; before we knew what was going on. Pizza arrived 20 minutes late. It was cold. The delivery person said that, no, traffic wasn&#39;t bad where she&#39;d traveled from. A little customer service goes a long way...so does the lack of it. I was a good customer, and a loyal one.

All their ingredients tasted freshly cut. The dough used on the pizzas were perfectly crunchy and soft. Marinera &amp; Pesto sauces were delicious! Get an extra side for dipping the crust! 

Salad dela casa was simple yet so yummy. Baby greens, red grapes sliced in half tossed with walnuts, crumbled cheese and a creamy balsamic dressing. 

16&#34; Pizza and 1 bottle wine for $25!!! House pinot grigio was whatever but it gave me the buzz I needed. Pizza was AMAZING. Splittable by 3 adults. You can request different toppings on each half including their signature style pizzas!

Pros: Great website for ordering, Crust is tasty

Cons: estimated 45-75 minutes, delivered in 75 minutes exactly. Delivered wrong salad which was also very small and wilted/browning lettuce. Not edible, threw it out. Pizza was greasy (see pics) and crust in the middle was very soggy so if you hold a slice and try to fold it the end just flops down.  The cheese was kind of clumpy, not gooey. A little pricey for what you get.

I like the place and the food when you dine in and get a personal pizza.  For delivery, I would not order again. There are many better pizza delivery places for a lower price (in no particular order): Cosmo&#39;s, Mile High, Joey&#39;s."

I ordered a personal Vela pizza - a rich and delicious combination of olive oil, mozzarella, provolone, ricotta, and Italian sausage. Yes it was heavy cheese overload but perfect for what I was looking for. I know it&#39;s a good pizza when the crust is delicious on its own and at Mici, it is.

What to do? Had pizza the other night and Chinese food would not suit our cravings. Well lets jump on to the trusty website Yelp and see what there is to choose from.

   Fast forward to Mici, the options looked wonderful and the idea of having a panini delivered to us was already mouth watering. We order on their online order menu. They said it would take 45-75 minutes. Once the food was delivered an hour later, which was within there time frame, I started to worry. It already felt cold. I got one of the panini&#39;s and it was tough, dry and cold... it seemed as though it had been sitting in the car for at least a half hour. The only saving grace of my whole meal was the TINY caprese salad, which despite its size was delicious.

It&#39;s like a blood infusion when I&#39;m down a couple of pints.  When I need a tomato-y, meaty, carb and red sauce infusion and I&#39;m working downtown, I always head to Mici.  If the Cortonese pasta is what my body demands, the Cortonese pasta is what my body gets.  The sauce is a perfect meat sauce.  You get the slightly sweet, slightly acidic flavor of the tomatoes coupled with a perfect amount of meat so as to complement but not overshadow the tomatoes.  Garlic rounds out the flavors and gives the sauce a nice tang on top of the acid from the tomatoes.  It&#39;s so satisfying.  Add a dense yet perfectly textured meatball, and you have the perfect lunch for this half Italian, half Anglo mutt boy.  

Their pizza is pretty good too, although I won&#39;t rave about that like I will the Cortonese.  Mici is good for sandwiches, as well.  I&#39;ve had the Chicken Parm sandwich, and it was delicious.  I can&#39;t wait to try their meatball sandy.  

I also just found out they do Lasagna all day on Tuesdays.  I wish I had known, I would have tried it out.  Next week!"

For that I would give them a 5.  BUT, at least at the downtown location, they routinely add a little to the bill.  It&#39;s always just a tiny amount, certainly not enough to go argue about, but isn&#39;t that illegal?  For instance, I ordered a sandwich the last time I was there and the total bill, per the receipt, was $8.50.  I added $1.  Then my credit card was charged $9.64.

Conveniently located on the southwest corner of Peoria and Mississippi, this fabulous find will soon become your go-to place for edibles from the East African nation of Eritrea!

(Now, before you ask - no, this place is no relation to the long-closed cafe on East Colfax with the same name. That was Ethiopian, and Meskerem is a very popular woman&#39;s name in both countries).

Plop yourself down at a table - yes they even have the circular wicker-topped ones known as Mesob if you&#39;d like to eat in a more traditional fashion (stop slouching!) - and have a look at the menu. To start, you could try a couple slices of the soft, lightly-spiced bread known as Hambasha, sided with the zesty sauce called Awaze (usually made by combining the multi-purpose spice paste Berbere with honey wine, known in Tigrinya as Mies). Then again, the lentil salad Azifa, rich with ginger and Senafitch [native mustard] is always a palate-pleaser. 

As tempting as it might be to fill up on starters, don&#39;t forget about main courses either! The meat/tomato/onion stirfry called Tibse is one of Eritrea&#39;s national dishes, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Meskerem offers several versions, like Goden (with beef shortribs) and Zilzil (with strips of steak) just to name a couple. But perhaps you&#39;d like to try the combination called Misto which, true to its name (a nod to Eritrea&#39;s Italian heritage) offers you a beef dish, then ups the ante with a lamb one, giving you even more delicious choices. Vegetarians and vegans, don&#39;t fret! They&#39;ve got you covered too, with dishes like &#39;Ater Alicha, made with creamy yellow split peas, and Hamli, with soft, earthy collard greens.

And if you&#39;re an early bird, you&#39;ll just love the breakfast menu, with outstanding offerings such as Quanta Firfir (dried beef stewed in tomato sauce, then mixed with the fermented flatbread variously known as Taita or Injera), and Kinche (cracked wheat liberally dappled with spiced clarified butter). In another homage to Italy, there&#39;s even a frittata available.

So embark on an East African excursion at Meskerem. I can pretty much guarantee that your first visit won&#39;t be your last."

With family in town, we spent the majority of the day near Civic Center Park. lo and behold, 100% was 100% on my radar. Adding to the fun, the silhouetted Pokemon out front was worth a 10% discount if you guessed it right.

The two queso dips were outstanding and the chips (as expected) were flowing endlessly from the kitchen. Guacamole only added compliment to excellence. For every meal that came to our table that night, seafood, chicken, and the like, everything was perfect.

My one complaint, and this clearly did not take away from the overall experience, was that the whole restaurant was shrouded in smoke from the kitchen for some time. But, it did clear eventually."

First of all this place is extremely overpriced not a single person got out of here for under $50. I&#39;m fine paying for quality, service and atmosphere but this place seems to be lacking in these areas.

Also the main reason this place was picked was because on line it says &#34;Happy Hour - 7 Days a week in dining room 3PM - 6PM 9PM - Close&#34; we were there after 9 and asked for a happy hour menu and were told they didn&#39;t &#34;need&#34; to have a happy hour that night.

I still stand by it. The whole experience here left me rather ticked off.  We stopped in on Cinco De Mayo as part of a group.  This place had basically been added to the to-do list by accident.  Upon walking in, we realized it was a bit more of an upscale experience than that for which we were looking.  The place was almost empty on a Saturday afternoon.  I asked it they could put our group on the large high-top table near the bar.  Apparently they did not want to clear the dishes on the end of it.  So, they set about preparing a different set of tables for us.  When our numbers swelled, they reluctantly seated us at the high-top.  We asked several times if they were sure they wanted a &#34;partying group&#34;, and they said yes they did.  However, the service did not live up to this affirmation.

At one point the waiter rudely told people to &#34;quit playing musical chairs&#34; . . . we should have left then.  Later, when one younger member of our group went to use the restroom, he was basically accused by staff of having wandered in off the street to use the bathroom.  Yep, they came off looking like total dicks in this interaction.

In summation, this place is overpriced.  Yes, I am sure they are rightfully proud of their extensive tequila collection.  And, if you want to try the best of tequilas, and cost is not an object, then you may want to check them out.  But, the prices are high, and the food is B.S, foo-foo, fancy-schmancy small plates."

We were promptly greeted at the door and seated, finding the restaurant nearly empty, as one would expect at 1130 on a Sunday. 

Chips and salsa arrived immediately as did a lengthy drink menu, brunch menu (11-2?), and regular menu. Chips tasted like they were just made and were lighted salted. Good start.  

The regulars (tacos, enchiladas, burritos, etc.) were all available, but the star of the show is the Molcajete Caliente--a mix of melted cheese and 4 types of meat that comes with 3 (corn) tortillas and, if you want, rice and beans. Absolutely the best!  

Drinks, unfortunately, were too strong--usually, a heavy pour is welcomed, but the margarita tasted more like a tequila shot than a mixed drink. Easily fixed, and the staff was very accommodating. 

Bathrooms were exceptionally clean and posh, as you would see in a high-end club. A bit out of place decor-wise, but a pleasant surprise compared to so many other restaurants.  

10% discount with the Yelp check-in, taking off a few dollars from a place that&#39;s $$.

For drinks we all ordered Margarita&#39;s which you do get the plastic &#34;Here is a picture of all our colorful options&#34; which is never the best sign. I went with the Spicy Mango Margarita which enjoyed very much! It had a nice compliment with the sweet mango and earthy flavor of the jalapeno, and not to spicy!

For dinner I had a fish taco, shrimp taco, and carne asada. All were delicious but a little small. I would say that I was content after having the three but could have had a bit more to eat.

I did have a quesadilla and a marg at the restaurant and they were fine.  It was happy hour, so, they were very reasonably priced.  The service was sub-standard.  After 15 minutes, I asked someone if I could order a drink.  I will never understand why and how Denver restaurants condone this kind of poor, lazy service, but, it&#39;s pretty consistent every where I go in this town.

Yet I appreciate that most good Mexican restaurants are affordable, family-run restaurants that bring out delicious food at low cost.

Not to say that there is no room for upscale Mexican. I love both Tamayo and Chile Verde for their regional, chef-inspired Mexican cuisines that use better quality ingredients and sophisticated techniques. I will always pay more for food that is higher quality.

But then there are places that are &#34;Mexican&#34; that seem to charge those higher prices without actually making their food any better than the affordable restaurants. Usually they have some variation of &#34;Margaritas&#34;  or are called a &#34;Taco bar&#34; and often are more geared to drunken yuppie happy hours than good food. Rent increases in Denver seems to have pushed out a lot of the affordable family-run restaurants and increased the number of expensive &#34;yuppie&#34; Mexican places.

I am actually not sure where 100% de Agave fits in all of this. On the one hand, their decor is off...it looks less Mexican and and more like a hotel bar with white tablecloths, fancy stonework and plush seats. But at least its not filled to the brim with Mexican kitsch in an attempt at faux-authenticity. 

The food is interesting because it really doesn&#39;t seem like white-tablecloth type food. Rather its simple quesadillas and burritos and $16! fajitas. Yet there are some good things on their menu like the poblano creme chicken and wide selection of seafood dishes that do elevate the cuisine a bit beyond the a typical Mexican restaurant.

And damn if the food isn&#39;t pretty good overall, even if it is overpriced."

The food was very good, and our server Jennifer was charming and knew the menu, especially helpful when it came to the mushroom salsa, which I like a lot, but my friend had never encountered. My friend ordered a beer and she brought out the bottle but no glass, which she rectified as soon as he asked her. 

It&#39;s not your typical Mexican restaurant. In my book, that&#39;s a good thing."

My family was in town for Texas and as you can imagine they are hard to please when it comes to proper Mexican food.  They were floored at how flavorful and authentic the food was, in fact they keep bringing it up every time we talk about the trip.  I highly recommend trying this place order yourself a margarita enjoy the chips and salsa and get yourself the steak burrito."

My boyfriend and I stopped in here the other day for some dinner. We were seated immediately and were brought chips and salsa (stale chips - flavorless salsa). We sat in a VERY hot restaurant for 20 minutes, at least, with no water, no wait staff. Nothing. There were people who worked there shuffling about, but no one came to our table.

We just got up and left. We will never go back. You shouldn&#39;t either."

Although it was busy, they were able to seat us right away. There were a ton of staff on the floor. We were presented with salty chips and salsa. The host told us abruptly &#34;your server will be right with you&#34; and didn&#39;t ask if we needed waters or anything.  The temperature was very warm and stuffy. Twenty minutes later, no server. No water or margaritas to wash down the salty chips. No pricing transparency on the cocktail menu (this is an out-dated practice). Our neighbor tables were getting plenty of service. I couldn&#39;t even tell you how the food was because we got up and left. Nobody noticed, which further instilled my distaste for the establishment.

We arrived in casual wear (we just got home from skiing) and the rest of the male guests were wearing collared shirts, tucked in. Female guests also dressed up in fancy pants attire. We were wearing jeans and an un-tucked sweatshirts. Was this why nobody paid attention to us?

We went to Illegal Pete&#39;s on South Broadway which is much more &#34;our scene&#34; and their food is always great. If you&#39;re out for a casual night of tacos and margaritas, 100% de Agave is not a choice you should consider."

My two favorite food items would be the quesadillas and the enchiladas. The chicken quesadillas come drizzled with sour cream with lettuce, tomatos, and guacamole in the center of the plate. For the $10, you get a very generous portion size. This is usually the go to sharing plate when I&#39;ve been here for happy hour."

The margaritas are tasty, but this drink is the real treat -- House mix, your choice of beer (Pacifico for me) which pairs perfectly with the beef burrito. Portions were huge and more than satisfying. 

Fresh made tortilla chips with fresh salsa and mushroom/onion/pepper tapenade were a great (complimentary) start. Great serving sizes, wonderful flavor combinations, and a nice upscale atmosphere.

FANTASTIC service from our servers as well as the rest of the staff. Wonderful welcome meal for my first night in Denver."

My girlfriend and 1 went on a Monday when margaritas are 50% and we had 14 of them. I was flabbergasted when we were not given a single free drink. Never in my life have I ordered 14 drinks from a bar without getting ONE free drink. 

Also, my girlfriends meal came with &#34;pico de gallo&#34;. I put it on quotations because their pico de gallo is cabbage with tomatoes. When we requested actual pico de gallo, we were charged and additional $2.00.

The food was good, but because of their lack of concern for their partons, I will not be returning."

The warm and inviting interior is deceptively large.  The dining room and bar area are each comfortably sized and masterfully separated into their own private zones.  Kudos, space planner!

We walked right in and sat down without a wait on a Friday night.  We were promptly presented with warm chips, making me wonder if they were made in-house, and two kinds of salsa.  The traditional red was good, if a bit sweet.  The house special mushroom salsa was very interesting and flavorful.  Our knowledgeable and friendly server walked us through the menu and helped Mr. P. navigate the extensive tequila menu.  The two he chose made for easy drinking and I, of course, had to taste for myself.  The Tequila 7 Leguas has just a hint of sweetness and the Dos Amigos Tequila was sweeter still but mild enough for me to be able to sip on a full shot.  This time, though, I stuck with the festive La Colorada margarita (made with Don Julio Blanco, Cointreau, cranberry juice, and fresh citrus juices).

I was excited to see several different kinds of seafood options on the menu.  We simply couldn&#39;t pass up the wonderfully delicious ceviche and ordered ours with shrimp and the traditional marinade (you can also get it with fish, octopus, or scallops with a tamarid or mango marinade).  In keeping with the shrimp theme, I had the Camarones de Veracruz for my entree.  It was unexpectedly hot and spicy (I mean mouth-burning spicy!) but super tasty.  Thankfully, it came with some refreshing jicima slaw to tame the heat and the obligatory rice and black beans.
 
Prices here are all over the map from $9 burritos to a $40 filet mignon special, making it both a really nice place to get your usual Mexican meal or a place have a more upscale cultural experience with seafood and steak.  The choice is yours.  Just don&#39;t forget the tequila."

It&#39;s been my home away from home as far as food and an atmosphere to relax and have a good time. I miss the old days when Noe and Manny use to run this spot.

Until recently they have cracked down on security to the point where it&#39;s become a direct violation of my rights. They believe in the philology &#34;guilty until proven innocent&#34;, rather than &#34;innocent until proven guilty.&#34; I have recalled countless times when the security guard has stopped patrons and has obnoxiously searched purses, bags and patted down and used a metal detector on said patrons. Where the fuck am I? This is south Broadway for Gods sake. It makes me feel uncomfortable to see my fellow customers being treated this way. I felt as if I was in a third world country traveling back to the United States coming through customs. It&#39;s completely uncalled for and borderline harassment. 

It didn&#39;t bother me too much until my girlfriend became a victim of this harassment. She was a bit intoxicated and was exiting the building to join me as the security guard grabbed her (not the first time he&#39;s inappropriately touched a woman) and tried to search her purse as she peacefully tried to leave. My girlfriend is 5&#39;3&#34;, Colombian, beautiful and highly intelligent. The security guard is 6&#39;5&#34; black, old and creepy. Obvious instinct told her to get away from this strange man so she ran to me as he shouted and chased her. I explained to him that her English is not the best and to please leave her alone as he continued to shout obnoxious things from the doorway. 

I immediately walked back inside to speak with the owner about this incident. He said due to recent looting during their &#34;karaoke&#34; nights, they crack down on security (harassment). This is no excuse. I have a solution for you. Fucking close down karaoke homie. Simple. You don&#39;t need to harass us good people for the few bad apples.

I use to love this place but until you change your harassment policy, you can say goodbye to me and the many people I have referred this place to."

I&#39;ve always had great experiences here and I&#39;m such a fan of their &#39;margarita Mondays&#39;. You can&#39;t get better than two for one and they usually have a pretty good selection of flavors. 

I&#39;ve had the street tacos, the burrito, and the ceviche several times. Each one of them is packed with flavor and sure not to steer your stomach wrong. The entrees are pretty big portions as well as the appetizers. The service is usually great, unless you come in on the weekends in the evening. They tend to get decently busy, so your service might be a bit slower, but its worth the wait.

It&#39;s not terrible at all but there&#39;s only so much fluff that can cover up okay tasting food. However, there are still some great things about this place.

Let&#39;s talk about eye candy, shall we? Man alive, there are some good looking fellas that work here. That&#39;s worth two stars alone! They are really nice too so there&#39;s always a good reason to stop by. 

The atmosphere is really cool. I prefer to sit at the back of the restaurant by the bar. It&#39;s very open and welcoming (if you know to head to the back). With a great location, 100% has a decent happy hour as well. It&#39;s worth stopping in for sure.

The food is very &#34;meh&#34; in my book. They add a lot of flare to their dishes which doesn&#39;t change my mind about the basic tastes. Don&#39;t get me wring, it&#39;s edible and has some spice but I don&#39;t crave the food. When in a pinch, it&#39;ll do.

I say stop in for the hot employees, the happy hour drinks, and the laid back atmosphere. It&#39;s a decent place and I hope it sticks around for a while..."

I keep thinking maybe it was just an off day - but again today - they were just SO off. 

Not one person said thank you. I waited 19 MINUTES for someone to acknowledge me and get my check at the end of my meal with EMPTY drinks - which is really rude when most the people for lunch are on their lunch hour. Yes, I just spent a 3rd of it waiting for my 16 year old inexperienced waitress to drop my over-priced check without a thank you or apology for the LENGTHY wait.

I am not going back. The food has gone from great to &#34;ok&#34;... and with service like that, it&#39;s just not worth it. There are SO many other options for low cost, AMAZING Mexican food in Colorado - why bother with the crappy service?"

This restaurant is conveniently located on the southwest corner of 10th and Lincoln. Try it, you will LOVE it!

Interior - The interior is much larger inside than expected. When you enter, there is a separate waiting area, nicely separated from the rest of the dining room, yet still part of the restaurant.  Patrons in the restaurant don&#39;t have to feel &#34;rushed,&#34; as they won&#39;t see the other patrons waiting to be seated. I appreciated this. A separate waiting area is very nice to see in a restaurant.

The interior of the restaurant is done in earth tones - browns, tans, blacks, oranges, reds. There is soft amber lighting, hanging from the black ceiling. The black ceiling makes the ceiling &#34;disappear.&#34; The floors are wooden.

There are ten tables that seat two, approximately six tables that seat four, and 5 booths. There is a large &#34;community&#34; type bar table that seats approximately 18 people. This table has nice &#34;star&#34; lights above them. I liked them, very cute, subtle too. 

The lovely music playing in the background, is just loud enough to hear, but not too loud that you can&#39;t hear others in your dining party. Thank you for that! I&#39;m getting older, and it&#39;s so nice to be able to hear those you are with.  

Bar - The Bar area in the back, is quite a surprise! When you are in the restaurant, you are not aware of the bar area in the back, and vice versa. This area has five televisions, and plenty of seating for several large groups. In fact, there were several large groups there, as I took a look around. There are two oval tables, which comfortably seat six people, two large bar &#34;community&#34; tables, and other individual tables. Oh, the bar! The bar comfortably seats 18 people - no kidding!

Food- Appetizers, Soups, Vegetarian, Pollo, Seafood, Salads, Desserts.

The first night we split:
a.   Pepes Street Tacos - carne asada, and pollo asado, with cilantro, onion, whole beans, and picante sauce. We enjoyed these, and just the right size too.  We will order these again. 

b.  Flautas de Pollo - three chicken flautas, mild salsa, queso, avocado, and black bean puree. These were good, but I&#39;d order the tacos over these. I just liked the tacos, what can I say?

c.  Soap de Tortilla - WOW!!!!  We only ordered a cup, but WOW, that cup was absolutely De-Lic-ious!  Homemade, and full of large chunks of chicken and veggies.     Simply YUMMY!!!!

d.  Flan de Rompope - Good enough to split for two, if you need just a little bit of sweet goodness after your meal. 

The second night (the very next night, what can I say, I really liked it!):
a.  We split the grilled chicken burrito - This was very good, and easily split between the two of us. Good, nicely done. We really enjoyed the green chili that topped the burrito, nice flavors!

Drinks - full bar. My husband had the house margarita both nights. He said the margarita was not overly sweet, that you can taste the tequila, it had a nice bit to it. 

Chips and Salsa - you are brought chips and salsa when you first sit down. The chips are not too salty, which many can be. The salsa has a little bit of a &#34;kick.&#34; The other &#34;salsa&#34; that they bring out is what I really want to talk about here. It is chopped veggies, and Oh My Gosh! There are onions, cilantro, carrots, and few other things. WOW!!! YUMMY!!!  Please bring me a bowl of this! I don&#39;t know what it was about it, but I just absolutely LOVED it!!! L-O-V-E-D  IT!!

Restrooms - beautiful, and clean! You MUST check out the restrooms. The old saying, &#34;if the bathrooms are clean, then the kitchen is too.&#34; Well, the kitchen must be spotless!!! 

Happy Hour - runs daily from 3pm - 6pm (double check their website, or give them a call). I told my co-workers about this restaurant, and I think we will be going there the next day or two, for lunch, and most likely, a Happy Hour too!

Prices - very well priced, won&#39;t &#34;break the bank.&#34;

Parking - street, or, get this, free parking in the garage! You can&#39;t beat that!

So, do we like 100% de Agave?   You betcha!
We have been there two nights in a row, and like I said, I believe my co-workers and I will be going for lunch in the next day or two as well. I&#39;m Happy!

LOVE  IT!!!! Can&#39;t wait to try more!!!!
See you there!
Update- We&#39;ve been back several more times, 5 times now within 2 weeks, and we LOVE this place! I have also been there for lunch with 4 other co-workers! We will (most likely) have a Happy Hour (from work) here too! LOVE IT!"

Wow what a disappointment !
We thought we&#39;d have dinner. There were very few people there. Not too much of a buzz. The waiter came with water. How he managed to dump the water all over me without breaking the glass is a mystery. In any case I was completely soaked. Both the waiter and manager looked on helplessly. The water was soaking everything and they just stood there. 

No towels, no service, nothing.  
We would have stayed but I was too wet. 
Maybe the location is cursed. Each restaurant at this location has not faired very well. Maybe it&#39;s the curse of the beauvallon. 

With all of the fun restaurants in the neighborhood, I guess it will be a while before we give Agave a second chance."

My boyfriend and I have been coming here since it opened and our server brought us back again and again. He&#39;s a manager now, and we go for the gorgantuan nachos, carne asada and house frozen margaritas. Beware, they are strong. But delicious! My favorite Mexican food in Denver. Its never too busy if you go early, happy hour every day from 3-6 and then 9-close, and the new staff seems pretty cool too. Love it!"

Had the Tierra del Mar which was skirt steak and shrimps. Skirt steak was no better than I could make at home in a frying pan and the shrimp was quite bland. $23 for the whole deal and it would have been too expensive at $15. 

We also tried the tortilla soup and if you can handle all the salt it was delicious.

There&#39;s a great back bar and the servers are very kind but the lack of value and quality in the food will prevent me from returning anytime soon."

The decor is upscale and fun, the service has always been great(on the many times I&#39;ve visited).  One item of note, the fajitas are MASSIVE, large enough that you can split it with a friend.  I&#39;ve also tried the chicken salad, which I enjoyed, if you&#39;re feeling like some lighter fare.  All in all, a definite contribution to the neighborhood in a sea of &#39;meh&#39; mexican restaurants.  If south of the border is to your liking, I would recommend you trying out 100% de Agave, it does not disappoint."

I&#39;ve visited this restaurant several times and never had had any issues or complaints, until last night. I had made a reservation online for 10 people to celebrate my birthday. We arrive last night and the hostess found no reservation under my name. She called the Owner over and he also was unable to find anything. He was completely unapologetic, extremely rude and condescending. I told him this wasn&#39;t my first time making a reservation as I had already made one the year prior and had also been there on other occasions to have dinner and/or drinks at the Bar. After a long argument he offered to get us table, however he made sure to point out that my complete Party was not there and that he could not give me a table for 10 but only for how ever many people were there at the time since he needed to have all &#34;unreserved tables&#34; available. Already upset I told him if this was going to cause so much trouble, we would just take my Party elsewhere. He said that wasn&#39;t necessary and set our table. We were there for a couple of hours as my Party started to arrive. Needless to say, the place was not packed and there were several empty tables left. I later learned that my sister also had the same issue with Reservations not being honored. 

The Owner definitely needs to step off his Cloud, be more humble and learn some Customer Service skills. If he continues with his attitude of Superiority, regardless of how good the food is or isn&#39;t he will start building a negative reputation for this restaurant. I for sure am NEVER going back and letting everyone know not do so either."

I stopped in after happy hour with a few friends. As we walked in, we asked the hostess if there were any hightop tables near the bar available, she said no so we decided to check if there were any spots free at the bar. As we walked into the bar area, every hightop table was available and no one was sitting at the bar. Also, the bartenders are not knowledgeable of what is in their drinks. They were very rude.

We will not be going back there. If you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant, try Machete in Cherry Creek."

Lol) it&#39;s a fried taco with potato in it and we also got the carnitas with it. WOW. Talk about amazingness. My margarita was top notch. We played it safe with our entrees but will be more adventurous next time. I got the chicken and cheese enchiladas. Hubby got the chimichanga with chicken. Both were very, very good!

So if the owner/manager/ executive chef read this just go a little easier on the salt. 

The drinks are awesome. I got nice and toasty at lunch off some of their margaritas, the silver coin and a coronita. The drinks here are awesome and the tequila on the wall is cool too. Especially since the selection is just vast to say the least.

I work in the neighborhood and some co-workers introduced me to 100% a year ago. I&#39;m particular about Mexican food, there are few places I will go to let alone recommend to others. 

I was immediately impressed with the food presentation and the fact that the food was delicious, generous in portions and the price was more than reasonable for the quality of food received. I have frequented this restaurant numerous times for lunch, a few times for dinner, and take out and the food has been consistently great. The happy hour was great with 2-for-1 margaritas, but I really enjoy the mojitos. The table side guacamole is a crowd pleaser for sure, and so damn tasty! 

I like the break-out of the restaurant space; the front is open, comfortable and inviting. Roomy enough for big groups but also allows decent space between tables to have lunch meetings or personal conversations and not be distracted by the patrons at the table next to you.I like the touch of the open kitchen and tequila display. The bar at the back is fun, with a nice view at sunset and allows for small or big groups to hang out. Not to outshine the great the customer service, the staff is attentive, helpful and friendly.  

I have held a company party in the restaurant bar area and my guests were truly impressed with the food, presentation and service. The owner and staff were flexible in allowing us to decorate, bring in specialty desserts and even helped some when we set up. My company staff has asked me a few times when would there be another party hosted there and I just the other day I was able to bring a little 100% de Agave to the office via catering. 

I was in a bind with less than a day to have catering in place for a large group meeting and Ric was kind enough to meet right after I called him, create a menu and have the food delivered less than 24 hours later to my office. It was a quiet meeting, since everyone was so intent on eating.They loved every bit of it from the guacamole and shrimp ceviche to the tacos de papas and empanadas de picadillo. We had so much that additional staff were able to sample the goods and now can&#39;t wait to try the restaurant. 

I can&#39;t say what dish I like best, I&#39;m slowly making my way through the menu before I give a final opinion (but the torta de carnitas is amazing!). I look forward to the next visit or catering, this place is definitely at the top of my list of great Denver restaurants."

I&#39;ll start off by saying we were all more than happy with our main courses. However, our waiter had to be reminded a few times to grab our drinks, even though we were located right by the bar and the place wasn&#39;t busy.

Then dessert time came around and we all saved room specifically for their fried ice cream (we ordered three of them, a total of $18). After seeing photos on Yelp and on their menu, we were all on the edge of our seats. What came out was something entirely different. They took ice cream and covered it in oatmeal... Not even fried warm oatmeal, but undercooked COLD oatmeal. I called the waiter over and asked him what he brought us, as we were expecting FRIED ice cream.. You know, warm crispy outside, and cool ice cream inside. He said they changed the recipe recently. We all could not believe they changed the recipe, and still think they just didn&#39;t want to go through the effort. Who in their right mind would change &#34;fried&#34; ice cream to ice cream rolled in undercooked cold oats?! We were all extremely disappointed and sent our dishes back.

This place could have been one of our new favorites, but after the slow service (the place was almost empty) and the highly disappointing dessert, I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll be back. If the recipe was actually changed., change it back!! Or at least change the description, name, and photo on your menu. Not cool."

I have been here a few times now and it deserves a great review! Happy hour is awesome! They have a late night one with food that is crazy good!

We went for dinner on Friday, not too crowded but we were early to get a happy hour drink before 6! By the time we left, the place was fairly full. 

The service is great, the design is awesome and there is a front dining area and a back bar area with a sweet view. The bathroom is a trip with a large window right onto the street in the sink area. 

The food is great! I have had quesadillas, tortas, tacos, and who know what else as I was enjoying those margs so much! They have all sorts of fancy tequilas and flavored margaritas. The location is great and it feels authentic, fancy, and laid back. I love how it is affordable and yet high quality. I need to get over here more often!"

If you show up on a night that they are hosting the UFC fight be ready for a $10 per person cover charge that they won&#39;t tell you about until they are walking around with wrist bands. 

The owner or manager didn&#39;t want to let us stay after spending over $100 before the fights even started!! We had to negotiate for him to let us stay and he wouldn&#39;t refund our friends $20 that he charged after letting us know we could stay. 

It took about 20 minutes for him to come back and apologize for the miscommunication and let us know we could stay. As a business owner/manager I know you have expenses to cover but is $10 really worth a fight and loosing a customer? To them I guess it is!

Come here for the tequila and that&#39;s about it!"

I noticed this place on Yelp a few months ago and have been meaning to go check it out for some time. From the reviews I thought it would be yet another upscale taco joint. Was I wrong!

While they have a huge &#34;cantina&#34; section and do offer tacos, they&#39;re much, much more. Hidden inconspicuously in a commercial complex on Broadway, the main dining room is quite welcoming and very stylish, with nice finishes, lighting and designer touches. It was so nice that it highlighted, unfortunately, that most of the patrons, wearing flip flops and hoodies, seemed out-of-place.

Their menu is extensive and quite unique for the Denver Mexican scene. Our server suggested it was &#34;Jalisco&#34; style. I call it tasty! Their signature items come in molcajetes, which is pretty cool. I had the Molcajete Caliente, which was extremely good with perfectly marinated and grilled steak, chicken, pork and chorizo along with nopales and a tasty spicy red sauce. It&#39;s kind of like glorified fajitas, but very, very good. Their margaritas were very good, made with fresh lime.

Service, I have to add, was the best I&#39;ve had in a long, long time. Starting with the hostess who was very welcoming, to the server, who was spot-on with her service, to even the managers and bussers that came by the table when we were there.

If we lived closer we&#39;d be there all the time. Highly recommended."

Went for a work birthday lunch yesterday afternoon.  I had the Tampiquena - carne asada with a mole enchilada.  OMG.  I am generally not a huge mole lover, that enchilada was the best one I have had in many years!  The mole with the mexican cheese was not greasy at all.  Every bite was better than the last one.  The carne asada was also prepared perfectly.  The slaw that came with was EPIC.  It was cabbage and cactus and cilantro and lime and heaven.  The chips and salsa were delicious as well.  The rest of the food at the table looked (and reportedly was) very good.  Next time I go, I am taking my daughter and we are going to order Carne Molcajete Caliente - one of my friends had it and it was better than my food which is fairly unbelievable.  I had churro y chocolate for dessert and they were perfect.  The fried ice cream is covered in oatmeal granola instead of the usual cornflakes.

I was a bit hesitant when we walked in and it felt trendy (beautiful decor) and wondered if good REAL Mexican could exist there.  It definitely did.  Service was great.  Tequila list was long.  

I can&#39;t write anymore now.  It&#39;s making me hungry...I&#39;ll update at next visit."

So we thought we would book a reservation for four people for Father&#39;s Day on Saturday evening to avoid the Sunday rush.  When I arrived for 5 PM reservation we were blown away to see that the dining room was occupied by a mass of people and a very very very loud band. Had to yell at the receptionist to give her my name and she tried to seat us in the back room where the bar was. The table was not even set up, and on top of the sound of the band in the front room we now also had the sound of the bar music. To say the least the entire experience sucked, we left and went somewhere else but I find it unacceptable you would take dinner reservations when you&#39;re having this kind of a show going on Thumbs down forever, this place has good food but no clue how to run a restaurant"

The mahi mahi was very fresh and cooked just right. Also had some of my girlfriend&#39;s fries, which were excellent.

The icing on the cake here was the considerate woman who I spoke with on the phone to see what time they closed. When we arrived, she asked us if we were the people who called, and that she always wants to make sure the kitchen stays open if customers are on the way. Really wonderful experience."

It&#39;s clean and nice inside and the staff is friendly but I think the prices are crazy for a little diner on South Broadway.  Here&#39;s what we had for lunch today:

She:  cup of chowder (very good and hot today but still just a coffee cup portion) - shared some bread with me (just a sliced up commercial roll and they charge for it) and the mussels with white wine and butter sauce which were exceptional but only about a dozen and four weren&#39;t open (you don&#39;t eat those).

Me:  cup of chowder - clam strips which were a lunch special and they were horrible - could have been breaded cardboard - no clam flavor whatsoever - charged extra for fries.

Both:  1 glass of chardonnay each.  

Total:   $87 with tip  Are you kidding me?  No way will we be going back there.  I think maybe it&#39;s worth a shot just for the chowder and the mussels but man you have to watch what you&#39;re ordering or it gets really expensive - fast."

Shrimp Po&#39; Boy.  Damn.  Could call it a Prawn Po&#39; Boy and you wouldn&#39;t be exaggerating.  4-6 huge, lightly-battered shrimp with some lettuce, tomato, and a delicious remoulade.

New England Clam Chowder was legit as well.  Perfect consistency and they do not skimp on the clams.

FOOD: we loved the red chowder!  Big chunks of crab meat and lots of flavor!  The ceviche special was also pretty good!  Very light and refreshing!  We couldn&#39;t believe the reasonable price for the food considering how well it was prepared and how fresh everything was!

SERVICE: A+ all the way!  Our waiter periodically checked on us to make sure everything was ok.  He was very knowledgeable of the food and drink menu.

Nice attention to every detail. Chowder awesome - lightly creamy with small chopped potatoes and little bacon, celery, and plenty of clams topped with fresh cracked pepper. I loaded it up with hot sauce until it was pink so don&#39;t call the chowder police. 

The special was a lobster roll with fries. Big ole hunks of fresh lobster in a lobster flavored mayo served on a barely toasted egg hot dog bun. So glad I ordered this! Makes me want to try everything else on the menu.

We started out with the clam strips. They were breaded, deep fried, and delicious. I had never had clams before then, but I think I&#39;d be okay with having it again at some point!

Split a shrimp po&#39; boy and it tasted great. The shrimp was crispy and jumbo (not shrimpy - har har).

I also had the vegan curry/chowder and found it to taste pretty darn good. It had a lot of veggies that were perfectly cooked. I had the curry plain, but it would go great with jasmine rice (which they have on the menu as a side). So, order it if you get the vegan curry.

One friend had the original chowder in a bread bowl and said it was delicious. He ate the entire bread bowl too. Wow, I just couldn&#39;t even. Just wow.

The service was awesome. The waitress was fun and helpful. The owners were around and making sure everyone was satisfied.

We ordered the chowder sampler which came with the chowder of the day (blue crab chowder), spicy red chowder, and the New England clam chowder. My fave was the New England it was full of flavor and nice and creamy. The husband liked the blue crab chowder which was actually more spicy and flavorful than the spicy red seafood chowder. We also ordered the shrimp po bo sandwich and fried clams. I felt the shrimp could have been seasoned more, the slaw on the sandwich was delicious, but a bit too messy for me. Fried clams were OK, wish we ordered calamari instead.

The setting is cozy and is great for dinner. The staff is very friendly and attentive to the little things (e.g., pre-busing, never letting drinks go empty, etc.) This place is definitely &#34;as good as it gets&#34; when it comes to seafood, so you should give it a try!

Atmosphere: Cozy/quaint. We had a party of seven and were seated at a huge booth with one chair at the end. The closeness in seating actually helped everyone stay in the conversation. The restaurant is above average on noise-level.

Staff: Janet, our server, was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. She was so much fun. All of her recommendations hit the spot. The FOH in general ran very smooth with all staff helping each other run food, pre-bus, etc. I love seeing teamwork in action. Hats off to the manager for promoting this discipline.

Food: If I could give an extra star, I would. The table started out with an order of clam strips, oysters and shoestring fries. The clam strips were fried to perfection. I chose oysters from the northwest and they were both fresh and delicious. 

I started with the crab bisque of the day. So delicious. I had the BBQ Shrimp for dinner. This is probably some of the best BBQ shrimp in town and as close to New Orleans as you can get. The sauce is just pure heaven. Be sure to order at least two extra orders of the toast points that they serve on the side. You will need them to soak up the rest of the sauce!

Chowder Room does not disappoint, and true to its name, the Chowder Sampler that I tasted was delicious!  I initially ordered the 3 chowder sampler- included New England (my favorite!), spicy red chowder (done well, but I&#39;ve never been a red fan), and a crab bisque (so creamy!). I paired it with garlic toast, at the recommendation of my kind server.

After finishing my soups, I was tempted to order a Po Boy.... Even though I was getting full, I pulled the trigger.  Boy am I glad that I made that impulsive decision.  Despite having left-overs to take home, this was THE BEST Po Boy I have had in my life!  As I picked up my sandwich half, the shrimp flopped out of the sandwich- like no joke, I pushed it back in, and it still flopped out a second time.  The fried shrimps were so large and dense that I had to position my hands carefully!  As I took a bite, I was in foodie heaven.  The sauce, the crispy shrimp, and the perfectly soft hoagie bun were the perfect symphony of flavors.

Wow was I impressed. Coming from the east coast I have pretty high expectations of chowder and more specifically New England Clam Chowder. So to say I walked in with hesitation is an understatement.

The Chowder Room is a quaint little spot on Broadway that certainly picked the coastal theme décor. I think it was nicely done keeping it casual but still with a little class. They have set up their menu to try more than one item and get your seafood fix! And that is just what we did.  We tried the calamari, pretty good, the Hawaiian Poke with raw tuna, also not bad, but the Chowder is definitely the star!

They give the option of a sampler to try all three (New England, Red, and Day Special) which is the way to go. The Red was nice and light, loaded with plenty of goodness. The special which was almost the star was a Corn and Clam chowder which if they have when you get there I highly recommend. It was creamy and highlighted all the corn flavors with still complimenting the clams.  As for the New England Chowder I would go as far to say best in Denver! It was just the right thickness, loaded with potatoes, clams, celery, bacon (I would rather go without) and spices. The best part is they didn&#39;t overdue the pepper which happens EVERYWHERE!

Great spot and if your missing the coast stop in to bring you back to your happy place!"

We ate here on a Saturday evening after making reservations and hour before on opentable. We arrived a few minutes early and our table was set and ready for us. We looked at the drink menu for awhile because so many things looked so good! I decided on a glass of wine for my first beverage and Nate ordered one of their signature cocktails while we perused the food menu. Everything looked like it would be amazing! We both love most seafood so we were pretty happy with the menu selection. We started with their Chowder Sampler and the Crab Claw appetizer. The chowders were so fresh and flavorful and they all had their different taste. The traditional New England Clam Chowder was my favorite. The claws were fresh and contained a good amount of meat. For our dish, we decided to share the BBQ shrimp with an extra side of sourdough bread. I think it&#39;s a necessity to get the extra bread when ordering this dish because the sauce is too good to waste. Plus, the shrimp are huge! 
Our service was attentive the whole time, and we even decided to stay and have another cocktail for our dessert. The Cherry Ginger Fizz is an amazing cocktail and I highly recommend it! 
The ambiance is cute inside, but it&#39;s nothing too fancy if you are expecting a fancy date spot. Which I&#39;m glad it wasnt. The music is really good too!"

The chowda has a creamy broth base and not chunky with starch!, the chunkiness was highlighted through the ingredients - plump clams, perfectly cooked potatoes and bite-sized pieces of smoked bacon.  You have to taste it to believe it.

Also, ordered a side of Fried Clam Strips ($9.95) which the clams were able to shine through the light batter.

They serve a bunch of other seafood favors - bbq shrimp, crab cakes, tuna, salmon, etc.

Riley brought us the West Coast Oysters and the East Coast.   Riley explained that the East Coast oysters had a more briny, salty flavor.  West coast oysters err on the side of slightly sweet.

It opened up earlier this year and the owners (Matt + Carrie Stein) recently moved back from California to start this joint.

Our server Janet was super friendly and brought us a sampler of the three different chowders. All were good and worth trying.

They had two types of raw oysters available, one from the west coast and one from the east coast. Each was distinct and worth trying but in the end I sided with east coast oysters from the chesapeake.

BBQ shrimp is perfect with a side of jasmine rice. You eat the shrimp and the add the rice into the leftover sauce.

Mussels were delicious and like the BBQ shrimp, perfectly cooked. Nothing we had during our 5-6 courses was overcooked.

Also their garlic bread is really really good for 90 cents. Get some.

Buy your beers by the pitcher (32 oz).

The service is top notch as they continually check your beverage level and always stop in to see if the food is to your liking.  We started with peel and eat shrimp, perfectly seasoned and fresh.   We all three went with the New England clam chowder, as all the reviews state it is the best clam chowder; period.   The three of us ordered crab cakes and fried shrimp and again perfect breading.   We loved this place and then to top it off the owner brought over a piece of key lime pie for our moms 70th bday.  This is our new go to seafood place."

The husband and wife  owners came out and greeted us at the table which was a nice touch. The husband is the chef and has great eye for the freshest seafood, which is saying a lot in land-locked Denver! We had the fresh oysters, a handful of huge peel and eat shrimp and some poke. Then we tried the crab bisque and clam chowder and they were both amazing. Highly recommend seeking out this little jewel if you find yourself in Denver looking for great food."

I expected more out of the Po Boy but all I tasted was the plain white roll and the remoulade sauce. The cod/protein should have been the star and it was plain breaded cod...no flavor, nothing special. Why oyster crackers with the chowders? This isn&#39;t Long John Silvers.  Lets be creative for the price point. As plain and simple as you can expect,  not awful but I was hoping for better. Disappointed..."

The ceviche had great flavor but was mostly vegetables. The red chowder was ok, the New England was the best for sure, and the special was green chili and pork chowder which was pretty tasty. The sliders at other tables looked good. We finished with the swordfish and garlic bread. The swordfish was very good and it&#39;s hard to beat garlic bread. The food was good for us to go back. You do have to put together your own entree though cause the sides are all separate. 

The service was very good, polite and prompt. Everyone was friendly and the decor was nice. The biggest thing for us though was it was pretty loud. The music was turned up beyond the conversation noise which made it hard at times to hear the person across from you.

We&#39;ll be back again to try more of the menu for sure."

The chowder from which this restaurant garners it&#39;s name is spot on. My girlfriend had delicious mussels and our meal was very reasonably priced.  Maybe the best Po Boy I&#39;ve had since visiting New Orleans several years ago. 

In a land locked state without a ton of seafood options, this place delivers. (Well, not sure if they literally offer delivery, but the food is awesome)

I took my wife here for our anniversary and it did not disappoint. As we are both originally from Southern California, my wife and I have a certain opinion about seafood.  Colorado isn&#39;t known for fresh seafood but Chowder House proved us wrong. 

Reading a number of reviews on Yelp, I decided to try their sourdough bowl New England Style Clam Chowder. The broth was perfect. It wasn&#39;t too rich; just the way I like it. There were so many clams in it, it was overflowing. The other ingredients were definitely complimentary and did a great job adding to the flavor of the soup. My wife had the seafood chowder. If was excellent. Just the right about of spice. Very flavorful broth. The combination of different &#34;seafood&#34; was perfect.  We wanted more!!!

As an appetizer, we had the five Alaskan Snow Crab Claws. They are served over ice with two sauces. Both sauces are excellent.  Although cold, the meat was tender, flavorful, and broke apart easily with a fork. If they would offer more, we would definitely have more.

For the main course, I had the scallops and she had a 1/2 pound of the Alaskan King Crab legs. First, the scallops, were amazing. Tender, lots of flavor, perfectly seasoned and cooked. I would be remiss in saying that if they offered a twelve scallop plate, I&#39;d eat that up in a heartbeat. Now, the King Crab, it did not disappoint. The flavor was spot on, perfectly seasoned, and tender meat. Simple. That&#39;s what we love. 

Desert--their key lime pie is not too sweet or sour, light, simply delicious. The chocolate ice cream parfait, excellent. If they&#39;d make a double, and if I wasn&#39;t full, I would order it.

All in all, the service is outstanding, the price is on par with other downtown seafood restaurants (maybe a little less), the atmosphere is great, and definitely a return trip for us very soon. 

Only one complaint, albeit minor, the music is just a tad loud. Although the selection was great, the ambient noise of the restaurant with the music makes it a little harder to talk without raising our voices. I didn&#39;t want to complain as I was having a great time but be advised.

This is definitely a must return for us!!!"

chowder-room-denver,Natalia K.,BnIY7cXbUfnrEqoQdQc9Pg,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,346,7,vyGb2bch7_QG_Q9ZM8S7kQ,5.0,2015-02-18,"I fell in love with Chowder Room the second I stepped in there. It reminded me of a cozy seafood shack. The first word that comes to mind is &#34;quaint&#34; -- but in the best sense of the word. It stands in contrast to some of the new restaurants popping up in Denver that border on pretentious in their quest to be modern and hip. Instead, Chowder Room is cozy, friendly, and affordable.

THE INSIDE
The Chowder Room&#39;s decor is really a labor of love, as the chef&#39;s family built most of the interior by hand. It&#39;s the perfect mix of woods and shades of blue, with tin-pressed ceilings and themed photos and knick-knacks all over the walls. It&#39;s the kind of place you feel immediately comfortable when walking into.

THE FOOD
The menu at Chowder Room is simple and unpretentious. It doesn&#39;t confuse you with too many choices and instead presents you with just the right amount of options that all go well together and represent the restaurant perfectly. They let the seafood speak for itself, highlight it with just the right sauces, spices, and other additions. And the majority of the seafood comes from Denver-based Seattle Fish Co. -- and I&#39;m all for supporting local companies.

I recommend ordering the chowder sampler your first time here, which lets you try their classic New England clam chowder, a spicy red seafood chowder, and the chowder of the day (which is something the chef rotates every day and you can keep track of @ChowderRoomCO on Twitter).

Personally, I am in love with both the New England clam chowder and the spicy red seafood chowder. I really couldn&#39;t decide which one was my favorite and ended up taking home a bowl of both.

I&#39;ve also heard that the vegan green coconut-curry &#34;chowder&#34; with tofu and roasted veggies is absolutely amazing, even if you&#39;re not a vegan (I didn&#39;t try it because I&#39;m not a huge fan of curry).

Chowder Room doesn&#39;t just excel at its namesake. One of my favorite seafood dishes I&#39;ve ever had is the BBQ shrimp here. If you&#39;ve never been to New Orleans, you might be imagining BBQ shrimp as grilled crustaceans smothered in a sticky, semi-sweet BBQ sauce. And that thought definitely doesn&#39;t do the reality justice, because these BBQ shrimp come in an incredible spicy sauce that&#39;s inspired by Chef Stein&#39;s six favorite New Orleans recipes. Which is why I think they really needs to add &#34;spicy Cajun&#34; to the description.

THE DRINKS
The drink menu isn&#39;t long, but it&#39;s extremely well-thought-out for pairing with seafood. There are at least 3 bottles of white wine that have won the Pacific Coast Oyster Wine Competition (and they&#39;re all under $40!). My personal favorite was the Foris Pinot Blanc. It was just perfect with all the seafood we were eating, especially the spicy BBQ shrimp -- and I imagine it would be heavenly with some oysters."

The New England clam chowder was very good. We shared a cup between my husband and I before the mains

I had the mussels steamed in wine and without the pesto (from the menu). Simple dish but delicious. My husband had a fish sandwich. Simple, not greasy and good. We shared a side of fries

As soon as I stepped in I felt like I was back in Boston or Maine. The decor is reminiscent of a New England restaurant... And the smells! It smells so wonderful. We started with the calamari, which is the best I&#39;ve had in Denver hands down. I had a clam strip po&#39; boy: the clam strips were tender and not chewy and the remoulade was just right. My sister had their Soup of the Day (crab bisque) in a bread bowl, it was hearty and bright and the bread bowl was great. The boyfriend had their burger (he doesn&#39;t do seafood), NE clam chowder (except for clam chowder, go figure), and an order of fries which he happily finished. With the calamari, and a bite or two of my sister&#39;s bread bowl, I left satisfied and with half my sandwich! Our server was adorable and superb. Fantastic service and instead of bringing you a mint or something similar with your bill, you got some East Coast salt water taffy. Truly a gem of a restaurant here off Broadway.

They hardly close at 10.  Don&#39;t make reservations after 930 with full menu intentions."

I read about The Chowder Room on Thrillist&#39;s list of the &#34;14 New Denver Restaurants You Need to Check Out Immediately,&#34; and I had to check it out during their Happy Hour and see if the clam chowder could live up to our high standards. We ordered two bowls of the New England Clam Chowder and a couple of drinks to put them to the test. The clam chowder here did not disappoint; my cocktail, the Nor&#39;Easter, was tasty; and the service was outstanding. Our waiter was friendly, conversational, and knowledgeable about the food and the restaurant. When we asked about the chowder of the day, a spicy oyster chowder, he brought us a couple of samples to try for ourselves. The restaurant had a very cozy, familiar atmosphere that made me feel as if we were at a small public house along the coast, despite being in frigid Colorado in the middle of the winter.

If your looking for great northeastern style seafood this is the place and as anyone who has spent enough time in Colorado knows, it&#39;s impossible to find good seafood here.  

We ordered just about everything on the menu.  The calamari, New England clam chowder, Caesar salad, Alaskan king crab legs, muscles (in a pesto white wine sauce, so good). Oh and the best key lime pie I have ever eaten in my life.  

These are the types of restaurants I absolutely loves to find.  Located on one of the busiest streets in Denver yet you probably have never even noticed.  A diamond in the ruff by all accounts.

Located on South Broadway across from the Sam&#39;s Club, it&#39;s a smallish location and not the easiest for parking. We parked at Sam&#39;s actually and walked across.

However, regardless of the difficulties in finding it or parking, don&#39;t let it deter you! We loved the place. TheY have a limited menu but enough options for everyone in the family. We ordered the sampler trio of chowders: New England, Spicy Red and the daily special (Manhattan in this case). Delicious. Suz got the Mussels and I got the shrimp arrabbiata linguini special. The mussels were quite succulent and tasty. I lapped up the linguini and literally licked the bowl. We left completely sated.

Denver restaurants do a great job with a lot of ethnic and other regional food (e.g. Fat Sullys with NYC pizza).  That said, I should have known this would be a disaster from the start.  

They offered samples of their chowders.  I tried all 4, and none of them were very good.  3 were bland, and the 4th tasted like straight cream.  

I got a &#34;dinner salad&#34; with salmon on top.  I asked the waitress if the dinner salad was large, because I was hungry and I wasn&#39;t getting chowder (see above).  She said that they are &#34;huge&#34;.  Great - works for me!  

The salad was tiny.  The piece of salmon was 4 oz max, and there were 12 leafs of lettuce max.  To her credit, when I called her over and told her that I hoped for a bigger salad for $15, especially since she said it was &#34;huge&#34;, she took it back and made it bigger.  Problem is, they made it about 5% bigger.  Maybe added another 4 leafs of lettuce.  WHY!?  Lettuce is so cheap!  It&#39;s not like I was asking for another piece of salmon.

Sadly, I was very underwhelmed. For what they serve, it&#39;s very overpriced for lunch ...($75 for 3 people) - the quality wasn&#39;t deserving of the cost. Case in point - the crab cakes which are desperately lacking in any crab flavor what so ever- all you taste is soggy bread crumbs...the worst mistake that one can make with a good crab cake. Also, the chowder doesn&#39;t taste quite right: too much vinegar, and lacking in the creamy flavor you expect from the New England variety.

Another detail I think is a mis-step is the rack of just a few bottles of hot sauce near the front door on the wall instead of logically placed at each table..(saving money??). I&#39;m not sure who thought this was a good idea, but if the place ever gets busy ...people will be up and down, and some tables will be without. Its a strange concept not well considered. Bc of this and other oddities, it seems overall that they are skimping in areas that seem like no brainers to me...charge extra for a decent bread with your chowder? Huh? 

Also, I have to say, when I was there for lunch, I felt the owner seemed lacking in any personable nature. She almost seemed annoyed to be there. Our waiter was nice enough, but not enough so that we&#39;ll be back anytime soon. 

I hope they plan to up their game if the intention is to stay open. bc they do have a nice little spot and a good concept that Denver&#39;s been missing."

I&#39;ve had the grilled mahi mahi, clam strip special, octopus and scallop app. Key lime pie was exceptional but I thought the parfait of the day was not as good. Generally, though, haven&#39;t run into a regrettable choice. The place fills up fast so make a reservation or you&#39;ll probably end up at the community table."

There are not a lot of SEAFOOD dining places that impress me here in Colorado, but this place truly makes me feel like I&#39;m back on the East Coast.
Great food, great service and great vibes.
Without question this is THE perfect place to get your seafood cravings met. The chowders are amazing ! The shrimp perfectly breaded and the coleslaw is a thing of perfection. I&#39;m actually looking forward to trying the lobster and king Crab sometime soon....instead of waiting for my trips back home.

P.S. I even took a bite of my friends fish (not a fan of fish, sorry) and IT WAS ABSOLUTELY the best.

Is it selfish for me to not want this place to become too popular ? Sorry."

Check out their special, it is usually worth getting as it will be seasonal, surprisingly fresh, and full flavored. I recently ordered a pound of king crab as a special. It was the best crab I have had outside of the east coast. The crab came out of the shell in inch thick pieces with no white film. It was so delicate and perfect I couldn&#39;t believe I was sitting in Colorado eating it!

The chowder. Oh my the chowder. There are many days when all my girl and I want are the chowder and the fish sandwich. 

The best fish sandwich this side of the east coast!!!

Everything at this restaurant is perfect."

We got a seafood platter of oysters, shrimp and crab claws. Slightly more expensive than expected, ~$2 a bite, but yummy except for the sauces (mignonette was too sour with too many onions, and the cocktail sauce tasted like tomato and pepper soup - not bright or horseradish enough). Oysters were fresh and well shelled. Peel and eat shrimp were nice and large. Id skip the crab - no drawn butter to dip it in, as well as the crab cake, which was either frozen or made using tinned crab meat (not the good lump kind). The classic chowder has bacon in it but the broth was well balanced thickness. Overall I might come back, but I think Jax is better on flavor and price."

When I walked in, I felt  like I was whisked away to some small coastal town on the East Coast.  I&#39;m originally from Boston, so it immediately gave me warm feelings. The colors, tables, chairs, and wall decor screamed seafood restaurant and made you feel you were in the right place.

I came here with my husband, 2-year old daughter, and mother-in-law. The staff is super friendly. We were immediately greeted and sat down when we walked in. We ordered 1/2 lb peel and eat shrimp, pacific raw oysters, soup sample, bbq shrimp, crab cakes, shrimp po boy, a side of rice and a side of spinach.

Everything was delicious, but my faves were the New England Clam Chowder and the oysters. I could probably have ordered just oysters for my meal. Maybe I&#39;ll do that next time. Seriously though....those oysters were super delicious. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the bbq shrimp was a little too spicy. However, it &#39;s one of their most popular dishes so maybe it&#39;s just me. 

When they give you your check, they also give you some salt water taffy. Yum! It&#39;s a fun way to end your meal."

So I was happy to see the arrival of the Chowder Room...and more thrilled to find the NE Clam Chowder to be excellent. Everyone in our party of six got the chowder (it is the Chowder Room!) and all agreed it was perfect. 

Our crew slurped down a dozen oysters, had the rainbow trout and salmon and each dish was pronounced superb. The beer selection is decent and the prices on everything except the oysters very fair. The oysters were a bit pricey at $3 a pop, especially for those who devour them like peanuts. 

Super friendly and competent staff kept the food and drinks coming at a good pace. We felt like long time regulars by the time the main dishes were served.

Living in Seattle the past 4 years, I  have developed a very high standard for all sea food restaurants. In Colorado, I had only ever been able to find soulless, average sea food restaurants like Bone Fish Grill. 

But then my sister suggested this place, and now I&#39;m a believer! When you walk in you are immediately greeted by a cozy and cute atmosphere. The staff were all very friendly and very attentive. In fact, I am fairly certain they employ psychics, because they seemed to know if I needed something before I even had to ask.

The food was a sublime cacophony of magic and butterflies in my mouth. I started with a New England clam chowder that tasted better than any I had ever had in Seattle. I only had a cup, but I could have eaten the entire pot in the kitchen! I then had  the most delicious crab po&#39; boy I have ever tasted. With each bite I could practically hear the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing as a corona of golden light floated down to bath said po&#39; boy in angelic light! 

This is by far the best sea food place I found in Colorado. It easily competes with any restaurant in Seattle."

We came for a late lunch, and were greeted by the host. He sat us at a booth, and said the server would be right with us. 1st issue - this is a small restaurant, why is there a host AND a server? Our server came, poured us some water, and told us the special chowder (Manhattan). 

We ordered a small Nicoise salad to share. And we each got the Chowder Sampler  (New England, Spicy Red, and Manhattan ), and a side of bread. Also, we each ordered a Pivo on draft. I love Pivo,but I&#39;ve never seen it on tap, so kudos for that! 

The salad was great! The small was perfect to share as an app. The samplers arrived, and were  smaller portions than I had expected, but I was still hopeful. The New England was good, not mind blowing, but good. The Manhattan was bland. The Spicy Red, while not at all spicy, was pretty tasty. Issue #2 - the soup cups. They are not a good shape for soup, it is difficult to finish the cup because of the shape. Issue #3 - no soup spoons? Is that a traditional New England thing?

Overall, The Chowder Room seems to be trying to be something it isn&#39;t. The service seems too formal. The prices seem high. Our bill for 2 beers, a small salad, sides of bread, and 2 chowder samplers was $50 with tip. Then again, you&#39;re paying for the host and table service. It&#39;s soup, good, but not great soup."

The serious negative is the noise level.  I would think it is an audiologist paradise with the wait staff if they work there very long in this small place.

They nail the &#34;New England chowder house with a touch of class&#34; vibe, and the seafood is most definitely the best I&#39;ve ever had in Colorado. I&#39;m especially picky about chowder, as I&#39;m a big fan of the real Boston deal- and theirs is no slouch. Their cracked crab claws were so perfectly sweet and succulent I might have cried a little remembering how much I miss fresh crab (and with gladness that I now know I can get it in Denver). Their mussels were simply prepared, but fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly. My wife had scallops and she was also very happy. Oh, and service is also great- to the point that when I knocked over my wine (I talk with my hands, it&#39;s true), I was immediately offered a free replacement.

My happiness tripled when salt water taffy, flown from Atlantic City, soft and sweet and perfect arrived with my bill. 

Only qualm? Wish they sold the taffy!

The staff was super friendly (I think everyone of them said hi or talked to us at some point in the evening). The food was well cooked and presented! We started with 18 pacific oysters (the two of us consumed every bite shamelessly) and they were delightful. Next, man ordered the scallops. There were 5... Maybe 6 medium sized scallops in a sauce. They didn&#39;t taste seasoned and the sauce wasn&#39;t thick enough to flavor them much, but it wasn&#39;t anything a little salt couldn&#39;t fix. They were cooked perfectly. I ordered calamari, which was delicious. Would love to see some sort of a vinegar dressed salad (cucumber, onion and peanuts?) with it... Just for a bit more of a pop.
Desert was the strawberry shortcake for me and fried clams for man. I loved my dish, but was practically licking the plate with hopes of finding more sauce. Man loved the clam strips... Absolutely no complaints. 
We left full and happy, with about a $120 tab. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the dishes for the cost, but recognize we aren&#39;t a costal town with easy access o fresh fish. Consider this a seafood tapas place, come prepared to spend money and order EVERYTHING!

I ordered an oatmeal stout, which I know is not the best pairing but sounded as good as it was. The server over poured into the glass and it overflowed a little and so brought me another when I was finished with the first. He more than made up for a simple overfill. Service was pretty good.

I moved here from the Pacific Northwest where the Thai food is superb and bountiful.

Seriously, I have tried almost every single Thai place Denver and numerous others in the Denver metro area and none have even come close to the food here at Thai Street Food.

The pad Thai was flavorful, thick, and juicy. The ordering is unique as you choose a sauce level among dry, a little juicy, medium juicy, and very juicy. I ordered medium juicy which paired nicely over fried rice. I highly recommend this combination!

As others have said, the place is take out only and cash only. Finally, take a look at their website to know how to order when you call in.

Now that that&#39;s out of the way. The food is excellent and super spicy. Different from most Thai food places out there but feels more authentic. I can&#39;t pretend I&#39;m an expert on Thai food, but it is one of my favorite types of food so I&#39;ve eaten my fair share. My favorite dishes here are the pad kee mao (drunken noodles) and the pad thai. The thing I love about the pad thai is the noodles. They are chewier than the pad thai noodles I usually get. Also, this may depend on your spice level, but I think the dish is overall less sweet than pad thai at other places. I consider myself to have a pretty high spice tolerance (I usually get the spiciest level at restaurants) and even I get medium spicy, so I would be on the cautious side when you consider spice level.

In summary, food is excellent but it gets one star less for the accessibility factor. Give it a chance though!"

No frills whatsoever. The pad thai was great...however, please be mindful of spice level. They really are not joking. We got hot, as I have always been able to handle hot. I could not. I have eaten spicy foods all my life and always get the hot option at all Thai restaurants. I thought I was going to die and was terrified my contacts were going to liquefy. So be wise, and go one level down then what you normally do. I also like the option of choosing how wet you want your noodles (as in do you want it with tons of sauce). Very interesting and thoughtful."

I just walked in at 12:10, and there&#39;s one woman working the grill, no hostess to order from. So I call the ordering number, and a second woman comes from the back. I try to place an order for a single dish, and she says it won&#39;t be ready until 1:35. Wow! This is my second time trying to eat here (the first attempt was calling in an order more than half an hour before they closed, and they said they couldn&#39;t do it), so I guess it&#39;s just not meant to be. Hopefully they&#39;ll hire some more help. I assume the cost of a second cook would justify their paycheck if you&#39;re literally turning away customers."

I ordered a tofu Pad Thai, not spicy, dry and the flavor was incredible! I had never had a not spicy Pad Thai that was full of flavor without the chili peppers! The noodles were a bit thinner than what I&#39;m used to, so the noodles were clumped together, but it was still incredibly delicious regardless. I may get it a little juicy next time.

The drunken noodles were pretty good, not as good as the Pad Thai though. The noodles were a bit over-cooked for my liking, but I appreciated the flavors! I may get this a little juicy next time as well.

For both, the tofu was on the tougher side.

As mentioned in other reviews, the portions are smaller, but the price is also slightly less than other Thai restaurants ($9-12). The two dishes came out to be $21.70 with tax. I got my dishes &#34;not spicy&#34; with spice on side and found it to be perfect (to a &#34;mild plus&#34; at other restaurants), as i was able to adjust the level of spice by myself.

Check their website for additional instructions on how to order for a quick and easy order placement.

The wait for the food can be long and painful, but the food is out-of-this-world delicious, so that makes everything A-OK here."

This is the best place to get that in Denver, or Aurora, whatever. If you aren&#39;t near it, it&#39;s most definitely worth the drive! I am giving this place 5 stars based on the food and the food alone because it&#39;s THAT good that I don&#39;t really think about anything else.

This place is owned by one person who cooks everything herself and it is freaking AMAZING. Her food is to go only for the most part. She does have one table in there that you have to reserve and apparently about a month in advance. I like to take my food home anyway so it doesn&#39;t bother me at all that she doesn&#39;t have seating. Hey, you&#39;re saving a few bucks on tip!

When you call to order, make sure you know what you want and how spicy you want it. Their level of spicy is no joke. When it says that their &#34;Medium&#34; is like other restaurant&#39;s &#34;Hot&#34;, they are NOT joking. The first time I came here, I assumed they were because I like my food spicy. My boyfriend (who is a spice wuss) got nice-spicy and I got medium-high. HUGE MISTAKE. We couldn&#39;t eat the food. I was drinking gallons of water with it so I got so full off the water that I ate about 2 bites. My boyfriend ended up rinsing his food in water before he ate it. Hilarious, I know.

We learned our lesson and he gets &#34;Not Spicy&#34; now and I usually get &#34;Baby-Spicy&#34; with extra spice on the side. Her dishes are flavorful and so good. I usually get the &#34;Pad Shea Eue&#34; (yeah, I&#39;ve never seen it spelled like that either) and &#34;Larb&#34; (not on the menu) and my boyfriend gets the &#34;Pad Thai&#34;. Everything is delicious. We&#39;ve also had the soups which are also good.

As far as parking goes, you may or may not be in luck. There are about 2 spots in front of her restaurant so you may find yourself circling around. That part kind of sucks. And the inside is not the prettiest but maybe that&#39;s why she does take out? Either way, if you want legit Thai food, this is it!"

This is HANDS DOWN the best and most authentic THAI FOOD in Denver. If you want authentic and wicked spicy, this place cannot be beat here in Denver.

I love the owner of this place. She spoils her regulars. My girlfriend and I eat here every week.

THIS IS NOT A SIT DOWN PLACE!!! It is PICKUP ONLY! It seems like the bad reviews are specifically griping about them not having a &#34;restaurant&#34; that you can sit down at. This is a food cart turned PICK-UP FOOD joint. If you&#39;re fine with that, you&#39;ll love it. Also, if you want to order food from this place, do it 45m-1hr before you want your food. They close at 8PM and if you try to order past 7pm, they will most likely be backed up to 8PM and won&#39;t take orders any longer.

I&#39;ve tried a couple different entrees, but I typically don&#39;t break away from the Pad Thai. I do &#34;Medium&#34; spicy. I eat a lot of spicy food and it makes me sweat. My girlfriend also enjoys a lot of spicy foods, but she normally orders &#34;Nice&#34; spice. She almost always gets the &#34;Panang Curry.&#34;"

A few things to note about this place:

1) Cash Only

2) Order well in advance (roughly an hour in advance). 

3) Mom and son runs the place. 

4) The food can be very spicy. 

5) Two parking spots. 

 

As long as you can get over the fact that this place isn&#39;t some chain to cater to fast food expectations, then you can probably appreciate the food.  

 

I had the opportunity to try the &#34;Pad Shea Eue&#34; and &#34;Pad Thai&#34;

 

Pad Shea Eue: A sweeter savory sauce base with the traditional flat and wide rice noodles. Accompanied with a small amount of broccoli and your choice of protein. Can&#39;t go wrong if you prefer a mildly sweeter dish. 

 

Pad Thai: This dish is true to it&#39;s name. It has the traditional sweet, tangy, and savory tastes as a Pad Thai should. It doesn&#39;t take the dish to a whole new level, but provides a nostalgic familiar flavor as you would expect from a Pad Thai. Another dish that you can&#39;t go wrong if you&#39;re craving Thai food."

After we left and came back, I casually whistled to the song on the radio and she told me that if I wanted to whistle she didn&#39;t need my business.

I understand that one needs to order hours ahead of time. Our host took care of that for us, so we did not have to suffer any delays. I would definitely order from here again, although I don&#39;t understand the business model of making guests wait hours for their food. Cash only does make sense to me for a small business, but that is another inconvenience for the customer. What to drink with this food? Champagne or other sweet wines like Riesling go well with the spice; beer is probably the classic accompaniment."

I recommend you look at their menu online, pick your dish, your sauce level (if applicable) and your spice level, then call your order in because it can take up to an hour and a half to get your food. Don&#39;t be discouraged by this wait time. There is one lady in here who cooks everything made to order. There is nothing chopped or prepped for your meal until you order it. Be aware that her food is spicy and if you like spicy food, medium spice is probably a good level of spice.

They made me wait over an hour for an order of Pad Thai. This is not because this place is sooooo good that the demand is that high. It&#39;s because they are too cheap to hire anyone else for their kitchen. It&#39;s one woman trying to keep up with all the orders. Who&#39;s cleaning the dishes/cookware? From the looks of the restaurant and the layer of dust over everything im sure it&#39;s just an afterthought. They have several rules which include no whistling inside their restaurant. Additionally,their front door does not close and they leave it open/cracked. This means bugs and varmint are allowed to play in your ingredients. 

They have a very prominent sign that says they reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.. Okay I guess I shouldn&#39;t wage any concerns or complaints as I might just be kicked to the curb( this happened to me before at another family owned restaurant) 

They are disorganized and unsanitary. From a business perspective they are just awful. The food is decent, but not worth the headache and being forced to look the other way at their many food safety violations. I watched the guy behind the register regularly handle cash and the door then just continue to assist with the food.. That&#39;s how you get people sick!! Please don&#39;t eat here. Send these guys a message.

1. Take credit/debit. It&#39;s 2015!
2. Clean/repair your restaurant
3. Practice safe food handling procedures
4. Make your establishment for inviting, I shouldn&#39;t feel like a criminal going in there.
5. Hire some help!! You could really be bringing in some customers if they weren&#39;t asked to wait for hours. I watched as three of your potential customers were made to find another place to eat.
6. Why do you have a lawn chair in your lobby..it&#39;s tacky!
7. &#34;We do not refund if your food is too spicy&#34; okay.. Goodbye loyalty and potential customers that don&#39;t want to take that risk. You people are way too cheap!!

I lived in walking distance to this place last year and I watched her quality change, whether it was with her food or her business. She went from having amazing flavor, using great ingredients and having dine in, to closing the dine in portion off to the public for a couple months, now to reopen with reservations way in advance and different flavor due to the different ingredients. I think for Thai food, using Chinese broccoli is a must and at some point she didn&#39;t agree and switched it to regular broccoli, changing the flavor and texture of the dish completely.

I used to love this place soooo much. Small, cozy, with an iced thai tea, no cream in the summer..Maybe i&#39;ll go back again this summer and it&#39;ll change again, for now it seems a bit inconsistent to me."

Okay, now that we&#39;re done with that.... i think this place makes their food with a little bit of crack mixed in, because I&#39;m officially addicted. 

Prices for each dish average $11... which is cheap... I think? 
I got the tofu green curry (medium) the first time I came and it was mind blowing! Huge portions (I had enough left over to eat for lunch the next day), perfectly flavored, and I loved the kick of spice I got. Medium was almost too hot for me, and I am a fan of super spicy food. I would recommend mild for those of you who enjoy a subtle spice with your meal. Loved the curry so much that I had to come back a few days later.... I got the pad thai and my friend got the drunken noodles with beef. I liked the pad thai a lot, but I was obsessed with my friend&#39;s drunken noodles (good thing she likes to share haha) and will likely get that next time! 

The service is something to be desired, but hey, that&#39;s something that you have to deal with if you want the best thai food on this planet. I wouldn&#39;t recommend calling in not knowing exactly what you want ... the line is full of static and there&#39;s definitely a language barrier so it&#39;s difficult to ask/receive clear answers about specific dishes.

However, if you&#39;re looking for a sit-down restaurant, you&#39;ll have to call ahead to reserve the one table, and be prepared to pay an extra fee.  

The food:  My favorites are drunken noodles and pad thai.  Both are SO GOOD, however, I do wish the pad thai came with peanuts on it, like it does at many other places.  They give you huge portions, so for the ~10, you get about two meals out of it.  Great deal!  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you spice-down from what you usually order.  At most restaurants I order medium-hot, and even the medium here is pushing it for me.  I usually stick with nice-spice and it&#39;s perfect for me.

I got the drunken noodles. I don&#39;t much about authentic Thai food, but it sure tastes more authentic than some the other places around town. And don&#39;t forget to order the vegetable dumplings. I could eat 50 of those things.

I eat spicy food very regularly. Still, I took the lady&#39;s advice and ordered my food with Baby Spice instead of medium. It was more than enough. I also asked for a side of hot sauce, and I quickly found out that using it was a mistake. It must be made from fresh Thai Chili or something. 

This is definitely worth a visit. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#39;t take out only or if they delivered. You know what? I&#39;m going to give it 5 stars anyway. The food surely deserves it."

We were heading to the Vintage Theatre to see a play on Saturday night at 7:30.  I searched for Thai restaurants in the area and found this one to have 4.5 stars.  I read a few reviews and looked at a few photos, but didn&#39;t dig too deep as every review sounded better than the last.

We wanted to give dinner plenty of time so we planned on meeting there at 6:00.  We got there a few minutes early to discover that the interior had changed quite a bit from the cozy little picture in this yelp review (I have asked for this picture to be removed as it no longer applies).  Anna, the owner/cook has changed the focus to be take-out.  There is a 15% surcharge to sit down and eat there! I have posted a new picture of the interior, it now consists of one picnic table and 4 chairs.  That&#39;s it!

With the snow on the road we gave it extra time to get there and arrived at 5:55.  They sat us down and provided water with big chunks of lime in it for us.  Then they took our order at 6:05pm.  We ordered 3 Pad Thais and six dumplings.  About 10 minutes later, the cashier/waiter came over and told us they were out of dumplings and eggrolls (2 of the 3 appetizers) and had only wantons, so we ordered 2 wanton servings.  They arrived about 6:30, we&#39;re talking a 15 minute wait just for that, and were ok.  There was nothing special about them though.

We&#39;re sitting watching the clock, tick-tock and creep forward and still no entres.  They would not look our direction so that we could get their attention so my mom went over at 6:55 and asked if our food was going to be ready soon.  The cashier said they were working on it and it should be out right away.  At 7:05 we still had no food.  Knowing that we had a play to go to and wanted to get something to eat, I went over and said something like, &#34;We have a play to go to at 7:30, if our food isn&#39;t going to be ready in 2 minutes we need to leave&#34;.  At this point, the cook Anna, said our food wasn&#39;t going to be ready for another 15 minutes!   WTF????  &#34;Holy empty promises and plates Batman!&#34;.  We were lied to earlier by the cashier about them working on our food and it being up soon.

After paying for the wontons we left and found dinner redemption in a hurry at Smashburger where we woofed down our food and got to the play a couple minutes late.

My daughter called after we left and asked how long it would be if we were to order dinner and they told her it would be ready in 45 minutes.  Crazy, we waited an hour and our food still wasn&#39;t ready.


I ate the wontons and they were nothing special.  I sat in a cold stark room for over an hour waiting for food and basically screwed up the whole night.  C&#39;mon yelpers, help identify that this kind of place should be take-out only.  I give them 0 stars on service, 0 stars on ambiance, 2 stars on the wontons, and 5 stars for screwing up my evening.

I don&#39;t care how good it may be, I will not give this place another try."

Make sure that you have CASH and if you are getting lunch, odds are you will have to call ahead to order or wait a couple hours, as it can get super busy. 

The food is VERY HOT, I usually eat very spicy food and I order medium there. Also, I recommend the panang curry, it&#39;s delicious. 

Prices are from $9-$11 per dish, so it&#39;s pretty affordable. Also, take out only!"

Pad Kee Mao and Thai fried rice were both tasty with high quality ingredients.  However, I ordered both dishes Med-High-High and that was a mistake.  I can handle extremely hot food.  There have only been two times in my life where food has been too spicy for me to enjoy.  Once in Beijing and once here.  Take their website seriously.  The spicy level here is higher than most Thai places."

As other yelpers have mentioned, take out only, cash only, and you can only dine in here if you reserve the table 3 months in advance. Huh, weird. What&#39;s also strange is that the space they have is actually quite suitable to have several tables and have a full-fledged tiny restaurant going but they don&#39;t. 

We called in for take out and it was a strange experience on the phone. I called one of the phone numbers, and I was told to wait. And then I waited for maybe 2-3 minutes while listening to a bunch of background noise. I didn&#39;t know if they forgot about me. I decided to hang up, call again, and yes I was told to wait but this time for maybe another 4 minutes. So bizarre. But alas, the man got back on the phone and took my order- we got green curry and drunken noodles, baby spice and nice spicy. It wouldn&#39;t be ready until about 45 minutes later...

Tip: If you&#39;re looking for pick up and go food, know that it will be a while even if your order isn&#39;t that big. 

Fast forward to the food- Do not be fooled by the cute names for their spice levels! Spice-intolerant peeps beware! I can handle my spice, and boy am I glad I took the advice to be conservative on this. I&#39;m not sure how spicy my food will be if I just say no spice next time? Might still be pretty hot. 

The great thing is that on top of the spice, I could still taste everything. And yes, this is why I am a fan. Beyond the burn that tortured my entire mouth with excruciating heat, I could also taste the lemongrass and thai basil in my dishes. Usually when heat overpowers, there is lack of flavor but not here folks. Flavor bombs galore, if you will. 

Tip #2: have some milk ready for when you&#39;re eating. You&#39;ll find that it comes in pretty handy."

I ordered the $9 Beef Drunken Noodles with Dry sauce Medium spice level (4 of 7), it put tears in my eyes and agent orange through my nose. The more my tongue burned, the better the noodles tasted so I maned up and ate it all! My stomach felt like a campfire all day. 

Anna the owner/chef started 16th St Mall Thai Food Cart in 2009 and moved to this location in 2012. Website says she&#39;s from NE Thailand and the food brings Thai and Laotian flavors together. I only waited for about 10 minutes for pick up and you can actually see the kitchen from the counter. 

Cash only, Carryout-only, 1 table for RESERVATIONS only, and there&#39;s a small Grocery section where you can buy some curry paste and attempt some Thai cookin."

Complex flavors, fresh ingredients, wonderful taste and texture. The drunken noodles with tofu were fantastic. The website gives really specific directions on how to order. It says pick your protein, your dish, your sauce level (how &#34;juicy&#34;), and how spicy. The scale is Not Spicy, Baby Spice, Nice-Spicy, Medium, Medium-High, Medium-High-High, and Fire. All the other reviews are accurate that the spice scale is tilted higher than most other restaurants in the area (or most other restaurants I have eaten in, in multiple cities). I got Baby Spice and it was perfect for me. I&#39;d recommend being conservative your first time there."

Too bad since I was eating there when it was just a street cart downtown. Loyalty, or lack of it, runs both ways."

At first the street it&#39;s on seems a bit sketch but nothing bad has happened when I&#39;ve gone so far. The inside is pretty small and I can&#39;t remember whether or not there is seating since they changed some stuff. I know they have reserved seating for large parties, but that was booked for the next month or so. 

When I first went there they still had seating for general customers. They also had one waiter and one cook every time I went.  The waiter was a young guy who seemed very shy and mostly would only interact with the men of they were around. It was a bit strange for him to avoid interacting with women if he could. Now I haven&#39;t seen that guy for some time but the same cook is there. 

I&#39;ve tried the curry, the pad Thai, drunken noodle, and the pad see ew (spelling?). All of these dishes were delicious! However, there is one small detail that always throws me off - their spicy scale. They have a long list of spice levels that&#39;s 8-12 different levels. One of the lowest ratings on their scale is comparable to medium or medium-high anywhere else you go in Denver for Thai food. I went in and got the medium and almost died haha. I used to be a lot better about spicy food, but as I age my stomach can&#39;t handle what it used to.  Then I tried the spice level two under that and it was still pretty spicy. At the lowest spice level you&#39;d be at about medium to medium-low anywhere else in Denver. Even if you order the same spice level every time, it can vary from visit to visit. So just be careful haha.

They used to only accept cash, but I still always make sure to bring cash with me because I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s changed and I haven&#39;t really checked.  So don&#39;t go racing in without some cash on hand. 

Overall I gave it four stars because of the great flavor of the food. I docked them one star because of the inconsistency that exists with their spice level. 

P.S. Anytime it&#39;s a meal time +/- 1hr, it&#39;s worth it to call in your order because they only have one chef and the wait can be an hour or two long at peak times like dinner."

And the food really is spicy. I&#39;m a champ when it comes to spicy foods and when I read the other reviews, I was thinking maybe some people just can&#39;t handle spice.

Then I ordered my noodles spicy.  I&#39;ve never experienced heart burn like this before!  My husband (who&#39;s not as tolerant of spicy foods) was sweating and hiccuping.  

The lady was super nice and I&#39;ll probably try this place again to see if the other dishes are better.  But for now the hunt for the best Pad Thai continues..."

Half a year later when I revisited, it was all down hill. First of all, it became to go only and they told us it would take fourty minutes to get my order ready and since it was cash only, we had to go next door to the shady pub to get money and pay ATM fees. And they were totally overworking the cook. Poor girl was doing everything by herself and the other girl was answering the phone nonstop and doing cashier while greeting customers. Basically it&#39;s like a zero for customer service because my friend who is vegan asked them not to use fish sauce in her fried rice and they told her it&#39;s not possible even though they&#39;ve done it before for her! So my friend waited 30 mins and ended up having to go get chipotle. Lastly to top off this bad experience, I noticed the portion size decreased and it&#39;s actually pretty pricey now I think about it. 

Bottom line: not coming back. This place is shady."

As others have already mentioned, yes dine in service is now a thing of the past, but the consistency and quality has always been maintained.  Yes, if you call at lunch time or dinner on a Thu-Sat or cold evening expect an hour wait, but it&#39;s so worth it.  Very few restaurants in Colorado allow you to have such an experience of feeling like you are in the kitchen with the Chef and always knowing your meal is being painstakingly prepared by the same dedicated and hardworking person each and every time.  Do a quick read here and on the website of how to order, bring cash, know it&#39;s to-go and don&#39;t order too hot unless you like to feel some crazy burn.  If you do that you will be happy you didn&#39;t miss out on a pretty cool and delicious experience."

But be warned, this place has changed a lot throughout the years.  It used to be a sit down restaurant where you can pay with card.  However, this place became so popular and because there is only one cook, the place could not keep up with the demands.  Thus, it is now take-out only and I recently found out cash only too.  It is not very convenient, but food is still very good here.  I normally order the chicken pad thai and my boyfriend likes the beef pad see ew.  Moreover, their spice level for entrees are extremely spicy.  When they say thai spicy, it is thai spicy!!!  It will hurt going down and going out the next day.  I like mine with baby spice; it has the right amount of kick.  Their thai tea is also super delicious.  It use to come in a gigantic soup container, but now it&#39;s in a regular drinking cup with lots of ice =(.  Disappointing, but I still love their dishes."

We had some difficulty with the directions since the location was incorrect on Yelp.  Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ve corrected it now and your GPS should work now.  The location is not in the best part of Aurora so you just need to deal with it.  If you want delicious Thai food you should make the effort and venture here.

The place is small inside, 5-6 tables, maybe the place seats 30.  I get the sense that there is always a little bit of a wait here.  Totally worth it if you are questioning it right now.  I recommend waiting.  We were lucky enough to grab a table that was empty when we walked in (pure luck I tell you).  

We were there pretty late, 8pm and they close at 9pm and they were still hopping.  The menu is pretty small.  A little bit of everything as far as Thai goes.  We were there too late to get the Crab Cheese Wontons, completed and utter sadness.  It just means we&#39;ll have to go again in the near future.  I blame the table next to us for ordering a full dozen - bastards!  We ordered some dumplings and egg rolls, both incredibly reasonable.  For our entrees we decided on sharing the Pork Pad Thai (Baby Spice) and the Chicken Panaang Curry (Baby Spice) with some white rice.

Dumplings - some of the freshest and most flavorful dumplings I&#39;ve ever had.  You can tell they are made by hand every day.

Egg rolls - Complete veggie egg roll that was stuffed deliciousness.  Loved dipping them in the sweet sauce and some of the hot sauce for a little kick.  

Chicken Pad Thai - We ordered pork but received chicken.  Not a huge deal but worth double checking your order with the guy who seems to be a bit hard of hearing.  Baby Spice is spicy - just a hint.  Pad Thai was perfect.  Noodles, veggies, bean sprouts, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime and this is an outstanding dish.

Chicken Panaang Curry - This was the highlight of our meal.  This is not the same as most other Thai curries.  The sauce is thicker and has true depth of flavor.  We drank every spoonful.  The chicken, the peppers, the green beans, all of it was perfect.  

This is a one woman show.  One tiny little woman in a small kitchen making magnificent dishes to order.  Completely impressed with her talent.  Considering she&#39;s the only one in the kitchen we received our food pretty fast and were in and out in under an hour.  The service is a little odd, only two guys taking orders, filling waters, getting drinks, bringing food and busing tables.  It can be a little slow at times but stay with it, the food is worth it, I guarantee it.  The JB Guarantee lets call it.  

Save some Crab Cheese Wontons for me.  The next time we come I&#39;m doing the order a dozen and ask questions later trick learned from the table next to us.  

Truly authentic Thai food made with love is found here."

It&#39;s cash only, but you can go next door to the sketchy bar and take cash out from their atm. Pool is free on like monday, tuesday and wednesdays, and like .50 all the other days.

Anyways! It&#39;s a small place with no dine-in service. I just traveled to Thailand a few months ago and when I stepped into their establishment, I felt a little like I was transported back - a little cluttered, not a pristine kitchen, one chef and assistant whom both did not speak very good english. They have plenty of warnings regarding the spicyness of their food. We ordered standards - pad thai and curry. Both were super delicious, you can taste all the different levels of spices and flavors in the sauces. Not a Thai-american place. Will be going back for sure! I think you should order ahead, because it took them 40 minutes to cook two dishes of food."

I have a friend who is a self-proclaimed &#34;pepper-head&#34; and this is one of the few places that has defeated him (his description was &#34;it&#39;s delicious food spiced with pure, piercing pain&#34;).

It&#39;s a bit annoying but CASH ONLY. If you&#39;re lucky, the food turnaround time is fast, but on busy days, it can reach over an hour on larger orders. It&#39;s absolutely worth it, though; this is the best Thai food in Denver that I know of."

We opt for TO-GO DINNER Orders coz have been busy with work and all.  Our recent visit was on Saturday March 9th 2013.  We were there like about 16:45hrs.  These were what we ordered that evening :

*  Crab &amp; Cheese Wontons - (2 pieces $1.00), Ordered 3 sets (6 pieces = $3.00)
*  Ginger Chicken over Rice (My Main Entree)
*  Chicken Curry (Hubs Main Entree)
*  Banana Wrappers for Desserts - (2 pieces $1.00), I ordered 2 sets (4 pieces = $2.00)

The total cost for our dinner with tax was $26.06.

When I open the container of the Ginger Chicken, I was disappointed with my order.  Maybe I DID order the wrong item from the Menu.  My main Entree comes with slices of chicken stir-fried with onions, ginger slices, mixed vegetables of Asparagus, Broccoli, Diced Red Bell Peppers and fresh green onions in a light and fresh sauce.  I thought the Ginger Chicken menu was like the other Ginger Chicken menu I had from another establishment, but I was wrong.  *Sad Face*  *Big Bummer*  Oh well...

Hubs like his order of Chicken Curry.  Hubs like the flavor of his order, SPICY but not THAI HOT Spicy that he is used to.  There are plenty of chicken pieces and vegetables mainly Bell Peppers and Broccoli.

Both the Crab &amp; Cheese Wontons and Banana Wrappers comes in brown bags respectively.  At least, the brown bags, soaked up some of the grease and still made the items warm from Thai Street Food back to our house.

I think the highlight of my Dinner were the Crab &amp; Cheese Wontons (Appetizers) and the Banana Wrappers (Desserts).  Anything FRIED is GOOD in my vocabulary.  The Banana Wrappers were sprinkled with powdered sugar.  It came out hot.  What can go wrong with Bananas wrapped with Spring Rolls and FRIED?  I like....  

The portion of both entrees felt a little too small for our appetite.  All in all 3 stars at best for our Dinner TO GO order that evening.  Though I think Hubs would rate his Dinner order 3.5 stars...

You can&#39;t help but be amused by all the rules and regulations they have posted all over. After we ordered a group of 6 walked in and they were told no groups larger than 4. They asked if they could sit at two separate tables. I just had to laugh. Have you ever seen Seinfeld and the soup Nazi? We ordered the coconut soup medium with chicken. We got coconut soup hot with shrimp. Be we just ate it. It was yummy and a very large bowl for $10 (plus $2 shrimp, $1 rice). 

There&#39;s only one lady cooking and one guy serving. I think they&#39;re busier than they can keep up with. A couple walked in to pick up their to-go order and were told, you come back another time? Apparently their order didn&#39;t make the cut.

My mom is from Thailand, and this is so cliché, but the food here is &#34;just like mom&#39;s&#34;! The service is great too! The people are really nice. I would&#39;ve given this establishment 4.5 stars given the option to do so. The only reason I&#39;m not giving them a 5 is only because it can take an hour for your food to be ready, because apparently there is only one cook, and it is a little pricey (~$10+ most dishes). Otherwise, if you like Thai food you&#39;ll LOVE this place! :)"

Am I ever glad I found this place, it is now my GO TO place for Thai food. Nothing fancy about it. One girl who takes the order and one lady who cooks all the food, from scratch, one item at a time.  And it is all great.  Fresh ingredients and if it is not fresh, they simply do not make it that day. I tried one day to get a dish heavy with basil, and they said they could not get fresh basil so the dish was off the menu for that day.. Last time I was there it was Take Out Only, first time, you could sit and eat your meal. I did not ask what was going on, just happily took my take out and left.  Seems like the owner(s) do not fully understand the American way of business, but they sure know how to cook Thai food and this is what I went for, and what I will return for, whenever I want Thai food. 

The absolute best Panang Curry outside of Chaing Mai, every bite just makes you want another.

Support them and try the food, you will not be disappointed."

As other reviewers have pointed out, be aware of the spice level. I ordered medium which was fairly uncomfortable. But Thai food should be hot so I was pleased that it was not taken down a notch. The menu is relatively limited, but the food I tried was excellent and I would definitely go here again if I didn&#39;t live in Hawaii. I did notice that they stop taking walk in orders if they get too busy, so order early."

Here are a few tips:
It&#39;s takeout (there really isn&#39;t anywhere to sit).
Don&#39;t order even medium spicy if you don&#39;t like super spice (it blew my spice loving husband away).
Forgot to get sriracha or soy sauce or fish sauce or ketchup? They have some there for purchase. 
CASH ONLY! 
Looking for amazing food? You found it.

I was very impressed with this place. The quality of their food was impressive. I think it is a family business (which I love) and they work hard for your food. Everything tasted amazing and was cooked on the spot! Highly recommended!"

(1) One week in advance to have a sit down at a one $ restaurant.

(2) Cash only, which can be understandable but they tack on 15% fee for service automatically if you do have a reservation and can actually sit down.

(3) They have tables but no one can sit and enjoy a meal. 

(4) Strange signs all over restaurant.

(5) I left and went to Sue of Siam, in a different part of Aurora.

The camera is on for the parking lot and seems skeptical for a 4.5 star food establishment.

These observations were made without trying the food, but their business practices makes it difficult to enjoy their food."

This review is NOT about the food, but rather the complication of trying to obtain 2 orders of pad Thai.  I&#39;m so disappointed.  I&#39;ve had this place bookmarked for months in hopes of trying it, and I anticipated a line of people and other issues.     

But I was not prepared for the terrible service we received.  With no line and only one other couple in the restaurant, we practically had to beg to order and THEN we were told there was a 45 minute wait!!  We were informed of this by a pretty friendly guy, but no apologies or explanations or even a simple &#34;we appreciate your patience&#34; in light of our Friday night call-in order rush...nothing.  We were told of the wait with more of a &#34;that&#39;s just how it is&#34; attitude, like we should have expected it.

The lady in the back was busy fixing up what I&#39;m betting were delicious entrees, but clearly they wished we weren&#39;t around to bother them.  So we decided not to wait 45 minutes to be an annoyance, and drove to a far better area with our tried and true favorite Thai Flavor restaurant.  

Also, on a Friday night at 6:30 most menu items were not available.  As others have stated, there are tacky hand scribbled signs plastered all over the front door stating all sorts of things.  No more than 4 diners in a party, no more dining in as of October, no this and no that...huh?  It&#39;s like they&#39;d rather not have people bother them.  Good reviews or not, there is no way I&#39;m giving this run down place with limited parking another try."

They have very good food and it&#39;s even better considering the price.

This is the first place where I&#39;ve seen the thai iced tea served in gigantic beer mugs. I don&#39;t even see beer mugs this big at bars. Ice to the top, hot tea 1/2 way, condensed milk for the rest and then two cups of sugar. This might be what sends me over the Type 2 edge.

For the appetizers, avoid the dumplings. They&#39;re the store bought frozen variety. Specifically they&#39;re korean type frozen dumplings that have the rice noodles inside. Not that great when deep fried. The cheeze wontons are delicious but it&#39;s also pretty damn hard to mess up deep fried cream cheese.

The papaya salad was really good and made with green papaya as it should be. However as far as heat goes, on &#34;nice&#34; level it was far worse than the pad thai on &#34;medium&#34;. It&#39;s a good amount of heat but expect for it to linger.

How the kitchen is setup, Anna cooks all the food and does it sequentially. All dishes are cooked one after the other. Anna is the only cook and she has two helpers to serve, make drinks, and bus dishes.

They&#39;re cash only.

If I&#39;m only reviewing on the quality of food. . this place gets a 5 star easily.  The value is great, the food is awesome.

We got Pad see eaw, Panang Curry, and Ginger chicken. Plus some appetizers. . .

here is where it doesn&#39;t live up to the hype:

- upon sitting down with 3 adults and 3 children we notice a sign that says &#34;no parties over 4&#34;.  Seriously?  We ignored it (and they did too)

- they were out of a lot of appetizers (such as egg rolls) operations 101 any one?

-  the appetizers tasted like they had been triple fried, biscotti style, avoid avoid avoid. The one food to avoid

- the thai iced tea was amazing

- the menu is a mess.   For example. . .it has this quote &#34;EXE: Pad Thai&#34; it says.  Executable Pad Thai?  What does that mean. . .

- The server acts like he speaks English just fine, so someone should of helped.  Options such as &#34;how juicy&#34; you want your food (WTF?) are on there.   As well as it says it comes with rice with each dish. . though you pay extra if the rice is on the side?

- so we got the rice on the side. They only brought ONE rice.  We asked for more rice. They never brought it.  One little bowl of rice for 6 people.  

- a couple water refills, but after that. . nothing. Never saw them again

- then we paid and left (lots of kids) only to realize later they charged us for the rice they didn&#39;t give us

- they could of spent some money on some tables. It looks like they just hit local garage sales. Maybe if they customized the tables they wouldn&#39;t need signs that say &#34;NO MORE THAN 4 people&#34;

- don&#39;t accept credit cards. Seriously? you don&#39;t have a Swype account and a fricken IPHONE.  Get with 2013.

So. . lets get this straight. Don&#39;t eat here. . .at least if you have ANY service expectations at all. Instead just pick it up to go.  Don&#39;t get appetizers, just main meals. Make sure they give you plenty of rice.

Pay cash, get it to go, just don&#39;t eat here"

Things are made fresh there for you know your food WAS NOT FROZEN! If you can write a review READ the reviews. Needless to say i love this place. Never knew it existed till i worked downtown and saw the cart &amp; tried it, LOVED IT. Then one day it disappeared.. Well turns out its been down the street from me along. You do have to order in advanced by calling to place your order. Got there later in the day they were out of beef, ok no biggie got chicken, they were out of crab cheese wantons, so got pot stickers. No need to ding stars and cry about it. Now i know call in advanced and go earlier in the day. Pad see ew has always been my fav. Totally worth it! **edit: CASH ONLY FYI!"

I just got off the phone two minutes ago (7:13 p.m.) and they are no longer taking orders for takeout. They do close at 8 p.m., but that was sad... We were excited to try this place."
thai-street-food-aurora,Steven C.,qSJv4MNkjL4U2FNwZmynXg,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,4,38,n1Dgs7pyfdBKIY8NBv-ohw,5.0,2015-03-16,"Been a big fan of Anna&#39;s cooking since her initial cart on 16th street mall.  Was going to her for 2-3 years, but when I changed jobs, I was no longer in the downtown area.  When I finally had some time and went downtown, I was sad to find out that she no longer had the cart there.  Found out later it was because the city of Denver wanted to dictate the hours of an independent small business.  

Luckily I remembered that she was tinkering with an actual store front, after a little bit of digging, found that she did move there full time.

Have been going to her current location for a couple years now and is still my go-to place when I&#39;m craving Thai.  I drive up from Littleton/Centennial but usually plan ahead so the 1-2 hours before my food is ready isn&#39;t a concern.

A few things for the new people.

1)  She&#39;s cash only.  I&#39;ve worked restaurant and retail.  Quicker to give change on a $20 on a $12.50 check then it is to swipe a card.  Also you don&#39;t get hit a 3% swipe charge on credit cards.  There are plenty of ATM&#39;s when you are driving to her place.  I usually do not carry cash, but my bank is along the way.  What&#39;s so hard about that?

2)  Her food runs hot.  and I mean really hot.  You have been warned.  I love eating spicy food, and can safely say that the &#34;Thai Hot&#34; that most other places (US Thai and Woody&#39;s would be the exception), is equivalent to her Medium.  I normally order Medium High High on the Pad Thai/Drunken Noodles.  Fire on the curry and fried rice, but Medium on the Soups.  Please don&#39;t be the ones ordering Medium High and then complain about your food being too spicy.  Nothing wrong with ordering Baby or Nice spice.  You still get the flavor. 

3)  Yes she is take out only.  I&#39;ve dined there many times when she was serving full service.  And I understand why she went to take out only.  People would come in Friday night or Saturday afternoon and spend a good 3 hours Facebooking, or socializing.  Which is fine, don&#39;t get me wrong, nothing wrong with hanging out.  But not when seating is limited and other people are waiting for your table.  

My fiancee&#39;s nephew was admitted into Children&#39;s Hospital two years ago, we managed to sneak out around 5:45 on a Saturday for early dinner.  Food took about 10-15 minutes  to cook, 15 minutes to eat and we were gone by 6:15ish.  Nephew&#39;s mom was hungry, so we ordered take out from Anna&#39;s again around 8, picked it up around 8:30 and the two tables who were sitting next to us earlier, were still there.  Obviously done with food, but still asking for water and her complimentary thai tea re-fills.  

4)  Her prices are still very competitive, considering everything is hand made and prepped.  When you order any shrimp dishes, extra attention is paid to cleaning and shelling.  The shrimp are very plump and fresh.  You can taste the care and effort she put into every bite of food.  From the curry, to the fried rice and the crab wontons."

If I could I would eat there every day. 

I just wished I could eat there instead of having to take out. 

Take out only and cash only so be aware! Also make sure to order early because there is only one cook and if a couple orders come in yours might take a while."
thai-street-food-aurora,David S.,3G68w6_VGJlgFSnjMuq93Q,"Arvada, CO",0,1,1,0,322,LxK4IS38e8IbEVrGCMmFvg,5.0,2015-06-23,"This place definitely a little different from your average restaurant.  Cash only, no dine in, order far in advance during peak times, view website to know how to order and very spicey (which i LOVE). Medium will make you sweat but sweat so good. This place is definitely worth dealing with though. The food is awesome, everytime. Cream cheese wontons  are so so good, same with veggie dumplings. Drunken noodles are a fav, noodle jelly salad is perfect thai dish, pad thai is good too. Haven&#39;t explored full menu yet but definitely will. The cook is also about a sweet as can be. I love this place. Give it a try."

It was definitely good, but frankly, I&#39;ve had very comparable food from other establishments around town that don&#39;t make me jump through as many hoops to get my food, so I doubt this establishment will become a regular thing for me.  That being said, I&#39;ve got to say again that the fresh crab rangoons are the best I&#39;ve ever had and an exceptional deal at $1 apiece.  I think I&#39;ll order up a ton to serve as appetizers at our next game night!"

I used to frequent this restaurant, especially since I began going to school on the Health Sciences campus nearby. However, the service has always been a bit slow (granted there is only one woman cooking for all the customers). Most recently, they stopped allowing patrons sit inside the restaurant and enjoy their meals. I am a fan of eating the food right when it comes out of the pan and it&#39;s still, in a sense, fresh. The last time I was there, the chairs and tables were still in the restaurant and when I asked if I could just sit down and eat my food, I was denied. Apparently, you need to make a reservation weeks ahead of time to sit at a table.

With that being said, if you can bare to take your food to go, this place is really great for authentic Thai food. I love the pad thai and all of the other noodle dishes. The Thai tea is awesome and I love the crab cheese wontons (great price too I should add).

Hopefully one day, I will be able to sit and enjoy a meal that this restaurant again."

Had the Pad Kee Mow (msspl?) and it was simply amazing.

I adore Thai food and try out different places in an attempt to find that special one and this is the closest I have come in Denver.

The place is small but the food very much makes up for the ambiance.

thai-street-food-aurora,Kay T.,w5wjPO6IRcFONbbz_vzNqA,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,1,116,0r2PKurQC5hs-scSqwoWQg,5.0,2014-12-22,"Probably one of the better Thai food places around the Aurora/Denver area.  The other reviewers are right about the spice level so I went with a baby spice.  
My whole office likes to come here once a month (we like promoting small business) and the food is so delish (pad thai, pad-se-uw, dumplings, soups, etc).  Full of flavor and spice that is why we keep coming back for more.  There is only one cook which is the owner and we&#39;re okay with waiting for our order because it is made fresh to order.

With that, reading through some of the comments on here and taking away stars for lack of  seating and cash only -- really?  
1) It is a take-away restaurant and the food is awesome  
2) Running a small business, cash is preferable since credit card companies charge a 2% fee per transaction and when the food is fairly cheap, they have to make an income some how - Just go to the ATM, how hard is that?
3) There is like a 3 month waiting list to eat there at the 1 table they have -- again, it is mainly a take-away restaurant.  By traveling a lot, this is traditional with overseas restaurants where not many places have seating so I can see where that comes from.
4) Started out as a food cart -- no seating and you took it to go --- Same concept just not selling from a street cart."

Recently the owner has not only changed the hours, but they are now charging a 15% fee if you want to dine in.  Additionally the last two times I&#39;ve ordered from here the spice level has been much higher then what we ordered.

This used to be a great place, truly unique and deserving of a 5 star rating.  Anymore, I would say you&#39;re better off going somewhere else.  I personally will now  be making the long drive to Woody Wings and Things to get my Thai (ish) fix."

I went on Saturday for lunch. There are no longer tables. If you want to sit- you have to make a reservation 1 day in advance and pay 15% service fee. 

Otherwise it&#39;s all takeout. 

I&#39;ve had really wonderful food here- but this take out- was throw out. Everything tasted oddly burnt and the seasonings were dull. This woman knows food, but she needs some help with the business side of things. Very sad."

I no longer live in Denver, but must come back once a month for work.  When I do, I drive all the way to Aurora just to get Thai Street Food!

FOOD: 5 stars
+   so much flavor
+   spicy is truly spicy
+   thai iced tea is gi-normous!!

AMBIANCE: 3 stars
+/-  not a cool/hip place BUT did you see my rating for the food?!

STAFF: 3.5 stars
+/-  only one cook, so if you have people ahead of you, you can possibly wait for a LONG time.  i called in my to go order once, got there about 15 mins later and waited in the restaurant for an entire hour.  And yes, i still gave this place 5 stars. If you go here, you just need to set your expectations accordingly and you&#39;ll be happy.
+/-  sometimes understaffed 
+ friendly staff

this place is all about the FOOD!
nom nom nom"

The parking is a little wonky:  perpendicular parking directly off the road, so be careful when you back up to exit!  But once installed and inside, you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re miles away from Montview Blvd!

This place is warm and cozy.  And tiny!  There&#39;s maybe a half dozen tables and a pretty nice bar top to sit at while you wait for your to-go order.  Nothing special or over the top.  Like Goldilocks said, this one&#39;s just right!

The menu is small but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s based on the original street cart&#39;s capacity.  Because I&#39;m still a noob when it comes to Thai food, I opted for two egg rolls and an order of Pad Thai, spice level three out of seven.  

Oh boy, this was delicious!  So flavorful and the spice level was spot on for me.  Maybe if I&#39;m brave someday I can kick it up a notch, but not too much more.  From just this taste, it&#39;s going to get hot and spicy in a hurry!  The egg rolls were also fresh and crispy, and the dipping sauce was nice and tangy!  Yum-o!

Yelpers, I fear I am in trouble.  Thai Street Food is no more than four blocks away from my work place and entrees only hover around the $8 mark.  And it&#39;s good.  Really good!  Downtown&#39;s loss of the Thai Food Cart is the Anschutz Medical Campus&#39;s gain.  And I thank them for it!"

I thought I had the best pad Thai until I try it at this place. That sauce is undeniably good. Take out orders and cash  only. They sell a few asian grocery items as well.  The papaya salad didn&#39;t pack as much flavor as the pad Thai (the salted crab topping was a bit weird for my taste, fishy). As for the spicy level of this place. For those who eat spicy food; their medium level is just below the Thai spicy level at other places. Highly recommend this place; worth the try."

My parents and I were visiting my brother in Colorado (we&#39;re from D.C.) and he told us about this amazing Thai Street Food Cart that used to be in downtown Denver. When he looked it up on the internet, he realized that the cart had closed and became a brick and mortar.

This place has a really homely feel. We went on a Saturday and there were only three people working. The cook (master of all Thai food), her husband who waited tables, and a dish washer.

Be prepared for a long wait because there is only one person cooking!

The wait was definitely worth it though. The food was really spicy, but it was a good burn. My face was sweating and on fire, but the rest of my body was shivering because I had to drink so much ice water.

I really like how you can choose the spiciness of the dish as well as how saucy you want it to be. My parents, who are really picky eaters, really loved the Thai food here too. Most of the Thai places we have back home are NOT spicy and super expensive/showy. My parents who were in Thailand earlier this year remarked that this is definitely real Thai food, and its at a great price too. If I ever come back to Colorado, I&#39;ll definitely be back to visit this place :)"

Food awesome.  
Rules - Way awesome.  I think of her list as, yup someone did that.. it pissed her off.. now it&#39;s written down.  I&#39;d wish she&#39;d post a photo of the person that made it to her list. 

This is why I love america.  Because she is THE owner she makes up her time.  If she doesn&#39;t want to work she doesn&#39;t HAVE to!   Partly the reason she left down town.. :-(  

Seriously.. it&#39;s just her.  If you&#39;re complaining about the speed.. seriously don&#39;t come back ever.  (that just means shorter wait times for me)  

15% + reservations for dine in.. don&#39;t you get it.. she doesn&#39;t want you in there she just want your money for her food.  Don&#39;t expect a hostess don&#39;t expect a matre d.  

She probably started adding the fee and did carry out because people would complain about the wait times for dinner so she said.. ok.. now you pay the fee AND you have to wait.

Buuuuuut...

The beer here is superb. I had the Dyad- a kombucha brett saison and a friend of mine had the Flora- a hoppy brett saison. The Dyad was much sweeter than the Flora, but both of them were fantastic. The Dyad felt like drinking two or three different beers (beverages?) with the progressive development and complexity of the flavor. The Flora is a real gem in a world of over-the-top unbalanced sours. The hoppiness, sweetness, and the sour blend together to make a truly one-of-a-kind beer.

I hosted a small group happy hour there for a nonprofit organization and the staff were all professional, flexible, and very accommodating.  Gavin is really pleasant to work with and the atmosphere of the building is friendly and open.

I&#39;ll definitely be back again!"

This place is a little bit different. Although I did have a few of their beers, I did also enjoy their GABF guest list. On top of that, and perhaps most shocking to me, was their menu and the quality of the food. Everything was good but nothing stood out more than the Korean pork tacos. I&#39;d actually come back just for those!

As for the beer, Wood is the one that stood out to me. Once more, I find a beer that is barrel aged, far from my favorite style, and it just impressed the heck out of me. Outside of the guest beers, I had two other home brews and they were decent. 

I&#39;d like to add that the service was great - the guy had a strong opinion on both beers and food and he was spot on for all of it. I love that decisiveness. In the end, I would certainly come back but first for the food and guest beers and second for their beers! ;)"

I again went for the Dyad, an excellent Brett saison with guava and kombucha, and E opted for the Flora, a dry-hopped sour Brett saison. Although the beers sound similar, they were delightfully different, with mine being a sweeter, fruitier sour and his being a touch hoppy and dry on the palate. We loved them both!

E then went for an Evil-Avo cocktail, with Portico tequila, jalapeño simple syrup, avocado, and galaxy hops. GET THIS COCKTAIL BEFORE THEY TAKE IT OFF THE MENU!!! If you like a little smoky, a lot of creamy (the bartender told us he just adds straight avocado to the ingredients and blends it in through shaking and then straining it), a little bite, and a whole lot of delicious, you will NOT be disappointed. What an absolute treat this drink is! It is truly amazing. They have a very nice and thoughtful spirit collection, and man can they whip up some great cocktails!

After our awesome bartender (I wish I remember his name!) made E&#39;s drink and pointed out that it had been tailored to pair with their pork kimchi taco, well E just had to have one of those too! The pork was cooked and seasoned beautifully and the flavors were on point, and even if you&#39;re like me and not really a fan of kimchi you will love this taco!

I honestly wish NIB wasn&#39;t so far away!! It&#39;s a fantastic place and I can&#39;t wait to visit them again! The staff is professional, efficient, knowledgeable, and accommodating - the food is delicious - the beer and cocktails are absolutely superb. Check them out!"

Normally I would never bring her to a brewery, but the food here is fantastic. Their pork kimchi taco is amazing, the pork is so tender and flavorful, plus the zest and brightness of the sauce and kimchi... mm. It&#39;s tapas style little plates, but priced well so you don&#39;t feel bad buying multiples.

They had about five of their own on tap and a plethora of other breweries both on tap and bottled. I ended up grabbing a beer from another brewery, while the two I were with both grabbed their houe brett. The brett was fantastic and perfectly sour, I kind of wished I had grabbed one for myself.

Since we were there on a Sunday before 5 all they had was brunch, even though it was 3 in the afternoon. I had heard their tapas were quite good, but alas I tried the brunch anyway and was impressed. I ordered the French toast and it came out perfectly. It wasn&#39;t overly priced either which was nice to see.

I hope to come back again sometime soon to try out their tapas as well, it&#39;s just a bit of a drive from Aurora"

I thought the house brewed beers were very solid with my favs being the East Coast Transplant IIPA, the Melanoidin Imp Stout, and the Wood BBA rye/wheat wine. We only ordered snacks this time and thought the root chips were weak (it was late and it looked like we got the cold crumbs from the bottom of the bin instead of actual &#34;chips&#34;. Also, are they always served cold?) and the marinated olives served with a small &#34;hunk&#34; (it wasn&#39;t sliced?) of a kinda okay focaccia bread were not a personal fav. There was a flavor permeating the olive oil which I thought was a candy ingredient. Turns out it was orange peel? Interesting but a bit too overpowering for my tastes. They&#39;re new and I did notice some of the menu items were different than our earlier visit so I&#39;ll try again. 
Side note: I feel sorry for Grand Lake Brewery being next door because NIB is definitely going to be stiff competition but, I hope Grand Lake steps it up and gives NIB some competition."

We came in on a Thursday night to get some dinner and check out the new spot in Old Town. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Melanoidin, and the server brought us an apertif to start the evening. The apertif was very bright and floral, and a nice touch. The Melanoidin was absolutely delicious. I particularly loved the taste of cold brew coffee in there. 

For food, we got the Spanish shrimp, the patatas bravas, and the OMFG flatbread. Everything was cooked properly, was piping hot and fresh, and looked delicious. It ended up being pretty flavorless, though. I&#39;m not one to add salt to my food but I was wishing I had some for this meal. I think they should take a trip to Penzey&#39;s a few blocks away and get creative! With a bit of oomph, this food would be great!

Altogether, I enjoyed our experience at New Image and look forward to coming back (brunch anyone?), but I do hope they infuse as much flavor in their food as they do in their beer!"

It has a cool vibe with many guest taps. And a great looking cocktail list. But I really came in for their beers. The beer I had was the bourbon aged one. It was very very tasty, but $10 for a 10oz beer is kinda outrageous. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll come back. On a positive note I did get a service industry discount for donating a deck of cards to the game table. I wasn&#39;t expecting that so kiddos to that. Also they have a tapas style food menu that looks really good I may have to try it out."

Their East Coast Transplant Double IPA is outstanding. It is so good. If you like IPAs, make sure you try this one. It is so delicious. They have a tapas style menu and the buffalo raviolis, were awesome. The owner and brewer was super nice and told us while they only brew about 5 beers, they prefer to have 5 kick ass beers. Hence why they sell other craft beer. Just an overall nice place to grab some amazing brews."

Want traditional? They&#39;ve got you with pepperoni or cheese. Want creative vegetarian? Grab the combo of potato and veggies. Want to sate that more adventurous palate? They have slices sporting things like bbq pork and mango.

So truly everyone there has a great choice for a pie. But if you are looking for slices and something truly UNIQUE to Denver, then I must recommend the Denver PieHole! 

How is it truly unique you might be asking? Well, of course this place has lots to choose from as far as whole pies, including creating your own. But where this place is most outstanding is the slices!

This is the only place in all the Denver Metro area where each and every day there are EIGHT different type of pizza slices to choose from! Yes, eight! So in other words, if you hate tomato sauce on a pizza, you got the right place because you will never have to suffer though a tomato based pizza if you really don&#39;t want to. (Personally I am allergic to cooked tomatoes!)

Four of the daily eight slices are the &#34;regulars&#34; of which you will find every day of the week and then four &#34;daily&#34; slice types that change each and every day, on Thursdays one of those is a vegan slice. 

For me personaly, the Potato &amp; Bacon slice is my standby slice, unless one of the daily slices meets my fancy. Last night was such the case as they had the &#34;Babe&#34; as one of choices. This is an alfredo sauce topped with ham, red onions, Blue cheese and roasted garlic! YUM!!!!

Another great thing about the PieHole is that you can LOAD UP THE EXTRAS! Extra veggie toppings are only 25¢ each and meats are only 50¢ extra! This is very reasonable and this way you can really get your pizza YOUR way! So I will usually get my slice to have roasted garlic and red onions added and then to make it extra crispy.

Open late seven nights a week until at least 2AM, 3 AM on Friday and Saturday! 

I have been coming to this pizza place since the very first week they opened and it is certainly one of my go-to spots in the Baker Neighborhood on South Broadway."

My favorite has to be the potato bacon. Yum. I also love that they have Sriracha and other hot sauces for you to add on top of your pizza. Heaven.

I&#39;ve tried the Margheritah Etah once (excellent) and the amazing Thai Chicken twice. Damn, I want that Thai Chicken pizza right now. NOW. It&#39;s amazing. 

Now, the pizzas are huge, so be warned that those of you with a counter depth fridge will need to make other arrangements for your slices. The box will not fit in your fridge. :)

They don&#39;t always have drivers available at odd hours during the day, but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s because they do most of their business by the slice in the shop. The staff are very friendly and are willing to take your order and send it out when the driver arrives (they&#39;ve always been able to tell us when that will be). 

Regardless, the pizza is worth waiting for. It&#39;s that good. Try it."

[I procrastinate.] Thin crust pizza, but baked to an interesting texture between being able to fold and nom (yummy) and cracker stiff (blegh). A wide selection of spicy hot sauces to top your &#39;za with, from medium to &#34;tear your face off and leave you a screaming skull&#34; -- I&#39;ll let you figure out which are which -- also some interesting choices like banana ketchup (I&#39;m a fan now; don&#39;t knock it, it works.) $2 cheese, $2.50 pepperoni and 4 choices of $2.78 pizza of the day specials (neatly coming to $3 w tax - pretty cool).  Flavor was delicious but I can see how other people would complain if they come in and eat pizza that was made 4 hrs earlier and has been sitting under a heat lamp -- if you get it relatively fresh, I don&#39;t see that problem here.  Staff is jovial and talkative and seem to have good personalities.  The place itself has a very urban, slightly punk feel to it.  Pinball machines and Ms PacMan/Galaga take up the back corners of the establishment -- and of course, lots of paper plate art on the walls [to be fair, some of it&#39;s pret-ty impressive.]  A good place to grab a quick bite during daytime hours."

We were getting hungry and didn&#39;t want to pay their ridiculous prices or eat their off the wall food, so we walked down Broadway looking for something to munch on. This aroma of pizza took over my nose and we wandered into Pie Hole. The place is a bit hidden but let your nose guide you. It was pretty packed with Saturday night Broadway traffic. We walked up and were greeted by the man making the pizzas.  You can basically get anything you want made by the slice, or as a whole pizza.  We ordered a few slices and within seconds they were in our hands.  The pizza was fairly cheap and obviously quick. The flavor is good, but it had been sitting there under the heat lamp for a little bit. I would give the flavor roughly a 6 out 10.  Not bad, but you have had plenty better.  For the price and location however, it was a great deal."

Each slice of Pizza was $2.78.  If I am NOT mistaken the other time I came here for TO GO Order, the Pizza I choose were : 

*  Balls Of Fury
*  Hot Cheez
*  Yeah Baby

When I ask the Staffs, whether their Meatballs contains any PORK, the staff is so willing to go back to the Kitchen and check it out.  Thankfully its JUST BEEF!  SCORE!  Hence that makes a choice that I want to choose for the options in my decision to purchase TO GO.  

This visit was on Sunday August 24th 2014, after I had Dinner a few stops away.  I purchased the slices of Pizza for Hubs Dinner and perhaps 1 or 2 for me for my after Dinner &#34;snack&#34;.  7 slices of Pizza was $21.02.

The pizza is great - they serve by the slice and rotate flavors. I had a vegan mango slice once and it was delish. They have $1 cans of PBR all day everyday.
The decor is kinda crusty but it&#39;s a cheap pizza place on SoBo - what do you expect?
I find myself ending my nights here more and more. I used to go to Atomic Cowboy but this place is so cheap, I keep coming back."

Nothing fancy schmancy- just downright dirty pizza- in a good way that is. This is a no fuss place- the pizza is there waiting for you, you order it, they throw it in the oven to heat that baby right back up and they slap it on a plate for you and then the rest is history. 

Must Try:
Potato Bacon- It&#39;s delicious that&#39;s why. 
We ordered a couple slices of Sausage, Pepperoni, and Thai Chicken. All were delicious but the real winner is the Potato Bacon- I&#39;ve never had anything quite like it. It&#39;s so simple and yet it totally does the trick. 

The place definitely had character that&#39;s for sure. It&#39;s covered from ceiling to floor with Pizza influenced art work. Oh and there&#39;s pinball machines as well... It&#39;s definitely a must-try for anyone come through Denver but just wanting something casual, cheap, and fuss-free!"

So far, so good. 

No one who ate the pizza became ill. Bonus thumbs up!

There are some cool toppings/flavors that make this place a bit out of the ordinary. My one gripe is the crust is a bit too thin, but that is purely personal preference. Alas, I don&#39;t live within a proximity that will allow me to partake of one of this establishment&#39;s signature attribute:  crazy late hours.

My late-night cravings for cherry and apple pie finally have an answer!  But lo, it was not to be.  But don&#39;t weep too hard pie fans; Pie Hole is serving up some A-OK pizza for those greasy cravings.

While the storefront of Pie Hole really looks teeny tiny, once you step foot inside you&#39;ll discover it is crazy spacious!  Funky murals decorate the walls, so be sure to take your eyes off your pizza for a few minutes to check them out.  There&#39;s plenty of seating to be had throughout this long pizza joint.

Okay, so it&#39;s a cool space.  How&#39;s the pizza?  Pretty damn tasty for a few bucks!  And slices are of course massive.  Not Fat Sully&#39;s massive, but one or two is definitely plenty.

So if you&#39;re in the need for a quick bite while meandering Broadway, definitely pop into Pie Hole.  You&#39;ll be in and out in no time.  And satisfied to boot!"

It really hits its stride after midnight. Let&#39;s face it, that&#39;s when a bargain slice of delicious pizza and a dollar beer sound their best. The dingy, creatively painted back room reminds me of every small music venue I have ever visited and the folks who work there were great.

They always have at least six pies on the go and the slices are generally between $2-$3 - a pretty great deal. They also always have daily special slices with interesting combos.  They were out of roasted potato and bacon which sounded tasty so I went old school and got a plain cheese slice. They also deliver and I can&#39;t wait to order from the menu that offers a drunk candy or bbq porker pie. The graffiti walls remind me of Anthony&#39;s off of 16th Street Mall.

For lack of a better word.  The crust reminds me of something I could do myself at home and the slices are kind of small and very light on the toppings.  They threw our slice into the oven for probably not more than 30 seconds.  It seemed like it was for show more than anything else.  The result was not an ooey gooey, craveworthy slice, but basically something to shove in your pie hole (see what I did there?) after a night of drinking.

However, they appeared to have very cheap PBRs and the ambience was a bit better than Sexy Pizza (read: darker and more places to sit).  Also, this stretch of Broadway was in need of an easy pizza by the slice spot (there&#39;s Famous Pizza up the street, but that place is terrible).  

I think they&#39;re somewhat new, so perhaps they will refine their pizza craft and make this place a go-to for late night, post-bar food on Broadway."

Slice was small had good flavor but also seemed like it had  been sitting out for several hours. There was only 1 gigantic piece of peperoni on my slice.

IF you like a pizza that&#39;s cracker like with little to no sauce this place maybe for you.  Like I said it did not taste bad just nothing special and I  was hopping for something better.

The classics are A+ and the crew makes some great specialties too. Definitely go for anything on spicy or vegan sauce. These are made in house and can&#39;t be beat.

The pizza was about $3 a slice and they had choices of meats, cheese, and vegetarian, all super good. I had to get another piece! I wish I could remember what I got, all I know is it had lots of jalapeños and was amazing. The crust was thin but heafty enough to hold all the cheese.

Unfortunately, because of this a lot of the rolls end up tasting very much the same. (Maybe if they brought in a different fish occasionally as a special? None of the combinations were really that exciting to me.) This business model may have worked in Colorado Springs, but I have a feeling that the palates of DTC denizens are perhaps a bit more refined.

To me, these rolls are probably about the same quality as grocery store sushi, and actually - if you look at how much actual fish is in them (see photo), probably less value for money. Surimi is cheap - dirt cheap (averages about $2.75 per pound), and yet there was still far more avocado than &#39;crab&#39; in my roll. The shrimp in the crunch roll was almost non-existent. 

The food seemed relatively &#39;fresh&#39; (with the exception of the wasabi in the little plastic cup which had formed a dark, unpleasant skin from sitting too long). Still, I would rather pay $14 or so for a roll from a &#39;real&#39; sushi place that actually has fish in it than pay $8 for a roll that is essentially some veggies, a ton of sushi rice, and a schmear of surimi, or a paper-thin slice of yellowtail.

I wasn&#39;t expecting this place to be Nobu or anything - I understand the fast food concept, and the delivery person was very pleasant, but I&#39;d probably purchase sushi from King Soopers before I spent another $40 at Sawara, at least I&#39;d actually be eating fish with my sushi rice and vegetables."

I had read the reviews, and some of them seemed a bit harsh.  I found the claims of some people that this was not any better than grocery store sushi to be a bit of a stretch.

(typos included) It tasted okay, but was very basic.  The shumai were not to my liking.  They were small, and rather flavorless.  This was $4 poorly spent.

This meal lacked bang for the buck.  My order of sushi, plus shumai, and a tip came to around $15.  That is more than I care to spend on a lunch where I am leaving still somewhat hungry.

Have been here numerous times for lunch. I have tried their regular rolls, specialty rolls, and the Shumai. All were very good. They do soy paper instead of seaweed for the rolls at no extra charge!! They also have some other options available in their menu if you are looking for something besides sushi.  

Service is good, the staff is friendly and helpful. You walk in, order/pay and they bring it out to you. Definitely one of our go-to lunch places. It is pretty casual for sushi but it works. They also have a card for frequent visitors that offer free stuff/discounts. Their regular rolls are a nice $4 and their specialty rolls are only $8... awesome!"

This place was similar to their Castle Rock location. We ordered special as we are gluten free which was easily accommodated. The rolls were tasty and I thought well made, not mushy.  Two items I would say about the food. The ginger added on the side was soaked in artificial sugar. Not cool or good tasting. We asked for gluten free soy sauce and they had it in stock!

Price was very reasonable: $7.99 per roll.

The restaurant is very clean and the staff was really friendly, explaining the concept and what ingredients were in each roll.

I&#39;ve been here twice as it&#39;s across the street, but I won&#39;t be back. I made a yelp account to let people know because I feel that this place is getting way more credit than deserves. 

There is nothing really wrong with the rolls, it&#39;s just the quality and quantity for the price. $7.99 seems like a good deal for a roll but the reality is they are very small. Think grocery store sushi size rolls or smaller and not any better quality. The special rolls are the same size as the normal rolls and 4 dollars more. My friend and I went here and spent 50 bucks on rolls and other stuff thinking it would be way overkill and it was just enough. 

We ordered two pieces the sashimi and it was served on browning chopped iceberg lettuce and the fish tasted old, but what do you expect for 3 dollars I guess.

Staff is nice enough and the place is clean (it&#39;s brand new) but don&#39;t expect any killer sushi deal. You can find much better sushi for a cheeper price at Benihana happy hour."

Presentation is huge here. It&#39;s not over the top annoying but the nice little touches. Plate is presented well, the rolls are tight, made to order, and don&#39;t totally break the bank. Had much more expensive sushi in Denver that was lack luster. For for the price and quality this is a great middle ground place.

Get your paper menu and tick off what you want and how many. Food is delivered in about ten minutes or so. Could order some starter soup but chatting with a friend the time flies by. Soy sauce on the table. &#34;Ginger&#34; and &#34;wasabi&#34; come with your food later."

7. TV (they were playing football when I was there)
8. no siesta or break during mid-day (many sushi spots I&#39;ve been to before are often closed around 2-4PM)
9. outdoor dining space
10. booths + table + sushi bar options
11.free salad with delicious creamy (peanut?) salad dressing
12. free orange after your meal that is cutely cut 
13. online ordering option available (for pickup not delivery)
14. pretty sushi display (with fake flowers)
15. many menu options
16. fair prices 
17. cool sparkly black tables 
18. waitress boxed my leftovers for me &amp; asked if I wanted extra wasabi, soy sauce. She was very helpful, smiley and friendly the entire dining duration

I can&#39;t think of any cons. I was very happy with my experience here. 

What I also liked was how I walked in alone &amp; the sushi chef asked: &#34;table for 1?&#34; (in a non-judgmental way) which is exactly what I wanted. I would assume that they would assume I came in to order pickup or take-out. 

I tried the Sushi Harbor special roll (8 pieces for under $10) that had cream cheese &amp; fresh jalapeno (and was fried). I forgot that I don&#39;t like cream cheese sushi rolls much so I will probably avoid that one next time. I also tried the volcano roll which had spicy tuna &amp; avocado + sesame seeds &amp; mango. I also had the tuna sashimi (2 pieces for $3. It costs the same price if you get it with some rice underneath AKA as sushi)."

The main dish is superb which is recommended of getting the dragon roll, spider roll, mango, Philadelphia, and even eel.

Unfortunately, the fish just isn&#39;t very good. The tuna and eel sashimi both tasted very &#34;off,&#34; almost inedible. We got one specialty roll, Sex On the Beach, which was just ok; there was no evidence of actual shrimp inside, just too-fried, ultra-dry chunks of tempura batter. This is especially disappointing as Sex On the Beach is my go-to roll at Taki (delish). The NY roll was good, but too much cream cheese, which dominated the flavor. 

Two things were pretty good: the spicy octopus roll, and the wasabi tobiko--a pretty little thing, too! Sadly, it&#39;s not enough to make me ever want to come back here, when there are far superior sushi places in Denver. Ultimately, the sub-par seafood and high-ish prices for what you get left a bad taste in my mouth, in more ways than one!"

The first time my husband and I split four sushi rolls, which was definitely enough food for two people. It&#39;s a little bit more than I&#39;m used to paying for sushi, but I&#39;m new to the city and unsure of what standard sushi pricing looks like here. Sushi-wise, there are a ton of roll options and the quality is pretty good. Most specialty rolls have the standard eight rolls, but they note it on the menu if you&#39;ll get less.

The second time I came for lunch and ordered a beef teriyaki bento box, which was an awesome deal IMO! For ~$9 you get a small side salad, bowl of miso, two little shrimp dumplings, four pieces of California roll sushi, rice, and a decent sized portion of teriyaki beef and veggies. The food was good (not super amazing or anything), but, most importantly, it&#39;s a lot of food for a cheap price -- I definitely recommend trying it! Note: They don&#39;t offer the lunch specials on holidays."

I was dissatisfied with my roll because it was expensive and very plain- which is fine if it&#39;s good quality but it had no flavor. The server, though nice, never checked back despite the fact that I hardly touched my food. As a server myself I find this to be unacceptable. It wasn&#39;t good nor terrible but I will not be returning."

If you&#39;re after a wide variety of Rolls, albeit 90% of their specialty rolls are each 90% exactly the same-- then you found your spot. 

Our rolls, salads, and soup came out quickly and with good service. 

Now if you&#39;re like me and you are seeking a truly exceptional Japanese Sushi experience, just don&#39;t set your expectations too high and you won&#39;t be let down. 

For me it all about the details-- nori paper, wasabi, ginger, how the ingredients are prepared. 

Sushi harbor is not world-class by any means, yet certainly eatable and worth a visit if you&#39;re after a sushi fix and do really enjoy rolls. 

The fish tasted fresh, the cuts were generous, and overall it was good. 

Most will really love this spot with a less critical eye on what sushi/sashimi should be in my humble opinion. The prices are fair and the service was also friendly. 

If you want the best and a truly delish sushi experience this is not it! 

So set your expectations on rolls and just a good sushi fix and it&#39;s A-OK"

Sushi Harbor is great!! My husband and I went for dinner and were so impressed with the service and the quality of the sushi. They have a huge selection which made narrowing down our order pretty tricky. We ordered small miso soups to start and our sushi came out shortly after. We decided on the Angel roll, the spicy tuna crunch roll, the salmon avocado roll, and the chili roll! They were all so delicious! I really liked how they incorporate the crunchy tempura into the fish itself j stead of sprinkling it over the top of the rolls like so many sushi restaurants do.

I didn&#39;t have the AYCE since I&#39;m a weakling with devouring more than 1 roll. I did have the sweet potato tempura roll but I didn&#39;t like that it came with eel sauce. Some places do it and some places don&#39;t so it was my fault for not asking. 

The veggie dumplings and edamame were delicious too :) You get SO MUCH edamame. I usually demolish it but my boyfriend and I both had a hard time finishing it. Great for a group portion."

They didn&#39;t skimp on this.  I just waddled home after indulging in several rounds of buttery yellowtail, silken salmon, robust tuna and a deliciously earthy black tobiko just to add some texture.

We came in on a weekday afternoon for happy hour. There was only one other table occupied and after seeing what was on his plate, we had to order it too. It is called the Crispy Spicy Tuna (see Linda T&#39;s photo of &#34;Tuna Crisp&#34;). Probably one of the most tasty appetizers I have ever had. Just trust me. 

We also ordered a few rolls and some wine. The Angel roll on the happy hour menu is pretty good too. 

The only issue keeping me from a 5 star review is the lack of wine specials on happy hour. There is buy one, get one beer and sake, but not wine. As much as I like beer, I always pair wine with my sushi and happy hour deals are what keeps me coming back."

This was my first sushi experience in Denver and it exceeded expectations! I was a little wary of sushi in Denver (landlocked state &amp; all that jazz) but this place was great.

I was extremely impressed with their selection of sushi, sashimi, and specialty rolls. My friend ordered the spiderman and it was so yummy. I ordered spicy tuna sashimi (a definite do if you like spicy tuna). I also ordered a normal tuna roll - not necessary unless you really REALLY want tuna. There wasn&#39;t anything too special about it. I also ordered the Dynamite roll - which is one of my favorites. It was SOOO good. I would definitely order it again (maybe with a side of eel sauce as this is one of my favorites).

The service was great. Our server was attentive without hovering. He also was very quick to get us our check as my friend needed to get back to the hospital for work. We were in and out very quickly which made the experience all the better. 

The decor - this place is a hole in the wall off of Colorado. You would not expect it to be as good as it is. With that being said, the decor is hilarious. There is glitter in the table tops and it looks like something straight out of the 80s. The music can get a little intense but its just all part of the experience. 

This is definitely a place I would come back to! I would love to venture out and try more of their rolls - especially some of the more obscure items. Also, they have all you can eat a couple days a week and I would love to come check this out as all you can eat sushi is definitely appealing."

In this tucked away sushi spot off Colorado the service is almost over accommodating and helpful with the extensive menu. With a very adventurous dining companion, I even ventured into the unfamiliar part of the menu and was pleasantly surprised with all the various options they offer besides your regular spicy tuna rolls. 

Our server&#39;s enthusiasm to help me explore the menu made my lunch so much more exciting and now I can confidently say I have had tuna cheek and will continue to order it at this delicious restaurant. But for the more standard sushi fare, like spicy tuna and yellowtail sashimi - this place is the jam, too! The mochi ice cream come in four flavors: Green Tea, Black Bean, Strawberry, and Mango, and are all beyond delicious with the perfect texture."

We went on a Thursday night and the ambiance was great. Conversations could be held in normal volume and there was an awesome minimal tech house soundtrack playing the whole time we were there. There was also the happy hour 2 for 1 beers which was a great value. 2 tall Asahi&#39;s for 7 bucks?! 

We got a variety of rolls and they were all delicious. The only one that was too much was the Fire Cracker roll, it was ridiculous and stuffed with cream cheese and deep fried haha. The Sweetheart roll was the best of the bunch, with mango inside and a thin slice of lemon on top. Sweet and slightly citrus-y. Highly recommended.

Ordered California rolls, spicy crunch tuna rolls, shrimp tempura maguro nigiri and toro (special) nigiri. California rolls standard good price, would order again. Spicy crunchy were not crunchy inside as was suggested. Either they forgot or the crunch is extremely minimal and not worth an increase. Tempura nicely battered but ponzu sauce was slightly off. Maguro wasn&#39;t bad but do not order the toro. I&#39;m a huge fan of toro and should have guessed it too good to be true. It was really bad and extremely fishy. So the sushi is what you expect, ok and looks like it has a good happy hour. Cute place to dine in.

Time was about 13:50hrs ish.  We opt to be seated at one of the Booths.  Our server gave us 2 Nigiri/Sushi/Sashimi Paper Menus, and one TO-GO Menu which is in Paper Form that looks &#34;used&#34;, which I found it a little puzzled with it.  Hmmm.... 

Each Sushi/Sashimi items begins from $3.95 to Market Price, depending on what you order.  The Basic Rolls are from $4.50 to $9.00.  While the Special Rolls are from $12.95 to $13.50.  Majority of the Special Rolls has Avocado in it.  *SIGH*  The Bento Lunch Box are from $8.50 to $8.95.

These are the items we ordered :

*  Yellowtail Kama ($10.00) - Sushi Bar Appetizers
*  Yellowtail Nigiri ($5.00)
*  Smoked Salmon ($5.00)
*  White Tuna ($5.00)
*  Osaka Roll ($13.50)

While I opt for these items for my Lunch :

*  Wasabi Tobiko ($5.00)
*  Spicy Scallop ($5.50)
*  Spicy Lobster ($7.00)
*  Sweet Raw Shrimp - Amaebi ($8.00)
*  Unagi Nigiri ($5.00)

We were given Complimentary Salad, primarily it was Lettuce with somekind of dressing in which seems familiar, but I am NOT So sure about it.  Hmm, my bad, next time, definitely I&#39;ll ask the Server.  Initially I opt to have Uni (Sea Urchin), but our Server said that they Were OUT of Uni.  A bummer that they RAN OUT of Uni, that afternoon.  *Sad Face*

The service is prompt.  But somehow, during service, at first, 2 items in our Nigiri/Sushi order got mixed up, aka it was DIFFERENT from what we initially ordered thru the Paper Menu, and our server rectified the problem by giving us the correct order aka Correct Nigiri/Sushi.

I cannot recall what actually Frances had, coz all the Nigiri/Sushi all look the same except the Smoked Salmon at her plate.  As for mine, at first they gave me the Normal Tobiko, in which from my Paper Menu, I opt to have Wasabi Tobiko.

Yes, the Yellowtail Kama, came out hot aka they either &#34;fried&#34; or flash-fried the Yellowtail Kama.  Its OK, though this fish can get a little fishy for some.

My order of Unagi, was overly sweet due to the Sweet Dark Sauce, aka the glaze, that they brush the Unagi aka Unagi Sauce.  Hence THIS Indeed affected the taste of the Unagi Nigiri itself.

As for the Sweet Raw Shrimp, this is yet another establishment, that embedded the FRIED SHRIMP HEADS with Sushi Rice and drizzled it with the Sweet Dark Sauce.  Why Oh Why??  Err, the next time around, I would ask them, if I can have my FRIED SHRIMP HEADS, just FRIED, WITHOUT The Sauce.

Frances also ordered the Hot Green Tea ($1.75), while I just opt for water.  Our server periodically come to our table, and re-fill our beverages.  At the end of our Late Lunch, we each ordered the Mochi Ice Cream.  Each Mochi order was $4.50.  It comes with your options of 2 Different Flavors.  Frances had the Green Tea and Strawberry, while I opt to have the Mango and Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream.

All in all Decent Sushi.  To Go Back, its a &#34;MAYBE&#34;, if I am in the neighborhood and perhaps from there my review might differ.  The Server that afternoon his name is Tom.  From the conversation we had, he comes from Indonesia.  I wish and hope Sushi Harbor well in their business venture and future undertakings.  Left this establishment at about 15:30hrs ish.

There is a parking lot, next to Sushi Harbor and plenty along the streets.

I had the crab and avocado salad, a salmon roll. and an unagi avocado roll.  The order came with soy sauce, peanut sauce and a spicy mayo sauce.

I really liked the salad - healthy portion of avocado (which I love) and an assortment of greens - no iceburg - Yay!  The peanut sauce that I poured over the salad really had a nice taste to it.  The salmon roll had nice size chunks of salmon and was fresh to boot. The only nit pick was the unagi/avocado roll was a little skimpy on the unagi.  

The prices were reasonable, and I love the fact that I can order through Grub Hub and 45 minutes later there is a knock on my door!"

This is a newer sushi joint near my home in Mayfair.

While it was 9:30pm on a weeknight  there were a decent number of people still eating. Without asking our server Tom brought my girlfriend and I salads, which is a nice way to start any meal. The dressing was a peanut ginger and not too sweet or heavy. It was a traditional mix of lettuce and carrots. 

I had the large miso soup ($4) and it was huge. The soup base wasn&#39;t my favorite but was full of seaweed, tofu and scallions. I took a lot home just because I couldn&#39;t come close to finishing it. 

My girlfriend had the tuna avocado roll and boston roll with avocado added. When the boston roll came out the first time the avocado wasn&#39;t added. However, Tom noticed this immediately,  apologized and had the roll remade with extra avocado. 

Great service, funky atmosphere and decent parking. 

I&#39;ll return to try some of their other offerings, including several unique sushi rolls."

He asked if we wanted to order something different. We did. When he came back, he told us the owner refused to take the hamachi off the bill. We were pissed, but the server produced on of those fliers they spam your mailbox with that gives you 20% off, so it worked out. When we got our bill, both the hamachi and the new roll were on there.

They did everything right and has great music playing while doing it. They weren&#39;t skimpy on the sushi. Pieces were large and filled lightly with rice and heavily with fish. California rolls used the whole chunk of imitation crab meat as opposed to mixing it with mayo as a filler. The rice was cooked perfectly. Salad was nice and fresh and crisp with a great dressing and the dressing amount was perfect in relation to the amount of lettuce in the bowl. Service was friendly and the presentation was stunningly beautiful. Great place no complaints here!

Running dry on tea now, will see if a refill is coming. At $2.95 a pop for a cup. Sure hope to see a refill. 


The sushi just came and I personally think the sushi chef at Safeway does a better job. The presentation is terrible. The sushi seems to be falling apart. Still no refill on the tea. Looks like traders joe sushi would be the better choice. For 7.00 for 8pc safeway or traders joe would be much better. By the way still no refill on the tea.


now the bento box. i am praying that i don&#39;t get cold frozen vegetables this time with chunks of fat for meat. once again presentation is like that of a child with a clay set. The meet seems to be better. Had ask for a tea refill by the way. No water refill and they are not that busy for lunch service. The overall review for this place is it&#39;s not fine dining but has higher prices because of its location. For the 25.83 that I just spent hot tea, beef teriyaki bento box, crunchy spicy yellow tail and Philadelphia roll the price was somewhat worth it. 

Was the third time a charm yes and no. This time I didn&#39;t get hardened fat pieces in place of beef, and the vegetables were warm. Seems like the microwave is used a lot. The rice was still mushy like you would get at an all you can eat Chinese buffet on Sundays after your morning rituals and you don&#39;t feel like cooking. Overall a slow service experience. Maybe if this would convert to all you can eat buffet it would be an improvement."

A couple of us walked over for lunch today. When we arrived, there were only 2 tables occupied. We grabbed a booth and were given the menu and wine list...yet the menu didn&#39;t include the lunch specials which we new exsisted because we saw them on-line. So we asked for the lunch menu and were given copies of their delivery/take-out menu which was great because it had everything listed. Surprisingly, the menus didn&#39;t match though when it came to certain rolls which I found odd. 

When our server finally came to take our drink order, enough time had passed that we were ready to order our food as well. Not kidding - while in the middle of taking our order, he actually walked off to seat two people who came in. SO, after placing our order, we received some of our drinks - two of us ordered water, two ordered coke. Two waters came out, then about 3 minutes later, two more. My friend clarified that we ordered coke and he said he knew that but was just bringing us water - which really made no sense and I&#39;m assuming he forgot what we ordered.

Our food started arriving about 10 minutes later and while all beautifully presented, none of us were really impressed. I only had the house salad and chicken gyoza which were fine but hard to really mess either up. I do not eat sushi but those that did felt it wasn&#39;t very fresh (and yes, we realize we are in Denver and land-locked but based on the many other sushi places they have been, did not feel it was as good) and one commented that it wasn&#39;t as chilled as she is used to eating. We had to keep asking for things over and over (forks - okay, that was me but I am stupidly awkward with chopsticks) and my friend&#39;s miso soup didn&#39;t come and so she had to ask for that. He was clearly annoyed that we kept repeating ourselves but that seemed to be the only way to get things. I had ordered the rice which never came and he realized at the end of the meal and told me he wouldn&#39;t charge me.

Overall, not impressed with no plans on returning and that was the overall consensus among the four of us."

It was pretty busy for a Saturday night- more than I expected I guess because the restaurant is very new. We were greeted and seated immediately in a cozy booth. 

We ordered several rolls- spider, rainbow, spicy tuna, spicy scallop, and a mango tuna roll. Loved it. The sushi rolls are well made and beautifully presented. The fish is fresh and I liked how they weren&#39;t overloaded with excessive sauces or too large. We devoured every last bit. The price scale on yelp says $$$ but I feel like prices are not that extreme. There are many of the regular small rolls that are well-priced. The larger specialty rolls are around $12-14, which is not too bad and relatively normal I think. 

The service was good. They were always attentive. The waiter was very gracious. The only setback we experienced was waiting almost 40 min for our food after ordering. Not sure what the hiccup was about, but during that time period, the waiter kept coming over and apologizing and letting us know that our food was not forgotten. He brought out a small salad for us to share on the house. It was funny because he actually brought out 2 servings of salad but only put one down on the table...oh well it was for free, not going to complain. I think he was giving the other one to the table next to us and doing the same. 

Meanwhile I was eyeballing the 4 sushi chefs at the bar and they were working working away...not really not sure what happened and why we had to wait so long, but perhaps they accidently skipped our order. I know they&#39;re new so they are hopefully going to work out the kinks. 

Either way, I have a good feeling I&#39;ll be a regular here if they can improve their efficiency. :)"

While doing some errands at trader joes I happened to peak around the corner and find this little gem. 

I decided to yelp it and saw some other new comers providing their praises for sushi harbor. 

Well friends... it was Delish and hit the spot! I&#39;ve found most sushi places I&#39;ve visited in Colorado are entirely too expensive and/or the balance of the roll is off eithor too much rice or mayo (yuck) in rice or very little seafood and they had everything just about right, including prices not to mention the miso was pretty tasty, I hope they start to get a new following, their still pretty new about 7 months."

Especially with the sauce they give you. I order two for myself every time I go. The hand rolls are amazing as well and every sushi roll is perfect! They remember who I am when I come in and they always greet me kindly. Nicer than some other restaurants I know. The atmosphere is perfectly fun and cool and relaxing at the same time and the waiters and waitresses are all so polite and ask you if you&#39;re ready for plates to be removed before just taking them, even if they&#39;re empty. I had the Tirimasu cake and it was fantastic as well! Perfectly soft and light and sweet. My favorite thing at the restaurant is the peanut sauce though. It&#39;s amazing and I eat it usually with the beef tataki but experiment on what it tastes good with! I wish I knew where to get or make my own. This is by far my favorite restaurant and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes sushi."

I had the vegetarian combo and a lentil sambusa. Everything was spiced wonderfully!

I was bummed not to have gotten the stewed cabbage because it&#39;s my absolute favorite! I couldn&#39;t even get through half of my plate- it was a very large portion and lentils are very filling! :) excited to have my leftovers for dinner. I called ahead for my order around 11am; my food was ready about 15 minutes after I called. I sat in the restaurant waiting for no more than about 3 minutes. The dining room was empty at the time.

That was the biggest bummer!!! People around us that came in well after we did were happily eating. The other upset was the rock in the lentils.. They should have been checked for rocks before they were cooked. We never got anymore water. I could have used some with the richness of the food. We sat for quite awhile after we were finished, waiting for our check. I finally went to the bar to pay.

The first time I wasn&#39;t a fan, but I decided to give it a second try. This time, I thoroughly enjoyed my food. I think where I went wrong the first time is that I&#39;m not good with spicy food and everything I ordered last time was spicy. Very spicy. My advice is to do some research on what the different dishes are called and figure out which ones are spicy so you can avoid them. 

Very nice atmosphere. Clean and nicely organized tables. There&#39;s a stage and a dance floor as well. 

After reading all of the previous reviews, I prepared myself for a long wait, but the food came out in about 25 minutes. My water and coffee came out promptly as well. The host and waitress were both very kind. 

The injera was very good. Not too shockingly tangy like I remember it being at the other Ethiopian restaurant I went to. It actually tastes like something I would snack on regularly. Very nice taste. 

The lamb stew was delicious as well and it came with a salad that was fresh and crisp with a flavorful dressing. 

Overall, this was a very positive experience and I&#39;ll be coming back here again!"

You will leave here feeling satisfied, and probably STUFFED...because you&#39;ll over eat, because it&#39;s just THAT good. If you&#39;ve never had Ethiopian, let me break it down for you. It consists of &#34;injera&#34;--a spongey-like break that is topped with your choice of dishes. I stick to my usuals which are: the veggie combo, quanta firfir (beef &amp; injera mixture), kitfo (marinated raw meat), and beef tibs (beef stew). All are delicious and will not disappoint. *PLOT TWIST* you eat all of this deliciousness with your hands, shocker, I know. Don&#39;t be that weird person that eats with a fork, you&#39;ll get stares and we&#39;ll judge you. &#34;When in Rome, do as the Romans do&#34;--it&#39;s totally a part of the experience. 

The only drawback to this place is you&#39;ll wait quite a while for your food, and the service isn&#39;t the best, but it&#39;s a cultural difference that you&#39;ll just have to put up with--the food is more than worth it."

Our meal took almost an hour to arrive!!!We actually had to ask how much longer? ?? Our primary server checked in the kitchen and said about two minutes...NOT. If we had not ordered the wine we would have walked out.

The food finallly came. Two other servers were attentive explaining the food and spices. The food was delicious but overpriced. 

The atmosphere was dark and plain. Plenty of young kids walking around and/or  crying:-(.

The bottom line...never again....

What people say about their service can be true; it might take a little bit of time to get your food if there are a lot of people. But if you can get over that you&#39;ll realize that the food is amazing. The ingredients are always fresh and each flavor and each aroma is able to shine and is not overpowered by any other.

This place was recommended to me after a discussion with an Ethiopian ex-apt about how disappointed I&#39;d been with places on Colfax. She said this was by far the most authentic and best quality she knew of.
Ambience: From the outside it is hard to even know this place is open, let alone that it&#39;s a restaurant at all. However, once inside it reveals itself to have a nice, clean, well appointed restaurant, bar and dance floor. One give-away that it going to be authentic was the fact that all the clientele were Ethiopian.
Service: Very friendly, attentive and helpful with advice on the menu items.
Food: Lots of choice, but many of the items listed under similar names had exactly the same description, so it made it difficult to know why you&#39;d choose one over another. In the end we chose lamb tips and shurot. The injera was very fresh and tasty (and came in a large portion). But the lamb tips was truly delicious. I&#39;d come back for that alone. The shurot was a little more watery than I like it but my dinner date thought it was superb. With those choices alone there was plenty of food for two. (okay, maybe most duos would go for one more main). Either way, I was bummed that I didn&#39;t have more people with me to allow me to try more items from the menu.
Price: A little pricier than most Ethiopian, but much much better quality, so it&#39;s worth the premium.
In short, I&#39;m looking forward to coming back again to work through the various items on the menu."

We have 2 children from Ethiopia and the authentic food and environment is special for them.   The food is delicious and reasonably priced - we always have leftovers

In response to some critical comments:
First:  yes, the time it takes to prep and serve our order typically takes 20ish min; however that is part of the culture - expect it, then take advantage of the opportunity to have meaningful conversation with whoever you are sitting with.  
When you go, write down your favorite meal so the next time you can call b4 hand and it will be ready for your arrival in about 20min.  We order ahead and carry out all the time.

Second, yes, some of their servers don&#39;t speak the best English; but to me that is not a bad thing.  They have menus with pictures English descriptions and #s.  If you aren&#39;t willing humble yourself and work with them, they typically have a more fluent English speaker in the back.  It is such a self centered American perspective to expect non-American&#39;s to constantly cater to us. Working in a restaurant setting provides Ethiopians a chance to learn and practice their English.  Learning English is a challenging &amp; long process - So I hope people will see the opportunity to support and encourage them and the opportunity to  learn something themselves.  Peace"

However, the service was terrible and my husband got sick immediately after finishing dinner. The waitstaff spent almost the whole time we were there sitting at a table in the back chatting and texting and were extremely inattentive. We both ran out of water multiple times and had to ask for refills once the server actually reappeared with our food. We ordered a beef dish and the vegetarian combo, which doesn&#39;t even have any kind of explanation on the menu--there are only 2 vegetarian dishes listed and many more are included in the sampler. Also, several of the veggie dishes had a weird, almost fishy taste to them. I&#39;d never encountered an Ethiopian dish that I actively disliked until eating here."

My husband and I LOVE to find Authentic Ethnic places to take our kids to and enjoy and this one hits the mark.  It&#39;s like walking into another country.  You walk in and a good 95% of the Clientele is Ethiopian.  I also like that they have the option of sitting at the Mesob tables, which my husband and I enjoyed prior to having kids as well as having regular chairs and tables.

If you&#39;re looking for a unique meal where you can communally &#34;break bread&#34; with your coworkers, then Nile is a great place.

There were only one or two other groups at any given time so pretty empty for a lunch.  The air inside is fragrant with incense.  The exterior is a bit more unassuming.

I love Ethiopian food, but I&#39;m not going to pretend that I can name all of dishes.  Injera is the bread upon which the entrees are served as well as what you pick your food up with, but that&#39;s as much as I can tell you.  If you like lentils, you will probably love Ethiopian food too.  I ordered the vegetarian combo and there were about four piles of lentils of varying spice and heat levels.  A pile of cabbage stewing with safron or maybe turmeric.  A little stew of squash.  Some turmeric/saffron laden potatoes and carrots.  Homemade cottage cheese.

Our service was slow, but great.  Along with our waitress, a guy (maybe the owner) came out and greeted us and told us about the various beers (Meta is delish, by the way) and assisted with the order taking and then checked on us again.

They also give you a ton of injera.  Big, soft, blankety grey folds of it.  No plates, so we sort of set it on our napkins while we tore pieces off.

Prices are standard for this type of food ranging from about $8 to $15 per entree depending on what you get.  I think the vegetarian combo was $11 and came with a ton of little tastes....enough to be quite full but still have leftovers.

I&#39;ve barely broken the Ethiopian mold in Denver/Aurora, but Nile definitely did not disappoint."

Once upon a time, years ago, there was a restaurant called Nile, which offered the metro area&#39;s only (at the time) Ethiopian buffet lunch. 

As exciting as this development was, the powers that be felt that it was lacking a little oomph. So, the place became the recipient of not only a makeover, but also a new name (Artist Inyie) thereby also squelching the fabled buffet. 

But no, the throngs were still not coming en masse (despite much praise from the Aurora Sun-Sentinel). Therefore, it was decided to go back to basics. Inyie would once again become Nile, although the buffet was still not revived. 

Gentle readers, that brings us to the present day, and the focus of this review. 

Nile Ethiopian Restaurant is probably the best-known of the five Abyssinian ambassadors which line Havana Street. Part gathering-place, part nightclub (with live music from Washington DC [the Ethiopian capital of the US] and even further afield), and part chow-hall, it entices, excites and energizes. 

For appetizers, why not try a Sambusa (crispy, flaky, meat or lentil pastries). Their Ayib be-Mitmita (spiced homemade cottage cheese) is also the biziggity-bomb, if I do say so myself. 

But don&#39;t stuff yourself too silly just yet! The main course is coming up, and you don&#39;t want to miss this. The menu offers so many choices! There&#39;s Yedoro We&#39;t - chicken stewed in aromatic Berbere sauce with a hardboiled egg, to symbolize the union of parent and child. Or maybe Yebeg Tibs - lamb and rosemary stirfry served sizzling on a hotplate - Ethiopia&#39;s answer to fajitas. Go on, splurge a little. Be daring and try the Kitfo - ground beef served raw (customarily), Lebleb (cooked just a little), or, if you must, thoroughly cooked (but don&#39;t be surprised if everyone around you goes &#34;BOOOOOOOOOO!&#34; if you order it this way. Oh, of course they wouldn&#39;t really do that). 

As Coptic Christians, the most reverent Ethiopians refrain from eating meat for 200 or more days out of the year (don&#39;t forget that Ethiopia uses the Julian calendar and is on a 13-month system). Is it any wonder, then, that there are so many dazzling vegetarian dishes on the menu? Why, there&#39;s Yemisir We&#39;t (perky red lentil puree), Ye-Kik Alicha (buttery yellow split peas), Gomen (knockout greens)... or why not do a Combination? 

Remember, around here food is served with only one utensil, the fermented crepelike bread called Injera, properly made from teeny-tiny grains of Teff. Tear off a piece (right hand only please!) and soak, dip and grab your way to culinary Nirvana. Why not treat your dining partners to Gursha, and feed them by hand (a great honor)? 

If Fate is smiling on you, you may visit during a coffee ceremony, where the beans will be roasted and brewed (thrice!) right in front of you as the scent of frankincense wafts through the air. Enjoy the rich brew the traditional way, with freshly popped corn. 

Nile Ethiopian Restaurant brings to you a little taste of the Horn of Africa, right in Aurora! And don&#39;t forget - after (or better yet, before) you stuff yourself you can pop into the Bukharian grocery in the same stripmall called Solomon&#39;s (see review), and check out their tasty treats."

Second, I am a very adventurous eater.
Third, this place was recommended to me by an Native Ethiopian as the most authentic restaurant in the Denver Metro Area. 
We ordered to dishes:
11.Lamb Tibs Awaze  $11 99
Cubed tender lamb sauteed with onion, rosemary, tomato,
jalapeno pepper, mixed with awaze sauce served with salad
26. Nile Combination $11 99
A combination of all the items on the menu
The Lamb was tender, cut into very small pieces, and the sauce was delicious. 
As far as the Nile Combination, we are fairly sure we were served the Quanta Firfir (Beef jerky fried with enjera, mixed with berbere sauce,
onions, red peppers, and spices sauteed in butter) instead.
As we were not familiar with the food, we didn&#39;t question it. 
We liked the beef dish very well, it came in a cast iron sizzling bowl, and was very reminiscent of beef fajitas. Because the beef was dry, blackened, and in strips, we assume it was the jerky bu have no idea. 
Nothing was explained to us when we told our waitress we&#39;ve never had Ethiopian food before, she just asked if we liked spicy food, We said yes, very much, and would love our dishes to be made spicy. 
Our food was not spicy, We tasted no spiciness. I understand it differs form place to place, but being Korean, and my Husband being from Laos, we eat a LOT of Thai chiles and other extremely spicy dishes. 
Also we came in on a late Friday evening, the places was nearly empty, and it took over 60 minutes just to receive our food. I also understand that fresh from scratch quality food takes time, but, come on.
Our waitress was short with us, friendly enough, but offered no pleasurable banter even when asking about menu items. 
I left my purse on the chair when I left and didn&#39;t realize until the next day.
I called to ask if they had a purse in the lost and found or if anyone found one, they said no.
Pressing my luck I went in myself in person. Guess what? My purse was there exactly where I left it.
Not really sure what that says about the cleaning during the closing or opening times. Makes me nervous about the kitchen. 
I would love to try Ethiopian food again, but, at another restaurant."

Great food.... we all shared the veggie combo. Everyone loved the tea. I had a St. George beer - delicious! It speaks to authenticity when you see the place full of Ethiopians!

I&#39;ve only been here a few times (over the course of years) but every time the service has been the same: friendly (with or without my Ethiopian friends) and slow! Haha, that part is very true. In fact you would do better going in expecting a wait. Definitely sit in one of the traditional tables for the best experience.

I like the Zilzil Tibs (strips of beef in Berbere spice) and Yemesir Wat (it looks like yellow split peas but I am told these are lentils). Both are pretty friendly for people who are not used to spiced foods. If you feel adventurous, you can get the Nile and/or Vegetarian Combinations, which I think is the best deal actually and gives you a little bit of everything on the menu. If you&#39;ve had authentic Ethiopian food before, I&#39;d say this is milder than what I&#39;ve tried in East Africa and not quite as spicy but still flavorful.

* Vegetarians, Vegans and Gluten-Free people: There are good vegetarian and vegan dishes here but the delicious, delicious injera bread is either made of teff, wheat or a mixture of both. It is not gluten-free. A friend who came here said they were great though and brought her rice (without charging her) so kudos to them!"

We were here for dinner on Saturday. At 7 pm there were only few tables left and most of them are being served. We requested the waitress to change the seating where we have a light hanging over the table (so that I can see what else I am eating). The restaurant is little bit dark and only lights are exactly above the table. We were little bit confused with the menu and asked the waitress to explain the dishes. She was explaining what the order consists and after few minutes later we heard about the Injari bread from her and that&#39;s we want to hear from her. 
We ordered chicken wot, Nile combo and veg combo. The order took little bit time and I speculate that they took longer to make injari bread. They serve the injari bread with every dish and can order as many as you want. The veg combo comes with four different formats of lentil with different spices, cabbage and carrot, potatoes and salad along with cottage cheese. Coming to chicken wot , the dish is made of chicken leg cooked with red pepper sauce, onions and garlic and little bit of spices.  I wish there was more chicken than the sauce. In Nile combo, in addition to chicken we had also the lamb dish.
The dishes are delicious and awful. The dishes are not so spicy and I added some sort of spicy powder and it perfectly goes with the Injari. (Will find the exact name of spicy powder).
It will be a little challenging task to eat with fork and spoon, so be prepared to eat with your hands. Prices are fair and reasonable for what they serve.
Lastly I can tell one thing that if you are from Asia sub continent you will definitely like the Ethiopian food as the food seems to be of the same style!!"

I have two favorites and this is my top choice. I recommend ordering the meat and veggie combo. $12.95 So much food for one, enough for two. Great with St George Ethiopian beer. This dish is so good with such a variety of foods that I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to order anything else every time I go.  The waitress showed me how to mix the hot mustard with the hot sauce...I had never seen that before. One disappointment is the bottled Italian dressing on the salad but some how the bottled vinegar flavor works with the intense and stewed flavors of all the variety of choices on the plate. 

I have had Ethiopian food in many NYC and Washington DC restaurants 
and this was  excellent. Great for a large group of people, very big place. Live DJ on Sunday nights starting at 10pm! Haven&#39;t caught that yet but I am told the kitchen stays open to Midnight for that night. 
An Ethiopian cab driver recommended this place and I am extra glad I tipped him well. 

Don&#39;t be daunted by the mirror glass making it impossible to see in when you first arrive... just open the doors to a nice casual room of clothed tables. Full bar in back but still very homey. A few Ethiopian decorative touches with traditional basket tables and Ethiopian pictures. One visit there was an Ethiopian New Years Altar with coffee cups and popcorn in the corner of the dance floor. 

An authentic warm atmosphere with very good food."

I take it as a good sign when I don&#39;t hear English spoken at the other tables in ethnic restaurants. The food was delicious and plentiful.

And all you can do is scream loudly for help yet nobody hears you as they quietly walk away.  So you scream louder and more frantically and still no response from the multitude of passerby&#39;s.

As I sat at the table desperately attempting to relay to the server that I am here for the International Restaurant Week on Havana Street, and that I wanted to order their special which was Lamb Alicha, I was rewarded with a blank stare and a slight nod.  The universal sign for  &#34;I don&#39;t know what the hell you are talking about&#34;.

Okay, plan B.  We show her the flyer and I think that may have worked.

So we wait...and we wait.... and we wait some more before the meal comes out.  In the meantime we nibble on Injera bread and Iab, a type of cottage cheese.  We get our salad.  A basic bowl of iceberg lettuce, some thinly sliced tomatoes and dressing on the side.  Finally the lamb alicha comes out in a hot pot and they ladle it onto a large Injera bread that covers the entire platter.  I couldn&#39;t believe they expected two people to fill up on this.  The portion size was enough for less than one.  

Trying not to be deterred we attempt to consume the Injera bread but it was difficult.  It has the texture of a sponge, looks like a sheet of tripe and wiggles in a most disturbing jello like way.  However, it has a very good sour bread flavor to it.  

The lamb alicha itself was very tender and flavorful but it was consisted of a huge bone and some meat. The hot pot that it came in was left at the table so I lifted off the lid and all that was left in there is some broth and onions.  No more lamb.   What did they expect me to do with left over broth?

Luckily our friend had ordered the sampler meal and we helped her with the plate.  Everything was either a flavor explosion or muted and flavorless.

When we finally decided we&#39;ve had enough we ask for the bill.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  They charged me for a regular lamb alicha (9.99) and a salad (6.99) when the special was both for two persons for $20.  At this point the idea of trying to communicate this to the server was more painful than it was worth.  That would explain the skimpy portions.

I left unhappy, unsatisfied and very disturbed by the whole dining experience.  Given I&#39;ve grown up dining on dishes that Americans only see on horror movies, I was not impressed or even stimulated by this cuisine.  How can a restaurant be part of a week long event and not even know it by the flyer?  The communication barrier was beyond anything I&#39;ve ever experienced.  

This is the first and only time I would have liked an option for zero stars as this was by far the worst dining experience I&#39;ve ever had.  Word to the wise.  Don&#39;t come here unless you have tremendous patience and don&#39;t mind repeating yourself with the possibility of never getting one word through.

Not is it a Eek?  Methinks not.  It&#39;s a Me thinks never again!"

The lady taking the phone order was really unclear on if the bread came with the meal or not. She said the vegetarian combo came with one extra piece of bread and nile combo didn&#39;t. We ordered one of each and an extra order of bread in case we ran out. 

When we got there, they did not order the nile combo for us so we asked if we can add it to our order. The waitress had a really unprofessional attitude and was constantly rolling her eyes telling us we did not order the combo over the phone. Then she said it would take 25 minutes. We asked if there&#39;s anything fast like 15 min we could order she said nile combo (didn&#39;t you just said it would take 25?) Anyway she finally decided to &#34;allow&#34; us to add the entree. When we got the order, there were WAY too much bread that already came with the meal (one piece really?). They were also too lazy to put the salad on the side for us so it was dumped on top of the entrees. 

Meh. Food was ok. Sambusa was delicious."

The service was slow but nearly all Ethiopian restaurants I have been to, the food has always come out slow.  3 stars because although the chicken doro wat was delicious, I wish there was more chicken, more meat than sauce and seasoning.  I got very little meat, but plenty of sauce and seasoning and injera.  Also, the service wasn&#39;t very personable.  Didn&#39;t get checked on to see if everything was ok.  Oh well.  Things can be improved.  I will definitely pay a visit again however I won&#39;t order the doro wat again."

The service was very good.  The location is in a strip mall, and the restaurant itself seemed a bit dated.  We ordered a vegetarian sampler and a beef dish.  The injera was outstanding, though the other dishes were a bit greasier than to which we were accustomed.  Overall, it was a good experience, but we are more likely to try the other Ethiopian restaurants that are closer to where we live."

I fell in love with Ethiopian in Tampa, so I was so pleased to see that my new city offers several Ethiopian options. This particular restaurant is near my office, so I checked it out with a buddy for lunch. 

At 11:30am on a Friday there were maybe two or three other tables being served; it wasn&#39;t very busy. Our server did have some trouble communicating with us in English, but we were able to place our order without too much difficulty. 

We ordered the Nile Combination (#26 on the menu) which was advertised as including everything on the menu. My friend and I both laughed at this, but we were pleasantly surprised to see that our giant platter of food did--in fact--include just about everything on the menu. The foods were served on a huge piece of injera and our server also kept a good supply of injera on our table. I must say that I was very impressed by the quality of the injera. It was perfect! 

Even though my buddy ordered coffee, our total was like $16--so it was less than eight bucks each! This is a fantastic price for a huge Ethiopian lunch. Great deal. I&#39;ll certainly be returning."

She speaks fluent English and is delighted to speak with you.  The service is slow, I imagine because the food is made from scratch.  It is so worth the wait.  The Injera bread is so addicting. I always tell myself I&#39;m only going to eat one and eat like 3.  Ugh!  We took our grandson and he loves it (you get to eat with your hands and he says the beef is very good).

No more.
The waitress here is rude and will ignore you as much as possible if you are not Ethiopian nor speak the language. She appears to be as happy and cordial as ever with those tables that are, but I&#39;ve had to constantly flag her down for simple water refills every time I&#39;ve dined here.
The food is good, but not good enough to make up for the service and atmosphere (it&#39;s always very dark with loud music).
If you want better food with friendly service, go the extra distance to the string of Ethiopian restaurants on Colfax (Africana Cafe has been the best one I&#39;ve tried so far!)."

I have been to about a dozen Ethiopian places in the Denver area, always getting the veggie combo, and this place still stands out in my memory as being the best.  The flavors are intense and amazing, and they have the best variety of blobs.  Aside from the usual lentil and split pea blobs, there is always one or two seasonal veggie blobs.  Once, I had one with squash.  Another time, I had one with eggplant.  Both were very yummy, and it&#39;s nice to have variety.

Sure, the service is slow, and, yes, they pay more attention to their friends and/or regulars.  I don&#39;t much care.  I go here when I have plenty of time and plenty of good company.

I&#39;ve been to at least 30 different Ethiopian eateries around the country and the slow wait is always the same. My wife and I always get the veggie dish and this one exceeded our expectations with the flavors and variety. The enjera was typical. The beef dish (forgot the name) was flavorless and tough, expect to give your jaw a workout...it is what you might think of unseasoned and overcooked carne asada...best avoided. 

The service was friendly but slow. With any sort of African establishment, if you want something you have to ask for it; in other words don&#39;t expect your water glass to be filled automatically. You want more H20, wave over the server...a concept most Americans have trouble adapting to. 

The setting is more in tune for an evening experience, it is dark and the likes of Kenny G is pumping out of the speakers. A full bar with Fat Tire and Heineken on draft plus a bottle of Johnny Walker Black. Better yet keep it real, then go for the Ethiopian beer and wine."

I have been here before, but was never very impressed with the food, until tonight.  Now, I think I&#39;ll be quite a regular.

The place was busy tonight.  Quite a few people were dining in.  But I love going home and getting in my pajamas and nibbling at Ethiopian food all evening.  And believe me, I got enough to nibble ALL evening.

I asked for the vegetarian combo.  It took about 20 minutes to get my order.  While I was waiting, I was offered free tea or coffee by the very friendly staff.

When I got to my car, I took a look into my takeout container.  It was filled to the brim and smelled wonderful.  I&#39;d been a little worried, because only after I ordered the combo did I notice that the fish dish (Fish Tibs Derek) was listed under the vegetarian dishes, and I&#39;m really not a seafood fan.  No fish on this combo (YES!).  I may have nibbled a little Injera (Enjera?  Pick your favorite spelling) on the way home.

When I got home, I started eating.  The combo had not only their dishes listed on the menu, lentils (Yemisir Wat) and chickpeas (Shiro Wat), but several other stews of potatoes and carrots and other combinations of lentils and such.  There were  at least 7 different stews in my combination.  It didn&#39;t stop there, through.  There were four different salads on top of the Injera covering the hot dishes.  A green salad with no dressing, a cabbage salad with no dressing, a cucumber and tomato salad in a vinegar dressing and Injera salad called Yetimatim Fitfit, which I adore.

I made it through about half of the takeout box with the help of my medium sized mutt, who thinks Ethiopian food is about the best thing on the planet.  Seriously, she&#39;d beg, borrow or steal for Injera.  She actually did beg, but she knows better than to steal and I think dogs have no concept of borrowing, really.  But I digress.  I still have half of my plate for a midnight snack, and tomorrow I have a date with the treadmill.

So good!

Oh, and one tip for everyone new to Ethiopian food:  those aren&#39;t green bell peppers in your salad.  Just sayin&#39;."

1. I am NOT an expert in Ethiopian food;  the first time I went here I asked for a fork because I did not know you eat with your hands
2. If you are looking to get in and out, choose another place.  Speedy service is NOT their forte.

With that being said, they still get 5 stars in my book (take away a star if you are counting for service as well).  As I said above, I am no expert in Ethiopian food and half the time don&#39;t know what I am eating.  Regardless, it all tastes magnificent.  The portions are huge and you will certainly leave satisfied. 

Also, I tried this place because EVERY cab driver I have spoken to has recommended this place.  Now I know why.

The wait staff was great, too.  Very responsive and fast (it just takes a lot of time for your food to come out).  But my waitress spoke English very well and took the time to go over the menu with me and even made some recommendations, clearly because I looked like I had no idea what I was doing :)"

Everything was fantastic, my wife ordered the Lamb, the Lamb was roasted to perfection with garlic and just the right spice, it was heavenly yummmmm! The prices are fair and you get your moneys worth!

The Atmosphere is quaint as well as a very friendly wait staff. If you and your significant other want to escape to another country right in the Mile High City and experience a great food experience you will want to try The Nile Ethiopian Restaurant it will not disappoint!

I went with a friend of mine that is orginally from Ethiopia/Eritrea area, he usually doesn&#39;t eat Ethiopian food, but I had been asking him to either make some Ethiopian food for me, or accompany me to a restaurant. So he chose this restaurant....

When we arrived we waited to be seated, and when the waitress approached, my friend started speaking to her in Amharic and she seemed please that he spoke their language. They discussed where we could sit and we followed them to the table. The waitress seemed pretty friendly at first, but once I started to place my drink order and obviously I spoke English with and American/Coloradan accent, she got upset. I asked if they had lemonade or Ice Tea and sucked her teeth at me and said no. I asked her what type of sodas they had and she said, &#34;mountain dew.&#34; So that&#39;s what I ordered. When she returned she brought me a Sprite and slammed the can down on the table and walked away. She came back a few minutes later and my friend started to order in Amharic, I told her I would like to order the number 8, she, again, sucked her teeth and walked away.

When she returned 20 minutes later with our dishes, she purposely dropped mine on the table and then gently placed the dish for my friend. I could tell my friend was getting upset with her and he snapped at her in Amharic, and she prepped my dish (I guess, the way it was supposed to be.) then left, and she never returned. 

There were a few customers that walked in after us, and was promptly served and given their check before they even returned to see how our meal was.

My friend had to flag her down, he ordered tea and asked her to clear away our dishes because we were finished. At this point, he was frustrated and was speaking to her in English. He asked her to bring me some water. After another 20 minutes, he again had to ask her for water and tea, by the time she brought the tea, he was so upset. 

He then had to ask her for the check three times in 35 minutes.

We left a few moments later, and he vowed to never go back there again! I told him that the food was actually good, it was just hard to eat with the right hand the whole time, when they had only given us each one napkin (in restaurant with no utensils). And his response was, &#34;You can eat authentic Ethiopian food that tastes like that from any of these restaurants in Denver, I am so upset at the way they treated you.&#34; 

I think that he may have over heard them saying things about me, when I got up to go wash my hands in the bathroom before we ate... 
I will never go back to this restaurant!!

I am not sure if they were upset with the fact that he was with an American, or if they are just that rude!!

Good Luck!!"

My uncertainty about this place is their prices and customer service. The kid at the counter is usually watching a movie and when you come in he acts like you disturbed him by being short with answers and making you feel rushed out the store. Not a big deal watching  a movie to kill time, I understand as I&#39;m killing time writing this review now. But I tend to take note of that since the focus should be on the customer and not the fact that someone disturbed your movie. So the other day I had the kids by myself and decided to order delivery. The meal that I ordered was 13.95 but when he gave me the total to pay it was almost $19? So when I asked why he said $2 delivery charge and $1.50 sub for noodle vs rice and tax. OK I&#39;m home alone with young kids, I&#39;ll pay this ridiculous amount for the convenience right now. Food was delivered in no time.. so when the guy delivered and I signed the receipt, the man says &#34;wow, no tip?&#34; So I quickly let him know that I paid a delivery charge already. He tells me that the trip charge goes to the owner not to him. I then let him know that he needs to speak to the owner on how their running the business since I&#39;ve already paid  $19 for this subpar at best food. This guy gets upset saying that he wasted his gas to deliver the food to me.. I am through with this place. 

2 or 3 stars because the food is worth eating but it&#39;s like having to go to your ex-girlfriends from hell house to get it! 

I will not be ordering from here anymore."

The have a nice seating area which from the outside I wasn&#39;t sure if they would have much indoor seating.  

We tried the Calamari (good but I wish the batter was a little lighter) that had a good sweet chili sauce and nice and hot asian mustard.  Then the pot stickers which were standard and tasty. For the last starter we had the spinach and cheese wontons where were nothing special, but good.  A couple more apps on the menu I will like to try next time.  

For the main meal I had the Seafood Supreme which was delishious, the seafood was cooked perfectly (tender and moist) and the veggies were spectacular cooked enough with just a little snap and crunch (very fresh).  My husband got the General Taos Chicken extra spicy and he enjoyed that as well.

The staff is friendly, the food came quick, and while the menu isn&#39;t huge it does have a great variety (Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese) and in a couple of their dishes (salad and lettuce wraps) they added their namesake sunflower seeds in the dish. 

Just note they just have soft drinks and no beer here, so you will just have to walk across the way for the Oasis liquor store or Two 22 after your meal.

The crab cheese wantons are delicious!  I highly recommend the lo mein noodles.  No matter what my husband and I order, we always make sure to get an extra side of those.

2nd order the food never came. I was baby sitting for my neighbors and placed a food order at 6:30. They said it would take 45 mins or so. I called at 7:30 and the gentleman said 10 or 15 mins. Called at 745 and same answer, 10-15 mins. Called at 8 and they tried to give me the same answer. When that answer didn&#39;t work for me he said he would call me back. Called me back driver on his way there now should be 10 mins. 8:45 I called back to cancel and he said 10-15 mins... I canceled the order it was too long to wait.
3rd Order(I know right!) Food was delivered on time, Once I signed the delivery driver(Older gentleman) started yelling at me about 30 mins and something else that I could not understand. Food was not good also.

My wife and I feel that we gave them enough chances and will not be ordering from here again."

We were seated right away and then waited almost 20 minutes to place our order. We reminded our server multiple times that we were ready. 

It then took another 20 minutes for the appetizer to come out. When our meals finally arrived, we&#39;d been at the restaurant for nearly an hour. If this was a leisurely dinner, it would be fine. During a lunch break from work, it was a little more time than I really wanted to spend. 

The food was absolutely amazing. We got the chicken samosa, Kalbi naan, chicken korma and lamb masala. Everything was delicious. I will definitely be going back."

The doll was not overly thick and heading nice consistency. Service wasn&#39;t overly fast but it was a nice place to just relax enjoy the food. Definitely a family run operation that takes pride in their food and the restaurant itself. If you&#39;re at Buckley Air Force Base this is definitely a great place to try.

I ordered two dishes medium (Lamb Korma and Butter Chicken) , I could have had a little hotter, but still the flavors were fantastic, and one dish mild (Bargain Bartha) which I normally would have ordered medium, but was conservative from my last experience.

The 4 of us came at dinner time and were seated right away. The place was pretty empty as there were only 2 other tables and it was pretty quiet. The entrees come with basmati white rice so it&#39;s actually very very filling. For dinner there is no buffet so we just ordered 3 entrees, garlic naan, and an appetizer to share between the 4 of us. Let me just tell you, it was WAY too much food. We took almost half of it home just because everything&#39;s so filling. 

Appetizer: we got the samosas but it wasn&#39;t what we expected. Normally samosas come dry but this was covered with some kind of chole sauce and potato noodle snacks. It was different but delicious!! It came with 2 samosas which was perfect for the 4 of us to share. 

Entrees: since it was our friends&#39; first time eating Indian food in their lives, we had to order the chicken tikka masala for them. They loved it! I loved it too! Medium spice level was perfect and the sauce was so creamy and the chicken pieces were perfectly tender. It tasted UH-MAZING with the garlic naan. The chicken vindaloo was also delicious. Even though we got medium, it turned out to be spicier than the masala so just a warning, you may want to go down a notch on the spice ladder. It&#39;s a thinner sauce than the masala but definitely a must try as well. For the 3rd entree, we ordered a dish that was loaded with onions and chole. It wasn&#39;t my favorite but it was definitely yummy as well. The rice could have been softer but it&#39;s not a big deal. 

The service was very attentive and they quickly brought everything we asked for. They came back multiple times to fill our waters and I had a great dining experience overall. The best part is...for all this food and leftovers too, I only paid around 13 dollars. What a great deal! And you can buy the $10 for $20 yelp deal to save even more. This has definitely become my go to indian food spot and I will come back for moar!!!!"

Came here with my boyfriend and two other friends; one of which was very familiar with the cuisine.  Thank goodness for that because I would have not known what to order or how to pronounce the food for that matter.  We ordered three entrees, an appetizer, and garlic naan.  Every dish was unbelievably tasty.  Each dish was well-seasoned and flavorful.  I honestly think if I was to go here by myself, I can chose any dish on the menu and not be disappointed.  It was so darn good.  My favorite for the evening was the chicken tikka masala; which I was told is a classic Indian dish.  I also really enjoyed the garlic naan.  Garlic naan is sort of like a pita flat bread, but better.

The food was good:

the meat samosa were delish, they gave us 2 huge ones, never had them that big before.

Garlic Naan, was disappointing. I had better and it wasn&#39;t warm or fresh, maybe because we took it to go.

Lamba masala medium spice= delish. Always my favorite dish.

The hostess was super nice and attentive.  She kept bringing water and brought a hot basket of naan.  I stuck to the vegetarian items.  I scooped some veggie biryani, aloo gobi, and some mushroom curry.  I think the aloo gobi was the best of the all.  And eaten as a sandwich with naan, yum!  I wasn&#39;t a fan of the mushroom dish.

There were many offerings for a lunch buffet, but no saag paneer this time.  It is not too far from the Aurora Municipal Court.  If you are in the area, this isn&#39;t a bad place with some vegetarian options."

We all went with the lunch buffet option, which is a pretty damn good deal ($6.99/person) considering how many dishes they have in their buffet. That&#39;s always one of the setbacks I find with Indian lunch buffets, but I was really happy to see how big the buffet was here.

The food itself was also pretty damn good. If I went on my own I could probably spend a couple of hours getting more helpings. Oh, and the naan was phenaanmenal (hohoho), and it&#39;s unlimited. 

Overall, solid place. I would definitely come back."

We have tried variations of the chicken, lamb, &amp; naan breads.... So much flavor &amp; never a disappointment w any dish we order. We have even tried a few desert items, which were awesome. 

They do have a buffet, which my dad thought was great (this was during a lunch visit).... &amp; our menu ordered items always come out piping hot &amp; full of flavor. 

Definitely 5 stars - I really recommend checking this place out!"

It&#39;s located in a semi-sketchy strip mall, which actually made me excited (the best indian spots are not in glamorous places).  Walking in, you can smell the strong Indian food aroma.  This is why my Father (who is Indian) refused to cook indian food in the house.

The service was a bit slow.  The waitress was probably 16 yrs old and related to the owners.  She was polite and nice --- but clearly hasn&#39;t done the job for long.  It took about 50 mins to get our food.  We got the dal soup, lamb kebabs, saag paneer (spinach and cheese dish), and aloo gobi (cauliflower curry).  The soup was a bit watery, but the rest of the dishes were out of this world.  I&#39;ve had my fair share of Indian food in Chicago (devon) and this place has the best kebabs I&#39;ve ever had.  All of the dishes seemed very fresh and well seasoned.  Beware of the spice levels --- many folks may not be so tread carefully here and dial-up the correct level.  Their medium was rather spicy, which I actually enjoyed.  I was told they can always dial up the spice levels if needed.

All in all I highly recommend their food and will probably get takeout from here the next time I get Indian."

It was pretty dead which kinda scared me but don&#39;t let that fool you. The food was top notch ... We ordered off the menu not the buffet.  We started with the dal soup which was very tasty, medium was pretty spicy and hit the spot. Then our garlic naan and chicken tikka masala (medium) came out just as we finished our soup.... This masala was bomb. Very flavorful and went great with the garlic naan.  Side note the rice was cooked perfectly ... I am heating up my leftovers right now and going to relive a little bit of last night. We will be back :)!!!!!! They deliver too I noticed on the way out."

The food is pretty flavorful and fulfilling. It does take a very long time to get your food though (45-60 minutes) and I only live about 10 minutes away, but the wait is worth it. My favorite is the Chicken Tikka Masala with the basmati rice and garlic naan. If you&#39;re new to Indian food like I was, that is the go to choice. I&#39;ve also had the three cheese naan and that was really good too, almost like a cheese quesadilla. I can&#39;t judge on authenticity since this is the only Indian food place I&#39;ve been to, but I&#39;ve become a regular customer."
indias-cuisine-aurora,Sarah W.,H4WU5JLL_Vg-XF848kFPgQ,"Denver, CO",0,1,1,0,1126,yUXlWzJVR-a0Z1xEB9VF9w,3.0,2015-09-01,"I work near India&#39;s Cuisine, so I eat here with my coworkers pretty frequently. The building itself doesn&#39;t look the best from the parking lot (it is in a run-down shopping center), but it is nice and clean inside. This place has a lot going for it, but the main issue for me, and the reason I&#39;m giving it 3 stars, is the consistency of the food.  

My coworkers and I always do the $9 lunch buffet, which is an awesome deal for the variety of dishes and amount of food you get. The lunch buffet comes with naan, basmati rice, and usually your choice of about 10 dishes. I love the butter chicken and the samosas! They always have lots of vegetarian dishes if you happen to go with a non-meat eater. Make sure you get the punch card for the lunch buffet also! Buy 5 buffets, get the 6th free. 

However, I&#39;ve found that the food tastes different week to week. Some weeks it is delicious and I go up for second and thirds. Other weeks, it tastes very average. My coworker even found a bone in some of the sauce the other day which is pretty unappetizing. 

I will still continue to dine here because I have enjoyed the food most of the time, but I do hope they work on getting them the same quality from week to week."
indias-cuisine-aurora,Riza H. C.,e3fX7_qkoSm-6-yTdlwcXw,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,359,15,nJdwvIkOO1S95-9IpCCTcg,4.0,2014-03-13,"This establishment is formerly known as Masala Express.  Sometime in 2013, they changed their name and relocate to this area which is located at EAST Alameda Parkway and SOUTH Chambers Road.  Its in the Alameda-Chambers Connection Shopping strip mall.  Our recent visit was on Thursday March 7th 2014.  

YES, the weather is cold.  YES, we needed something warm.  Since we are in the neighborhood, after work, we went here for Dinner.  Time was about 19:15hrs ish.

When we arrived there are a few other patrons dining in.  We were seated promptly.  I am slightly confused about the layout of seating arrangement in this establishment.  The establishment is decorated with cute trinkets.  The service is polite.

We were given the complimentary Papadum and the dipping sauce which consists of the Mint Coriander Chutney and the Red Chutney.  The Mint Coriander Chutney was a little watered down to my liking.  If I am not mistaken the Red Chutney could be Tamarind Chutney OR Imli Ki Chutney.  I may be wrong with this.

NOTE to SELF : Next time, ask the servers what are the condiments or dipping sauces exactly were.  The Papadum tasted ok, a little stale, NOT freshly fried.  From our complimentary Papadum, after ordering our food, we cannot deny our food took awhile to be ready.  

We ordered the following items :

*  3 Cheese Naan - Naan bread stuffed with 3 blend of cheese ($3.50) 
*  Chai (Indian Tea) ($2.50)
*  Lamb Vindaloo ($13.95)
*  Lamb Biryani ($14.95)

We received our first order at 19:52hrs ish.

Maybe due to some misunderstanding or miscommunications, I think we got our Naan order wronged.  The 3 Cheese Naan do NOT taste any different in terms of Cheeses they put inside the Naan.  Maybe we COULD NOT taste any differences of whether there is any 3 different kind of Cheese to begin with, in our 3 Cheese Naan order.  *Sigh*   

For the price and portions, they offered it reasonably well.  We requested our order to be EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA SPICY HOT.  Yes, they do deliver it well.  This was the first time, I was indeed &#34;glowing&#34; once I ate the Lamb Biryani...  Hubs like it too.  Our order of Lamb Biryani, comes with Raita that comes in a small condiment bowl and a little too diluted to our taste bud too.  The Lamb Biryani, comes with slices of red bell peppers, sprinkled of coconut flakes and silvered almonds as part of the garnishes.

As for the Lamb Vindaloo, for those it has the flavorful notes, its more to the &#34;sweet&#34; side, probably the Tomatoes notes in their dish.  There is a tang to it, maybe from slight vinegar notes.  But the Vindaloo is NOT as SPICY as the Lamb Biryani that we requested.  

Hubs order of Chai was filled twice.  Hubs like those too.  Its a toss of 3.5 stars for this establishment.  Hubs rated it as 4 STARS coz he fills that the SPICY LEVEL of the food we requested was on point, and is THE MOST SPICIEST we have tasted thus far from an Indian Establishment.  The Lamb Vindaloo though, was more like 3 stars.  *Slight Sigh*

All in all, this establishment has the potential to shine thru in our books.  Definitely will return to have the LUNCH BUFFET which is being offered EVERYDAY (11 am till 2pm).  SCORE!  Maybe from there our review might differ.

Left this establishment about 20:35hrs ish.

the staff looked like some group of youngsters covering up for the actual chef and waiters. ver unprofessional indeed.

To start with a simple tomato soup served to us was  nothing but a gravy. we believe it was left over gravy of paneer makhni/ or a tomato gravy made ready for some dish. on questioning, it was told to us it is the restaurant&#39;s style and they prepares like that.  we saw that all the staff here were  grinning behind us as if they were making fool out us. . they came out grinning frequently and watching us which made us evident they were fooling around.

this was unprofessional, manner less and very annoying. 

we were told this a north Indian soup and not like a south indian soup...a racial comment from a lady here. this showed how arrogant and unprofessional they were...
we asked her to cancel the order and they obliged, as they knew what it was ....

in another instance, Asked for a veg dish speciality/ suggestion of the restaurant, the reply was whatever u want

ordered for a dal tadka and roti... dal was nothing but plain cooked dal with 2 spoons of mirchi/ red chilli powder. i don&#39;t know what we were eating and  paid for. the roti were hard and over cooked.. 

paneer chilli - something, this was listed under gravy and we got a dry dish, that was neither close to a paneer Manchurian appetizer. was filled with jalapeños. 

while clearing off the cheque, we saw a guy come out and grinning all the way, looking at us and hiding his laugh.  wonder how lightly they take a customer for granted.

we were shocked to see good reviews for this restaurant and advice a caution to whoever wants to check this place."

We purchased the 20 for 10 deal through yelp and we&#39;re pleased how easy it went. The only difficult part was letting them use my phone away from my presence. Not that I didn&#39;t trust anyone because the server was incredibly nice and such a sweet person I just adored her, but more because it&#39;s hard to just have your phone so far away. We loved their dishes but why I must give it 4 stars is, I wanted the truly hot hot and got just plain hot for vindaloo. It was hot but not burn my mouth hot. I love a good vindaloo that does that. Their veggie dishes though were some of the best I have ever tasted. We are happy we came in, what a great place post thanksgiving! I know I will be returning again!"

This place is a little far from me but well worth the drive. Indian food is my absolute favorite and I just loved this place! I&#39;ve actually spent 3 months in India so I can be quite picky with my masalas and whatnot. We ordered saag paneer and navratan korma. DELECTABLE! Of course we had some naan as well, and I ordered a mango lassi. Haven&#39;t had a lassi taste just like the ones in India in... ever. It&#39;s a shame the restaurant wasn&#39;t very busy. It&#39;s a hidden gem in a somewhat dead shopping plaza. Definitely recommend!"

If the rating was on food alone, they would totally get 5+ stars. We ordered garlic naan, 3 cheese naan, saag paneer, tandoori chicken and chicken korma. All absolutely delicious. We got everything mild except the tandoori chicken which was ordered medium and it was HOT. I can handle some spice but this was crazy hot. They aren&#39;t kidding on their spice levels.

What made my rating a four was that I used the yelp deal, and they gave me some kickback on using it for takeout. I read the fine print closely before purchasing, and it said no delivery, but nothing about takeout and the description was generic. I figured takeout was the same as going in. Ultimately they let me use it, but not without making me feel guilty about it. So for those of you buying the yelp deal its basically &#34;dine-in only&#34;, which isn&#39;t directly specified. Also - there is no good waiting area for takeout. You have to stand awkwardly by dining tables. If you&#39;re offering takeout, I would say a bench or something needs to be placed by the front so its not so awkward to stand amongst other diners. 

However, these are small details. The food is amazing and I will be getting takeout from here again."

I was quite disappointed on how bland and flavorless the buffet food was.  Yet again, a repeat experience of not getting our naan until we were finished eating our meal. Like really? C&#39;mon...one of my coworkers got the last samosa from the buffet. I was expecting them to restock the buffet with samosa but we when we left, the samosa pan was STILL samosa-less.

The fact that they have another &#34;base&#34; for all of the Indian food other than rice is a big plus. They have this cabbage stir that you can put your Saag or other entree on is great. The fact that the cabbage is slathered in grease, I mean slathered, makes it hard to stomach. You could use it to oil a squeaky door. Also, their buffet selection was just ok...

In general the curries had no flavor or salt very bland. I am not a big fan of very hot food but i do expect it to be medium spiced at least. Buffet usually has some korma or paneer dishes for vegetarians but there were only a cabbage stir fry and red kidney bean and spinach  mo paneer dish. Not sure how the dinner menu is but buffet 8.99 not good. My friends who ate chicken said it was so burnt they couldn&#39;t eat.

Highly recommend if you&#39;re looking for something new in the area. Portion sizes were good, we got about 2.5 meals out of it for just my husband and I. Enjoy!"

Visited this restaurant in one of the biting cold evening. Enjoyed the great taste of spicy Indian food. The staffs were very friendly and nice, order was ready on time, and food was delicious!!. I ate with great relish. 
The interior settings,  lightings, music and  decoration give very relaxed oriental ambience. They have a lot space inside and outside with huge parking lot. Perfect for party or meeting organizers. 
Another great thing about them is they have HOME DELIVERY service. If you want to be cozy in your couch and have craving for spicy indian food, just give them call. 

It is great to have this &#39;New Kid in The Block&#39; with great service and great food."

There was another couple in the restaurant, but otherwise a little empty for an afternoon.  But hey, it&#39;s the &#39;burbs.

We were seated promptly, and invited to the buffet.  The naan came out fresh, and it was just okay. Very flaky, not a lot of substance to it.

Then things went further downhill.  We headed to the buffet, and the selection was very limited compared to other buffets we&#39;ve been to in the area.  It was mostly vegetarian (2 chicken dishes, and tandoori chicken), which is understandable and we&#39;re very okay with.  The fruit and salad options were limited to sliced head lettuce and watermelon. But I&#39;m not at a buffet for salad. Give me the good stuff!

But hold on, where is it?

I found the basmati rice, and lots of saag.  But wait, where&#39;s the paneer?  We weren&#39;t the only ones wondering, because we eventually overheard the other couple in the restaurant pose the question to the hostess/server.  What was explained was that other guests must have picked out all the paneer.  Each individual piece of paneer?  But who else was there to pick it out?  Surely not us.  I get that paneer adds to the cost of a dish, but come on!

When going down the buffet line, everything else had also run out.  I&#39;m not kidding when I say that I tried scooping food, and I would return back to my seat with a nearly empty plate, except for the scrawny piece of chicken I managed to scoop out of the tikka masala.

By this time, another couple had come and gone.  They were right along beside me, looking for ANYTHING to eat.  They left in a loud huffy.  Guess they were hangry, and unfortunate for them, we had eaten the reamaining scraps.

20 minutes passed, and 4 more guests had arrived, and I felt slightly bad for them.  BUT, lucky them! Another server/hostess came out with a small Tupperware container of freshly cooked chicken.  I was up at the buffet line, and that&#39;s where I witnessed her dump half of the container in the leftover tikka masala sauce, and the other half in another dish I didn&#39;t previously have a chance to try because it was empty.     

I will not come here again.  

The service was fine, everyone was nice. The poor hostess/server did a great job trying to appease and do damage control. She did the best she could with unsatisfied customers.  

However, restaurant management should revise their practices, because what went on was bad business.  Empty buffet serving dishes during prime time lunch buffet hours during the weekend?  It&#39;s no wonder the place was empty, and we should have left.  But no, we&#39;re nice and are willing to pay $8.99 per person, and leave a good tip because we felt bad for the hostess/server."

The flavors of the spices they use is delicious, I prefer it spicy and they didn&#39;t hold back. I ate here a few weeks back and got the medium spice which wasn&#39;t as hot as I liked it but when I returned and got the hot, it was spectacular. The sweet naan is not the best I have had but the garlic is very good and soft, just the way it should be. 

My wife asked for the shekh kebab curry which is not on the menu but they said they could make special no problem.  She found the meat to not be as flavorful as other places we have tried, might have just been the night we went. Overall we enjoyed the good and will definitely be back"

This is a great gem in Aurora....more people need to find it before it is run out if business. Only 2 other tables besides us on a Saturday evening. Had chicken tikamasla (probably butchered the spelling) with garlic nan and it was excellent. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I found it to be rather pricy. We had a groupon which was great but for the two of us for dinner with only water it was $45. The ambiance and the wait staff was great. The place was very clean as well which is always a welcome sight.

We have tried a hand full  of Indian restaurants in Denver but have never seen one in Aurora.
We noticed the relaxing atmosphere when we arrived.The Indian music was quit pleasant and the decor was simple but nicely done. My server was very friendly and had a way about her that had us feeling like we had known her for years.
I  have always been partial to the chicken Masala but this time I had the Fish Marsala. My wife tried the Chicken Korma and they were wonderful and rich. Just the way that I like them.
This place beats the other Indian establishments that I have eaten at and we plan to return on Tuesday for the lunch buffet. I hope they have the creamed spinach sauce because that is the next one that I want to try.
I highly recommend this place."

Chicken Vindaloo was appropriately spiced, as was Chicken Masala and a vegan curry dish.  The naan is excellent and the spicy chicken soup also.  This is the best Indian restaurant in the Denver area, and we will certainly be back. The owners buy their spices in bulk and grind them themselves.  It makes a difference in taste. Have also had the best tandoori chicken here that can be found in the area.   Highly recommend this restaurant.

Update as of 4/19/15:  Last evening we drove to the restaurant, arrived there  a minute or so before 5 p.m. (the posted opening time). The door was locked and no sign of anyone around.  At 5:01 we left.  We drove to the Yak and Yeti, where we had an excellent meal.

Well meant advice to the owner:   we wish you all the best, but unless you are able to have the staff in place at the opening time we think things don&#39;t look good for you."

They had fast service and nice delivery people.

The medium spice was just the right amount of heat without overpowering the great flavors of the food. The mild spice of the masala was good too but medium is the way to go for me.  

The service was good.  Our server, Laila, was very attentive.  She checked on us numerous times to refill drinks etc.  It should be noted that there were probably only one or two other tables seated that night, which is a shame because the food here is awesome.

Our server was a young female and she was really great. We ordered the Chicken Curry and the Chicken Jalfrazie and it was AMAZING. We experienced good service and some of the best Indian food we&#39;ve ever had. 

After having gone a few times since then we have noticed a few things over time:

1) The food is a little inconsistent. The first time we went it was mind-blowing. The second time we went it was still good, but you could tell something was different. They might have two different cooks? The dish&#39;s flavor becomes a bit of a toss up each time we go.

2) As of August 2014, their service has depreciated. They are VERY understaffed. They forget to bring out things we order. They&#39;re fairly apologetic but I don&#39;t want to have to ask them about missing items all the time. I have decided to never order the chai again because they forget to start brewing it and when they offered me a second cup I never received it. Its unfortunate because $2.50 for a cup of chai probably has a pretty good profit margin. Also, they forgot to bring our naan until we were already finished with our meal. 

This restaurant could do really well if they just had the staff to support the demand. There are usually quite a few people in there for dinner and they only have one waiter doing all the work. I really do hope they get the support they need, I want this place to succeed because their food its pretty good."

We got the vegetable and meat samplers. Have to say that everything was delicious. as good as any Indian places in town.

Service was okay, not great. Refills were a little slow in coming.

It sits in a shopping plaza and is nothing to write home about as far as looks.  Small interior with lots of booths and some tables.  We were a party of 5 and it seemed like we had to squish in.  Definitely not for big groups.  

They have  a big menu and even have wings!  I guess they took over an old wing restaurant and kept them on the menu.  I had a combo plate (cheese enchilada, beef taco, chile relleno) and I found it freshly made and big portions.  No complaints, nothing that stood out.  They never really came back to give refills, which was disappointing.    

Looks like they have a decent happy hour and breakfast too!   It really picked up when were there, so it is a neighborhood joint.  If in the area and wanting Mex, it is a decent option."

If you have read my previous reviews about Mexican restaurants, you know I love me so hole in the wall joints. This place however does not qualify. It&#39;s extremely nice inside and the service is pretty good. I have been here twice and haven&#39;t really delved into the menu too much. Both times I have gotten the tortas. The first time it was steak and the second was chicken. I preferred the steak but then again who doesn&#39;t prefer steak. That&#39;s not to say the chicken wasn&#39;t good though. Lit comes with French fries and for a Mexican restaurant they are pretty good. The bottomless chips and salsa are great and that&#39;s definitely a plus because I will smash some chips and salsa. The menu is fairly big and the fajitas, which I will try next, look pretty good. Also, they have what looks like a full bar so if you want to have drinks with your food you can.

Welp...I concede. Ha! I got a crispy chile relleno plate that Blew My F*kn Mind. 
The crust was wrapped nicely with just the right amount of crispy and the chile &amp; cheese were perfect. The refried beans are exceptional. 

We also had fried ice cream which also was delightful.

Portions were quite small for the money, and the pies were largely crust with very little filling. Mushy peas weren&#39;t like English mushy peas (which are made with cooked dried marrowfat peas) so I wasn&#39;t too keen on them (these were literally green peas mushed up a bit with lots of pepper). Not unpleasant but not what I was anticipating. 

Sausage roll was okay, but a bit soggy on the bottom. None of the food really stood out in terms of flavour; nothing was bad - just so-so. 

Didn&#39;t try any of the sweets, but they looked nice, so maybe they&#39;re worth visiting for that."

Those who have been pining for a taste of true Aussie tucker need look no further than Aurora&#39;s Cornerstar Shopping Center, which plays host to a beaut of a spot known as The Great Australian Bite.

The undisputed stars of TGAB (as I will be calling the restaurant for the duration of this review) are its selection of &#34;four-and-twenties&#34; - or, if you prefer, savory pies with a wide range of fillings. And yes, to answer what I suspect will be the next question, they do indeed have one with kangaroo on the menu - try it out! I think you&#39;ll find it to be a perky palate-pleaser. But in all honesty, the one with mouthwatering curried chicken is equally enjoyable in my estimation. Or you could also do steak-and-onion, chicken-and-veggie, beef-and-Velveeta - stop snickering! That&#39;s a perfectly delightful combination and you know it. However, as great as all the pies are, I nevertheless also have to put a word in for the steamy, subtly-spiced sausage rolls. Sided with mashed potatoes and gravy or green peas (available in both whole and mushy form), you&#39;ve got some bonzer bites to choose from.

But there&#39;s always room for just a little something extra isn&#39;t there? And that brings me to the dessert roster at TGAB. A quintessentially Australian sweet is the Lamington, and the restaurant stays true to its typical recipe of sponge cake squares napped in chocolate, then liberally showered with flaked coconut. Or how about a bit of Rocky Road? No, that&#39;s not just an American thing - the chocolate/nut/marshmallow combination is also very popular in parts of the Southern Hemisphere thankyouverymuch, as these little bars will attest. Fans of US-style oatmeal cookies will want to check out an ANZAC biscuit or two - as the name might suggest, you can find these in New Zealand too! But whichever one you settle on, you&#39;re sure to be serenaded during your visit by the authentically Aussie sounds of Cold Chisel, James Reyne, AC/DC.... who knows what you&#39;ll hear on your visit to TGAB?"

The owner Leanne is very friendly, had a good chat, she used to be a Sydney sider. So happy someone finally opened an Aussie shop especially so close to home.

That&#39;s what brought me into this quaint establishment, when I walked in though I saw several other types of pies, sausage rolls, and desserts.   I had the kangaroo pie, the steak and onion pie, and a sausage roll (READ: cheat meal).

The sausage roll was the most surprising.  The surprisingly soft sausage mixture was good, and the pastry was light, buttery, delicate, and flakey.   This was absolutely delicious.  I want another just writing this...but I digress.

The Australian pies are similar to English pies.   The kangaroo pie was good, but the steak and onion pie was hands down my favorite.  The kangaroo pie had small, if not ground kangaroo with vegetables inside.  The slight gamey taste was the only way I could tell it was in there.  The steak and onion pie had fairly large chunks of steak and was very filling.  I will go back when I don&#39;t have to grab and go, so I can sit down to try the sides, but my next long cross country drive will be fueled with pies from this place."

This was A LOT of food but I like to try a little of everything my first time. The kangaroo pie was my favorite. It had a slight game taste due to the kangaroo but as recommended by other users topped with mashed potatoes and gravy = pure perfection. Yummmm.

The beef and mushroom pie was good as well. Has a nice rich gravy on the inside. I enjoyed this pie without the potatoes and gravy on top. 

 The custard tart was delicious. I loved every bite. The fresh nutmeg sprinkled on top really makes this dish. 

Lastly, this place has great crust! This needs to be said since it is a pie place. The tart crust was exactly what you&#39;d want in a dessert crust. The pie crust were flakey, buttery and uber savory. I&#39;m hungry for it again just writing this review."

The pies are heated in the display case, while sitting in the case they get a little dry.  The crust is also kind of thick in relation to the pie.  The cost is very reasonable  but they would be much better off having the fillings in a pot then just put the filling in a bowl with the crust on top or cook the pies to order and have customers wait 12 minutes for it to be cooked to order.  I had the kangaroo pie it was tasty and different not like  chicken, but was a little small would pay more for a larger pie, and it was a bit dry.  I would wait for a fresh made meal."

I had the &#39;Original&#39; style meat pie, a sausage roll and mushy peas. How could you get any more traditional than that lineup?

If, &#34;hearty, flavorful meat pie with flaky crust&#34; sounds appealing to you. Then I wholeheartedly recommend you stop down there and try a pie. It was savory and delicious. I loved it. I wish I was still eating it.

If &#34;very flaky and soft sausage roll&#34; sounds good to you, then go for it. This is VERY flaky! The majority of the entire roll is flaky crust, with mince on the inside. I know some people who I would like to try this sausage roll, because I suspect they would love it.

The mushy peas were a bit bland, it really needed some salt and pepper (and there&#39;s none at the table, for you DIY folks either.) The peas also weren&#39;t as mushy as i would expect them to traditionally be. They were, to a large degree, still looking like peas, rather than like mush. But maybe that&#39;s how it is in Australia - I&#39;ve had my mushy peas over in the UK. I can only really recommend this to hard core mushy pea fans, this is not going to offer people who aren&#39;t fans any great new textures or tastes that they&#39;re not familiar with already. Otherwise I say skip the peas, if you&#39;re still hungry after a roll or pie try one of the desserts I was too full to try -- or steal a bite of someone&#39;s sausage roll when they&#39;re not looking.

The inside of the restaurant was clean and nice. The booths are very close to the table, so if you&#39;re a larger person, be ready for that.

I will go back."

We stumbled upon this amazing joint! I&#39;ve done a ton of traveling all over Australia and have family in Alice Springs, but it has been ages since I&#39;ve had Australian food. We had the sausage rolls, kangaroo pie, steak and onion pie, potatoes, peas, and mushy peas... Oh don&#39;t forget the Lamingtons! Also root beer and fosters! All were amazing! Not to mention the decor is great. Love that they not only paid tribute to the wild life and the flag but also the aboriginals! The aboriginal art is a great touch. Even the bathroom doors were themed with jackaroo and jillaroo signs. If in town I will come back again! Hope this review makes everyone else want to stop by!"

The owner was there helping as customers came in. Very friendly and helpful to this novice And I appreciated the suggestions. Food was so so good! The sausage roll was flaky and had the best mixture of meat and veggies. I also tried the steak and onion pie and mashed potatoes. Potatoes taste great with or without gravy. The pie was perfect. The crust and top were the perfect consistency and did not overshadow the filling at all. Highly recommend trying this place out. It is a little gem!

The founders, Libby and Brad, feel that everyone deserves homemade, fresh food with the best ingredients.You pay what you want or what you can for your meal. If you cannot pay, you will be offered the opportunity to help around the restaurant as a form of payment. Dignity is maintained and stomachs are full. They have FUN fundraising events (golf, poker, wine tasting, seasonal meal, etc.) to raise money to supplement the donation box funds to continue to provide fresh, local, homemade meals. 

As a lunch restaurant, every day you will have a choice of two soups, two salads, and two kinds of pizza, and the food is always on a par with Mom&#39;s best. If you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll be walking in just as a tray of cookies is coming out of the oven!

So many people stop in to enjoy the sunny ambiance and friendly staff. You will see volunteers like me, students, moms and babies, business folk, and a few street people grateful for a meal and a smile.

- check out the daily choices on the white board (usually one or two soups, salads, and pizza options)
- place your order (one of each - if you want to try both pizzas for example, they ask that you come back up when your finished with your first plate to order more)
- put your cash donation in the little box or process your credit card in the little tablet self-service station
- take your food plate and soup mug and grab a table inside or out (sit-alone tables or join the crowd at the big community table)
- pour some water, iced tea, or coffee from the self-serve drink station
- enjoy!

HOW MUCH TO DONATE
&#34;Pay what you can&#34; is the concept. Here&#39;s my guideline:
-  if you had breakfast this morning, donate $10 per person
- if this is your third meal in 24 hours, donate $20 per person
- every once in awhile up your donation to MUCH, MUCH more. It&#39;s worth it.

I&#39;m surprised that when I mention S.A.M.E Cafe, a number of folks are hesitant because the don&#39;t understand how it works. So here you are, process laid out. Now get yourself over there, it&#39;s delicious food and you&#39;ll feel good about it."

It&#39;s minimalistic and vegetarian friendly too; I personally enjoyed their veggie soup and couscous from the small menu. A single lunch is all I&#39;ve experienced at SC, and I was mostly there to participate with a group, but I found the atmosphere very pleasing and the concept humbling.

Love the concept, love the food, and so glad I was able to get out to Denver to support this amazing cafe. There&#39;s no way I couldn&#39;t give it 5 stars. There was no wait and it was calm and quiet. I had pizza, panzanella, and tomato bisque soup. My husband had the butternut squash soup. Everything was obviously homemade, so fresh and delicious - simple but hardy, just like a good meal should be. I could barely eat all of it, so there was plenty! They also told us to come back for more salad and soup if we wanted, but we were stuffed. The pizza was good, the panzanella was amazing, and the soups were both delicious.

They gladly sold me a to-go cup of coffee (with sweetener and 1/2 and 1/2).  I tucked $2 in the &#34;pay what you want&#34; slot and was out the door.

The food was quite good, though your basically eating whatever they&#39;re serving that day.  It was a comfortable atmosphere and nice service.  But I spent way more than I probably should have trying to pay for my desire for a better world.  And unfortunately, this just left me not wanting to go back because I can&#39;t afford it.  I know I could just go back and pay less, but then I&#39;m cheap and don&#39;t want to help others.  Just tell me how much covers your cost and a little more to fix the world.

I would love to volunteer here but at the moment have only dined. There are usually two pizzas, two soups and two salads available and our party of four tried some of all the offerings. The soup was a hearty vegetable offering and was tasty and obviously nutritious. The pizzas were also very filling - one was a four cheese and the other was mushroom. 

We donated accordingly at the end and as I said earlier, I can&#39;t wait to volunteer here soon!"

The menu is limited at Same Cafe, so if you&#39;re picky or not sure you&#39;ll like the menu I highly recommend reviewing the website prior to going, it looks like they update their website daily with their offerings.  They typically offer two soups, a pizza option, and a couple other items.  

The idea behind Same Cafe is with the base of volunteer work, and paying what you can and what you feel your meal was worth, if you don&#39;t have the funds you can do an hour of work in the kitchen, busing tables, or cleaning and the like.  

Cheryl and I enjoyed a chef pizza that had broccoli, olives, and other mixed veggies, tortilla soup, cauliflower curry soup, carrot and apple salad, and a pesto couscous salad drizzled with balsamic.  I want to remind everyone that we are not talking gourmet food here, so don&#39;t expect homemade pizza crust or 5 star items.  This is healthy and good food that is prepared mostly by donations.  The food was good, not outrageously so but totally worth a visit to support a local lunch spot trying to &#34;pay it forward&#34;.

I spend all of my spare time at the metaphysical store within the same block but had yet to be introduced to this place until an acquaintance asked me to meet her there. There I was exposed to the concept of SAME Cafe and fell in love.

They have a daily menu of balanced and filling meals and it is all volunteer run. The food isn&#39;t free but it is donation-based and, if you do not have the funds, you can volunteer an hour of your time to make up for the cost. 

The food is exceptional. It&#39;s not chow line slop by any means. All entrees are made with organic, quality components.

I have tried to get on as a regular volunteer here but even their volunteer list has wait list.

Never being fully satisfied due to that fact that the busy reflection of Colfax blocks my view, also the fact that my schedule never allows me the three-hour window I would need to dine-in. This week I decided to make some time, and was rewarded with an incredible experience not just of food and atmosphere, but also being able to witness the beauty of humankind. 
     I took my first steps into the humble rectangle, which gives a full view of the kitchen and dining patrons, and became fully aware of the warmth in the room. The yellow walls and the friendly, hard at work staff seem to project warmth from their bones, which the air holds tightly. I gaze to the ill-fated man sitting near the window, enjoying a dark brew from an eclectic mug. I followed the trail of tables to an earthy couple enjoying small pizzas on colorful plates and laughing. The sound of pot clashing brought my attention to an even more diverse staff busily shuffling about.
     The women in-front of me stepped away from a whiteboard containing menu items consisting of two soups, two salads and two pizza choices, without prices. After the women step aside, I was able to ask the server about the cost of my meal, to which he replied &#34;pay what you can.&#34; What? The gentlemen went on to explain that the SAME café is a non-profit and is dedicated to providing healthy meals to everyone. The food is organic and grown by local farmers or donated by costumers, which is why the menu verses. Just place a donation of what seems right in a brown box or volunteer in the kitchen to pay for the lunch. &#34;So All May Eat!&#34; is the motto of the SAME café.
     I placed my order and was served quickly with a smile. I received two mini slices of three cheese pizza, with a side of apple salad humbly gracing my green plate. I was able to sit near the window and enjoy the view with my meal. The salad was crisp, tasty, with juice apples and vibrant green lettuce; The pizza was delicious and warm. Unfortunately, the portion and my hunger did not equate to fullness, and I was tempted to retrieve another plate. If it were not for my guilt of taking more from others, I would have. If I had to put a price tag on my meal, I would not pay more than four dollars, but I donated ten just for the cause.
     I am no foodie nor critic, just a person who stumbled upon a great idea. The SAME café provided me with a unique experiences, tasty food and a lovely feeling of humanity. I would recommend this beautiful remodel of a soup kitchen to anyone from the business oriented to the starving artist."

SAME&#39; has been around for awhile and if a homeless person wants a meal all one has to do is do some working around the restaurant like do some mopping or doing dishes.

It always varies with the food, sometimes its great and sometimes I take it to go and give it to my dog, but being supportive and helpful to our community is the step in the right direction.

As for volunteering you can sign up for a one-hour shift starting at 10 am (where you&#39;ll prep most of the food for the day) until 2 pm Monday through Friday and 8 pm on Saturday. The prep work is fairly simple as the menu only consists of 2 soups, 2 salads and 2 pizzas each day. If you aren&#39;t prepping you&#39;ll be serving food or cleaning up, i.e. bussing or doing dishes. You see a wide variety of people come through the door; some are clearly down on their luck while others are there just for a quick and easy lunch.

As for the eating part, while the menu is simple it is also delicious. For instance, the day I ate I had a potato and arugula soup, taco salad and pizza with bacon, dates and blue cheese. The owners here use fresh ingredients from local people to make the healthiest food you can have. Also, both of the soups and salads were gluten free and they had a vegetarian choice for all the options. When you get your plate you get an envelope and you put whatever you feel your meal was worth in that envelope and drop it in a chest. Or you can volunteer instead of paying. And they even give you a cookie for after lunch. I can definitely stand behind that.

I think their motto should be Do Good, Eat Good, Feel Good. So what if it isn&#39;t grammatically correct?"

I understand the cafe is funded by donations from its patrons and run by volunteers; however, I felt that the food was worth less than the few dollars I plopped in the jar.
Tiny pizza slices, about the size of a small hand, with dry crust and hard cheese. 
Next was a coffee mug full of watery tortilla soup with some corn chips sprinkled on top.
My date got the asian-inspired salad, which was essentially peanut butter smothered chopped lettuce. *gag*

SAME cafe&#39; is amazing in the benefits it shares with so many.
Walk inside the now-expanded space and friendly, smiling faces greet you from behind the counter.  
There is a menu board which lists the menu for the day.  Usually there are two soups, two types of salads, and two different kinds of pizza available each day. You are free to choose what you would like to eat, and if it is ready, they will serve you promptly, or in my case, bring a fresh slice of pizza to you at your table.  The food here is quite tasty, organic, and fresh. Diners bus their own table, contributing to the cleanliness of this wonderful space. 
There are several small tables around the restaurant, as well as one large, community style table.  People who come here tend to come from all walks of life, and the regulars are known by name. 

While sitting here having lunch, one cannot help but notice the quotations on the walls...&#34;Needs are great, but your possibilities are greater,&#34;...&#34;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams,&#34;...&#34;Life loves to be taken by the lapel and told &#39;I&#39;m with you kid.

Completely unconventional.  Unusual.  And hard to understand just how this restaurant stays open -- since you don&#39;t have to pay!  You walk in, look at the simply laid out menu and tell &#39;em what you want.  There are no prices, no menus, no waitstaff, no tipping and they proudly offer organic and locally grown (as much as possible) food.  Still hungry?  Go back for seconds; you get it with a smile.  If it&#39;s a tall &amp; lean bald guy, it&#39;s probably the owner Brad.  I caught his wife, Libby in the corner chatting with a customer. 

What sets this restaurant apart from all others is that you pay what you can afford.  That&#39;s it!  By our own compassionate default, we of course then want to pay at least what it is worth, but really you&#39;d be inclined to pay more than that.  Or, you can sign up to volunteer for any amount of time.  I signed up and can&#39;t wait to bring my 2 teen boys to volunteer and my husband.  

Their blog shows what they serve each day.  If they have a specific need, they&#39;ll note that on the blog as well.  For instance, at the moment, they are in need of napkins.  I know that I have excess kitchen supplies of all sorts that could be used for far better purpose than that of my overfilled and underused kitchen cabinets.

In a dignified manner, someone hard on their luck can come in and eat with no worries about paying, because 5 minutes later, someone will come in and pay double or any other amount because he &#34;can.&#34;   God bless this couple for their over abundance of compassion and vision to do what is needed and appreciated.

Today I had the pizza, house salad and very nice ice tea.  The crust was truly really good, I didn&#39;t expect that.  The pizza sauce stood out for me and the green salad was not the cheap iceberg lettuce that most restaurants offer.  My balsamic dressing reminded me of my time in Italy, not bad!  No kidding, it was good.  Even better because I knew what it all meant.  Love this place.  Please frequent it and pay more than YOU can!"

The food was edible at best--the soup watery and lacking flavor, and the pizza slices were the smallest I have ever seen.  I went back to get another slice of pizza, as I was only given one (and paid ten dollars for this food), but there was no more to be had.  Again, I think that the honor system payment method and the fact that anyone can eat here is fantastic, but don&#39;t go expecting anything delicious, or to not be totally hungry upon leaving.  I had a second lunch after I left because all I got was a TINY slice of pizza and a small cup of dull soup but at least felt okay about possibly paying for someone else&#39;s meal."

I had the privilege of volunteering here today with some stellar folks for a really great cause. The fact that my 9 and 11 yr. old daughters were able to help with some table washing and envelope sorting was really important, thanks for letting them be a part of your jewel of a cafe. I will not get into the whole philosophy of SAME because others have already done so beautifully. I will however comment on the really tight ship and well oiled machine this place is.

 I was really impressed. Taking on this kind of endeavor could easily go south on you and must be a HUGE responsibility. You would never know that by spending a morning here however. This went super smooth and is a true testament to the high quality of people behind SAME and how much it means to this community. 

We did not eat here after we volunteered but not because we didn&#39;t want to. The quality of the food is second to none, everything is organic and prepared beautifully with the utmost of care. I just felt that because they have a limited supply of goodies we would leave the yummy stuff we helped prepare for those who may need it most.

It was quite a positive experience for this Boulderite to volunteer with an amiable Yelp bunch,  and then eat at SAME yesterday.  Since my trips to the big D are limited, and an old friend wanted to meet me for lunch and enjoys organic food, I was able to schedule the lunch with friend in at SAME too!  My friend really liked the food, and seemed to like the unique phenomena of SAME Cafe.

We worked a Saturday afternoon shift (12:30-2:30pm) that consisted mostly of bussing tables, washing and putting away dishes and a little food prep when the person working the cash register was slammed. It was very informal and casual and everyone there was friendly with a great attitude. I can&#39;t wait to volunteer for a morning session where I can do more food prep and play with the ingredients of the day. I learned that they get much of their food and supplies by donation so they operate on the fly sometimes when coming up with the menu of various, ever-changing soups, salads, pizzas and desserts like cookies and brownies.

I stopped by Same Cafe on a recent trip to the mile high city, given that it was one of the top reviews for lunch near my iPhone (and me). I was a little bit unsure if I&#39;d be comfortable inside given that a bunch of college aged kids (wearing tight jeans and looking like skaters) were congregated outside. I guess I felt old. Anyway, the folks behind the counter were all very friendly and there were plenty of places to sit inside.

They seem to offer a fixed menu each day consisting of one or two entrees, a side salad, and a dessert. This past Friday they were making two kinds of tasty pizza - tomato basil and California chicken - a great couscous salad, and cinnamon sugar cookies. Everything was good, and they offered to give me more a couple of times (I didn&#39;t want to be greedy, so I just had one serving). I did have a refill of the excellent agave soda; I really want to find that in the Bay Area. 

The whole vibe seemed very different from the usual cafe. Sure, some folks there might have had less than plenty of resources, but everyone got some good food in an absolutely clean and comfortable environment. I would definitely go back if I lived in the area.

We left about $14 in the collection box for our two small lunches -- by &#34;small&#34; I mean &#34;what a normal person should eat&#34; as opposed to what you&#39;d get at the average chain. This seemed fair for a total of 2 pieces of good pizza, two servings of salad, and two sodas. Really interesting to pay what you think is reasonable for food, and I&#39;m pretty sure that most people on Yelp will pay a bit more than they might actually need to...

The concept of working for one&#39;s food is appealing because you get to know the workers and the owners as well as see what dishes they can create on a day to day basis.  I do not mind helping out even though I am quite able to pay, it is the social atmosphere that I like there.  The food is fresh and portioned right and is flavorful.  I like the idea that a non-meat eating person can have a decent meal based on their particular diet that is nutritious and wholesome.  I would like to see others including members of our state government go there to work for their meals and see how they are doing as well as they are given all the economic indicators that may or may not be favorable in Colorado.

Yes.

Just go grab a bite at SAME Cafe.  Just by EATING there you&#39;re making a difference.  How?

The owners have a very simple philosophy.  Pay what you can afford.  And if you can&#39;t pay, you can volunteer time in the kitchen in exchange for a healthy, organic, all-volunteer-prepared meal.

So you go, you eat, you pay what you can - and know there&#39;s someone in the dining room who paid less - and you just helped buy them lunch.

Volunteering there is a GAS too!  The owners are awesome, the people you&#39;ll meet are fantastic, and you know you&#39;re doing good work for a good cause.

The menu changes daily, and features natural and organic foods. Choose from soup, salad, and pizza, all created by hand. Speaking from the volunteering side, I can attest that everything is fresh and high-quality. The day I worked, the menu featured bbq chicken pizza and artichoke pizza, coleslaw or spinach salad with pear and gorgonzola, and either chili or minestrone soup. If you&#39;re not on food prep, there&#39;s plenty to do: serving, cleaning, dish duty, organizing, and general chores.

I was lucky to volunteer in a larger group (your favorite Yelpers) size allowed, got to know people that actually help SAME Café regularly, helped on chores, and since I had the morning shift (from 10:00-12:30), I helped with some chores, organize their drink fridge, and make some pizzas. This place has an amazing positive energy feel to it, all the staff is happy and greeting diners with a smile!

Food:
I was expecting food to be simple and boring, totally wrong. All food prepared from scratch, with wholesome ingredients, very simple ingredients but well combined. Today&#39;s menu had a choice of salads, coleslaw or spinach pear salad, made with baby spinach leaves, pears, blue cheese crumbles, and balsamic vinaigrette. Two options for soup, a chili for meat eaters and minestrone for vegetarians, it&#39;s awesome seeing that they have options! Couple kinds of pizza, both of them using wholegrain pie crust; barbeque chicken pizza, and feta with artichoke hearts pizza, both of them very simple yet delicious.

Food was good but my review goes for the work they do, in helping less fortunate to eat. At Same, I&#39;d served families with small kids, well dressed people, few executives, and less fortunate people; regardless, you should go to SAME get to know their culture, maybe eat some, maybe volunteer, maybe donate some, but most importantly, get involved with this great concept and be humanitarian!"

The staff I&#39;ve seen so far was incredibly friendly.  It makes me want to stop by just to enjoy the scene. 

As to the food, it was pretty good.  I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say great, and it may be better some days than others, but the whole experience was definitely 5 stars worthy.

They also have some great homemade cookies!  I&#39;m excited to visit here again and maybe put in a few hours to help out.

I spent a lovely morning/afternoon here in exchange for my meal. I&#39;ve worked in a few kitchens before and this was by far one of the best experiences. The vibe is upbeat and sunny. The work can be fast paced and I occasionally had no idea what I was doing, but I didn&#39;t feel in the way or lost. I felt like a visiting chef help prepare the scrumptious 4 course meal for all the King&#39;s men (and women). 

Helping cook made me famished. I really enjoyed grubbing down on that meal though because I knew awesome people had made it and that only the best ingredients were used. The owner fellow learned my name and really made me feel welcome! Topping it off with cupcakes donated by the Shoppe had me on Cloud 9. While dining, I learned they had wifi! Sweet!

Whether you want to volunteer or not, I urge you to dine here. You&#39;ll feel good about it and you&#39;ll get a good meal at the same time."

So I don&#39;t have a lot of money, but I do have a bit of free time. I want to give back. At Same Cafe I found out giving back is not only fun but also a bit of a confidence builder. 

I helped to prepare the lunch options for the day including cutting romaine lettuce, onion, cheese, making cookie dough, and my favorite using the salad spinner. These may seem like mundane tasks but I don&#39;t cook. My idea of cooking is unwrapping a packaged meal and putting it into the microwave or oven. Let me tell you a secret I actually enjoyed helping to prepare a meal! DON&#39;T tell anyone and for the love don&#39;t remind me of this fact.

The last thing I would like to say is that Brad who runs this amazing restaurant is such a asset.

Came in on a Thursday night and waited about 10 mins to order, which isn&#39;t bad at all. You order at the counter, take your assigned number and find a table. The size of the restaurant can be deceiving. At first we were like.. wow this place is small, we&#39;re gonna have to sit out in the front, but there&#39;s tables in the back, and they have a back patio with a bar.

We ordered the cart-driver, peppers, and half a dozen of oysters. Wow it was tasty. If you typically like traditional pizzas with red sauce, I think you&#39;d be happy with peppers. The tomato sauce on this pizza is a little more sour compared to pizzas at dominoes etc, but it was delicious. The cart-driver was interesting, I definitely recommend this for anyone who loves kale, and for those who don&#39;t like kale.. I&#39;d still recommend this.. because it&#39;s super tasty.

The servers forgot about our oysters, but when we got them... we literally inhaled it. It tasted fresh and they were huge. 

Service is great, like beyond amazing. Typically at restaurants like theses where you order, take a number and sit.. the servers don&#39;t check back up on you after you receive your meal, so it was nice that every so often one of the workers would check up on us. Additionally, because they forgot about our oysters.. they ended up giving it to us for free. Which was unnecessary, but very generous of them."

All I can say is that I do NOT regret this decision one bit! We are normally very low key people who order fried apps so we were weary when nothing on the appetizer list sounded appealing to us. We still decided to go and try something new and oh my goodness it was AMAZING! They have outside seating in the front and back and the inside is small but very comfortable. We sat at the side of the counter and when I saw they had Prosecco on tap I knew that we were in the right place! Their drinks were amazing and the pizza was even better. You watch them make ALL of the food and I was intrigued by the care that they had shown while cooking. Everything was clean and all of the food was fresh. 

Before we left we wanted to tell the pizza maker that he did an amazing job and that you can tell he genuinely cares about the food he is presenting. When speaking to him we found out that he WAS THE OWNER! He was nothing short of appreciative and sincere. I do not have one negative thing to say about this stop!"

I don&#39;t know what was better, the food or the service, but I think they compliment each other very well.

1 - all beers are $5 and they have beers that sell in liquor stores for $3 a can so... that&#39;s awesome. 
2 - they have several vegetarian pizza options that are creative, fun, and delicious. Good job, guys! (the summer pizza without the n&#39;duja is great and you don&#39;t miss the meat at all). 
3 - the mushroom pizza with burnt onions was amazing. I don&#39;t really know what tarentaise cheese is but it&#39;s buratta-like in flavor and texture. deeeeelish.

The late night happy hour (10pm-12am) caught my eye, so I put it on my list. Luckily enough, Cart-Driver was right around the corner from our Airbnb, which was awesome. It&#39;s located directly next to Work &amp; Class.

The first night we stopped in around 10:30pm and ordered a $5 Daisy (Margherita) pizza. They also have sardines on toast and a couple of drink options, all for $5 each! I also ordered some spiced nuts from a deli case up at the counter and a Radler. The guy at the counter was super friendly and awesome and the pizza came out quickly.

The spiced nuts were just okay - I wouldn&#39;t get them again. The pizza, however, was amazing and a steal at $5. It&#39;s thin-crust, oven fired and enough for 2 to share for a snack or light meal. The restaurant is inside an old shipping container so seating inside is limited, but they also have outdoor seating. 

I loved Cart-Driver so much that we stopped by again during our short stay in Denver. This time, however, it wasn&#39;t as great - the girl working the counter seemed like she was new or just off her game; she came by our table repeatedly and asked us several times if we ordered the pizzas she was carrying (we didn&#39;t) and once she just asked, &#34;have you gotten your pizza yet?&#34; The pizza oven must have been firing hot that day as well, because they were much more charred than the first visit. Still, you cannot beat $5 for a pizza! They also have a regular daily happy hour (3-6pm) with different items. Check it out!"

Granted, I haven&#39;t eaten any other pizza in Denver, so I don&#39;t know what a proper basis for comparison is in Denver without having tried a lot of other places in town.

Cart &amp; Driver is a bit hard to find -- if you put the location in Google Maps, you&#39;ll end up outside of Work &amp; Class and be confused as to where &#34;Cart &amp; Driver&#34; actually is. It&#39;s behind Work &amp; Class, so just walk down 25th St. a little (the entrance is not on Larimer). It&#39;s an old shipping container, turned restaurant, so it&#39;s a bit on the small side. There are 4 seats at the bar, another area on a ledge with 2 seats, and then 4-5 tables that seat 4 people, maybe 6 if you squeeze in. There is also a back patio / communal table area. So if you&#39;re a party of 6, and it&#39;s not super early or super late, you may want to go elsewhere since seating is really limited.

There are 8 different kinds of toppings / flavors that you can pick from, ranging from your normal tomato &amp; mozzarella, to a white pizza, clam, or ones with meat. You should be able to find something that most people like since there&#39;s a good variety of vegetarian-friendly &amp; meat-friendly options. We ordered 2 pizzas between 2 people; we were hungry since we had been skiing all day, and ended up eating almost both pizzas in one sitting (we may have had one or two slices leftover). I don&#39;t think that 1 pizza would have been enough for us.

Cart-Driver Pizza ($15) - Sausage, kale, mozzarella, chili flakes. You can&#39;t go wrong with sausage &amp; kale on pizza; this has a white sauce so if you&#39;re expecting tomato sauce on your pizza, you may want to pick something else.

Four Season ($16) - This is seasonal and has four different quadrants of flavors, so it&#39;s great if you&#39;re indecisive and like variety. When I went in February 2016, mine had potato, winter squash, Asian pear, ham, arugula pesto, and burrata. There were decent sized chunks of fresh burrata on top, and they did not skimp on the toppings at all. My favorite toppings (in order of preference) were the squash, potato, ham &amp; arugula, and then the asian pear. I thought the fruit on a pizza, mixed with the pesto, was a little bit weird. The proportion of the toppings were a little bit heavy compared to the thinness and lightness of the crust. I&#39;m glad we got to try this flavor as it gave us a lot of variety - my boyfriend and I were able to eat one piece of each flavor.

The crust was also nice, light, and chewy, yet crispy on the bottom. It was a tad bit on the oily side (than what I&#39;m used to), but it was not overly charred and burnt, which I was happy about.

If you&#39;re in the mood for pizza, this is a solid place to come. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d eat here over and over again on trips to Denver since I would rather try other restaurants, but if you are looking for a reasonably priced meal, craving some good wood-fired oven pizza, this is a good option."

We dined on a sunny, late Sunday afternoon and were delighted to learn that it was happy hour.  With the sun lightly kissing our backs we enjoyed happy hour oysters as we deliberated over their pizza selection at the counter/bar.

I devoured the Cart-Drive (with sausage, kale, mozzarella, and chili flake).  Quite possibly the best pizza I&#39;ve had in a very long time.  I&#39;m partial to the olive oil (no tomato) pizza and this pizza was the sh**!  It was so light and delicious yet perfectly filling.  Another added perk is that the pizza cooks in just over a minute.  JUST OVER ONE MINUTE!  If there&#39;s one thing I love more than pizza, it&#39;s not having to wait forever to eat that pizza.

The pizza is in a brick oven and it had kale, sausage, and chili flakes.  The cheese and sauce were the perfect balance, and there was no way that pizza was going to be boxed up.  Ate the whole thing.  

My friend bought a can of Portuguese Trout, and they served it with possibly the best loaf of bread I&#39;ve had in America, and served it with a ridiculous olive butter that made the three of us savor and feign with each bite.  I&#39;m serious, it got quite dramatic.  But it was so good.

I had read a number of reviews saying Cart Driver had &#34;the best pizza in Denver&#34;. We couldn&#39;t find a table big enough to fit our group of five, so we sat in their covered section, which was still 94 degrees. The salads came out quite quickly, but the pizzas took a very long time to get to us. While the staff did make small attempts to alleviate the fact that we were dripping sweat while we were eating, a round of beers (fuck even lemonade) or something on the house would have gone a really long way to cheer up the situation. 

The pizzas were average at best. The so acclaimed clam pizza had hardly any clams on it, and the clams were chopped so small it was hard to tell there were any on there in the first place. The chickpea crust is a nice alternative for gluten-free diners, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone else. 

We felt the menu was just sub-par after being written up so well by a large number of people. The chopped salad was mostly good, although had bitter olives in it that could have been omitted for a significantly better dish. The giardinara simply isn&#39;t giardinara. It&#39;s pickled vegetables and should be sold that way. 

Maybe another time under better conditions we would have loved this restaurant. But I won&#39;t be returning any time soon to find out."

I come from the hospitality world and eat out a lot. I love it. The problem is that not everyone who works at or owns a restaurant genuinely loves being there, or times are hard or management sucks. Blah blah. The list goes on and anyone can read articles on securing good solid cooks and staff. It&#39;s rough out there - especially in Denver with our growth and our love of food. 

So I go to Cart-Driver for lunch, only knowing that friends have liked it. That is all I knew. 

I was guest number one of the day right at 12 noon and was probably a minute early. The girl at the counter was still finishing final touches to open and we exchanged a super friendly bit of words. She could have had attitude or said not ready yet. I told her I was so psyched to be there and she smiled and said welcome!! 

I sat down to wait for a friend and in walks a guy in a little chef cap. He smiles and strikes up conversation and here is where this place jets to top spots in town for me.... 

The conversation was real, engaged and genuine. All while he asks if I had been there before, talks about his time in Italy and the fact that he Fed Ex&#39;s fresh oysters twice a week. He is working away at a stunning plate of pickled fish with citrus segments, oil drizzles and fresh herbs that goes in the display case so you can see what you might order. 

Without any pretension or a tone of hierarchy Andrew mentions he was the owner and introduces himself. 

I am writing all of this non-food detail because it is the missing link anymore in my opinion. Communication is ever changing and I like to know that my food is made with care with stellar ingredients and by those that want to be making it. And with some niceties - look up the definition of hospitality.  

All of this and more is happening here. 

A small and curated menu with focus on small plates, fresh oysters that are delivered so perfectly displayed with shaved horseradish, house made hot sauce, shaved ice and a mignonette .... and let&#39;s not forget the wood-fired pizzas that are out of this world. 

And here is the best...... Fresh Clam Pizza $18 with Pancetta right here in Denver. 

I love love love love this spot."

I came here with my friends last night for a late night dinner, right in time for happy hour! We seated ourselves and ordered at the counter. We each got a oyster and ordered the clam and daisy pizza (only 5 bucks during happy hour). The oysters were really fresh and tasted fantastic. The pizzas were decently sized (6 slices). The clam one was a bit salty for my taste, but I really enjoyed the interesting combination on it. The daisy was pretty basic but good as well. The dough was very chewy and has great texture.

I&#39;ll be back to try the oysters because I love &#39;em and hear good things. The pizza here reminds me Brooklyn favorites like Paulie Gee&#39;s or Barboncinos (albeit slightly smaller and the same price, more or less).

The space is pretty small but really cool. Built inside a shipping container. There is a small front and back patio as well. The few times I have been I haven&#39;t had to wait much at all though.

But, I can vouch that the clam pizza (because clams I CAN do) is life-changingly good.  It tastes so decadent and the prosciutto was crispy and salty and perfect.  

And as if the food wasn&#39;t enough, I felt like the entire staff was genuinely concerned with us liking our food and having a pleasant dining experience.  That&#39;s always a nice feeling.

We arrived HUNGRY, so each of the three of us ordered our own pizza, some snacks to munch on while we waited, and an adult beverage. Our drinks were delish, and so were the pickled things. My boyfriend also got a hot dog and he raved about it. The fact that it came on a top sliced bun alone was enough to make him happy...friggin&#39; weirdo East Coast people and their bizarre bun configurations. 

So I&#39;m a little OCD/food obsessed, and I always browse the menu and decide what I&#39;m going to order before I even get to a restaurant. I had looked at Yelp pics and I knew for sure that I wanted the Four Seasons pizza. When I got there and tried to order it, I was told that it was no longer on the menu (I almost cried), but she suggested I try the Market pizza. I debated for awhile, but eventually decided to go with her suggestion. My friend got the white pizza, and my boyfriend got Cart Driver, then we all shared. The Market was by far the best. We were all fighting over it. The white was probably my second favorite, and the Cart Driver was my third favorite because I felt like it had too much crust and not enough topping. Honestly, if it hadn&#39;t been for the Market pizza, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d have been impressed enough to go back. The Market pizza bumped them from a 3-star pizza joint to a 4-star pizza joint. I would return just to get that lemon goo again."

You do go up and order your food and don&#39;t forget to take your own water. You also pay at the counter. None of this was a big deal. It&#39;s not a big place and there are tables in the front and back patios.

THE FOOD:

One pizza and a side is probably enough for two people, the portions are a little bigger then personal. We came with admittedly a large group of ~8, but the timing was off.

A small, quaint Neapolitan-style pizzeria restaurant (much like Cart Driver minus the container) in Austin, Texas that flew an oven in from Italy and reassembled it in Texas to make pizzas much like what Cart Driver is aiming to achieve.  I bring this up because since I have eaten at the Backspace, I just know what Cart Driver pizza could be!  And it&#39;s just not there.  

The concept of Cart Driver is beyond cool.  Love the size, love the container, love the booths and the order at the counter concept but for me the pizza fell short in a pretty big way.  The most I can say is that the crust tasted fresh but there was nothing amazing about the pairing of toppings that have me jonesing to go back.  The Proseco on tap we all commented just tasted like a white table wine and the market charcuterie was an enormous helping of only one kind of meat.  which, while generous, could be much improved by offering less quantity and more variety. 

So, in short. I wanted to love Cart Driver. It&#39;s like that first date where you want him to be the one but then you get the nookie and realize you&#39;ve had better nookie. There is no going back!  Even the highest of cheekbones or perfect hair can&#39;t erase you knowing there is better nookie out there.  Backspace, you are the one, the nookie on high."

At times the place seems a bit to simplistic even for their casual style. The charcuterie plate has one type of cured meat and one type of pickle. Both items on the plate were good but I would like more variety and maybe some bread and mustard. Pizza is where they shine the most but it isn&#39;t anything mind blowing.

The dough is Devine, the toppings are fresh and creative, and the wood fire grill cooks the pizza in a way that doesn&#39;t make it taste like a campfire but still gives the crust the unique texture that can only be achieved with wood heat.

The four seasons is my favorite. For those not familiar with the concept they make a four seasonal topping pizza with one topping in each quadrant of the pizza with two slices per topping. It&#39;s great to share between two people as you each get one slice of four different flavors.

I don&#39;t normally trust oysters in Denver but have at least two every time I go to Cart Driver. The fresh shaved horseradish root is amazing with the oysters.

I must preface this review by noting that I have heard great things about Cart Driver, and continue to, so maybe this experience was the exception and not the rule. I ordered the Cart Driver (sausage, kale, mozzarella, chili flake) for pickup, and overall was just not impressed by anything about the pizza, outside of the sausage, which was tasty. That said,  I found the pie to be oily, lacking in flavor and crust texture, and on the small side for the price. I would liken this pizza to Marco&#39;s in style, but I&#39;d give Marco&#39;s the clear edge based on this experience alone. 

Maybe the takeout aspect was responsible for the missing two stars, but I was not impressed."

We had the clam pizza, which is amazing, bursting with seafood and meaty flavors, on top of a great pizza crust that is slightly charred.  It reminded me more of Naples than the other Neapolitan pizza joint that I frequent due to the fact that the crust is lighter and slightly less chewy.  I prefer this style for sure.  Since it was late, we had access to the late night menu, where we sampled the mortadella hot dog which was fabulous.  I&#39;m a sucker for good mortadella and this was definitely a great dog.  It didn&#39;t need any condiments.  Finally the duck liver mousse with raspberry mustard was probably my favorite thing on the menu.  It had that perfect harmony of sweet and unami and also lightness that could have possibly made it pass for a dessert.  But in the end the savory flavors won out which still made for a great ending to the meal.  The Negronis went perfectly with the food.

Two people could eat really well here even with a couple drinks for under $60 which I think is a fantastic value.  This is the place I take my out of town guests when I want to impress with the slowly up and coming Denver food scene."

So good! After chatting with the super friendly Andrew and the other sweet woman working there, we settled on the Four Seasons. The crust was deliciously flakey and chewy and was the perfect base for the squash/ham/potato/Asian pear toppings. Then, we were surprised with an amazing piata (puffy chewy sour bread), herbed butter, and sardines. Out of this world!  

We left perfectly satisfied AND with a list of other eateries and shops to visit. We are absolutely coming back here next time we&#39;re in town."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think our pizza game in CO is not like NY, but this place.....this place does a decent pie with some amazingly fresh toppings. It&#39;s located in RiNO, so it&#39;s a bit hispter-y, but it&#39;s a great concept with helpful servers.

It&#39;s shooting for the minimalist approach and nails it. However, I&#39;m a big guy....this is not a place for big guys. So if you&#39;re a big guy and really want pizza, the question you have to ask yourself is: 

There is no question, suck in the gut and go eat some pizza."

One pizza was plenty for us with a few cocktails.  Though it did hit the late night happy hour, so we also got the mortadella hot dog.  The strawberry preserves and orange thyme pickles went excellently with the dog.

The name is apt - the restaurant is about the size of a cart.  It&#39;s just around the alley from Work&amp;Class and is hard to miss if you aren&#39;t looking.  If you get there late, the wait might &#34;drive&#34; you crazy.  But if you get there at the right moment, or are willing to chat around the bar while you wait for a seat, this is a great new addition to RiNo.

A friend and I checked Cart-Driver out as part of the winter Denver passport program.  The special in the passport was the house-made prosecco, which was sweet and still a little tangy.  Served in highball glasses, the restaurant is decidedly unpretentious.  We also ordered the white pizza, which took a while to come out.  Because of that, though, one of the chefs brought us out some shaved beef and pickles to snack on while we waited.  How nice!

The last drink of the night that we ordered was the Whiskey Daisy.  Again, a good balance of sweetness while not masking the nice bite of the liquor.  The cashier was so friendly and struck up a conversation with my friend about her unique last name - and ended up giving us one of the drinks for free as well."

Around ten pies labeled pizza but I guess only two or three with any sauce, I&#39;d appreciate it indicated on the menu.  The crust was just a bit too dry.  I love the attempt at burnt bubbles and crispy crust, but a little too much flour kept my mouth dry.  Maybe I&#39;m just from NY and have a very clear picture of pizza, but I&#39;d say these need a little sauce to get to perfection.  Service was excellent and decor is awesome.

The oysters were fresh and perfectly briny. The care taken to prepare the accompanying lemon and horseradish are indicative of the care they take with their prep.

I may have an affair here &#39;n there, but that&#39;s just what&#39;s expected of me from restaurants. 

The move here, if you&#39;re a seafood lover, is he clam pizza. The oysters are always great. The drinks are different. The sauce is great. It&#39;s not a NY slice which surprises me being a NYer that loves real pizza. It&#39;s unique. And they&#39;re all covered in &#39;gourmet&#39; toppings (whatever that means). No bacon but they do have guanciale. Things like that (google it).

My favorite situation... It&#39;s after 10 and before 12. I&#39;m hungry. The late night menu here has $5 pizzas, $2 oysters, and great drink specials. I&#39;m eating a pizza, half dozen oysters, and a proseco drink for under $30. If you&#39;re looking for a NY slice you&#39;ll be let down.

Prosecco on tap ain&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s tough goin&#39; $8 on a glass for anythin&#39; on tap.

The salads are thoroughly immersed in dressing-- not too much, and def not dry.  The ingredients were super fresh, particularly the cherry tomatoes.

Interestingly, the GF pizza dough is chick-pea.  Ain&#39;t never tried, nor heard of, anything like it. Typically the upcharge on GF anything is because it&#39;s shipped from Boulder and they pass the charge onto customers, which I loathe.  Andrew explains everything&#39;s fresh made there, which I love, and there&#39;s no room for storing anything in coolers, which is rad, but it&#39;s still $3 more for GF.  I wasn&#39;t really clear on what I was paying for.

Try the Clam Pizza for sure-- the brine of the clams and the salty pig cheek that (I learned) is guanciale makes for some good eats."

Wrongarito.

&#34;Cart Driver&#34; is a name taken from the kinds of small local truck driver-y kinds of bars you find throughout the back ways of Italy. It means something like &#34;the truck stop bar&#34; (but with much more cache:).

Andrew, the owner, has really got it going at this new spot (they own the Basta eatery in Boulder).  And they take a mainly small plates kinda perspective. 

We had some great and reasonably priced drinks that included, for my sweetheart, a couple of glasses of their on-tap prosecco, and for me, a great Ska Brewery (Modus Hoperandi) beer, followed by a wonderful house (Sangiovese) glass of red table wine.

The burrata and eggplant bruschetta were superb, as was the prosciutto mousse bruschetta topped with diced cantaloupe (!). We followed that up with a wonderfully simple, but elegant, chopped salad, and finished with the white Cart Driver small pizza (4 pieces) of rapini and sausage with great cheese. (Ask for a side of margherita sauce and un-aged parmesan cheese to dip your crust into . . . it totally rocks!).

Fair prices and excellent food = 5 stars in my book. Give em a try.

Having just ate dinner, I wasn&#39;t ravenous, but had to try at least every oyster. They allow you to order a la carte - so with half a dozen, I was able to try 3 different kinds. All delicious. But the best part was their house made relish. They switch out the ingredients each night. For instance, one relish night might boast some garlic and the following night they&#39;ll feature carrots and celery in the relish along with freshly grated horseradish.

That being said, this place was awesome! I went to this place twice in the span of several days, that&#39;s how good it is. 

The first time I went with my friend and we ordered the royal meal for two (or something like that) which comes with a drink. We had red wine which was pretty good. Everything on the plate was fantastic, especially the lamb curry. I loved the bread that comes with it. It&#39;s like a spongey, slightly sour flat bread that just absorbs all the yummy sauce. Also, they will give you extra if you ask which is nice. 

The second time I went with my husband and we ordered the meat combo for two. Again, the food was fantastic and my husband loved it (first time eating Ethiopian food for him too). I think if I had to pick I would choose the royal meal for two as the better dish but honestly you can&#39;t go wrong with either. 

Things I still want to try: the vegetarian combo and the honey wine."

This was definitely off the beaten path yet Denver Yelpers didn&#39;t steer us wrong. It hit high marks for food but the wait time / no one really checking on us left much to be desired. 

When we arrived, we were unsure if we were in the right spot because there isn&#39;t really any clear signage. It&#39;s a small space in a strip plaza next to a gas station. The interior is nothing fancy but it is one room with tables lining the walls. This is a true Mom &amp; Pop- there were TWO women working (incl greeting, serving , cooking) . From where we were seated, I could see them cooking over the stove. This is a no microwave facility- the food seems to be churned out as soon as orders are placed.    

If you are planning to come with a big party, call ahead and make a reservation. If you have your heart set on a particular dish, call first to make sure it is available. We ordered an appetizer that never did come. I ordered the veggie combo (sampling of several of their entrees) for 1 and my husband ordered his 2nd choice(a beef dish of some sort) since 1st choice wasn&#39;t available.    Service was super slow  and excrutiating for us since we had come from a day of hiking and were famished. So if you don&#39;t want to deal with wait time or have places to go, not sure if this would be the place for you. I will say that the food was delicious once it did arrive. It comes served with healthy portions of enjera  which is a sort of spongey crepe that you use (instead of utensils) to sop up the food before inhaling. lol   The woman working the floor even came back to offer us more since she noticed we were running low so that was a nice gesture.  As we were dining, the restaurant did start to fill up. We had to pretty much hunt down the employee for our check. Once it did come, nothing was itemized. We were just given a total. So we may/may not have been charged for the appetizer that never arrived. At that point, we figured that the poor employees earned the amount of it that we didn&#39;t throw a stink about it.   

I really wanted to give a higher rating because the food was delicious but between the longer than norm wait , missing appetizer and no real table service, 3 stars fits our experience. 
If you bring an extra dose of patience, I think you may be fine."

The place is a whole in the wall with, perhaps 30 seats. One waitress. It took a long time to get the food, but it was worth it. We had the feast for four. It could have fed six. 

My advice. Make a reservation. Don&#39;t be starving when you go. Order a cold appetizer. Be patient. This might not be the place to bring young children. Be prepared to have a good dinner conversation. Ask to talk to the owner-she is a joy. Be nice to the server. She works he behind off. Eat with your fingers. 

I would go again and again."

The  food was just as good as I remember.  (After the first visit, I tried my hand at making my own Sam Bussa, Injera, and Shiro Wat.  The Injera was a challenge.)   

On both visits we had Sam Bussa as an appetizer and went with a large meat combo and a small vegetarian combo.  Both orders came on one huge platter with plenty of Injera.  My favorites are the vegetarian dishes.   The platter was plenty for three adults and two children.  We had a bit of a vinegary salad dish this time that I loved.  I would also recommend the spicy tea.

Both times we arrived with children in tow (ages 6ish and 9ish).   The kids love this place which is kind of amazing considering it is not food most children are used to.   

A couple of recommendations.   Call ahead for a reservation.   We went early on a Thursday night and although the place was not packed at all, we were chastised a bit because we had not called ahead.   &#34;My grandmother likes everyone to have reservations,&#34; we were told by our cute and efficient young waiter.    Secondly, all of this food is made from scratch and made to order.   It takes a while for this goodness to make it out of the kitchen.   We took some games to play while we waited as did another family at an adjoining table.   

The place is small with about 8 four-tops.   There is a traditional dining area in the back that I am sure you need reservations for.   

Make sure you google map the location because the sign out front has faded into oblivion.   

The food and atmosphere are definitely worth the wait."

We arrived to a warm welcome from our hostess and then after taking our order, she went to the kitchen and started cooking. 

We got lovely Ethiopian coffee plus honey wine for drinks. Then we decided to eat family style and shared the skinned chicken breast, both the hot lamb stew (Yebeg Wott) &amp; the mild lamb stew and then we also got Shero Wott (roasted chickpea stew). 

When the food arrived it was in this massive communal plate with enjera bread surrounding it and we dug in with enthusiasm. The food was hearty and delicious - each dish had a distinct flavour and it was all just really good! 

The lamb was tender and I loved the taste of the potato, cabbage, carrort vegetable dish. That enjera bread was fluffy and light and our hostess bought out seconds for us. Lovely food, lovely service - Would totally recommend!

I&#39;ve always gone to the other Ethiopian restaurant listed here on Yelp, which is as highly rated as this place, but decided to try Queen of Sheeba...I was very glad I did.

This place takes the positives I like about the other place, like its quaintness and atmosphere, and improves on the negatives, like the wait time and the fact the other place doesn&#39;t take credit cards. The food is equally delicious but just different enough to stand out. There are also other unique items like &#34;Tej&#34;, the honey wine which is exotic and now the usual drink with my meal. Ordering one meat combo and one veggie combo is perfect to share among a couple; think date night.

The entire family works the restaurant and is extremely friendly. I&#39;ve met them all and am treated like a member when I arrive. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be here for years to come.

Give Queen of Sheeba a try and go on a dining adventure!"

I settled on Queen of Sheba in Denver due to the great reviews and the proximity to my hotel. The existing Yelp reviews hinted that &#34;good food takes time&#34; and &#34;there&#39;s only one cook&#34;, which should have been a warning. Ethiopian food usually takes a bit longer than other dishes, but we were sitting there for well over an hour before our food came out. There was nothing complicated about our order and none of the other tables were served out of order; everyone else was waiting just as long. The food was legitimately good Ethiopian, but I have no great desire to wait quite so long for a standard meal.

High Points: The food, once it comes out, is solid Ethiopian fare. Not the best I&#39;ve ever had by a large margin, but it will fill you up right. Price isn&#39;t bad, either. They have tej (honey wine) if that&#39;s your thing.

Low Points: You may not survive until your food arrives."

She always had a smile on her face and seemed genuinely happy to hear how much we enjoyed the food! For two people the veggie platter for one and a beef dish was more than enough. So flavorful. So delicious. The lentils were our favorite - all the lentils. The seasonings and how it was cooker could not have been better. You won&#39;t be disappointed. 

Do know though that, as is typical with Ethiopian restaurants, the service will be slow... Don&#39;t expect a fast dinner. Every second is worth it though. Nothing disappointed."

Boy am I happy I did.  The curb appeal is a small strip of shops on E. Colfax.  You walk in to this small, but comfortable, well decorated and inviting restaurant.  

We were immediately greeted by our server who we later found out is the daughter of the owner/chef.  She was kind and answered all of our questions completely.  I ordered a vegetarian plate for two, vegetable samosas and an Ethiopian lager.  Super happy about the food.  The amount of heat and spice was perfect and the portion size was fairly large.  My favorite part was the cabbage carrot stew and the green peas.  The food is amazing, with fresh ingredients that you can tell come from love and experience.  And the pricing on her food is perfect.  Afterwards, Zovi? the owner/chef came out and thanked us.  It was a great night.

Service is incredibly polite and friendly, and our server made excellent recommendations and took great care of us.  I advise asking to sit in the &#34;private room&#34; towards the back of the restaurant.  It creates more of a cozy, intimate dining experience.

We started with the sambussa- pastry filled with lentils, green chili, onion and herbs, and also ordered some Ethiopian beers.  Our server recommended which were lighter, darker, etc. and helped us make the right choice even though we didn&#39;t know anything about Ethiopian brews!  We shared a cup of honey wine just for fun, and although I probably wouldn&#39;t choose it again, it tasted better than other honey wines I&#39;ve had before, and added to the experience.

We had the lamb and veggie combos with our injera (Ethiopian bread- sponge-like and almost has a sweet taste to it), and our server brought us extra injera as we were not the most efficient eaters.  Be prepared to eat with your hands and lick them clean!  Everything was mouthwatering good and we did not leave a single drop of food on our platter.  We finished off with some Ethiopian coffee, and our server first brought us the roasted beans to smell to show the authenticity of their coffee.

One tip- if you&#39;d like to order take out, just know they ask about an hour&#39;s notice.

I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

The owner greeted us upon arrival. Very nice lady who seemed grateful to each person who came though the door.  I felt very at home- more like a guest and not so much a customer.  
Like I said- never had Ethiopian food before, so I have no idea what to compare it to.  The food was absolutely delicious! You have to taste it to experience it.

We almost missed Queen of Sheba, it&#39;s located in a tiny strip mall next to a Conoco. and there is almost no sign from the outside that delicious food is being made inside. This proved to be a recurring theme, the owners have seemed to make it clear that they have zero interest in aesthetics, usually this would bother me but for Queen of Sheba it inexplicably adds to the charm. 

The waitress was kind and the service was pretty good. Be prepared to pencil out at least two hours for your meal though as there is only one waitress for the whole restaurant and the kitchen seems to be manned by just two people. The leisurely pace of service was not a detractor as it allowed us to enjoy our meal, we also did not feel rushed when our food did come out.

We ordered the vegetarian and meat lover&#39;s meal. Both were served family style with heapings of injera on the side. All of the dishes were flavorful, well-spiced, spicy and rich. It is clear that the dishes are cooked with much love and care, this was confirmed to us when the chef came to see how the meal was tasting. If I were of Ethiopian descent then I would wish that the chef would be my grandmother, she exuded utter warmth and kindness.

The two comments I will make about the food is that it was lukewarm when it was brought to our table and that they do not do substitutions on the vegetarian/meat lover&#39;s combo&#39;s.

Regardless, it was fun being able to have ample time to sit down for a delicious meal and get to enjoy eating with our hands."

The cook seemed to be standing in the back with her eyes closed and the other lady was moping the floor? I wasn&#39;t sure how it worked, I didn&#39;t believe I was suppose to order at the small counter, but asked just in case since it had been a long wait with no attention. She yelled at her other worker and she set down the mop and insured us she would be right out. After an additional 10 min we got up and left. The other table of five was still waiting.

We have been eating here and ordering to-go for ten years or so. 

When in doubt, try the combo meals. It&#39;ll give you a good idea of all the different veggies and meats. 

Something to know about this place is that it is run by ONE woman. Just one. She occasionally has a person to help, but it&#39;s a one woman shop. Prepare and realize it&#39;s a 90-120 minute experience. This isn&#39;t a casual eatery that gets you out in 30 minutes. Plan ahead and sit and talk and watch her cook and eat some tasty samosas."

I had been to Queen of Sheba a very long time ago as a boy, and now coming there with my son seemed surreal. We ordered a what we thought was a lot of food, honey wine to sample, etc. I also ordered something I had not had before Tea Lieben which was incredible when mixed to taste properly. The food was delicious, although I did not see certain items on the menu that I have become accustomed to at my other spot, but everything was very delicious. My only gripe would probably be the portion size. We ordered the meat and veggie combo plus another side dish, we finished a dish and we&#39;re certain we had more coming, but alas that was apparently everything we had ordered.

Some things have sure changed; Some things have not. The faded signage out front, the worn dining area, tables and same old photos on the walls, the questionable condition of the bathrooms, and the menu covers, still look as though they were created when Haile Selassi was emperor of Ethiopia!

What has changed are: The prices. Everything is more expensive now: $10 for a plate of a mashed pea dish, for example.  Most dinners opt for the dinner for two, which is now $32. It used to include appetizers, but no more. The owner just crossed that line out of the menu with an ink pen. The portions; You still still get 4 meat items, lentils, and 2 vegetable items but the portions for the vegetables were no larger than one serving spoon. (We had to order a $10 side of a vegetable because the original offering could not feed both of us.) And, there was not much lamb compared to the healthy portions of chicken and the two beef dishes which, have become indistinguishable. I believe that this is because they may now use the same sauce for both beef dishes. 

However, the food itself is delicious. And if one were to compare the consistency of the meats at Queen of Sheba as opposed to say, the Lebanese restaurant, Phoenician Kabob, the beef, chicken, and lamb at Queen of Sheba, was free from fat and grizzle and cooked to perfection. Unlike the Phoenician Kabob which, the past 3 times we have been there, has served us tough grizzled lamb, fatty beef, and dry chicken.

The other big plus going for the Queen of Sheba is the owner herself. Still, after all these years, a wonderfully pleasant woman, who makes everyone feel welcome.

One odd thing about the restaurant is that they offer no desert. After consuming all that spicy food, we had to seek out somewhere to get some chocolate. I suggest the coffee shop, Quince Essential, down the street, right off Colfax on Quince.

The flavors and textures are on point. The family owned place is a little bit tough to find (end of an Ethiopian owned shopping strip) since their sign is very worn and old. Service is also a bit slow- there is only 1-2 cooks in the kitchen at a time, one of them also being the server. Don&#39;t come when you&#39;re starving because you will expect to wait 30-45 minutes for your food. But I promise it is WELL worth the wait. The owner and her daughter are also super sweet. We get the veggie platter + shero watt. It&#39;s all vegan!! And they offer Gluten Free injera (call ahead and have them set some aside for you). Servings are large and plentiful. A veggie platter for 2 could easily feed 3. This is the best Ethiopian in Denver. Enjoy!

Update-- we went here again and all of us got food poisoning...someone didn&#39;t wash their hands or something... :("

In Denver, my family has a go-to resto, but on my last visit home, we decided to switch it up and try Queen of Sheba after hearing time and time again how it&#39;s the best in the city. 

The great thing about trying new Ethiopian restaurants is the menus are usually very similar, so we always go with the same order. For starters, we tried both the veggie and meat sambusas. While I loved the lentils that made up the veggie variety, my favorite was the meat kind, made up of slightly sweet ground beef. For our main feast, we went with the meat combo for two and the veggie combo for two. It was the perfect amount of food for the four of us and I can honestly say I loved every bite on the large plate! To sip, we enjoyed Ethiopian beer (they were out of all but St. George&#39;s) and also traditional honey wine, which was some of the best I have had.

This is a very small place and there were only two people working, with the lady of the house very much in the forefront, taking orders and delivering the food. She was super friendly and although she messed up our drink order and was a bit slow in getting refills, it&#39;s admirable to witness how much care she takes in her restaurant and food. 

If going in with a group of four or more, definitely give her a call. A group of about 8 walked in without a heads up and while they were seated, she urged them to call next time and I could tell she was a bit miffed. 

My fellow Ethiopian lovers were praising our food the entire time. From the injera to the stewed meats, it was more flavorful than most joints I&#39;ve tried. 

Case in point, looks like we may have a new favorite Ethiopian restaurant..."

This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and my experience could not have been better! First of all, the kitchen is run almost entirely by the sweetest little Ethiopian woman who made us feel more like a guest in her home than customers at a restaurant. The space is small and welcoming but the food is the best part. I ordered The Vegetarian Combo, a giant plate of delicious and perfectly flavored, interesting dishes featuring lentils, greens, potatoes and veggies. Rather than eating with utensils, you break off a piece of this simple dosa-like bread and pinch the different dishes. As a vegetarian, it felt like a culinary adventure!

But setting that aside, the food was incredible. This is not my first time eating Ethiopian food but this was an opportunity to try new dishes I&#39;d never had. For my main I got the spicy red lentils. I also ordered the fried injera topped with spicy Ethiopian butter. The fried bread was so good and a huge portion. In fact I was told the red lentils would be plenty for lunch. Only after I assured her it would be several meals did she relent and let me do both. 

The red lentils came with yellow lentils, collared greens and regular injera. I ate all of that. Wow, some of the best Ethiopian food I&#39;ve ever eaten.

One side note, the restaurant is rather small and Zodi asked that if I bring a party of 4 or more to call ahead to reserve a table and to also allow to prep for it.

It was late in the evening, and upon walking in, the restaurant was noticeably crowded but foot traffic soon dwindled just before closing time. The interior lighting was no longer the sharpest, and the long vertical dining area looked lonesome after hours. Despite these noticeable signs of fatigue, this one-person operation was in no hurry to call it the night. She enthusiastically served us, and waited until we were completely full before sending us off, happy and satisfied. 

The Tibs ($9.99) turned out too dry, unfortunately. The accompanying jalapenos, onions, and seasonings couldn&#39;t overcome these overcooked beef strips. Tibs can turnout inedible when it&#39;s too dry. In this case we couldn&#39;t finish it.

The Vegetarian Combo for One ($14.99) came with yellow split pea stew, green split peas, red lentil stew, collard greens, cabbage, carrots, and potato stew, and green lentil salad. The Combo was sensational, addictive, and generous. The combination of textures and the mild to spicy flavors was spot on. I particularly liked the variety of peas, vegetable stews, lentils, and collard greens. 

We were provided with plenty of fluffy injera to complement the delicious veggies. The Ethiopian Honey Wine ($3.99) offered a sweet and refreshing aftertaste to give breaks to the taste buds. I highly recommend it.

Service was personable, gracious, and friendly. Interestingly, rather than a platter, the food was served on a plate with injera folded on the edges. We were never rushed to leave and the owner stuck around and chatted with us. I want to give this place another chance so I&#39;d be interested in coming back to try the lamb items."

So, yes, I can absolutely tell that the whole place is run by two people doing everything - taking orders, making food, cleaning up, everything. Yes, this does mean it&#39;s a little slow. However, given that when we got there, the place was packed, and we had our food within half an hour of sitting down, and it was indeed fantastic, I&#39;m not complaining too much. 

I&#39;ve eaten Ethiopian food at a handful of places now, and my comparison for pretty much everything Ethiopian is Messob in LA, which until now has had the best everything of anywhere. Well, we got to try a little of everything here (ordered the standard meat combo and the standard veggie combo, for maximum trying things), and Messob now has competition, food tastiness wise: 

* Messob beats Queen of Sheba in pretty much all the meat dishes we tried - which is not to say Queen of Sheba&#39;s meat dishes are bad, they just aren&#39;t as good as Messob&#39;s. 
* Their veggie dishes, on the other hand, were all mindblowingly flavorful. I didn&#39;t think you could get more flavorful than Messob, but turns out you can. We both agreed, if we were back in Denver, we would totally come back here, but we would just get a double order of the veggie combo. 
* Also of course had to try their tej. It&#39;s not quite as good as Messob&#39;s, but is definitely clearly freshly made, which is good. A little less sweet, and the flavors are a bit different (this one tasted a little peppery?), but still very good. 

Only complaint, other than that it is a *little* slow, is: they don&#39;t serve the food on a bed of injera. That&#39;s half of the fun, eating the injera off the plate that&#39;s soaked in all the flavors of the food the whole meal. First Ethiopian place I&#39;ve seen that hasn&#39;t done that, I dunno why."

We walked into this restaurant, with high expectations because of all the raving reviews. Instead of the warm smiling owner that many of the other posts have expressed, we were greeted  with an unhappy owner. She informed us that since we had five people we should have made a reservation, but seated us anyway. The table we were seated in was half covered by a plant, which was a bit annoying but not worthy of giving a one star review. 
The one star review comes from the fact that we waited a few minutes for her to take our order then before we finished ordering she ran off, without giving us time to finish our order. She came back after a few minutes to finish taking our order. We asked for honey wine, and she promptly informed us that she would have to go check to see if they had enough. Apparently they did because she promptly delivered a bottle to people who were seated after we were. We waited for 30 minutes, trying to get her attention; all the time she kept looking at every other table. We finally went to the kitchen to ask for the wine again. She brought it to us. Then we waited another 30 minutes for our food to come, watching six other tables receive their food and finish eating and at that point we decided that we could not wait any long for our food and asked for the check. Once we did this the owner replied &#34;I wasn&#39;t trying to punish you&#34;, we tried to pay, she refused our money but clapped when we walked out."

The Vegetarian combo is spectacular. Especially the red (spicy) lentils and yellow split peas. The carrot/potato/cabbage dish is also super yummy. One day I will learn the traditional name for all of these dishes...

Other reviews mention a long wait time, but we didn&#39;t seem to notice that on our visit. Everything was brought out super quickly. 

It was also very busy. The dining area was consistently full throughout our time here. There are only a handful of tables so that could be a problem if it&#39;s overly packed. 

All in all, the Queen of Sheba feels like a traditional Ethiopian style restaurant. The food is delicious. The service is fantastic (although not your American-style wait staff, which I was thankful for). Visiting this place for dinner was a GREAT experience."

About five minutes later we had waters but she took another table&#39;s order first (one of their guests had arrived before us, but the other three after). After 10 minutes she still had not taken our order, which was frustrating because we had entered with about 45 minutes of time (maybe we should have shared this earlier). 

I asked if we would be able to leave in 30 minutes if we ordered immediately. She asked what we wanted and we told her the veggie combo for 1 and veggie sambusas (we were originally going to order a  meat dish, but nixed it based on time). She said she would make it work.

About one minute later our food magically appeared in front of us! I&#39;m guessing this was all pre-prepared. She told us that it&#39;s not normally this fast, but this time it was. 

Quite the turnaround in service. She was much more attentive after that, dropping our check before we finished our meal, and wishing us well several times. 

The food was quite tasty. I loved the different lentils, collard greens and potatoes with cauliflower. It&#39;s always a very satisfying way to eat, using your hands and injera, as well.

Furthermore, she is genuinely friendly and values each and every one of her customers. If you can get her talking, she will tell you all about her crazy adventures from back home. Love it.

You will wait a long time for your food.  That&#39;s because the owner is the only one in the restaurant.  But that makes you savor the experiences more and enjoy your company.

I prefer the vegetarian fare over the meats (which tend to get a little dry).  For two people, I suggest the vegetarian combo for two. There is so much food, and if you need more bread, the kind lady will gladly bring you more.  All of the food is seasoned so well, and soaks into the injera (spongy bread) very well.  Get ready to eat with your hands.  Pretty simple food with so much flavor.

If you can sit in the secluded room in the back, do it.  Takes it up a notch.  The rest of the restaurant is small and cozy, tucked away in a strip mall on Colfax.

Decently priced.  Highly recommended for some great Ethiopian flavors."

Went here to break our fast after Yom Kippur.  The place is in a kind of run down strip mall but don&#39;t let that fool you. The woman that owns the place is the chef and the waitress.

Everything takes time here but worth the wait. I loved the lamb dish and cabbage with potatoes and the spongy bread.  I also enjoyed the St George beer and I got to practice my Arabic with our gracious host. What a very beautiful woman ! Her personality and her food take you through the beautiful culture of Ethiopia.  Our friends invited us here and it was our first time.

You would never find or try it based on the faded sign that tops their strip mall location. Zewditu immediately chastised us for not having a reservation for our group of four. We knew this was going to be an experience. 

We started with a veggie sambusas. It was crispy on the outside with a &#34;meaty&#34; and spicy lentil filling. We shared the vegetarian platter for two. When it was presented, we thought that it couldn&#39;t possibly be enough food for two people. We walked away stuffed. The peas and lentils were amazing and tasty. Not too spicy.

This is definitely a hole in the wall with amazing food. We will return on our next visit to Denver."

The food is 5 stars, amazing, authentic, savory. The service on the other hand was very slow. If you go on the weekend, plan on staying for 2 and 1/2 hours. They are on their own time, which may be part of the cultural experience. The cook is so sweet and kind, really feels like a family run affair. A small shop, maybe seats 30. Definitely worth a try!!"

My motivation to go for the 2nd time (in a long time) was so that I could learn more about the food to better help me with my job. My first experience in all honesty, was not a really memorable one. I don&#39;t remember it being bad, but I don&#39;t remember being blown away either. 

That said, I made the trip to Queen of Sheba to give it another go. After reading many of the awesome reviews about this little restaurant, I still didn&#39;t set high expectations. But man, this food is good. Would I go back? Heck yeah I would. Would I recommend it to others? Yes again. 

So, a big reason I chose to go to this particular restaurant was the one-woman show. We went during prime dinner hours and it was a busy little spot considering the neighborhood and the &#34;minimal&#34; staffing. The owner/server/cook was this cute little lady who was nothing but warm, friendly, and polite. She takes her time, and doesn&#39;t move all that efficiently, so don&#39;t expect a quick meal. It took a little over 20 minutes after we sat down and received menus for her to take our order. 

We decided to go with the Queen&#39;s dinner for 2 since it had a good assortment of items to try- chicken, beef, lamb, lentils, potatoes. It came served with the injera all rolled up on the sides of the plate. It&#39;s soft, and perfect for mopping up all of the saucy, stewy deliciousness. I loved each and everything on that platter. It was an excellent combination of robust flavors, sweet and spicy comfort food. She also gave us this delicious appetizer...I can&#39;t even recall what the name of it is because i couldn&#39;t understand her, but it seemed to be a crispy version of injera topped with some sort of spicy/cinnamon/sweet oil. OMG what delicious morsels of food! 

Bottom line: Go and try it, but don&#39;t expect to be in and out. And it&#39;s completely worth the slow service!"

Located in an aging strip mall with limited parking, it&#39;s pretty decrepit appearing from the outside. But if you have the courage to open the front door, the aromas that greet you are really pretty wonderful. Then you meet the &#34;Queen&#34; herself, and that&#39;s really the story. She may not be the Queen of Sheba, but she&#39;s definitely the Queen of the restaurant. She greets you, seats you, clears tables, takes your order, tells you what you can order and what you can&#39;t, serves you ... and cooks in her free time. Ask her how the &#34;bread&#34; is made to come out with the bubbles and she shows you. Ask her how to say &#34;please&#34; in her native tongue and she asks if you want the masculine or feminine. She&#39;s very gracious and very charming. And she marches entirely to the beat of her own drummer. She brings you menus when she&#39;s ready. She takes your order when she&#39;s ready. If she has other pre-eminent (to her) priorities, you just wait and enjoy the company of your friends. This isn&#39;t a criticism - she really is delightful - just understand that the Queen of Sheba isn&#39;t a place for a quick bite. Count on an hour and a half minimum - probably closer to two hours - then sit back, relax and enjoy.

The food was excellent. I&#39;ve had Ethiopian food in several other restaurants, and this food was the best. The sambussas were delicious. Then we had the Queen&#39;s combination for 2, for 6. We tried to order 3, Queen&#39;s combinations for 2. But the Queen told us she would bring us 1 Queen&#39;s combination for 4 and 1 for 2. Then she brought us 2 Queen&#39;s combinations for 3. I told you, the Queen marches to the beat of her own drummer. But however you do the math - 2x3, 4+2 or 3+3 all come out to be 6 which was the magic number for our party of 6. The spicy red lentils were delicious. There were other vegetarian, lamb, beef and chicken dishes on the Queen&#39;s combination as well - some a little spicy, none brutal and all delicious. 

Here&#39;s the formula for a great experience at the Queen of Sheba:
1. go when you have plenty of time
2. park your high horse outside the restaurant
3. do it the Queen&#39;s way (whatever the Queen says, just respond &#34;sure, sounds great&#34;)
4. for the evening consider yourself Ethiopian family - I really think the Queen considers you that way"

We went in with four people and ordered two meals for two and asked if it would be enough food for the four of us and we&#39;re told that it would be plenty. It was not. It is the first time I have ever left an Ethiopian restaurant and not been stuffed we could have all had more food. Honestly the food we ordered was the amount of food we get at other restaurants for just my husband and myself.

The food was good but not the best Ethiopian I have ever had. I am actually quite confused why everyone thinks it is so great? Not to mention that it was really expensive. I have never spent that much money on Ethiopian for such small amounts of subpar food."

We just moved here from LA and craving Ethiopian and so glad we found Queen of Sheba! Ethiopian is our favorite food so I can say our standards are very HIGH in this arena. We had the Beef Tibs and vegetarian plate for 2. Everything was seasoned perfectly. The ambiance is as if you went to Grandmas house and she cooked you her best meal for her loved family. This is a small restaurant and it takes time to order, get your food and pay. Be patient, don&#39;t come here expecting an in and out experience. Eat with your hands for crying out loud, it&#39;s traditional! We saw a few eating with forks, really?! How offensive! People with OCD and can&#39;t share foods family style, just stay home.

Queen of Sheba is literally a tiny, nondescript hole-in-the-wall place tacked on the end of a strip mall. Not much to look at from the outside, but once you go in... what an experience.

The dining room is tiny, but very comfortable. It&#39;s open to the kitchen, so you can see the people preparing the food, which is very cool. The place has a really welcoming, homey quality.

The food! The food is wonderful. Spicy, flavorful, full of character. Everything was cooked perfectly so that it had plenty of texture. We shared a Queen&#39;s Feast platter, which came with chicken, beef, lamb, collard greens, lentils, and vegetables all surrounded by injera (the spongy flatbread that you use to pick up your food). There was also an appetizer of two delicious foods I, unfortunately, can&#39;t remember the name of. No utensils! You eat with your hands. Everything was so tasty, and we greatly enjoyed every bite of it. We also ordered the honey wine, which tastes exactly you think it would. The after-dinner coffee was just amazing - they freshly roast the beans right there on the stove!

This is a great place to come with friends and just relax for a while. There were only two or three ladies working on the Saturday evening, sharing the tasks of hosting, cooking, cleaning, and serving patrons. It&#39;s really just like you&#39;re in a friend&#39;s home, and it&#39;s the wizened grandmother who is making everyone a home-cooked meal. It was a long wait between courses; I think we spent about three hours there in all.

I would definitely come back again!"

We called ahead for the 4 of us on a Sunday night, and were told it would be crowded, but they would *try* to fit us in. Upon showing up, it was definiately a tiny hole in the wall location...although it wasn&#39;t more than half full. There was an awkward dance around seats and ordering water (ice was easy, but a straw for our dining companion who was wearing two wrist braces was scoffed at). That said, we ordered two sets of vegetarian platters for 2 (for all 4 of us) and everything we ate was life changing, even the two items that were a bit spicy. Our server kept the Injera coming and the waters filled, and the four of us ate till near explosion plus a full take home boc for my parter. Averaged out to $14 each.

I mean it when I say it was the best Ethiopian food I have ever had, at any Ethiopian place in the US. When my partner tried it cold, next day, he said the same thing. It is thar freaking good, dine in or carry out, hot or a bit cold. HIGHLY recommended."

We walked in, and she seemed frustrated we hadn&#39;t called to make a reservation, yet nowhere on their ad does it say this is required. If she had simply told us we had to make a reservation at that point and said she couldn&#39;t seat us, that would have made sense and I wouldn&#39;t have bothered to write a review. Instead, she huffed and puffed and sat us down in the corner. She came around 5 minutes later to finally give us menus, and came back 2 minutes later expecting us to know what we wanted already. When we needed a second to open the menu, she said she&#39;d come back. Little did we know she meant an hour later. It was like pulling teeth to get her to pay attention to us, and she refused to make eye contact any time she went to the three tables right next to us to serve them or refill their drinks. We watched as new people came in and orders and received their food before us. We finally stood up and went to her to place our order. Our drinks came maybe an hour after we sat down, and our food never came. After two hours, we finally stood up and walked out. She mentioned something about punishing us for not making reservations. It was asinine service and I wouldn&#39;t trust that woman as far as I could throw her. I will never attempt eating here ever again, regardless of the rave reviews they had. I am the customer and deserve to be treated with respect. Regardless of what it says on your sign, you are NOT a literal Queen. I know more people than the average person who are always looking for good Ethiopian food, (because it&#39;s always delicious and unique and difficult to find) and guess what, you just lost all of their money, not just mine."

This gave me hope as I had previously read on here that service was slow as molasses... but I digress..  upon arriving to the front door, my group and I noticed some folks waiting to be seated. Because the &#39;rents are old customers and kinda regular, she took us right in and sat us. She told us it was busiest on Tuesday nights these days and so the waiting began..  

About 45mins-1hr after being seated, she, who is the owner, waitress, busser, and cook (along with another gal), finally brought our table glasses of water. We did not receive any service after that for another hour, and that was enough time to figure out EXACTLY what we wanted to order. So, all in all, Queen of Sheba receives an epic  as it took 2.5 hours before we finally got out entrees. 

We ordered the vegetarian platter for two and meat platter for one (14b). This was enough food to feed a group of 4 easily!  The prices aren&#39;t crazy and the drinks are great.

I&#39;m not sure what all I ate, since we got the Queen&#39;s Dinner for 4 AND the Vegetarian Combo for 2, but the food was all great. I particularly liked the red lentils, and the sam bussas. The honey wine goes great with the mild spicyness of the food.

We&#39;re finalizing our wedding details, just two stops left when my love announces he is hungry. And when he says he is hungry, he means right now.  I begrudgingly got out of the car and stomped all the way to the door of Queen of Sheba. 

As he opened the door, the most enticing aromas reminded me I was famished. The sweetest lady pointed to our table, chatted with my fiancée and brought our drinks simultaneously. She served us pastry type appetizers with vegetables, next we had beef and more vegetables with a sweet, sponge textured bread and honey wine. 

It&#39;s sort of like going to your grandma&#39;s house for dinner. The exceptional food, the cozy surroundings and the sweet charming lady.  Dinner was more than two hours but I forgot the schedule and thoroughly enjoyed myself.

I was the only one there. The lady who came to greet me was very particular about where I sat. I didn&#39;t understand it but whatever. I ordered the hot lamb (forget the name but it was 7a) and asked if I get to pick the sides. She said no. Ok that&#39;s fine, I like surprises. Then more people started coming and she asked me to move so that another couple could have my table. I said ok but didn&#39;t want to move since I already warmed up my seat! Luckily the couple was cool and said they would sit at a different table. This happened again to some other people who came in after me and by then I already had my food in front of me so she asked a different table to move instead of me. I found this very strange and off putting because there were still empty tables in the restaurant! Maybe they were reserved? If they were, I would&#39;ve preferred her to mention that so I&#39;m not scratching my head wondering why she&#39;s playing musical chairs. 

I didn&#39;t get a salad as one of my sides as I expected from every other Ethiopian restaurant I&#39;ve been to. Just FYI in case you&#39;re expecting that to be the default like I was. There were only 2 people working and service was slow since more people came in around the same time."

We arrived at 7:10 didn&#39;t get our food until a little after 8. Our server was a very sweet woman and I believe the cook. I think since she was the only person taking orders, cleaning up each table after people left, and helping in the kitchen this made everything go a lot slower. I was afraid to ask for a refill of water because who knew when I would be getting that. By the time we finished it took 26 mins to get and pay our bill.The table next to us even made comments about good luck on getting the bill back soon. Another table next to us waited about 20 minutes for menus, when the server came to get their order the couple asked if they could get menus first. The server apologized. 

I don&#39;t know if it was a Friday night thing but I&#39;m willing to give it another try but maybe during the middle of the week."

I&#39;m willing to travel for good Mexican cooking though and was not disappointed at lunch today.

First of all it&#39;s a spruced up old Denny&#39;s or some such but it&#39;s clean and pleasant if a little too bright and maybe the Mexican music is a little too loud but the staff is friendly and there&#39;s a parking lot.  Monday is a good day to go because the 12oz. house margaritas (which are quite tasty are - are you ready $2?)  I had two and if I hadn&#39;t had to drive back home I might have had another.

When seated they bring you very good fresh chips with a surprisingly kicky slightly smokey salsa and a small bowl of what some people describe as slaw - whatever it is, it is very tasty.  Take some time to look over the very extensive menu - a little overwhelming actually.  Lots of traditional dishes (rellenos, burritos, tamales, enchiladas, etc.)  Plus, pages of steaks, chicken, seafood, molcojetes).  I went with my Mexican restaurant litmus test dishes - a soft chile relleno smothered green, a cheese and onion enchilada, and a side of beans.  The relleno was exceptional - a whole freshly roasted chile poblano stuffed with white cheese and smothered in a slightly tangy pork filled green chile sauce.  Best I&#39;ve had in a long time.  Cheese enchilada was very good as well and the beans were just like I like them - a little on the soupy side not a scorched pile of bean &#34;mud&#34;.  Friend had a combo plate with a chile relleno, enchilada, tamale and two tostadas (one guac and one bean).  He was very pleased overall although not a fan of the bean tostada which I told him he should skip but he ordered it anyway.

Service was very prompt and friendly (some Spanish is useful when ordering), food came fairly quickly and it was hot and portions were more than generous.  All this for just over $20+ tip.  Great find and yes, I am a fan.  Next time we&#39;ll try their other location (Colfax and Cherry) which looks a little more divey but only half the distance from my neck of the woods.   Parking won&#39;t be as convenient though darn it."

My bf always makes fun of me because I say California Mexican is the best. It&#39;s just what I grew up with, so I&#39;m used to it! Californians probably can&#39;t make green chili for shit, so there ya go.
Anyway, right off the bat I loved that they served the chips &amp; salsa with cabbage slaw. Both were fresh, and the salsa was spicy.
Tamal, enchilada, and rellenos all were wonderful. Not *exactly* like the stuff from NorCal, but pretty damn close!"

But this place has a cool vibe with an artsy bar that has real irregular shaped wood tables and a well stocked bar and good bartender! The karaoke was getting warmed when we were seated and that was a fun area to keep an eye on.

We ordered based on recommendations - the paella and the mole chicken. But first came the chips and salsa - hot chips and a flavorful salsa that paired beautifully! And they are unlimited - score!!

The paella got ALL of our attention - full of delectable seafood with very little rice on a sizzler griddle. Fish, bay scallops, head-on shrimp, calamari, clams and mussels. So the Spanish paella in Barcelona had a larger rice serving and sometimes with the black squid ink. But this one with less rice had a different feel. However, a very large serving that is presented beautifully and tasted amazing! it was enough for the two of us....

The mole chicken was competing against the above - it did well but I would give it 3.5/5 mostly because the sauce felt a tad bit runny. So it is a personal preference of mine to have a more stable mole sauce. But the dish carried over to the next day as teh leftover amazingly well with the chicken maintaining its texture and flavor.

Saw a couple of table get their carne asada molcajete that looked like a family size dish - I think we will try that the next time."

More people need to come in, because it was a little slow Friday at 730. That&#39;s okay, though--if too many people find out about this spot (the old Pisco Sours), we&#39;ll have to wait for dinner!

The way they serve food has varied over the time they have been open, from counter service to buffet and back again, but it now seems to be stable at counter service.  They make a delicious mango lassi and nothing I&#39;ve ordered has been bad. I often get chicken tikka masala and sometimes the vegetarian option.

We had the choice of a buffet or ordering off the menu. The hubs and I have never had Jordanian food before so we wanted to try as much as we could. The buffet was our pick. 

We had so much food to sample. The lamb shank with yogurt sauce is a very traditional food from Jordan. The lamb fell off the bone and onto a bed of delicious yellow rice with vermicelli and almonds. A ladle of the yogurt sauce transformed the dish into something magical with no hint of the lamb gaminess. 

I also really liked the cheese samosa and potato samosa. The cheese was salty almost like a feta but not quite. The potato samosa was in a really nice pastry and jam packed with potato. 

The food was both Indian and Jordanian but so good. Other tasty dishes were the baba ganoush, hummus, paneer in tomato sauce and a Jordanian eggplant, tomato and beef dish. 

The baklava was good too and a sweet way to end the meal, however it was doughier than other baklavas I&#39;ve had.

I have spoken to one of the Chef, and she is willing to provide BUFFET for us.  At $25 per person is DEFINITELY A STEAL DEAL!  Chef Enas indeed go ALL WAY out to provide ALOT OF FOOD for us.  Some of my friends also opt to order OFF the Menu, in which majority liked what they had.

  All in all it was a Successful Event.  Then why the 4 stars?  Actually it is 4.5 stars coz at the beginning, we have to repeatly requesting for water.  Its organized chaos.  Furthermore, with limited parking space, coz a lot of my friends are UNFAMILIAR with this Neighborhood, let alone location.

  They are indeed short-handed in terms of Staffs.  Even one of the Staffs happened to be one of our Meetup members, in which I found out on this actual day of May 17th 2014.  If I am NOT mistaken, during this evening, even the Owner, Venu also helped in the running of this event.  The Food everyone like.  Its a mixture of both Indian and Jordanian Cuisine, that contains, lamb, chicken and vegetarian dishes.  By the end of our Feasting Dinner, we are given Mint Tea and some Desserts such as Baklava.  We are indeed stuffed! 

  Now to return is definitely, &#34;YES&#34; but it will be awhile.  I am hoping they can make the Hyderabadi Dum Biryani as a REGULAR Menu instead as a Monthly, or Seasonally...  From there who knows this establishment deserved that 5 stars in our books.  Furthermore, I grew up eating Hyderabadi Dum Biryani back in Singapore.  I do hope those Hyderabadi Dum Biryani can blow my taste bud to the Max!
  
  Thank you Chai &amp; Chai for providing a memorable evening for us, to enjoy.  We did enjoyed the FEASTING!  Above anything else, we hope and pray for your business undertakings to prosper to many more years to come and to give a fresh take of the cuisine that you offer on Colorado Soil.  Thank you.

The food is decent at a decent price and certainly better than the subway. But the food and the service is always so inconsistent. Every once in all you get this amazing meal and you&#39;ll be like wow this they really did make everything here in the restaurant. And then the other a couple times you&#39;ll be like I can&#39;t believe they are serving me this. The younger little guy is the best he wants the customer happy.

Chicken curry also great. Naan was good, lighter and less doughy or chewy than others.

The staff is AWESOME! Especially enjoyed Mallik and the two cooks who stayed late for us tonight. Mallik even shared his butter naan with us so that we could compare it to the regular naan. These guys are awesome... Will be back next time in town :)"

The food is just as good, but they are constantly tinkering with the way they do the menu and the ordering process, and all it does is confuse people and make for longer lines.  Now instead of just doing a straight lunch buffet (which is the best idea for this place, since 90% of their business comes from people who work on campus and just want to grab their food and go), they have a menu board where you order one of 8 dishes.  They scoop it into your to-go box, you pay, and then you go over to the half-sized buffet and add the rice and vegetarian dishes that you want.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a good reason for why they are trying this method, but it&#39;s getting annoying to have a different setup every time you go over there.  Just do a buffet, charge one price, and get on with it.  No need to make it more complicated."

I found this groupon that said &#39;dum biryani for two people&#39;. I used it two days after it had expired and they were really nice and let me use it! I was pleased ... :) BUT ... the biryani was so so dry and the rice felt half-cooked and hard. I needed a lot of water to push it down my throat; not to forget it was so hot/spicy!!!

 Yes 5 stars.  Basically Chai &amp;Chai is 2 restaurants in 1.  Indian and Authentic Arabian cuisine!  I&#39;ve only had the Arabian so far...excellent.  

The Arabian chef is this little lady from Jordan.  Greatness.  I had the baba ganoush, hummus and steak box.  All authentic and great.

I feel obligated to say/stress these dishes are the real deal, they&#39;ve not been Americanized to appeal to a wider audience.  I love places like this. 

This is in the same location as the old Big City Burrito...definitely an upgrade."

The chicken tiki masala has been prepared in about 4 different ways with veggies, without veggies, tiny cubes of chicken to more pulled style chicken.

I enjoyed it when it first opened, things were a little disorganized, but the food was good (very well spiced) and the people were friendly. But as they settled in, the restaurant made constant tweaks to their menu and pricing model, none of them positive, until we have what the restaurant is now- a (painfully-high) one price buffet of luke-warm food, tiny portions, and haphazard preparation (think not-fully-de-boned chicken). 

I only hope the restaurant will return to how it started, though it would take something special to get me through the door again.

I will say, however, that I have only eaten there for lunch, and from reading the reviews, perhaps they do better at dinner."

Service - Very good. It&#39;s clear they realize the value of keep a customer happy and coming back for more. 

Price - I went there to get dinner and it is about 10% more expensive than other Indian places. But that comes with the location I guess. 

Food - 
The food is awesome! As a vegetarian I&#39;d like to see more choices but the food I did eat was delicious. Here is what we ordered:
Samosas: Balanced flavors. I wanted to order more.
Gobi 65: Great taste and great texture - I eat slow and this one sat on a plate for a while, but it remained crispy for the most part and didn&#39;t get soggy at all. 
Falafel plate: Who made this? He/she deserves a medal. Dude it&#39;s like home food. Awesome.  

I give the food a 10/10. Great fusion of Indian &amp; Middle-Eastern menus. Its like a well functioning mormon-marriage of flavors without any pain the next day (even after a bit of overindulgence).

It gushes straight from the endearing ChaiChai (I suppose there is an ampersand in there, but for the purposes of this review and every conversation I ever have about it, it&#39;s ChaiChai.  Real fast.  All together now.) staff straight into my hungry heart.

Not only does the Anshutz Medical Campus mostly have terrible food, those terrible food venues have terrible hours.  Mmmmmm, crusty nasty Subway sandwich?  Too bad, it&#39;s 6pm.  Gross Jimmy John&#39;s sub where there is literally *one* vegetarian option (and no: lettuce, cheese, and avocado on bread is not food)? Too bad, it&#39;s 6pm.

Thank god (/Allah/Vishnu) ChaiChai came to campus.  It blows away all the competitors by being completely and utterly delicious, not to mention having an incredibly diverse rotating menu, infinity vegetarian options, amazingly friendly staff, and the occasional guest chef.  I&#39;ve been a half dozen times (or, let&#39;s be real, dozen), and it just keeps getting better and better.  In the evening, they have DOSA, people.  If you don&#39;t know about dosa, then goshgolly, get yourself over to this medical campus and order yourself some.  It will blow your mind.  Get some pakora too while you&#39;re at it.  Mmmmmmmm.

I see some folks whining about the lack of menu.  JUST EAT EVERYTHING IN THE BUILDING.  Seriously.  In any case, I find it completely wonderful that there is no menu.  I love hearing the employees describing every delicious morsel, and getting suggestions.  And the beet halva?  Oh my.  Tasty tasty.

I&#39;m (clearly) a ChaiChai convert, especially since they have DOOOOSSSAAAA now.  If you ever are unfortunate enough to find yourself at the University of Colorado Hospital, at least you can have some tastiness, dear Yelper."

I was flying back from Las Vegas nursing a nasty hangover when my flight got cancelled in Denver due to an impending winter storm in DC and I found myself spending a night in an airport hotel in Colorado. Needless to say, I was not happy.

I was jonesing for Indian and came across Chai &amp; Chai from Yelp reviews but was afraid no one would deliver to my obscure location. I called up Chai &amp; Chai a few minutes before they opened and naturally no one picked up. But surprisingly, a few minutes later, Venu called me right back.

Even though they normally deliver in a 3 mile block, he made an exception and walked me through the menu, making recommendations and customizing my order. I ordered the lamb curry and garlic naan.

When he arrived (he delivered it personally with the driver!) he let me know my hotel was actually 10 miles away, not the 6.6 miles Yelp had told me (yikes!!) but was so nice about it. He also threw in raita, beetroot halwa and rice with my order at no cost. And, even though he told me chai wouldn&#39;t deliver well, he brought chai wrapped up expertly in plastic wrap!

Service and thoughtful generosity aside the food was delicious. Seriously the most tender lamb I&#39;ve ever had (and I&#39;ve had my fair share) and the halwa was so yum! 

Highly recommend this place for its concept, service and most importantly, delicious food. If I ever happen to be in the area, best believe I will be back in person!!"

I would call to check the availability of biryani over the weekends to make sure it is part of the menu for that night.

Second time, the food was extremely late and cold (driver had written down the wrong address and never communicated back to the restaurant.)

He was really apologetic and couldn&#39;t apologize enough for the error. He offered me either a full refund or a redelivery the next day. I took the redelivery the next day (the food is so tasty!) the food arrived on time without a prompt from me and was hot and delicious. I got a call later that evening from the Manager/Owner asking if everything was ok and if I enjoyed the food. He apologized again.
They really went out of their way to apologize for the delay and to rectify the situation to my satisfaction. That was customer service done right. They have a loyal customer in me from now on!

Warning: The restaurant is located on the University Hospital campus, and parking is...an adventure. We ate there on a Saturday night, when the campus was deserted, so we didn&#39;t have to worry about parking. We had reservations, but the restaurant was empty at 6:30. That changed, happily. We need people to eat at Chai and Chai, to keep them in business. Despite the menus listed on the web site,  we were never given menus, simply seated while both the Indian and Jordanian cooks came out to explain their food. We&#39;re very familiar with both cuisines, so we simply ordered.

My wife got a dosa and a chicken curry, both of which were excellent. I opted for the mansaf and some kibebh, both of which were spectacular. The lamb in the mansaf was so perfectly done, the way I wish that I could get it to come out when I cook at home. It was of course a very filling meal, and we ended up taking a LOT of food home with us. We were provided with tea, both Indian and Arab, before and after dinner, but we had no room in our bellies for dessert.

We&#39;ll absolutely be back very soon. Enas, the Jordanian cook, tells us that she will be doing Arab breakfast, and we&#39;re really excited. You should be too."

The deal was valid for Indian food at Dinner. My wife and I decided to head over for Lunch since I wanted to try the middle-eastern fare.
It took us a while to figure out where to park. We parked in the covered parking behind the building. It was $5 to park on that particular day (Saturday). We later found out that the gravel-lot across the street from the restaurant is free on Weekends.

The Indian cook was very friendly and greeted us as we entered. The place has an open kitchen divided into two sections - Indian and Arabian. There was a young girl cooking on the Arabian side. She was quite abrupt and unfriendly when I asked her what was available. Enas, the Jordanian chef, peeked out from an inner kitchen and told me that she would take care of me in a few minutes.

My wife ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken 65, a Veggie wrap and Carrot Halwa from the Indian side. Enas came over to our table and discussed the Arabic options with us. I ended up ordering the Mansaf.

Enas started us off with some Pita bread and 3 different dips ( babaganoush, Hummus and Tabouleh). The Mansaf was outstanding; with the Lamb meat literally falling off the bone. The yogurt and cheese based sauce was like nothing I have ever eaten before.
My wife&#39;s indian food was also delicious.

We spent over an hour there and drank tons of Chai and Arabic tea. We were suprised that the total price was so reasonabke for the great food and experience we had. The service was outstanding except for that rude young girl on the Arabian side of the kitchen.

We will definitely be back and have already recommended this place to a lot of our friends."

The dosa cook on the first occasion was excellent! He used to cook at India&#39;s Harvest and we were big fans of his there too. However, he&#39;s gone &amp; the new guy isn&#39;t anywhere as good. The dosa and the sambar disappointed. We also ordered pakoras and it looked like we got the left-overs after the choice pieces were taken.

The middle-eastern food is good, but I wish the chef wouldn&#39;t come to the table to encourage you to order it. It makes you uncomfortable if all you want is Indian food. The menu &amp; wait staff should be sufficient to help patrons decide what they want.

We had such high hopes about this place &amp; had talked it up with all our friends. I hope they can snag a good Indian cook again - especially for dosai."

The very unique concept as an ethnic kitchen co-op will keep us coming back to sample all of the cuisines that are offered.  You quickly understand that the Arabian food served up by its Jordanian chef is the kind of authentic food you would expect to have in a bustling restaurant in Amman, Jordan.  The baba ganoush is probably the best example of eggplant spread that I have ever tasted.  The lamb mansaf on special rice, almonds, and yoghurt sauce is terrific.

Second time decided to try empanadas and it was sour and spoiled inside, laid on that display shelf for too long, they took it back and offered to pick something else, the gal mumbled that it was supposed to be freshly made and i told her it was not and they can check, nobody wanted to check and i didnt make a scene either (wanted to just enjoy the weekend breakfast with my husband and toddler), just said it was spoiling inside and i cannot eat it, they knew it was old based on reaction. Today got desserts, the ones topped with fresh fruits and glaze displayed fruits that dried up, why keep selling if not only fresh but even lost presentation due to aging. 
 So got box of cones floating in some honey (they r good by the way) and 2 pieces of cheese cake with caramel and pecans on top - super dry and smells like the place itself smells, not fresh just looks good. For these i paid $20, this was the last time i helped this small business.
 To owner -  this is yr reputation and business, u should really weigh investing in some quality assurance vs. potentially loosing license. Throw unsold items, do not stretch it to get invested money back from selling unfresh, not worth the risk."

The cake was dry and tasted like it should&#39;ve been pulled from the shelf last week. If it there was a visible expiration date on this cake it would read  &#34;7 days ago&#34;. The cake was hard and crumbled when touched, besides icing shouldn&#39;t crack. Inedible.  The other items were ok but the entire experience was marred by the bad red velvet.

- Average pricing
- Fast service
- Delicious food!

As soon as I looked at the display of food setup up like a Cuban patisserie I was ready to eat! I&#39;m lucky I didn&#39;t order with my eyes instead of my stomach because the food is filling and packed with flavor.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich ($8.59) and it was the best I ever had! The portion was more than I expected from the photos but for the price I am happy it&#39;s HUGE. This sandwich was more like two regular sandwiches in sheer size and neat content. The bread was really flaky and cheese melted perfectly on the meat.

We bought a few items like an meat empanada, a chicken and beef ball wrapped in mashed

I was a little taken aback when we walked in. There were 4 breakfast options on the menu, coupled with lots of various pastries in a case. Not exactly what I was lead to believe. I got the eggs and bacon meal with cafe con leche and buttered bread. He got a few empanadas (the real reason we came, I deduced!) 

The place is relatively small, so we ordered and then tried to not be in the way, which felt pretty impossible. It was busy on a Sunday morning.

His food was ready right away, mine took a bit longer. We got it to go, so we paid and headed out.

I&#39;ll be honest in saying that I was pretty disappointed in mine. The two tiny eggs and two small bacon strips didn&#39;t really do it for me. The fried eggs were runny; the bacon was cold. To be fair, I did like the cafe con leche, and the price was very good. I feel like I should have gotten something from the case, but many things weren&#39;t labeled and they were so busy that I really didn&#39;t feel like it was appropriate to have someone walk me through what everything was. I tried a couple of the empanadas and they were very good. 

I was happy to try somewhere new, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go out of my way to come back. It does seem like I ordered the wrong thing, so next time I&#39;d try something different."

Me and my friends came here in August and it was a disaster. At first, we were so excited due to the reviews describing the food as &#34;the best sandwiches in Colorado&#34; and &#34;a gem&#34;, well, the excitement quickly disappeared.

We ordered the most popular sandwiches, empanadas, fries, pastries, and chocolate cake. EVERY SINGLE THING tasted old, stale, not fresh, and just plain gross. None of us could eat after a few bites and had to throw it all away. 

If one thing tasted remotely fresh, I&#39;d give this place another chance. However, EVERYTHING from the bread to the meat to pastries tasted old.

This desert is no more.  I found Cuba Bakery &amp; Cafe. It is the kind of place I would expect to find somewhere in Little Havana (Miami).  

They have a  selection of bakery items, a selection of awesome Cuban food cafeteria style (like my favorite Ropa Vieja).  I got the Ropa which was served with a nice helping of rice (i picked black beans/rice) and sweet plantains.  

My wife bought a Cuban sandwich which fed her lunch, fed me at dinner, and fed me lunch the next day.  I mean seriously - that is one heck of a sandwich.

We also bought a empanada.  I think people who are giving great reviews to that empanada place next to Future Former brewing HAVE NEVER EATEN here.  These are crispy, flaky, awesomeness.  I mean darn. . .you can&#39;t do better


To end the meal we both had a little bit of cuban coffee. Perfect.

We will be back.  This time we weren&#39;t able to try their sweet pastries. . and its on our lists.

- note:  Order at counter.  There are a few tables,  but overall a small place. A couple tables sit outside on the sidewalk.  you will find this place in a non-descript shopping plaza.

I tried several of their empanadas, a few desserts, and Cuban tamales. Their empanadas are SO DELICIOUS and are very reasonably priced. My favorite was the shredded beef empanadas but the other 2 were really good as well. They&#39;re nice and crispy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside with a full flavor profile. The taste just sticks to your tongue, making you wanting more! Their desserts were good as well but a tad bit too sweet for my taste. The Cuban tamales were a little bland but I think it would make a great breakfast entree.  Also, all of the employees were friendly and helpful. I will certainly be coming back here SOON :)"

I was going to be in the area so finally I could stop in for some authentic Cuban food. The cuban sandwich was ginormous. The bread was crispy on the outside, the pork was tender and I really enjoyed the spicy mustard. I tried the ropa vieja and chorizo empanadas. The ropa vieja was tender, both had just the right amount of spice and neither were greasy, as I&#39;ve found some chorizo. For dessert I had the guava and cheese pastry. It was so good, I wish I had purchased more than one. Flakey, crispy, chewy, salty and sweet. It would be very easy to gain 50 lbs in one day with their dessert selection. How does one decide? I decided not to stray too far from the empanadas or I would have needed my stretch yoga pants asap."

For the price and the portion sizes Cuba Bakery is awesome...but those desserts taste old and cheap. My family and I didn&#39;t eat any of the desserts I bought so I won&#39;t ever buy the sweets from here again which upsets me cuz they look SOOOOOO GOOOOOD!

The staff was very nice and the food tasty but nothing to the caliber of the Cuban restaurant that I frequented in California. However, in Cuba Bakery&#39;s defense, Versailles Cuban Restaurant is more costly and a step above a Mom &amp; Pop.

Cuba Bakery does good for what they offer. A lot of food for a little price!

We also purchased two pastries: one is called orejas and the other I forget but it had pineapple in it. Both were scrumptious. Also picked up a bag of yellow plantain chips, which are a favorite of mine.
Also purchased were empanadas to be eaten the next day. We were advised to heat them up in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 5-10 minutes to maintain the crunchiness of the empanada.

The pork is pretty basic, not all BBQ drenched or overly sweet. The one thing I have learned to specify is asking for extra veggies (lettuce, tomato, ect.) as the sandwiches can be a bit dry otherwise. The French fries are too thinly cut. The kind of thin that would probably go good on a salad. 

I have yet to really explore the baked goods menu, but I had one of their chocolate chip cookies with chunks of Reeces peanut butter cups. I knew it was going to be rich but damn my mouth was at overload. I recommend stopping in just to see the variety, sweets to meats, they are sure to have something you&#39;ll like."

I tried the gigantic sandwich from the plate of my dining companion.   The bread was more pastry than bread, and the meat was also fantastic.  I would recommend the cuban sandwich to anyone who loves the sandwich.  Did I mention the portion size, half of the sandwich was packed away for later.

Opening hours are from : Monday - Saturday : 7am till 8pm

Sunday, they are open from 9am to 3pm.

From the Paper Menu, that they had, the Bulk of their Sales perhaps are from Catering Events or Big Purchases such as Parties what nots.  Party Specials are from $39.95 to $149.95 which can feed from 25 to 100 guests, respectively.  Included in the Paper Menu were items such as Pastries Or Desserts which starts from $1.25 each, Breakfast Items ($4.99), Sandwiches ($6.95-$7.95), and Daily Dishes ($7.95).

There are like about 10 seats with tables inside in case you might want to have your Meals here at one go.

Recent visit was on Saturday January 18th 2014.  Time was about 16:50hrs ish.  Actually we wanted to have an Early Dinner there, but since they were quite swamped with the &#34;Early&#34; Dinner crowd, I decide to have some Savory Pies to go.  From the Savory case, we opt to have the following items :

2 Chicken Empanadas, 2 Beef Empanadas and 4 Beef Pastries which cost about $18 ish with tax

My bad, forgetting to ask the lovely staff at which Fahrenheit and for how long to re-bake the Savory Empanadas.  When we get the chance to eat our purchase, All in all its was ok.  We prefer the BEEF Empanadas the best, though we cannot deny the filling could be more, since the Empanadas looks big, but it was more Dough than the Filling.  But with the reasonable cost, we can understand why.   The spices and the flavoring in the Ground Beef Empanadas was just right for our liking.  Both Empanadas, comes with Red and Green Bell Peppers.

We decide to cut them into halves and having it that way, so we can at least taste whether there would be any differences in each Empanadas what nots.  Yes the Empanadas Dough was crispy and crunchy.  LEAST favorite Empanadas was the Chicken Empanadas.  It was NOT as flavorful as we were hoping for.  Perhaps due to the seasoning which was a little too bland for our taste bud.

As for the Beef Pastries, unfortunately, perhaps I bake it at a higher temperature that resulted in &#34;burnt&#34; Phyllo Crust.  From that bite, I can understand why, coz they might have &#34;washed&#34; the top of the Phyllo Dough with Diluted Sugar water coz the Phyllo Dough tasted a bit on a sweet side.  In the Beef Pastries, it was also Ground Beef, just without the Bell Peppers.  It tasted slightly similar with the Beef Empanadas, but NOT the quite the same.  Still intrigue with all these Savory Empanadas/Pastries.

Nevertheless, we wish them well in their Business Undertakings, and hope they can prosper well in this Neighborhood and many more years to come so everyone can enjoy what they have to offer especially the lack of Quality Cuban Cuisine, in Colorado Soil.

May return when craving some Cuban Desserts that might call my name especially the Sweet ones since I saw ALOT of those while we were there...  OR convince Hubs to return and perhaps enjoy on what they offer in terms of Sandwiches and Daily Specials food that might peak Hubs interest such as Pan Con Bistec or Ropa Vieja (Shredded Beef) or Carne Guizada (Beef Stew)...  Hmmm.....

We also had plantains and an Empenada. Empanada was good, tasty and the meat was juicy and it had a nice flaky crust. Good value for the money.

The sand which bread was hot, meat was luke warm. The bread was a little too dry and crumbly. The pork was also a little dry.

Plantains were great, freshly made and arrived very hot.

We got desserts to go. It began with us opening the box and smelling something horrible. The taste matched the scent. It&#39;s almost as if they tasted like smoke ....disgusting. It ruined the bakery for us. We won&#39;t be back."

I have had Caribbean food, including some from home cooks, so I thought &#39;hey, this is going to be a treat&#39;. Nope. 
Flan is supposed to be a custard. The flan they make is grainy. Instead of a flaky pastry, you can taste the grease on everything and the rice is basically Spanish rice from a box. 
But that&#39;s not enough for them. How do you ruin rice from a box? Why, cook the box rice in such a way that the customer gets explosive diarrhea within a few minutes after consumption, of course. I was awake half the night with the worst diarrhea I&#39;ve ever had within a few minutes after eating it. 
My brother had the potato balls and he said the beef was okay, but the chicken was iffy. 
Upshot is if you&#39;re bulimic and you don&#39;t want to ruin your teeth with constant vomiting, the rice could be a covert, convenient laxative. Otherwise, avoid this place like the plague."

Some of the most flavorful food I&#39;ve eaten in my life. We stepped off the plane and stopped here as our first meal. Considered eating there more than once on our three-day trip because it was phenomenal. Low on atmosphere, high on WOW factor.

Tried both the yellow rice and rice with beans. Phenomenal. Chicken in tomato sauce was great. Oxtail was a little too chewy but phenomenal flavors. Sweet plantains here are out of this world with a perfectly crisp caramelization outside. Food is all prepared and on a hot line so you can order and start stuffing your face immediately. 

Cuban sandwiches are also made to order, but man... ain&#39;t nobody even got time for that after checking out the hot food line. (The person at the table behind me was saying she grew up in Miami, and this tasted like home... gotta be good right?!)

Massive dessert case. You start with the lofty ambition of getting dessert, but by the time you finish eating your meal (WHY CAN&#39;T I STOP) your eyes will be rolling in the back of your head and body in need of a nap.

The cafe con leche was absolutely delicious, and there are tons of pastries and other food that look like a must try. The cinnamon &amp; sugar &#39;elephant ear&#39; went great with the coffee.

This place is clearly run by great people, as everyone was really friendly and made me feel like I walked into a family kitchen.

The pastries on the other hand were kind of a disappointment. They looked so good but they all had a weird after taste of plastic. I had a flan, a cream brûlée, and a red velvet cake. They all add that same plastic taste. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the sugar they use or the display case making them taste that way but it wasn&#39;t delightful.

As a Cuban displaced from his family and home for a decade now this place is a godsend.  The pastry case is outstanding.  I ordered my childhood favorite quesitos (cheese pastries) and was blown away by the quality.  I&#39;d venture to say that these rank in the top 5% of what I&#39;ve tasted while living in Florida, Cuba, and Puerto Rico.  You absolutely have to try them.  And this isn&#39;t just the bias of being homesick, my Colorado native wife gave them a try and was speechless.  The rest of the pastry case looks incredibly attractive and I can&#39;t wait to visit again to try something new.

While there I also indulged in a Cuban sandwich and it brought me back to my childhood in an instant.  The bread was crisp and full of flavor on its own (I&#39;ll have to buy a loaf of their bread next time I visit) and they did not skimp on the ham and pork that filled the already huge sandwich.  No shortcuts are taken - the bread, meats, cheese, and mustard all matched up perfectly with the flavors of my childhood.

If you miss your panaderias fellow Cubans and Puertoricans, you absolutely need to head on over right now."

Also, this place has a bunch of pastry and smaller bites (empanadas, potato balls filled with beef, etc.)  which all looked really good as well.

I went to get the same meal and some potato balls(chicken&amp;beef) and two guava pastries. The pastries were horrible! Especially the potato balls! They had way to much potato and not enough meat! Plus, the meat they put in was gross, did not taste good at all! Nothing compared to the yummy delicious pastries at porto&#39;s out in cali. Also, the service sucked this time that I went bymyself to do takeout. The older lady with dyed blonde hair was not at all welcoming when she took my orders and almost seemed annoyed.

Every now and then however, there&#39;s a hidden gem that absolutely blows me away.  As a matter of fact, you can bet that as soon as I finish completing this review I&#39;m probably going to make my way to Cuba Bakery &amp; Café.  Apparently they&#39;ve only opened up shop for approximately five months or so.  Not even an official sign posted up out front.  Just a flimsy banner.  Upon entering this place doesn&#39;t really look like much, if anything at that.  On top you have your menu with a variety of sandwiches they offer.  Display case full of pastries.  Variety of decadent sweets and savory morsels.  

Potato balls!  I&#39;ve been scouring the state looking for these ever since trying them at Porto&#39;s Bakery back in California.  Though they aren&#39;t as good as Porto&#39;s, they&#39;re still pretty good...Who wouldn&#39;t like a deep ball of mashed potato, crispy and breaded on the outside and once you bit in you get the soft creamy mashed potato and in the center is some ground beef. Only complaint is that the beef isn&#39;t seasoned enough.  Heck, they should take the seasoning they stuff in their beef empanadas and cram it into the potato balls.  Problem solved!  The Cubano sandwich was probably one of the better ones I&#39;ve had in recent memory.  The portion is huge too!  The pork is just tender and juicy and I believe it&#39;s what sets it off.  Cuban espresso was pretty darn good.  Potent and lethal...Just a shot of it gave me such a jolt of energy.  It wasn&#39;t really bitter surprisingly considering how concentrated it is.  And for $1.50 a cup, that sure as hell beats getting a tall black coffee at Starbucks for $2.88.

This place is good!  My friends and I often found ourselves constantly getting up from our table and ordering more items I&#39;m sure we were annoying the heck out of the ladies who were taking our orders."

On the inside there isn&#39;t much special about it. It looks like a typical bakery.

They serve a variety of sweet and savory pastries and other desserts and meals. 

During this visit I got the coconut n creme pastry, guava and cheese pastry, and a beef empañada. The coconut and creme was alright, not too sweet. Was a little disappointed that it didn&#39;t have much coconut flavor to it. The guava and cheese pastry was delicious! It&#39;s a definite must have next time I go and makes me want to try the guava and cheese bread. The beef empañada was filled with meet and a few veggies with and pleasantly spiced. The meat was also quite moist and not dried out. 

The lady at the counter was very sweet. She helped me pick the ones that didn&#39;t have any nuts in them, which is surprisingly quite a lot of them. Usually bakers are quite liberal with their nut use. So I was happy about that. 

Next time I want to try one of their entrees that looked delicious."

The cafe is not fancy but it&#39;s got a cute interior, dominated by several bakery display shelves showcasing freshly baked breads, pastries, and cakes.  I was greeted immediately, and if the teenage girls behind the counter weren&#39;t particularly friendly, they did their job well.  I ordered the Media Noche sandwich, which is a sweet bread with ham, pork, pickles, cheese and mustard.  Prices are very reasonable.  All sandwiches are $8 or less.  I bought a sandwich, a can of soda, a bottle of water, and two items from the bakery (a coconut pastry and a chicken ball to bring home for my partner).  My total was only $13!  

The Media Noche was good, but the bread was a bit dry.  The pork has a nice marinated quality like it had been in a slow cooker all day and it balanced well with the saltiness of the ham and pickles.  It was also a very big portion - I think half would fill most people up.  It came topped with what might mistaken for fries, but was actually closer to a potato version of those onion strings you put on top of your green bean casserole.  

The pastry I took home for later and reheated.  I was like a heavy croissant filled with coconut paste and brushed with a sweet glaze.  The mix of sweet and savory came out very nice, though the bread was a bit crunchier than I would have liked (that may have been my fault for not eating it within the first few days and zapping it).  I can&#39;t comment on the chicken ball as it has yet to be eaten. 

I spent some time perusing the big menu on their wall while eating, and it looks like Cuba Bakery offers some really incredible deals on catering - their deals come out to about $.50 per piece for a mix of bakery items and sandwiches and you get  a sheet cake on top of that!  So I&#39;ll come back and try the regular Cuban sandwich, see if I like their non-sweet bread any better.  If it&#39;s good, there&#39;s a decent chance we&#39;ll be catering our anniversary party with Cuba Bakery this year!"

Very attentive staff and the owner came out from the kitchen to check on us.  We took our made from scratch pastries to go and they were fantastic (specialty).

 First thing I noticed when I walked in was how clean everything looked.  Small place. About a dozen tables.
 I was greeted by a lovely young lady. While reading the menu she suggested the bacon and Swiss Quiche. Yup. Had to try it. Very tasty. Just the right blend of ingredients. Flaky crust. 
Very good coffee.
They serve breakfast, sandwiches, salads and baked goods.
 So you might be asking yourself. George why the 5 star rating?  While this place does not have an elaborate menu,everything we had was very good. 
Cleanliness, food and service was excellent!
The only draw back was they did not have pork roll for the egg and cheese sandwich. What&#39;s pork roll you ask? A NJ regional favorite. Look it up.
If you ever find yourself in the NJ area order a pork roll, egg and cheese sandwich.
Try the Regal Bakery out. I think you will like it."

I ordered the egg sandwich with ham and a lime tart. They were both good, I wish they used chunky ham but for the price, and how close it is to me, I&#39;m good. It&#39;s hard to find a clean eatery in this area so this place was more than refreshing. The atmosphere was okay, as I said it was clean but there was no music or anything playing to enjoy while I ate. I will surely eat here again, as this place has a ton of potential. I&#39;m excited to see what they do because it seems like a good business. The cook came out of the kitchen and asked if we liked the food which shows she actually cared about what she was dishing out.

I was having a late lunch and wanted to order something for pick up and saw that Bangkok Tokyo had a stellar lunch menu with items around $7 or $8 along with rice and a spring roll. I called in my order for spicy basil eggplant and it was ready within 10 mins--woot woot!

The menu was mostly a fatty, oily sauce that I couldn&#39;t escape. There was no basil and no spice, even after letting it sit for a few days and letting the flavor develop. I was a sad panda."

My husband ordered a Miso Soup, 4 pieces of nigiri, and a Philadelphia Roll.  He couldn&#39;t finish all of the sushi.  The nigiri is $1 per piece when you dine in.

Had to ask our server for everything...chopsticks, soy, wasabi, ginger. However, the bussers were on top of refilling drinks and keeping things going. Its not a bad choice for sushi in the area, seems pretty average and solid each time we go."

Service was excellent again but once again the food is just not great. You can tell a good Asian restaurant by their Mongolian Beef.  If it is sliced thin w good quality meat you have a good restaurant. Here it is chewy, fatty and not very good. As much as she likes this place just won&#39;t bother again. Too many other choices.

The place is nice and clean. Instead of trying to drive through rush hour on a Friday evening to Sushi Den, we opted for suburbia Aurora. Fiancee and I were craving sashimi, so we ordered the sashimi dinner for two. Per the picture posted, everything was fresh and we&#39;re thick-sized cuts. The boat comes with two soups and salads. The miso wasn&#39;t as flavorful as other Japanese restaurants, and was lukewarm.  Thee salad tasted like liquidy lettuce with a hint of sugary ginger dressing. The best part would be the sashimi all the fish were fresh and they melted in your mouth like butter. I would recommend for the best bang for your buck, to do the lunch special for the sashimi sushi. But for Aurora,  this place is great."

I guess I was reluctant to try a place with a name like Bangkok Tokyo.  Recently, I gave it a try and I was pleasantly surprised.
I&#39;m nervous anytime I eat sushi so far from the coast, but the sushi here is quite good.  I also had the chicken curry, which was flavorful.  But, I was hoping for some HEAT!!!  My wife had the chicken bento box and she liked it.
The service is fantastic, and the prices are reasonable.  They advertise 1 dollar sushi?  I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll try that!
Don&#39;t pass this place up!  I think the strip mall / shopping center / weird name can be a turn off.  But, if you&#39;re looking for decent Asian / Thai in suburbia Aurora - you won&#39;t be disappointed."

First off the Sushi - nothing special, but a large selection at $1 a piece, so a very good deal for the price.  I&#39;m more of a traditionalist so don&#39;t usually go for the weird roll creations, but tasted a few from my friend&#39;s orders and found them to be pretty tasty.

They have a great selection of other items on the menu.  My favorite so far is the Tokyo Steak with Tomato fried rice (think rice cooked with sweet tomato sauce - sound weird but good) and the steak has a really nice light teriyaki sauce mixed with some vegetables.    It&#39;s only served at this location (their sister restaurant Saigon Tokyo doesn&#39;t have it as far as I know.)

Service is usually prompt and it hasn&#39;t been crowded any time I&#39;ve gone.   I&#39;ve made this a somewhat regular stop now."

 We have tried their sushi, Japanese noodle soup with seafood, shrimp with veggies and basil, and their teriyaki bento plate and everything tasted great.

They have a huge selection of sushi and rolls to choose from and they&#39;re all pretty spectacular. They have the perfect balance of flavors from the components that make up the rolls. The ingredients always seem very fresh. 

I moved to Thornton and have tried other sushi places closer to me, but no other place has compared to Bangkok Tokyo. My friend and I go here at least once a month. It&#39;s a further drive, but so worth it.

Across the board, service was prompt and very friendly.  Another +1 star on the service.  The miso soup was very good.  It was hot and had good flavor and ingredients.  
The sushi:  The unagi and ebi rolls were very good, as was the Philly roll.  The octopus on the other hand seemed a bit dried out and rubbery.  Took me awhile to gnaw through it.  -1 star.  In retrospect, there probably aren&#39;t many people ordering octopus sushi here in Colorado, but it just didn&#39;t seem very fresh.

We didn&#39;t try the sushi and only had some generic stir-fry dishes, but the flavors were outstanding and everything tasted so much fresher than at the other places we tried. Very tasty.  The atmosphere was also a surprise, very bright and modern-looking. Looking forward to going back."

First they had no problem with us being there and told us to take our time.  All smiles and very sweet staff. We ordered the wantons which were amazing! After we ordered I was discussing with my husband how I&#39;ve always wanted to have a sushi boat, the sushi shokunin (Will) overheard our conversation and put our order on a boat! Wow! He was very pleasent and we enjoyed having a conversation with him aswell. He even helped us out with extras! The sushi we had was to die for to say the least. After they took great care in packing up our leftovers and even wrapped it up and told us the best way to eat the leftovers. I may in Colorado Springs but we WILL be back! Thank you for being such a great business!"

I was not particularly impressed at first glance because it&#39;s in the Albertsons parking lot, next to some maybe-i-would-eat-there-maybe-nots. It was slightly busy for a weekday afternoon. We waited maybe 10 min for a table. Hostess was extremely busy trying to clean tables, sit people, check out tabs etc. Very friendly service. The food was okay. I would not make this my have to go to resturant but it was good. I ordered a chicken bento for my daughter and the chicken definitely lacked flavor. Also ordered sushi and apparently this comes out seperate. We had finished all our meals when I had to ask if our sushi was even coming out, took so long I forgot I ordered it. Not a huge fan of the mango sushi but appreciated the combination of flavors on the sushi platter. Resturant looked clean, did not see the bathrooms, asian flaired and had nice little vibe. I would go again since it&#39;s pretty close."

First of all the service was simply amazing.  The staff were very helpful and they were very attentive to the needs of our group.  

We tried a number of the different rolls.  My favorite was a roll that had tempura shrimp with mangos.  The flavors were amazing together and the mango gave a nice sweetness to the roll.  

The California roll and spicy crab roll were also delicious.  For appetizers we had the edamame and the cheese wontons.  The edamame were fresh and had some course sea salt on them to make them very flavorful.

If I lived  in the area I would definitely return to this great sushi restaurant."

Having said that we are kinda particular about where we take our children to have Sushi.  I&#39;ve always frequented Sushi establishments closer to the Parker/Centennial area and have found a few great ones.  That is, until we stopped in Bangkok Tokyo..  This is now (and I know I&#39;ve said this before) our absolute favorite!  

We order up a lot of Sushi, everything we&#39;ve had here is so fresh.  the gyoza is the best I&#39;ve ever had, the edamame is great, not too soggy, just enough salt, and warm.  We typically order bowls of edamame but at Bangkok Tokyo you&#39;ll only need one, it&#39;s a huge bowl.  Had some hand roles (cones) and they were phenomenal.  Could go on and on...

Oh, and the staff, they are super duper friendly and attentive.  The place is larger than your typical Sushi place.  Hey, if you are in the Southlands area you have to try this place out.  Now that I&#39;ve written this review I&#39;m gonna go back tonight!"

The service staff were super friendly and very eager to please. 

We also took food home with us for the evening. 

The stuffed chicken wings were flat-out awful. 

The other two dishes - some kind of lemon grass chicken and beef sauteed with tomato rice were very tasty.

Maybe they had an off-night on a couple of the dishes but the atmosphere, and the wait-staff (looks like a family business) makes it easy to give them another 5 or 6 chances to get everything right - hey they&#39;re trying hard!

By the way - the portions are generous and sushi presentation was very well done."

There is a good selection on their dollar menu, however it is nigiri only and some fish selections are not on it.

Salmon, white tuna, and yellow tail were excellent.  Tried their Queen Roll and it was very good as well.  We order ed a Thai Chicken Salad with Peanut Sauce that was much bigger than we thought and was meal sized but really good (I am a sucker for peanut sauce).  

The service was fast and friendly and I am glad we found another option to go to in our neck of the woods and don&#39;t always have to go downtown."

It was on a weekday in the afternoon and they only had about 3 tables full, so we experienced no trouble with speed of service. The food was delicious and carefully prepared and we enjoyed it immensely. 

The lunch prices are affordable (from $7 and up) and came with soup, egg roll, rice and entree.  Their dinner prices are pretty inflated and don&#39;t even come with soup and egg roll. 

Didn&#39;t find any melted plastic in the food which, if I had read that review, I definitely would have been looking for. They seem like the kind of place that would struggle to keep up with a crowd, but for us, on a slow afternoon, it was very nice. Delicious food and pleasant atmosphere. I didn&#39;t appreciate the two T.V.&#39;s going, but at least they were silent. 
Nice place over all, and we&#39;ll be back, but will avoid busy nights as others have recommended."

But seriously, if you&#39;re looking for really good sushi in the area, stop by here.  I ordered the Duke Roll and it was delicious.  It is cut up into about 8 pieces, and we&#39;re not talking small pieces either.  They aren&#39;t giant, but they are bigger than other sushi rolls i have had.  The price is reasonable, I expect to pay this price for GOOD sushi at any other place (So long as it is good sushi).  The restaurant was rather quiet on a Saturday afternoon, which is a plus.  Service is attentive, which is always good. It has a nice appeal and charm going for it, excellent for a first date.  And if you are not a sushi lover, they have other menu items that may appeal to you.  All in all, this one is a keeper and I will definitely come back."

$1 sushi on select items (about 8 choices that almost everyone likes like Salmon, Tuna, Tako and Albacore Tuna etc).  I always have reservation about the sushi place that&#39;s run by non Japanese or Korean (call me food racist) and my assumptions usually proved to be true.  However, I will have to say this place&#39;s sushi is good and considering the price, GREAT!  I ordered 4 pcs for $4 and they were good.

I ordered lunch size tofu basil and it was perfect.  bit sweet side with bok choi, right amount of tofu and perfectly balanced basil. it was served with soup of choice, small rice and rice egg roll.  I gave big thumbs up 2nd time!

My other half ordered Pad Thai (i don&#39;t think they had lunch size) and it was so so.  The noodle was kinda thin and taste was so so.  However, the presentation was great and the size of the dish was quite large.

The wait staff is very friendly and courteous and spoke good English.   the owner is very friendly.  No complaints here!

I will be back for some more soon."

They have other items on the menu as well such as Fried Shrimp Rice, Pad Thai, MaPo Tofu and Teriyaki Beef.  I don&#39;t think MaPo Tofu and Teriyaki Beef are traditional style so you maybe surprised (or not like the way they do it).
Other than that, Sushi is fantastic.  also, their summer $1 beer bottles and discounted glass of wine are great too.

When you dine in the service is almost OVERLY attentive. With multiple people asking if you&#39;re ready to order, if you&#39;re done eating, if you want the check, etc. It&#39;s like they are constantly trying to rush you out the door. So, we opted to start ordering their food to-go, which went great until we found a melted piece of plastic in our food one night. That&#39;s so toxic and dangerous! I think from now on we will be making the trip to Thai Basil by Park Meadows. Much better service, better food, and consistent quality can be found there that cannot be found at Bangkok Tokyo."

They have completely redone the inside of the restaurant, and it now has a minimalistic Asian style. They have a sushi bar and large seating area. The entire look is clean and modern. 

Now, on the the important stuff. The servers were all amazingly nice and eager to please. We had the Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles with beef. The Pad Thai was acceptable fare, but the drunken noodles were simply **out*of*this*world** 
The flavor of the dish was strong and rich. There was an enormous amount of beef in the dish compared to the amount most other Asian restaurants put in their dishes. This was a very pleasant surprise. The beef was tender and not tough or chewy at all. The portion size was also quite large - definitely enough for 2 meals for me. 
I certainly plan on making this place one of my regular eateries. And I sincerely hope that it survives since several other restaurants in that location have not. 
Give this place a try yelpers!! They need all the publicity they can get."

Bad experience 1: We ordered 2 Philadelphia rolls and two spicy tuna rolls as takeout. The Philadelphia rolls were not as fresh as we had experienced before and had a very fishy smell and taste. Not pleasant at all and we didn&#39;t eat most of them

Bad experience 2: Large takeout ordered with 2 pad Thai, 2 Philadelphia, 2 unagi, 2 spicy tuna rolls and the wasabi and ginger was completely missed. Forgivable... but the manager argued that it was included...and then argued more when I asked for a credit to cover a typical order we do for takeout... 2 Philadelphia and 2other rolls (spicy tuna or uniagi). He would only credit 1 of each. 

Not impressed with the current manager. I have a family of two adults and 5 kids and I would expect a little more effort for my business in hard times like this.

A happy customer will keep coming back and might tell friends. But an unhappy customer will probably tell 10 of his friends. I hope Bangkok Tokyo reads this and takes this to heart. They were the best in the southlands area and now I am going to reevaluate that."

It&#39;s a nice new joint, one of those fusion types - you can find on the menu Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese. They&#39;re doing a special nowadays, all single-piece sushi (nigiri?) are $1 each. The sushi is just OK, I&#39;ve had better. 

We also tried the Dynamite for starter, it took a while to cook but it was definitely fresh, hot and still bubbly when served. The Tempura combo entree was the only thing that came with miso soup and salad, guess &#39;cause it was Japanese. Again, it&#39;s just OK. Other entrees we ordered included the Tokyo Fried Rice, it was delicious! A little bit too much ground pepper for my taste and they used sushi rice, but the flavor and fragrance were both good, I&#39;d give it a 4 star out of 5! The Vietnamese style Lemongrass Pork Chop came in a generous portion, it is everything you&#39;d expect from this kind of dishes. 

Now, desserts! We had green tea ice cream, it was no good, it had that taste like it&#39;s been frozen in the fridge for too long! But the other ice cream I rarely see anywhere else, is pineapple coconut flavor, reminds me of pina colada, that was awesome! Both ice cream balls were pretty good size, 6 of us shared them."

They were very busy; it was Friday, I get it. However, we waited 90 MINUTES for our food. That&#39;s right. It took at least 15-20 minutes anyone took our order. They forgot our sushi order and had to ask us again what we wanted nearly an hour into us being there. 

Three people at our table ordered hot entrees, and those took the longest because the &#34;kitchen overheated&#34; and they had to shut it down, meaning a lot of people were out their meals they had already been waiting an hour or more on. We literally watched two or three other families seated near us walk out because no one ever came to take their order or the food took too long. The servers were all running around frantic and unorganized, and the sushi chefs looked really stressed. 

It was an unpleasant experience. The food IS very good, but totally not worth the bad service and ridiculously long wait times - especially when we had a 4-year-old child in tow. The waiters kept apologizing but, in the end, no discount was given on our bill for the major inconvenience of having to wait 90 minutes for our food and the terrible experience (and you can bet we complained and tipped accordingly for it). 

We will NOT be going back, and I highly suggest others avoid this place all together. Hana Sushi and Mt. Fuji in Aurora are MUCH BETTER OPTIONS. This place simply doesn&#39;t have the adequate staff or skills to keep things running smoothly on busy nights. Disappointing!"

We tried the delivery, which went well despite the fact that I had to repeat  my order twice which made me worry.  But the food arrived correctly and on time as promised which is unusual nowadays.  The delivery person was very pleasant which is a definite positive (he was nice even before I tipped him).  

Now for the food: the cheese wontons were good, but were slightly cold by the time they were delivered. A better package to keep them warm would help a lot with this.  The Thai curry lime beef was the star of the show.  Way too many Asian restaurants cook the crap out of their vegetables leaving a mushy flavorless mess.  This was not the case at Bangkok Tokyo. The veggies were firm, fresh and delicious. I am a devoted carnivore and yet the vegetables were so good and well prepared that it actually kept up with the flavor of the meat, which was a pleasant surprise and the main reason for the 4 stars. 

That being said, both me and my girlfriend felt the fried rice was of surprisingly low quality.  The meat and other ingredients in the rice were very good, but the rice itself was very sticky and clumpy, which really left the texture feeling a bit unappetizing. Also, while the seasoning on the Thai beef was good (a bit more spicy would have been welcomed), the rice itself was bland compared to other Asian restaurants we eat at.

Overall, the taste was very good and fresh as promised with the small exceptions listed above.  Portion sizes were appropriate for the price, and we will be ordering again, especially if they fix the issues with the fried rice.  Only 4 stars until we can taste the wontons when they are hot and fresh.  ;)

Late edit: I like the Tokyo fried rice but my girlfriend would love a simple chicken fried rice on the menu. Thanks!"

The paper lanterns on the ceiling have Japanese writing on them and there are several different lamp shades.  The room itself is a bit like a warehouse and there is a fairly loud echo but still, pretty good.  
I ordered Chicken Satay (well done) along with the Royal Chicken with spice added.
The Satay was the best of the 5 Thai restaurants I have visited in the Denver area: it was also the first time the chicken came out well done as requested! The peanut sauce was thick and had a hearty peanut flavor.  The Royal Chicken was cooked properly, very hot but not over-done and mushy.  The ingredients were all fresh and of high quality.  Unfortunately, the dish was not made with authentic Thai spices.  The dish was far more Chinese fare than Thai: very much like Szechuan.
The wait staff was very attentive and all were smiling and very friendly.
While I can say the food was excellent, I can&#39;t recommend it as being Thai.  
I do plan to return to try their Sushi menu which appears to be substantial."

But this definitely was the case. The wait staff and owner are very quick to get you what you need. They always check up on you and will fix any hiccups in quality immediately. I even overheard them agreeing to deliver a menu - JUST a menu - to someone who lived fifteen minutes away. Talk about service. 

Their quality of service is definitely reflected in their food. The portions are large and the presentation is great. Not to mention everything I&#39;ve had here tastes amazing! Especially the Tuna Collar (Appetizer)! You guys should give it a try. This place makes it great. 

I know $1 sushi sounds scary, but don&#39;t let it scare you away from here. They&#39;re sushi is pretty fresh and they have some interesting rolls that don&#39;t disappoint. 

All-in-all, a five-star in my book.

[UPDATE]: 

Okay, I just canNOT get enough of this place. I keep going back for more. Anyways, here&#39;s an update for somethings you have to try on the menu if you&#39;re not there for the sushi. 

1) Hamatchikama (Tuna Collar) Appetizer is the best here! First off, it&#39;s hard to find; second, when you do find it, it&#39;s usually overcooked. But they do it perfect here! 

2) Satay Chicken: Can you say YUM!?! I&#39;m not gonna&#39; lie, kind of drooling just thinking about it . . . the owner gave it to our table for free just to sample and, well, now we&#39;re all hooked. 

3) Yaki Udon: Real Udon noodles (I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so hard to find Yaku Udon with actual Udon noodles . . . but it is). Super yummy and a HUUUUGGEEE serving. Expect to take some (aka &#34;a lot&#34;) home. 

4) Green Tea: Their green tea is imported from Japan and they use a brown rice green tea roast. It&#39;s definitely worth it if you like trying different kinds of tea."

We always get the food delivered and it&#39;s always delivered to us correctly and hot.  My favorites are the Pad Thai (which is a pretty large portion; like 3 meals worth) which comes with chicken and shrimp.  The Peanut Curry Chicken is also yummy.  Another favorite is the Thai Spring Rolls that are shrimp and veggies rolled up with rice paper served with a yummy peanut sauce.  We have ordered their sushi as well and everything has been great.  I know they have $1 sushi if you dine in; we have never tried that.  They have lunch specials on their menu that come with soup and egg-roll.  They are aways super friendly when they take my order over the phone.  We are so happy to be able to get Asian/Sushi delivered instead of pizza!

First of all, the staff is always very sweet. I typically get carry out or order from home for delivery and each time I&#39;ve been treated great! Same with my most recent visit when I actually brought a friend here and dined in.

We ordered the gyoza to start off with, then a few rolls that I adore from this place. One of them, the mango roll, seemed to have had some wasabi in it, but because I&#39;ve had this roll delivered numerous times, I knew the wasabi was not typically in there. Also, the tempura in a different roll was way way WAY over fried to the point of it being dark brown and no meat was left in the center. Because everything else tasted good, we continued forward to dessert.

My friend got the strawberry swirl cheesecake, delish! My husband got the tempura pineapple/mango icecream, also delish! It&#39;s served in a deep bowl and is surrounded with a lot of whipped cream to give it a much larger look and possibly some wow factor, so I&#39;d ask for that on the side next time because it quickly made the tempura soggy on the ice cream. My dessert was a lemon cake layered with lemon icing, which was still frozen. I brought it to one of our two servers attention (two of the women working took turns taking care of us) and she told me the cake is kept frozen due to freshness purposes. I told her I did not want a frozen cake, and she offered to box it up for later after it has sat out for a while, or to microwave it to thaw, but I wasn&#39;t crazy over the solution. No offer to take it off the bill even though I only took one bite, but that&#39;s okay. We ended up paying and still tipped great because I know this isn&#39;t a usual occurrence here, but it will be a while before I go back."

Read some reviews that seem to match my thoughts perfectly, and others that make me wonder if they went to the wrong restaurant.

My girlfriend is pretty into Asian cuisine, especially Korean food as a whole.  I LIKE the majority of Asian cuisine I&#39;ve tried: Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, but I haven&#39;t forayed into the Korean food scene much.  Finally have (as shown in multiple other reviews), but Dae Gee was my first as a whole really in town.

Been in a few times now, but the first was for AYCE BBQ.  Cause, man, sometimes... you are friggin&#39; starving, and the only thing that with sate your hunger is stacks upon stack upon goopy stacks of marinated meats and sauces.

Yeah yeah yeah, it is a bit pricey, but honestly, look at what you are getting: short ribs (ain&#39;t cheap, brisket (ain&#39;t cheap), ribeye (ain&#39;t cheap), chicken (cheep cheep), pork belly, and pork bulgogi.  It is a large variety of pretty decent cuts of meat, and as much as your heart desires... or at least as much as your arteries can bear.  Oh, the short ribs are not AYCE, but whatever, plenty to enjoy.

I like cooking my own BBQ stuff at the table.  It&#39;s fun, a unique experience, and sort of prolongs the meal, so when you&#39;re in good company, it makes for a longer evening of enjoyment.  Plenty of sauces to choose from, and tastes to create.  Yum.

They also have an unlimited variety of sides that come with your meal.  The seaweed is crazy good, I have considered eating that as a meal in and of itself, but that would back me up worse than Eastbound I-70 on a Sunday afternoon during ski season.  Few different styles of kimchi, some nice potatoes, and a few other random dishes, that are way tasty.

I&#39;ve also had the non-AYCE BBQ options.  The hot Bee Bim Bop is good, but I prefer the non-hot variety.  Tons of goodies in the bowl, plenty of meats if you so desire, and rice rice rice.  Good rice.

I tried their tofu, and it is the only thing I did not like here.  It wasn&#39;t marinated, sauced, or fiddled with it all.  It was plain, cold tofu.  Not getting that again, I&#39;ll stick to the meats LIKE I SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST DAMN PLACE!

Tried soju, never had it... awesome.  They have their own beer as well, tasty and goes well with all.

Their service method is a bit unique: you don&#39;t have a set server.  Rather, the entire staff on the dining floor will swing by, check in, bring more food, clear plates, take orders, etc.  Makes service faster in my opinion.

Either way, this was a great introduction to Korean food as a whole.  I have tried the less-Westerner-friendly spots in town, and I am glad I experience a much more introductory venue such as Dae Gee before trying them.

Good spot.  Great spot.  Tasty spot."

We went for the unlimited everything (chicken, beef, brisket, pork) option which was $22 a person. You get a lot of food for that price (hence the unlimited). My favorite is beef bulgogi. I wish I would have stuck with what i knew and loved and went with the unlimited beef bulgogi and shipped the other meats. 

The unfortunate thing at this restaurant is you must finish everything before you can choose the option you want. So we had to eat the pork prior to getting more beef. None of us were big fans of the pork, but we still had to force it down to get more oh the good stuff.

so if you&#39;re like me and know what you like already, stick with that unlimited plate."

1. The menu forces you to get all you can eat.  All you can eat is 22 bucks, while a single entree ranges from around 17-20.  There&#39;s really no reason not to pay the extra few dollars for all you can eat.
2.  Galbi isn&#39;t included in the all you can eat.  They bring one strip of galbi per person for the all you can eat, and you&#39;re not allowed to have more.  One strip?  Come on, that sucks.  Now, that I think about it, it&#39;s a better idea to order just galbi, because they will surely bring more than one strip and the galbi is the best thing, obviously.  They trick you into getting the all you can eat so they don&#39;t have to give you a full serving of the sweet sweet galbi.  I don&#39;t like that.
3. The banchan sucks. With the exception of the kimchee and maybe the seaweed stuff, the banchan isn&#39;t good.  Potato salad?  Raw broccoli.  No thanks.
4.  Half of the grills have vents and half don&#39;t.  If you get one without a vent you will smell like the food your&#39;e cooking.  Didn&#39;t bother me personally, but I could see how one would be annoyed.
5. No gochujang.

I still like going here.  All the meats are pretty good.  It&#39;s a decent recreation of a real Korean bbq experience and I always have a nice time.  All the staff is really nice too. If you&#39;re a seasoned Korean bbq person, you might be let down."

My boyfriend and I had a bit of a wait even though there were open grill tables, but it was only about 10-15 minutes or so. Our server came over right away and asked if we were familiar with how the all you can eat worked. We&#39;d never been there so she explained everything clearly for us. They bring out each of the 6 meats for all you can eat and then you can order more after you finish the first round. They do charge for uneaten meat portions and they give you unlimited banchan.

The grill table we had was uncomfortably close to another table, so close that I had to move to sit next to my boyfriend because I couldn&#39;t even get into the chair across from him. (This may have had something to do with the guy sitting at the table by us who made no attempt to move at all.) We had a grill table without an exhaust hood, so we ended up getting pretty smoky by the end.

The first round comes with brisket, pork belly, kalbi, chicken bulgogi, spicy pork and beef bulgogi. The banchan included kimchi, radish, potato salad, broccoli and fake crab, crunchy sweet seaweed, fish cake, and maybe a couple others. They also give you lettuce wraps. My favorite was the beef bulgogi which was the only thing we got more of. It would have been nice to have some seafood options. Servers kept coming by to check on us throughout the meal; I had no complaints about the service.

Overall, I thought this place was pretty good, if not 100% authentic."

- Super friendly staff that keeps up with refills on drinks and sides
- Love the concept! And it is fun to have a long lunch and chat with your friends while your meal is cooking 
- Because you have to cook for yourself you get full faster so you won&#39;t over eat here... if you do then you were dedicated in doing so.

Cons: 
- If one person at your table wants the unlimited barbecue, everyone at the table has to get it. I wanted a simple lunch special and not the BBQ but had to get BBQ like the other guests. No beuno.
- The meat is rather flavorless as well as some of the side items like the broccoli. The only sauce provided was the vinegary Korean BBQ sauce which wasn&#39;t my favorite and wasn&#39;t like the Korean barbecue sauces I have had in the past. 
- The sides weren&#39;t great. Lunch came with kimchi pancakes, fermented vegetables, overly sweet potato salad, fishcakes, broccoli, lettuce wrappers with bean paste, and rice. 
- It is rather expensive for cooking your own food that doesn&#39;t have a lot of flavor. $16 bucks a person at lunch. 

Overall, I was just disappointed. The atmosphere and concept is great but they could benefit from some sauces/marinades, side options, letting people order whatever they want at the table, and definitely lower pricing. Might be back to accompany my friends but wouldn&#39;t come back on my own."

I loved the staff! They were welcoming and very friendly!!! It&#39;s not like the other Korean BBQ places where they basically just want you to eat there and pay then go. They made sure we were good all throughout the time we were eating. Their selections were more than great and for the price... it was not bad at all!!! $20 each and it&#39;s the best and cheapest one you&#39;ll find! Love it!! we&#39;re definitely coming back!!!"

But preparation &amp; consumption of food isn&#39;t just an exercise in mimicry.  Sometimes, when you&#39;re sick and down and weak and feeling lonely, all you want in the world is the smell of something that tastes like comfort.  Obviously, kalbee and bulgogi are the draw here, as with most Korean restaurants, but earlier this week, 26 hours into summer-cold misery, I went straight for the kalbee tang (beef soup with kalbee, eggs, and vermicelli noodles) and it was glorious. It was exactly the brothy, savory, bone-warming goodness that I craved.  The abundant pieces of kalbee were tender and toothsome, and it was better medicine than anything that can be found in a pharmacy."

I just couldn&#39;t get over the poor quality in comparison to San Diego and SOCal. Full disclosure: I grew up in a  blended family with a  Korean step mum and spent every Sunday chowing down on some home cooking, so my standards are admittedly high. However, this place was just sad in terms of banchan selection and meat quality. I stopped in with a friend for dinner on a Monday night, we were the only one&#39;s there (not a good sign), ordered the dinner combo. 

This place is odd in the fact that the banchan is not prepared before sitting at the table. Every Korean BBQ I&#39;ve been to stateside and in Korea has the table prepared before sitting (nitpicking perhaps). Once seated we told the waitress we wanted the dinner combo, she said ok and left to get the banchan. I had to explicitly ask for barley tea, something that should come standard on the table preferably in a pot. Once she brought the banchan which was lackluster to say the least she just walked away. I flagged her down to ask about ordering particular meat and she explained that at Dae Gee a first order comes out with a bit of everything then you can order particular cuts. I usually wouldn&#39;t mind this approach, but I had no desire for their chicken, but was told you couldn&#39;t change the order. 

What we got for $22/person:

-chewy under seasoned chicken
- poor quality pork bulgogi
- decent beef bulgogi but too sweet 
- Kabli was decent, but you only get one order on the combo
- Overly fatty beef

Banchan:
- Potato salad
- sugar laced fried seaweed (where is my fresh salad?)
- Kimchee
- Daikon
- fishcake 
- had to ask for beansprouts (not typically served)
- Cucumber Kimchee 
- &#34;Korean Salad&#34;- some sort of lettuce mixture doused in something sweet 

I was expecting better meat with some sort of squid or octopus option and the banchan should have had some sort of japchae for sure and more pickled options. The point of banchan is to add variety of texture and flavor.....which didn&#39;t really happen.

I will say the one good thing about this place was the awesome waitstaff who were friendly and helpful. The Banchan dishes never stayed emptied and the staff anticipated reorders very well. 


I know this is Colorado and not Korea or SoCal, but Dae Gee could definitely step up the authenticity and quality of ingredients. I might go back for lunch if I really had a craving, but to be honest...I could do better at home with some ingredients from the market.

1) Side dishes are very limited. They brought out like 4 , and they aren&#39;t really good . Seoul BBQ would bring out 20 different side dishes 
2) their all you can eat meat choices are limited, especially their LA Kalbee is not unlimited . Although I cannot fault them for that since LA Kalbee is expensive , I totally get it!  for $21 all you can eat, can&#39;t really expect all you can eat Ribs .
You get one strip of the rib per person . You can get unlimited beef brisket and the Bulgogi and spicy pork and chicken . Their Spicy Pork is decent . The flavor is there
3) The tofu soup was a little bit tasteless. I am so used to the delicious  deep flavor of that soon dobu Tofu soup at Seoul BBQ, so this one didn&#39;t meet my expectation. 
4) there was a very friendly waitress , we really liked her , but there&#39;s one that got kinda irritated when we asked to change the grille. She said &#34; that&#39;s what happens when you turned the grill on high&#34; Well , understood  but , but the meat didn&#39;t cook because it was not hot enough, so can we please get another grille and call it done ?? ;) ! I didn&#39;t say that to her but .. yeah .. so wanted to tell her that ;)

I really recommend this place for anyone that is looking for something different, getting to cook your food is fun and is a good change from the typical dinning experience. Highly recommend checking this place out for lunch because the prices are better and it&#39;s less packed.

When we arrived, we were greeted by a younger hip Asian lady. She was pretty cool, gave us the low down on the food, and the downtown life (since we were tourists) The food we had was great, they switched out the cooking grill/plate often, and frequented our table to ensure the best possible customer service.

W just went as a small group and didn&#39;t really have the appetites to support the all-you-can-eat stuff, so we each ordered our own entree. Everything was served fresh, piping hot, and it was all packed full of flavor. Every single staff member we met was enthusiastic and seemed to really want to be there.

We were a party of 6 and my husband and I were super excited to do the unlimited bbq. I forgot that the whole table has to do it, which I get but it&#39;s annoying.
We started with chicken dumplings and the zucchini pancake. The pancake was really good.
So we ordered the squid, brisket, short rib, shrimp, pork, and the beef bulgogi. We decided not to cook our own food as I would likely be wearing it all since I was sitting closest to the grill. As such the squid was overcooked but the sauce it was in was amazing. My husband thinks it was cooked perfectly, but they bring it out still cooking effectively and that might have been it&#39;s undoing. The brisket was fatty in a not delicious way. It was also tough. The short rib too was fatty. The shrimp wasn&#39;t shared. The pork and beef bulgogi were the winners for sure.
I&#39;d also like to go back for the bee bim bhop. 
My husband and I had Passports, which we&#39;ve never had a problem using, but here for some reason, while our waiter accommodated us, it wasn&#39;t before telling us that they usually don&#39;t take two passports on the same check. Again, I&#39;ve never had a problem with using them. Perhaps they shouldn&#39;t do the passports next year then. It was only for draft beers, not even fancy cocktails, but whatever."

However, I refused to go until they had grill tables installed. The first year (and change) they were open and operated as a standard restaurant... not a korean bbq.

Finally they got tables installed so I strolled by. OK we made one fatal mistake and it was a first for me as well. We got seated at one of the electric grill tables. Don&#39;t do it. Say you&#39;ll wait for a gas table. It&#39;s a trap.

The gas grill tables have a large hood over them on the ceiling. The electric tables do not. The electric tables have a cute red glow like you&#39;re cooking with a light bulb a la easy-bake oven. Too bad it takes 4x as long to cook meat compared to a traditional gas grill. Seriously, we&#39;d put meat down, take a stroll through the neighborhood, stop for a sandwich on the way back, sit back down, read a book, write an amazon review, and then finally it might be time to flip the meat over. It&#39;s hard to get the characteristic char marks as the heat is just so pathetic. Fool me once...

Anyways, the sides are fantastic and I had several orders of kimchi and pickled veggies. I will come back, but will skip out on the george foreman grilling experience."

We leave the place in a good mood if their service was good and if their meat was tasty as well. Now you&#39;re reading this, thinking what the hell does this have to do with Dae Gee? A korean bbq in Denver?

Well its safe to say that DAE GEE compares to some korean bbq places in Los Angeles. The service was good. We came 30 minutes before closing on a Sunday night. I dont know if that was the owner or manager that greeted us and sat us down. He explained to us, just in case we didn&#39;t know how it worked. For a korean bbq spot in Denver I was pleasantly surprised.

One thing for the owner though: YOU MUST HAVE BRISKET SAUCE!"

A+ dining experience. As soon as we walked in, we were immediately greeted with a warm and friendly smile. The staff were extremely attentive, and made us feel very welcome. The restaurant was clean, well appointed, and had an inviting ambiance. 

Now to the important part: the food! We started off with the traditional seafood pancake - a simple dish, yet very easy to mess up, if overcooked. In this case, the seafood in the pancake was cooked to perfection - no rubbery calamari to be found here.

For my main dish, I opted to go with something simple, the tofu bee bim bhop. Insanely delicious, I highly recommend. As far as the sides... all of the traditional trimmings were present - the vegetables were pickled perfectly, and did not have an overpowering chili taste. As for the white rice, which is sometimes considered an afterthought, and not important enough to mention in a review, is definitely deserving of some accolades in this case. Dae Gee really nailed it for the perfect rice - fluffy and not overly sticky. 

While it may not always the case, Guy Fieri had it right this time; this is one place that you must try if you are in the Denver area."

I wasn&#39;t crazy about this location, staff seemed a little frazzled and it just didn&#39;t have a warm, inviting feel like the Westminster location but I guess they are just catering to the crowd that lives around here. That being said, the food is absolutely amazing and Dae Gee is still my fave spot for Korean in Denver. You can get single portions of bulgogi, spicy pork, galbee, shrimp, etc or for about $4 more, get the unlimited portion. The only caveats to that is that everyone at your table has to be down for that option as well then the real fun begins and you get to grill up everything at the table. The sides are baller as well and one of my favorite parts because they are so varied and FREE unlimited portions! From potato salad to fish cakes to steamed broccoli and of course, kim chi, you really have it all. It&#39;s easy to fill up on a single portion of bulgogi and the sides. Too easy actually......I was so full throughout the night I could barely sleep because I had too much (gluttony, party of one). Stop here if you want legit Korean!"

If you order a $16 dish of pork bulgogi, you most certainly expect a little more meat than 4 oz or so I would expect. Seriously, please look at the picture of my takeout box to be WARNED that you will get nothing more than that. 

AND they put it in a big ass box to make it look even worse. I called them after seeing this and thought it must have been a mistake, but the dude on the phone just said &#34;that&#39;s how much we give.&#34; I told him this was unacceptable, basically to pay that much for such a flimsy amount of meat. He repeated his sentence again and then finally said he would give me another order but it would be coming out of his pocket, and made it a point to tell me that he&#39;s a server. I thought, &#34;so what? Tell your manager then.&#34; Clearly, he was trying to make me feel bad about this but I really needed to be talking to the manager, not the server. 

My advice to you is to not order the take out BBQ. I bet they do this for all of them. I have no idea how it is when you dine in, but I&#39;ve had my share of Korean BBQ in my life and this was by far the biggest ripoff I&#39;d ever seen. If the cost isn&#39;t going to go down, they seriously need to do SOMETHING to make this sad looking order look better and like an actual meal. Add some vegetables or SOMETHING.

However, I am really impressed with Dae Gee: great customer service, high quality meat for the unlimited BBQ, and a clean atmosphere all lead to a great dining experience! 

There are two separate menus, one for the unlimited Korean BBQ and another for individual dishes as per a traditional restaurant setting. The individual dishes looked very enticing and have some great options, including popular Korean dishes. My table decided on the all you can eat option, so this review will be for the Korean BBQ.

Your entire table must order from the BBQ menu, but at $16/person for lunch and $21/person for dinner, it&#39;s definitely affordable. There are five different meat options for lunch and six for dinner (the difference being the L.A. Galbee beef short ribs). Despite not having the beef short ribs, the thinly-sliced brisket, pork belly, and variety of bulgogi (marinated meats) provided more than enough delicious food for lunch. I was looking forward to cooking the meat on the grill provided at the table, but they were currently being installed when I stopped by. Thus the meats came to our table already prepared but were still marinated to perfection and weren&#39;t too bland or overly-salted. My table went through several rounds before we were delightfully stuffed. 

There are plenty of traditional side dishes that are brought out along with the BBQ, such as the kimchi pancake and pickled vegetables, which accompany the meat well and are tasty even on their own. The side dishes are unlimited, so if you fancy a specific one, they will keep bringing you more of it at your request. Rice is also provided at request. 

The customer service was exceptional, especially with the staff&#39;s attentiveness to when we needed more meat or when our waters were running low. We felt welcome the entire time and will stop by again; I hope to try some of the items off the other menu soon."

And mind you, &#39;I love Korean food&#39; is an understatement for me. Try the pancake for the appetiser... You won&#39;t be disappointed. 

I also had the chicken bulgogi and seafood soon do fu. The chicken was tender and well grilled but I&#39;ve to admit, it&#39;s not the the best I&#39;ve had. The soon do fu was good but not the best I&#39;ve tasted either.

Kimchi Cheegae is really spicy. It&#39;s one of the lingering spices and not a kick. I think it&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t have enough of ingredients other than the kimchi is what makes the spice linger longer. It&#39;s not the type of spice I like, so it wasn&#39;t that great for me. 

Galbi Tang was interesting. It was like the broth of a rice cake soup (Dduk gook) wanting to become a galbi tang. There&#39;s some ingredients in there that&#39;s not usually part of it. So, I was a little thrown off, but nothing to complain about really. I would prefer the original recipe though. I felt it just wasn&#39;t worth the price."

Many of us have been to Korea and fancy ourselves KBBQ aficionados.  I have been to several places that I thought were better overseas as well as several in LA and San Francisco that I prefer but our little group unanimously vote this the best KBBQ in Colorado.

Highly recommend the beef and chicken bulgogi and the bibimbap!"

It looked as if they have a patio for outdoor seating during the warmer temperatures. Once you enter, you must wait to be seated. They have a decent amount of tables plus a bar. 

Once seated they provide a large bottle of water with cups. Thank goodness because their food is quite spicy for my sensitive palate. Their menu consists of appetizers, soups, and BBQ. Unfortunately this location doesn&#39;t have the table grills just yet. 

We ordered yook gae jang, which is a spicy hot soup with shredded beef and vegetables. For our main course, we ordered beef and squid bulgogi. With the main course, you get multiple little sides and rice. 

The yook gae jang was quite spicy for me to handle so I ended up taking a small bite then packing that to take home. Onto the main course, the beef bulgogi was properly marinated and very delicious. But by far my favorite was the squid bulgogi. That was spicy but the squid was soaked in the marinade and seasoned very well. 

I love Korean food so I was quite satisfied with this restaurant. I will be back once they get the table grills installed."

The first time here I had the bibimbap and the second time had the dolsoht. I have to agree with Cyn that the dolsoht with the crunchy rice really takes the food to another level. I always opt for a fried egg, as the thought of a runny egg makes me ill. I also like the tray of Korean veggies. The potato salad was delish. Some of the veggies are pickled or are spicy. The spicy ones are out of my taste palette, but others seem to enjoy. I also like that you can get refills on the veggies, which is nice as well. 

The prices seem reasonable and the servings are a little larger, so I have enough for lunch the next day."

Waitress, Tamara, was curt and when we asked questions about the menu, seemed irritated that we didn&#39;t know exactly what we wanted or how to interpret the dining options.  She then proceeded to forget to bring us the appetizer we ordered, and hardly ever walked back by the table.  I suppose this could have been excusable except for the fact that they were only seated at about 25% capacity and had plenty of waitstaff on duty.  Finally, when we asked for the check, she brought it and ran off to sweep the floors before I could pull out my card and then never came back.

Food was high quality, but lacking in the fact that the bowls we ordered had little to no meat in them.  Other places I&#39;ve been to that served such bowls had large portions of meat topping the rice and vegetables, and perhaps this was just a misunderstanding of the dishes offered, but as I said, my questions about the menu were met with curt disregard so there&#39;s no way I could have known that.

Although I came in with high hopes, and towards the beginning of the experience was looking forward to coming back and trying the BBQ, by the end of the meal we decided that we won&#39;t be returning to Dae Gee."

I&#39;ve been meaning to check this place out for months and was finally able to grab lunch with a friend.

The lunch specials are reasonably priced ($8-10) and so are the drinks. The &#34;Mulefoots&#34; is a Moscow Mule twist made with a Korean alcohol. It was tasty and refreshing. We ordered pork bulgogi &amp; a Bee Bim Bhop to share. Our meal started with complementary Korean starters, which I greatly appreciate they serve! The kimchi was spot on, the dried seaweed was crunchy perfection, and the fish cakes were yummy! Our Bee Bim Bhop came in a metal bowl, which surprised me a little, and I later realized you have to order the hot stone version seperately (the stone is totally worth it!) The vegetables in the Bee Bim Bhop were fresh and perfectly cooked, the beef was delicious, and the only advice I would give is...if you want a runny egg, say so, as ours was over medium (a little too cooked for my liking in a Bee Bim Bho). The sauce for the Bulgogi was wonderful, they nailed the flavor and the meat itself was very tender.

I took my girl tonight to this place for the $21 unlimited meal. We entered here at 8:07pm. People are waiting in line for the bbq table, we were fine if our bbq cooked in the kitchen. There fore, we got seated at a regular table at 8:17. NOBODY noticed us until 8:43pm. We don&#39;t even have water. You cannot find anyone walked around the floor and serve our section. After we meet with our server, we told her we want to do the unlimited meal. Then she said she need to check with kitchen to see if they still can serve it due to the busy hours. However, she was gone for another 10 mins. And then she told us we cannot do the bbq on the regular table. We can only order the regular menu or get back to line to wait for another bbq table. 

Me and my girlfriend just decided to leave. It took them 40 mins to tell us they can not serve us. By the time we were out, lots of the places are closing. All my appetite are ruined. Who would not be mad if the restrains the can treat customers like this???!!!!!

Dae Gee Korean BBQ is a real hip joint with a nice selection of entrees and appetizers.  The portions are relatively small, but the quality of the food is worthwhile.  The ambiance skews toward a younger, voguish crowd; in fact, Dae Gee&#39;s placemats have a list of the restaurant&#39;s various social media outlets.  Finally, the service is topnotch.  First-rate service seems to be a rare commodity these days, but you can find it here in spades.  

If you&#39;re a hog like me, you&#39;ll need to double or triple up on your appetizers and entrees.  The portions are petite, but the food is excellent.  I started with a side of Kimchee, a spicy and sour fermented dish made of vegetables, that was out of his world!  For the main course, I had Beef Bulgogi (Thin-sliced rib-eye beef marinated in exclusive Dae Gee BBQ sauce) and Goh Dueng Uh Gooee (Grilled Mackerel).  The Beef Bulgogi was incredibly tasty.  I woofed that down in a heartbeat.  I was a bit disappointed with with the Grilled Mackerel, however.  I wholeheartedly believe that this dish was pan fried.  It was greasy and heavily salted.

This establishment is very Millennial-esque.  I really appreciate businesses like Dae Gee that are plugged into the insanity that is Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.  Social media in this realm is not just about idiotic customers (like me) taking and posting food pics - it&#39;s about a  friendship and an ongoing dialogue.  The web is a place where compliments can be given and complaints taken care of.  That&#39;s the true value of social media.

Lastly, I have to give a shout-out to my waitress, Tamra.  She was a phenomenal server.  Great service should always be acknowledged.  Well done!!

Enjoy your meal!"

The L. A. Galbee (beef spare ribs) were the best part, but all of it was great. 

We took our 5 + 6 year old boys. They had a good time, even with the new flavors. They stuck to the chicken, which was very tasty. Service was very friendly and accommodating, even with children.

The Sides were great; especially the pickled radish, kimchee, broccoli, the cucumbers and the potato salad. We ordered the unlimited bbq and really loved the pork and chicken (could have done without the pork belly and brisket). The main reason for 4 stars would be one of the waitresses, she seemed frazzled and overwhelmed even though her tables seemed pretty low maintenance (from what I could overhear). She hassled us for leaving two pieces of chicken (after we had eaten the other two pieces). I understand they do not want a lot of food waste but it was a bit extreme and left a bad last impression."

The positives were that getting seated with a group of 6.5 (our baby was there too) was easy.  The menu is descriptive and helpful for those of us who haven&#39;t been often for Korean BBQ.  It would have been nice if the lunch specials and portions were available on the weekends too.  The prices are definitely high for a lunch.  Additionally, the tables are still not available for cooking your own barbecue.  We had some mixed reviews on our various dishes.  The sides were good, but way too many spicy ones (not good for kids).  The barbecue was better than the bibimbap, which was bland.  The appetizers of dumplings and pancakes were good, but a little greasy.  The service was friendly when available, but the place seemed to be understaffed with only 1 waitress serving all the tables and, at times, disappearing for long stretches.

We went in, were seated, and told the waitress we wanted the All you can eat option. Waited a while, and instead of bringing out a grill, she brought out a plate with a few slices of Cooked brisket. Literally maybe like 5 slices of brisket. Are you kidding me? (see picture). I asked the waitress why we don&#39;t have a grill to cook it ourselves. The response was &#34;Our grills have a problem right now.&#34; 

Really? You can&#39;t tell me that before we order? You have grills built into the tables. The entire point of kbbq is to cook and drink and eat with friends, it&#39;s an interactive experience. If a major part of the incentive of kbbq is not available, Shouldn&#39;t you tell your customers up front? Not only that, but if you are having problems with some grills, and your business OPERATES on grills, can&#39;t you run out to a market and just buy the tabletop propane grills? Those are a super inexpensive way to keep the business running. So given all that, the excuse seems very flimsy. Also, I felt pretty deceived. 

(Another note. It appears from other yelp reviews that this has been their &#34;excuse&#34; for over a year now. I think they just do not allow true diy kbbq style grilling, period, while pretending their grills are broken.)

We had to wait like 10-15 minutes between each order of tiny servings of meat to come out of the kitchen, because every table&#39;s orders had to be cooked in the kitchen and served. We couldn&#39;t cook it to the way we liked it. We couldn&#39;t get the turnaround we wanted. In the end we basically got full off the rice and side dishes, before we could get enough of the actual korean bbq meats. Not only that, they only have 5 types of meats to choose from. (1 of which is an &#34;LA style&#34; marinated meat that you can only have 1 serving of.) So they really only have 4 types of cuts to choose from."

For whatever reason, on Sundays, there is no unlimited lunch.  Instead, it&#39;s unlimited dinner for $21.  It wasn&#39;t even noon when I visited.  Pure money grab for the restaurant I say.  Whatever.  I wanted to try this, and went in.

Okay, I&#39;d say 60% of the meat is quite good.  Skip the bacon (whatever it&#39;s called), and try everything else.  The pork bulgogi (spicy pork) is especially good.  The kim chi and korean pancakes are also quite good.  Stick with that the entire time.  

One last thing, make sure that you keep your plates clean.  If there&#39;s meat left on the table, or you take any to go, it costs extra.  Another money grab that&#39;s just silly to me.

Silly rules aside, it&#39;s good, but I&#39;ve never seen these silly rules anywhere else.  So that."

And then told us that even though we don&#39;t like the meat we still have to eat it cause they can&#39;t bring extra unless the first round is all gone.

The server argued with me when I tried to explain the purpose of an appetizer and she continually insisted that it was nearly ready, despite the fact that we didn&#39;t need it or want it anymore.

Dae Gee has another restaurant in Arvada/Westminster and I&#39;m so glad to have one so close. 

Walking in, you are instantly greeted by the booming of the Korean pop music. Make sure to call ahead if you are going in a big group.  This place barely opened but was almost packed on a Wednesday night! 

Currently, they don&#39;t have the BBQ grills at the tables so whatever you order is cooked then brought out to you on a hot grill.  

The seafood pancake was a delicious start to our meal.  Unfortunately they do not have unlimited BBQ right now but we proceeded to order the beef short ribs, pork and beef bulbogi, and pork short ribs.  Everything was so delicious and the service was on point.

Don&#39;t be shy, ask for more sides (they don&#39;t fill up the side dishes as much as I&#39;d like).  Ask for more spicy dipping sauce with the pancake!

The prices were fine and the portions were big, but I&#39;d prefer smaller portions of better meat. Also, your grill just did not get hot enough on the sides. Finally, the soon tofu soup had little depth, the broth needs more flavor than the Dae Gee sauce. Just my opinion. We love Korean BBQ."

The sides were great, but they still did not have the tableside hibachi grills so that you can cook your own food. Cooking your own meat at the table is essentially the main component of Korean BBQ. However, they said that they would get the grills very soon. So we ordered some of their other dishes and were pleased.

Fast forward to today. 

We are sitting at home, and do not want to leave. So, we see if we can order delivery from DAE GEE. We live about 1/2 a mile away from the restaurant, but apparently they will not deliver to anyplace east of Colorado, the street on which they are located.

So we thought about going into eat, and decided to check the reviews on Yelp! to see whether or not they had gotten hibachis for the table. A year later, and they still have not. 

Confused as to why they did not deliver, and curious about the failure to get BBQ grills after nearly a year of operation, I decided to call the restaurant. The phone rang...and rang...and rang. No answer or even an answering machine. That sealed the deal for us.

I was really excited about this restaurant but they just don&#39;t have the management or the ownership to turn it into a place worth eating. Steer clear."

I was looking for something different and yelp reviews recommended it.  I tries the  DOHL SOHT BEE BIM BHOP which comes with endless appetizers. 

The appetizers are good enough to eat but leave room for the rice dish. The vegetables are crunchy and have great flavor. The clay bowls make it exotic.   This is definitely better than the meat bbq which is probably si liar to many other places."

Their AYCE is little different than any other Korean AYCE place I&#39;ve been. (I grew up in LA, traveled a lot in SF area and Las Vegas). You have to order all six kinds of meat and if you like specific meat, you can order it again after your first round. However, my friend couldn&#39;t have anything with gluten but brisket and pork belly and she wanted to have AYCE for the first time. We asked see if we can have just two kinds of meat, the answer from the manager is either we order the dish by dish or we have to have all the six kinds, regardless you are gluten intolerance or not. Well, I didn&#39;t want to fight and we were hungry so I had all other marinated meat so she can have the meat with gluten free.

What really irritated me was the prices vs the portions.

My friends and I came here after meeting up for an intense work out. We were HUNGRY. We shared appetizers... man doo and the veggie pajeon. Both were delicious. I think the dumplings (man doo) were a great deal (6 for $4). In addition, tons of free side dishes, like the delicious kim chee (delightfully crisp), marinated beans, potato salad, sesame broccoli, and a few others. (get free refills - you might have to ask)

All of us ordered bibimbap. My friends ordered Kalbi bibimbap; I had my heart set on dolsot bibimbap (with beef) and the fried egg. I had enough will power to let the hot stone bowl do it&#39;s job and had the crispy rice to mix in. Perfect ratio of veggies and meat. I wish I had used more of the sauce.

Beware - it&#39;s a big portion. I had enough leftover for a large lunch the next day.

I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s &#34;Seoul BBQ good,&#34; but it was definitely tasty. I got the bulgogi, which I always get. Great flavor, tender beef. The squid dish that my mom got was the winner at the table, though. I&#39;ll have to see if Seoul has a similar dish and compare. I only had two minor issues that kept this place from being 5 stars right now: First, there were no tableside grills, but they&#39;re coming soon according to the server. Second, the entrees seemed smaller than I usually get from Korean restaurants. 

A couple of Yelp reviews suggested that they charge extra for extra bowls of rice and didn&#39;t provide refills on side dishes. That absolutely was not my experience. Our server was one of the most attentive servers I&#39;ve ever had at a Korean BBQ, and we did not get any push back or extra charges when we asked for more rice and other side dishes."

When we first got there, it was a bit busy with prom and high schools students. We were understanding. After waiting quite awhile, we finally got sat down. But, it literally took 25-30 minutes to get a server to take care of us. Prom kids were long gone. When we finally got our order in, which we all did the all you can eat BBQ. Not until our first meats/side dishes came they told us &#34;Oh last call is in 30 minutes.&#34; In my head, I was thinking they should have told us, before we made the commitment to AYCE BBQ. So the eating experience was sort if rushed (considering we waited and lost a total of 40 minutes where we waited in the beginning to get a table [which there were plenty of tables] and someone to serve us.) Anyways, overall our server gave us good service and made sure we got our moneys worth. They were out of a lot of side dishes, which is something to consider if you go towards the end of the night. Meats were marinated pretty good, and there choice of sauces were good. There was a mild, spicy, and a bbq one. Branding of this place is REAL cute and hip. Dae Gee means to PIG OUT!

This establishment was not offering AYCE on our recent trip, but overall their menu lists an abundance of affordable options. Plus, your meal comes with the usual 40 small plates boasting more tame options such as bean sprouts to the funkier preserved cabbage AKA kimchi.

The soups, rice bowls, and BBQ are what you expect. Strong in flavor, simple in ingredients, and light in body. You leave here feeling satisfied but not stuffed to the brim.

The person on the phone was very kind and let me know it would be about 30 minutes.

I went in and my order was ready and very hot.  My bill was about $20 which isn&#39;t bad for a 14&#34; pizza and cheese bread.  The cheese bread was absolutely delicious.  They put two sides of pizza sauce in with it.  The pizza was also delicious and cooked to perfection.

Two weeks ago I was looking for something new and near me. Lucky for me, I open the yelp app and saw Coloradough pizza and it&#39;s very high ranking.

Going here was one of the best pizza decisions I&#39;ve ever made!! Where my old favorite place had become a cardboard crust with marginal toppings thrown on lazily without care and no cheese to speak of, this place made a super duper fly ass pizza pie!

Hot. Fresh. Cheesy. Delicious. Even the next day when the leftovers won hands down over a fresh one from the old place (yes, I compared to make sure).

Heading out now for a pizza. Yum!"

I finally went to Coloradough Pizza shop and, to my surprise; there was pizza for sale (unlike the last few times, but I digress).  The lady at the register told me that were some &#34;issues&#34; during the opening weeks, but that was all in the past.  She then told me that Coloradough is the best pizza in town.  While this was not exactly accurate, it was very close.

I ordered the 5280, and the Pizza was wonderful, hot and fresh.  The crust is different from others I have had.  It was perfectly crisp, yet chewy, mild in flavor, and not at all heavy.  The sauce was good and there was not an excessive amount added to my pizza.  The toppings were exceptional, a perfect mix of quality and quantity.

So, in closing I would like to say, Let&#39;s start over, this could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship."

The problem: the phone number did not have message capability. I decided that the reviews were compelling enough to give the place a try, so drove up to find the place open for business. When I walked up to the counter to place my order, the attendant had to stop in the middle to answer the phone...

I ordered a large spinach feta with bacon. At the recommendation of another patron - who was successful in getting through on the phone - I added roma tomatoes. They estimated 45 minutes for the order, but when I returned at that mark, another person at the counter had to search for the box and found it at the bottom of a large stack of other pizza orders. 

When I made it to my next destination 2 miles away, the pizza was only warm. It still tasted good, but I would imagine that it would have been better had it been hotter. 

For a place that only does pickup and delivery, they really need to add additional phone lines. When I told an employee about not being able to get through, the response was, &#34;Yeah, we only have two lines.&#34; I don&#39;t know what the industry standard for business lines is, but perhaps they should add online ordering capability?!"

The 5280 was great, nice crisp crust, and we felt like the prices were a lot more reasonable than some comparable pizzas around. 

Only complaint would be on the Spinach &amp; Feta--the white sauce was great, but there was almost nothing on it. At first I thought they&#39;d given us a cheese pizza by accident b/c I almost couldn&#39;t find the spinach and bacon (and I guess there was feta?). We ended up adding on our own toppings at home; if it&#39;d been loaded with spinach and cheese and bacon, I would have had no complaints. I still feel like it deserves more than 3 stars, though."

The pizza was hot and smelled so good! We ate immediately and the pizza was absolutely wonderful!! The ingredients were so fresh, the cheese was hot, and the crust was just right for us!

However, she never smiled, she needs to smile. Lol. At least pretend to like your job.

A minute or so after being seated at our table, our waiter came to greet us with a HUGE smile and a super cute accent. Eberardo is a great waiter!! He brought us our drinks. My drink tasted a little flat, so he said he would go to the waiter station to get a new one and that maybe the sodas from the bar were flat. Going above and beyond. He was there at a moments notice if we even had a question. Like he knew. 

The food was pretty good. We ordered the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños. Really greasy, but what do you expect from bacon. It&#39;s was very tasty and flavorful. 

For my main course, I had the spicy shrimp and chicken fettuccine. This was super tasty. Decent size portion too, that I had a little left over. 

My best friend had ordered the mediterranean mahi-mahi naan with a side of seasoned fries. Super messy, but pretty good. 

And to top it all off, even the paper table napkins were super soft. Best table napkin I&#39;ve ever had, and they were softer then using a real napkin. Loved it!"

I ordered the &#34;Classic Cheese Burger&#34; ($8.40) without cheese, so basically a hamburger. As you can see on the photo, the Burger and Fries looked pretty normal, nothing spectacular. This is probably the best description for the taste, too. First of all, they didn&#39;t ask me how I wanted the patty and it came medium-well. It tasted pretty &#39;old&#39; and dry, the buns were even drier. The veggies were pretty fresh and tasty though.

All in all I&#39;m giving 3/5 stars, since the Burger was only average, the price below other Burger places and the service pretty nice."

All while the place only had few tables taken. After ten mins we were finally seated. 
The waiter spoke quietly and I had to ask him a few time to repeat himself. (The music was cranked up)so My boyfriend and I ended up just playing in our phones for most of the time there since we didn&#39;t want to scream across the table during the whole meal. 

We ordered the all American burger and the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. Burger was good however the pasta tasted just like a frozen pasta dinner not worth the $14 bucks.

The mashed potatoes seemed the same as they used to be. The Mac and cheese was missing the cheese part. It was just hard penne pasta. My wife ordered the potato skins, mozzarella sticks, and boneless chicken wings in the Memphis BBQ flavor. The wings were decent. The potato skins were missing the potato part.

We ended up ordering a desert and paying for it just so we could leave him a generous tip (because honestly who the hell carries cash now a days)."

Both of my waitresses have been wonderful and personable. One in particular didn&#39;t know the menu really well though. 

If you like chicken salads I definitely recommend the pecan crusted chicken salad! It is my new favorite!! They will allow you too change things out in the salad if your taste buds are craving something slightly different. 

Both the drink menu and food menu have a huge variation of foods to choose from. If you are not driving you must try one!"

We now have visited the Aurora Mall location and every single time we visit, we are sorely disappointed, not only with service but also the food. 
We came on 4th of July around 10pm and it was empty because the fireworks display had just ended. 
My Husband ordered: Ribeye and shrimp, with loaded mashed potatos and cesar salad. Salad never came. Ribeye was supposed to be medium rare, it was well-done. Mashed potatos were not supposed to have chives, as my Husband is allergic to them and we told our waitress this. We also asked for extra Jack Daniel&#39;s sauce and offered to pay extra. Well, mashed potatos came with chives and Jack Daniel&#39;s sauce didn&#39;t come as requested. In her defense, she did offer to replace his meal, but as we had already waited 30 mins and were starving, we decided to take it as is. 

I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp and asked for extra bruschetta. Instead of fresh, succulent tomatos, they splattered extra marinara all over. 

The waitress said she would bring ice tea refills 3x...and never did. My Husband had to get up and go to the wait station where she was chatting and got it himself. Manager came by and saw this, he did not say one word at all. 

They did comp the salad, so that was good. Overall, the experience was not what I expect from TGIF. Even our neighboring table complained. Their apps came out before drinks. Also, they asked the busser who brought out their apps for another round of potstickers. Busser said she would let server know. Server came about 7 mins later, they asked if their extra order was placed. Server said nobody told her. 

At one point, a kitchen staff member with a hair net came to serve us. Clearly this restaurant has no communication within itself. Its staff is poorly trained at best and even management can&#39;t be bothered with customer concerns."

This place quickly reminded me why Boulder doesn&#39;t have nearly any fast food chains. 

3 tables seated at the bar area, my friend and I were one of these tables. Two bartenders, one had to come over to get our drink orders started while our server struggled, but Im not sure why. 

Friday&#39;s now offers, &#34;Happy Hour all day, every day.&#34; which means there are $5 and $6 drinks and (limited) apps all day...its really nothing special. Id rather have all the apps half priced a few hours a day. 

Just in for a quick snack, we ordered two beers ($6/ea) and two apps: Jack Daniel&#39;s Chicken Strips (an old fav of mine), and mozz sticks ($5). They apps came out lukewarm, and both were better in my distant memory of liking this place. The mozz sticks were really creamy, they didnt taste like cheese, it just kind of felt like cheese and looked almost like cheese.

I don&#39;t need to go back, they don&#39;t even have good happy hour, for it being &#34;all day.&#34;"

We always self seat at the bar so we can get half price apps, after we were already seated the host approached us and asked if everyone at the table was 21? It was obvious my kids 11 and 13 weren&#39;t. He was just being a smart ass and said there is sign that says they need to be 21, I told him I&#39;ve never seen the sign so on our way to being escorted out he rudely pointed out the sign. I told him he didn&#39;t have to rub it in my face and he said i just want to make sure you see it this time.

We were seated and waited about 5 mins before anyone came to get a drink order. There were about 7 other tables, 2 were wrapping it up. Once our food got to out to our table we had to wait another 5 minutes for silverware. 

I ordered the pick 3 with pretzels, potato skins. NO BACON and mozzarella sticks. All came cold, sauces had skinned over. Pretzels were burnt, skins were full of bacon. I asked waitress if they looked burnt to her, she said nope. She took me back, they came back more burnt and with cheese sauce filled with bacon. She said this is what color they usually are. I told her to take a bite. She refused. 

Manager came, told me I wouldn&#39;t be charged for food i didn&#39;t eat, duh!!!!

My husband and I went for Sunday lunch, restaurant wasn&#39;t very busy at all, however we were told the kitchen was &#34;backed up&#34;, that&#39;s why it took more than 45 mins for the first order of Endless Apps to come out. But I&#39;m jumping ahead. We were seated directly to the right upon entering the door, were told a specific waitress was assigned to us and then after what looked like some arguing amongst the servers we were finally assigned someone. Still took about 15 mins for out drink order to be taken. Then another 10 mins for the liquids to actually show up at our table. While we had plenty of time to wait we got a great show. 3 other tables surrounding us had major problems either with the kitchen or serving staff. We didn&#39;t want to fall into that category so we waited patiently. Unfortunately, we were sucked into the negative atmosphere because our first set of boneless wings came out w warm sauce covering cold pieces of chicken. We set it a side, finished the potato skins and placed our order for the next set of apps. Unfortunately this is where we were told the kitchen was behind. Again, looking around the place was not busy at all. 1 table asked for the manager who didn&#39;t show his face until 30-40 mins after they requested him, we had an opportunity to talk with them about there disservice. He then treated them to the nines and we still got the shaft. Even if you count the 2 sets of parties who left for lack of service. I&#39;m pretty sure our server was scared to death of our entire area so we were included in her lacking our attention. The entire 2 1/2 hours we were there we only had 2 sets of apps and 3 refills. Tanay, our server could have made things so much better considering she only had 4 tables to attend to. She would disappear for such a long time we couldn&#39;t figure out where she went. She even asked me if I wanted my last refill, walked away for 20 mins, then walked straight towards our tablea grabbed my empty drink cup, walked away for a good 5-7 mIns and finally brought my drink. Crazy! We have been there many times and never had an experience quite like this, it will most certainly be a very long time before we attempt a return!"

After we came from the bathroom the same man was seating someone who had just walked in the door. Ignoring that minor miscommunication I still decided to eat here. My food was cold when brought out, i ordered the sizzling chicken &amp; shrimp. Which you would assume it&#39;d be sizzling right? Nope. smh. Still I didn&#39;t complain because really we were there just to kill time, not very hungry. I asked the man that seated us (because I couldn&#39;t find the waiter ) if he could get me a small plate for my daughter to eat on....I wish I could&#39;ve taken a picture of the plate he brought out that was filled with old dried up food pieces that didn&#39;t get cleaned off...enough said.

So walk in with my girlfriend and get promptly walked to our table, but in route to the table another one of the staff actually makes me get out of his way that would be find and dandy if said person actually was a waiter and carrying a tray and not just a worthless greeter..... Yeah he was a worthless greeter as neither of the two of them actually greeted us or welcomed us to the place.  

So we sit and look over the menu well by the time a waitress got to us had i wanted to memorize the menu I would have had ample time to do so along with the drink/dessert book....  So she apologizes for the wait as the manager informed her that the waitress that was supposed to serve us hadn&#39;t made it to our table yet so she took over...  That was a great move by the manager I have to say...  seemed that every table in the section that was served by what was supposed to be our waitress had to flag down other waiters or waitresses to get some service.   So the waitress we ended up with did a fantastic job at recovering could have done a little better but she did what she could then it came even more clear and evident as to why she could only do so much.  

The manager then comes to the table and asks how everything is knowing he is already in the hot seat.  Well his customer service skills could use a little more polishing to say the least  at the end of the night he ended up giving us a free dessert and two free coupons for a dessert or appetizer.

The food was ok a little heavy on the garlic for the fries but still good, the burger was very good as well.  The ladies food the broccoli wasn&#39;t fully cooked and chicken a little too much garlic as well...."

The queso I got as a starter was so-so, but the beef chili stuff was really yummy. The buffalo wings were alright, but not very spicy especially since the sauce we chose was second hottest.

My steak is delicious; juicy and cooked right! My mom&#39;s baby back ribs were way too salty and she said they were giving her serious cottonmouth. My brother&#39;s chicken and shrimp Alfredo was good; my fiancé&#39;s was burger good.

Great if you&#39;re 20-something or blue collar rowdy; not so great if you want a good meal in even a reasonably loud restaurant."

So lets start out with going in. First off we asked for a booth but were given one next to the bar were the music volume is several decibels over normal conversation volume making it impossible to talk. So i asked for us to be moved to a quieter area and were but i feel that it was the responsibility of whoever seated us to ask us this question prior. Next the burger i ordered was medium rare, when i got it, it was burnt to a crisp, and i mean to the point that if you took a chunk between your fingers and squeezed it, not one drop of juice would come out. In addition it was cold. The guacamole my wife ordered had hole chunks of avocado in it probably 1.5 the size of a marble. The only good thing i can say is that the manager did not charge me for the food as me and my wife left after eating maybe 1/4 of the food."

I usually am very boring and predictable but I got the tomato soup, ham cheese grilled trio thingy. Its more a lunch item but you can get it whenever. Its a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, its more grown up with white cheese, a semi-zesty sauce and a darker rye/grainy bread. A small bowl of soup, and it comes with fries, but they will sub veggies or a salad. I&#39;m pretending to be on a diet so I get the salad. My man gets the sizzling chicken and cheese. WHATS with all the cheese I know I know, but remember again, who doesn&#39;t like cheese. It has a mexican flair with all these onions and peppers almost like fajita chicken but not quite. Its so good and the name says it all. Sizzling, gooey melty cheese that sticks to everything as it cools. It comes with garlic mashed potatoes. 

I don&#39;t usually get dessert here. They seem to rotate their dessert menu all the time and I don&#39;t really like their basic options and everything they get something good its a limited time thing. And besides, I&#39;m on a diet, wink wink. 

They service is a bit here or there, and its so dependent on when you go, who gets you etc. They are also open super late like 12-1 am something crazy like that. We usually get average to good service."

There are always people waiting to seat you, our servers have always been friendly, some even exceptionally funny and interesting. The service has always been quick, I&#39;m very picky about waiting too long for service, and the servers here always seem to be on top of things. My drink is always well attended to, and the food-what anyone goes out to eat FOR in the first place...phenomenal. I haven&#39;t tried EVERY part of the menu but from my several visits I can tell you the wings, ribs, and steak are all top-notch. Sweet potato fries are a favorite that I NEVER go without. Best appetizers so far would be the nachos and the pretzel sticks w/ cheese. During my most recent visit, yesterday, I found out that they have recently revamped their menu, so I tried something new. I think it was called &#34;Chicken Mushibi&#34;. It was some kind of chicken skewers on a bed of rice with grilled zucchini and pita bread...mmmmm new favorite!
Will be in soon for another visit. I would bring anyone here, one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat with someone. Keep it up guys."

This entire franchise is a joke, this particular location sent me and my fiancé over the edge. Lets start by saying we&#39;ve been about 20 times in the past year and every experience has been absolutely terrible. We even contacted corporate and they sent us a stack of buy one get one coupons, but even now, we would not even waste our time using them. The aurora mall location has been the worst. My fiancé orders the same thing every time and somehow they always get it wrong, it&#39;s right on the menu! He doesn&#39;t even make any special changes. The meal he orders is jack daniels ribs and a jack daniels steak, this time around he got barbecue ribs and barbecue steak, we asked for the correct meal and they brought it back a few minutes later with the barbecue sauce still on it but they just microwaved it and slapped jack Daniels on it. We immediately spoke with a manager who took it and had a fresh one made but she just brought out the ribs and steak and didn&#39;t bring his sides (even though she took them uneaten), we asked about this and she said the fries were still cooking. Waited, and nothing, they never came. We paid and left. You literally could not pay us to return to any location, they&#39;re all the same. It&#39;s disgusting."

We were in Aurora to pick up some stuff for my partner&#39;s computer business and everyone was hungry, so we stopped off here.  It was just after 7pm and we waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  We had our twin girls with us that evening and the place was LOUD!

Our server was friendly, the drinks were constantly filled and the food made it&#39;s way out in fairly decent time, especially given how busy they were.  They have certainly changed up their menu and presentation of the food since my last visit to one of their restaurants...and personally, I think it&#39;s for the better!  I had the black angus sirloin (6 ounce pre-cooked) with sweet potato fries and grilled mixed veggies, which was part of the &#34;three for $16.99&#34; promotion they have going on right now.  I shared my mozzarella sticks (appetizer) and my Oreo ice cream sandwich dessert with my daughters...I also shared my veggies and fries with them, but ate the steak on my own.  I asked for well done and it was well done but still VERY tender and moist with wonderful flavor!  My kids both had the chicken skewers (taken off the skewer for the half-pints) with pita bread and mashed potatoes and they both inhaled it.  My partner had some kind of Argentina inspired pesto with steak and although she said her food &#39;wasn&#39;t that great&#39;....she certainly did down the whole thing!

The only real complaint that I have is the table next to us with the obnoxious children (who looked to be around the same age as our twins...one about 5 and the other about 4 or so).  The kids were running up and down the aisle, screaming, getting in the way of the servers (the aisle was already narrow), bothering other patrons and...well...just being BRATS!  

Yes, I can make comments about this type of behavior because not only do I have kids that age, but my kids KNOW better than to behave like that in a restaurant!  They know it&#39;s inappropriate and would get them into a lot of trouble.  My older two, who are now grown (newly grown, BTW) also knew better than to show out in a restaurant like that -- even with ADHD and even when the meds were low and/or they were tired.  

It&#39;s a bad thing when your five year old kids look at the kids running around like screaming banshees, look at you and say, &#34;why are they being bad, Mommy?&#34;  Good question..."

This is the first time I have ever walked out of a restaurant. A 1 star is too high a rating. Zero would be more appropriate. We went there for dinner around 5:20pm. My wife ordered a wedge salad and I ordered one of their 3 course meals - wedge salad, shrimp and dessert. After 25 minutes here come the shrimp. We asked about the salads. The waitress returned with 2 house salads. We stated we ordered wedge salads and was told they were out of wedge salads and brought these instead. I stated the salads should have been here long before the main course. No explaination was given. In retrospect, the waitress should have told us about the lack of wedge salads at the time our order was placed. This restaurant and service was worst than terrible.

We went late, it was probably around 10pm.  I asked the hostess not to seat us by any children.  She then asked &#34;is this table ok?&#34; which was right next to a table with children at it.  I pointed out her mistake and we were brought to a booth further away while she made it obvious that we were inconveniencing her.

I ordered an Ultimate Mojito.  It was good, but it was WAY too sweet.  My boyfriend and I split the spinach &amp; artichoke dip and a California club sandwich.  The artichoke dip was so-so.  Not bad, but not really that great.  The sandwich was fantastic!  Soft, warm bread, crispy bacon, avocados... yum!

We were then rudely interrupted by a toddler running around the restaurant screaming.  Can&#39;t people control their children?  Should these small children really be out this late?

At any rate, the service was OK, the food was OK, the clientele was annoying and overall it was just OK.  I ate here one other time, I think it was last winter and I&#39;d say it was a little better last time, but not significantly.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back if I get another free gift card.  Otherwise, probably not.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d actually waste my own money on coming here again."

We found them at Civic Park when we were &#34;researching&#34; vendors for our wedding. We would definitely recommend the Crock Spot for your catering needs! Our guests STILL mention how great the food was 9 months after the wedding! 

Although they were unable to bring the actual truck to our venue (we were married up near Winter Park) due to having to drive over Berthoud Pass, they provided normal catering services for us. Mandy was great to work with, and they even custom-made a vegetable dish specifically for us, and it was so good! 

We cannot express 1) how great the food was, 2) how easy it was to work with them as a vendor, and 3) that they are just nice people to do business with! If you are looking for something different that your guests will rave about for months after your event, we definitely recommend using the Crock Spot for your catering (or stopping by the truck when it is out-and-about)!

It&#39;s a simple idea, good for quick service and easy to mobilize for the limited cooking capacity in a truck kitchen.  You pick your grain, your protein and your sauce, and a few seconds later you wind up with a bowl.  There are only a few rotating options for each on a given day, but that still allows for several different combinations.  It&#39;s a bit high-priced, but what food truck isn&#39;t at this point?  Hopefully you catch them on a day with some of the common favorites that other reviewers have mentioned.  I really enjoyed the chimichurri sauce for one, so I&#39;ll get that again regardless of what else I assemble in my bowl.  Meats are generally nice and tender, though obviously I haven&#39;t tried them all.  This is one of the better food trucks I&#39;ve visited lately."

Summary: Gets me full for $10 ($9 without extra veggies). Easy to cut and mix, best eaten that way IMHO. Great amount of flavor, Nice Staff. The Cold sauce on top of the cold food was not a good idea and the food got cold fairly fast  less than5min. 

I had my heart set on the meatballs, but wanted the cook to chose good pairings, and of course add the side of veggies. The meatballs have the perfect amount of bite, are well held together but still being able to be cut by plastic fork. Due to the nature of the truck, each item was almost trying to be the star of a possible meal. I didn&#39;t see  When I did mix it, Everything integrated perfectly. Props to them for making the individual items work well together

Ps: The side of veggies was definitely a bit light (two pieces of broccoli, a strip each of green and red bell peppers, a tiny sprinkle of corn), but for only one dollar there is worse you can do."

As the name implies the food here is slow cooked in crock pots. You start your bowl by choosing a grain, options include Jasmine rice, pearl barley, quinoa and others depending on the day. Next you pick a protein, something like stout braised pulled pork, turkey meatloaf, lentils, or roasted lamb - again the options change regularly. Then you get the sauce, you can have chimichurri, chipotle sour cream or Jamaican jerk among other options. These, too, vary daily. But, the whole point is you can mix and match these items to create a taste sensation in your mouth.

I went with a barley, pulled pork, chipotle sour cream bowl that not only was delicious, but also big enough to last me two lunch periods. I ate some that day and took the rest home to savor it the following day.

I say simple in the sense that the process of ordering could not have been easier. Simple because the food, mind blowing, was easy to set up. It starts with a bowl. Then from this bowl you add a base (I chose jasmine rice, unreal) then you choose a meat. You have your choices of jalapeño beef, turkey, pork or lentils. I love beef products and spicy things so naturally I went with the jalapeño beef. Next comes the sauces. There were so many to choose from but I could only remember the one I ordered which was AMAZ-BALLS. It&#39;s base was siracha(spelling?)  and then some other ingredients to allow for the spice to cool down and then hear up again once the jalapeño came into play. Some serious flavor action going on inside this food bowl. Then to top it all off I got some Asian cole slaw which turned out to be the perfect topper to it all. 

The first bite is like a game of tag with the flavors. Each getting their turn to play with the palate. Oh man. First the jasmine rice comes over and lightly brushes the taste buds then a beautiful crescendo of spicy beef and the sauce come together to overcome the senses in both taste and smell. Only the moment before you think it gets too hot does the Asian coleslaw come in to cool things down and take you back to the beginning for a second bite. This food bowl is more than a food bowl. It is a satisfying life experience that everyone should at least try once, and, if you are of age, have it with a beer from the local Denver brewery. It makes the meal that much more memorable. This meal was, in every possible sense of the word, delicious. I finished off the first bowl and went back for seconds which was handed to me within 30 seconds of ordering. The food is fast, fresh and full of different brilliant tastes that all compliment each other in the best of ways. Crock Spot, you have won my stomach&#39;s heart forever."

I wasn&#39;t sure when I would ever get the chance though, because they seem to never be around me, so you can imagine how excited I was to find them at the Pearl St Farmer&#39;s Market. I literally jumped up and down!!! I wasn&#39;t even hungry, but I didn&#39;t care. The hubs and I split a bowl of brown rice and pulled pork with chipolte sour cream sauce. My husband pretty much summed it up-&#34;this is @#*! delicious&#34;. The meat was so tender and juicy. The sauce was what took this dish over the top. I wanted to go back for seconds! 

The concept of the truck is fantastic, everything made up in good old crock pots, so there&#39;s essentially no waiting in line for food to be prepared. Being at the Justice League the night before, this was very welcoming, because the lines there were insane. The truck also has the ordering system, similar to that of Chipoltle. Choose your rice/lentils, meat/protien, then sauce. Quick, but not easy! Everything sounded so good, and there are so many ways to combine dishes. 

Crock Spot will be at Pearl St Farmer&#39;s Market every other Sunday. That means they will be there this weekend. And that means you know where you will find me! I am curious to try the curried lentils and chicken. Stay tumed for updates :)"

The filtered review about them refusing service at the bike ride is irritating. If the event organizers were no longer reimbursing the truck, why should they serve any more food? You&#39;re asking them to give it away for free. While this is no problem for big companies sponsoring the ride, it is a big deal for small businesses that simply can&#39;t afford it.

The hubs and I came for brunch this morning and walked away real happy.  We arrived just a touch after 11 and got a booth right away.  One thing that I love about Mexican restaurants is when the chips and salsa come out ASAP.  This was no exception.  The chips were light, delicate and warm.  When paired with the slightly spicy salsa it was a great intro.

They have a bottomless mimosa but I just wanted a single so I was able to order that but with guava juice.  Guava mimosas are the wave of the future my friends.  Absolutely sublime.  For my main, I got the huevos rancheros but smothered it in their famous green chili.  It is always a little dubious for me to hear that kind of a claim, especially with regards to green chili, but they delivered.  The black beans were perfect and the corn tortilla that was nestling the eggs and green chili was perfectly crispy.  There was a side of potatoes that had zero seasoning and maybe they were intended to mix into the dish that had plenty of seasoning.  Either way, I passed on those so I could eat all of my meal plus one of the house made flour tortillas.  

The hubs got the breakfast burrito which was also smothered in the green chili.  He was really happy with his dish and after he mixed in his potatoes to his green chili, there was a perfect balance of seasoning.  Service was fast and friendly!"

--------------



After reading reviews we decided to try this place out. What a great decision! Coming from Arkansas to Denver we always look forward to eating some great Mexican food, especially green chili (something they&#39;ve never heard of in Arkansas). La Loma did not disappoint! 

My wife and I split the choose three combination dinner ($18). We chose a tamale, shredded beef burrito, and shredded chicken chimichanga as our three options. The meal is served with rice and beans. 

The rice &amp; beans are some of the best we&#39;ve had anywhere across America. 

The tamale was bursting with shredded pork and the masa was flavorful. 

The chimichanga was perfectly fried, not greasy, and the shredded chicken in it was very mild. 

The shredded beef burrito is like eating a tender pot roast and laced with wonderful Mexican spices. 

All smothered with the best green chili we&#39;ve found in Denver! The heat level was just perfect for us. Just spicy enough to leave a nice sensation on the tongue but not too spicy to burn out your taste buds. 

I&#39;d come back again and again if I lived here!"

There&#39;s multiple dining areas here, which makes the place interesting.  I&#39;m thinking historically this place may have been a house at one point?  Either way, cute, older, cozy restaurant.  

There&#39;s so many choices in the menu, so it took me some time to figure out what I wanted.  We started off with some chips and salsa, margaritas, and some table side guacomole.  House margaritas were good.  The salsa had some kick to it.

I ordered the combo plate with a long piece of chicken flauta (that came in a separate place because it was so large), and chicken enchiladas smothered in their &#34;famous green chile&#34; along with rice and beans.  The portions were so huge, I wished I shared.  Nonetheless, the flavor was great.  The chicken in the chicken flauta had great flavor, and the chicken wasn&#39;t dry.  Extra crispy.  

For dessert, our group of 6 shared the fried ice cream.  Yes, it was big enough to feed 6 of us.  That was a great choice.  I would get the fried ice cream again.

I suggested to my dad to go to a restaurant in the highlands, which he hates because it&#39;s always busy and there&#39;s no parking, so he countered with a La Loma suggestion. I had never heard of it. When I pulled into the parking lot it seems apparent a lot of people had! 

First of this place is huge! It&#39;s like a house or something, big parking lot, but careful bottoming out when pulling in if you have a little car, I think all 3 of us who drove did. 

The menu is large and fairly priced. They also had a big brink selection and a 64 oz Margarita. I passed on the boozy selection (for real who can drink that much, I&#39;d be on the ground). Chips and salsa, no quac for us the price seemed a little unreasonable. 

We all order different plates that were similar. The food was fast and delicious. The fajitas also looked amazing! You cannot go wrong with green chili I think I could eat it all day. My only complaint is that or service was terrible. It seemed like our waiter was paying attention to every table except us - which wasn&#39;t hard because we were in the middle of the restaurant. He came back multiple times to clarify our other (just write it down - we don&#39;t care), didn&#39;t refresh waters or beverages, and completely forgot to bring ice tea to those who ordered it.

It is definitely Tex-Mex and I grew up in Texas so that&#39;s saying something! Their Cadillac margaritas are seriously delicious. We had a 12 oz. Then another. Then just got a pitcher!

Went here for a friend&#39;s birthday and he invited a bunch of people and they made reservations and were able to accommodate us all which was awesome! We were a little cramped in one part of the restaurant so the waiters kept hitting us when they were walking back and forth.

Our waiter was super awesome. I got the beef enchiladas and I wanted it with the enchilada sauce and green chili so he did half and half and it was DELICIOUS! Then I asked for double rice instead of refried beans since I&#39;m not a fan and I ate all that too. I must have been really hungry because I ate everything. HA!

We brought our own cake and they were very helpful. They refrigerated it for us and lit the candles and brought it out. Super cool. This place is super delicious and reminds me of Texas! So sad I didn&#39;t get to try the fresh made tortillas. Next time!

The atmosphere is super cute as well. It&#39;s 3 houses that they combined and made into a restaurant which is pretty sweet. I heard that they are going to be moving into downtown Denver so we will see how they are!"

Super crowded, but we had a reservation. There were 11 of us. The new digs are very nice, but certainly lacks the charm of the 26th Ave. location. The menu is quite a bit smaller, as is the restaurant itself.

I ordered the Mexico City Tacos. When they arrived, I was shocked at what was on the plate. Honestly, it didn&#39;t even occur to me until the next morning (the ordering/delivery of food was pretty slow, and with a lot of people at the table it was pretty chaotic) what the problem was. I had the tortillas, meat, avocado slice, beans and rice. That&#39;s it. ALL of the cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, lime, etc. was missing. That certainly would have helped this dish. While the meat was flavorful, it was a huge disappointment. If it had occurred to me then what was actually missing, I would have said something. I hope that they can iron out the kinks in their new location."

My biggest deal with this place is how TERRIBLE the bathrooms are! The toilets had problems, we&#39;re not clean, the toilet paper was not changed out and was left floating around the floor, not to mention the paper towels were flooding the garbage can and were on the floor around it.

We were seated almost immediately with a reservation, and everything we ordered was delivered quickly (with the exception of a margarita that was clearly forgotten about during a busy few moments with a large party). I had the shrimp fajitas, and they were good, but a little overpriced ($20). Chips and salsa were delicious, as were the drinks (beers, margs and a Paloma for dessert). The friends I was with ordered the fried ice cream and it was probably the most delicious thing I have ever eaten at a Mexican restaurant - however, it was the size of my head, and likely contained more than a day&#39;s worth of fat and calories.

For dinner we started with chips and salsa and added some guacamole. The guac was delicious with lots of fresh cilantro and lime. Good thin crispy chips were perfect with it. 

I ordered the shredded chicken enchiladas with verde sauce. It was really flavorful and had a nice spice. If you aren&#39;t big on spicy, you might shy away from this dish.

We were sat immediately on a Saturday afternoon during brunch. I had a hard time ordering because everything sounded amazing. Our waitress was very helpful after I told her it was our first time there. She brought us a fresh flour tortilla with samples of green chile, red chile, and enchilada sauce. It was awesome to get to taste these before we ordered. I ended up going with the Carne Guisada and it was delicious! My girlfriend got the beef burrito. Keep in mind that the burrito is actually two smothered burritos with meat on the inside and the rice/beans on the side.

They also have $12 bottomless mimosas Saturdays and Sundays with a delicious juice bar consisting of grapefruit, guava, mango, orange, and peach. I recommend the Peach/Mango combo!

Steak fajitas were not good. The tortillas they serve with are amazing; soft, fresh and local made. The meat was way tough and Rhee was a huge pile of onions with it. Mist importantly, the meat was tough and chewy. 
Pork shoulder fajitas were the same. Amazing flour tortillas but very tough meat. It is supposed to be braised and tender, but if it was, it was braised about two hours short of what was needed.

We were all saving ourselves for this dinner, and I think it&#39;s fair to say we weren&#39;t disappointed.

I started off with a Patron Tequila-based Margarita ... always on the rocks with salt. It was really good. I got the 28-ounce version, but they have a smaller 12-ounce version and a much larger 64-ounce version. 

It certainly worked its magic. I felt relaxed and in a joyful mood midway through the drink. The conversation flowed.

I read on Yelp that the green chili was often referred to in the highlights section, and so that&#39;s what I ordered. It was pretty good and came with warm tortillas. The waiter, who was very friendly, offered more tortillas. He did an admirable job of taking care of us.

We ordered churros for dessert. Very good as always. That&#39;s my staple whenever I see it on the dessert menu. Ours arrived warm and toasty, with a chocolate dipping sauce. 

Oddly enough, and I&#39;m not sure why, but a Dos Equis dark beer goes perfectly with an order of churros. I can&#39;t quite put my finger on why this is the case.

How large you might ask? Well up to 64 oz. The margs here are tasty, not too sweet or sour. Definitely get one of the margaritas here! For food try the stuffed sopapilla with green chile. The green chile here might be my new favorite place for green chile in Denver. 

We came on a Friday night expecting a wait and were seated right away. The food was delicious and the margs were incredible! This is a must try to anyone who lives or is visiting Denver."

I love me some Mexican food. But my Mexican bar is set super high. I&#39;m from Las Vegas. We have AMAZING Mexican food there. So every Mexican restaurant I go to, I always compare to some of the best places there.

Getting to the location isn&#39;t bad at all. It&#39;s in a nice spot on top of a hill in the Highlands neighborhood. It reminds me of some of the old Mexican spots I went to back home. It has that cantina/family kind of feel when you walk in. The bar area is huge.

The hostess, who wasn&#39;t as on as the rest of the staff there, seated me with my party. They had gotten there a little bit before me. I loved how open the space is for dinning. As I looked around, there was outside seating and it looks like 2 huge rooms for regular guests and a private party room as well. All of these were separated. 

Our server was working our table double with another server, so I can&#39;t quite remember his name. Both gentlemen were very friendly and knowledgeable. I ended up getting the SMALL Cadillac margarita. It was delicious, and just how I like a margarita. 

Me friend ordered the Papaya margarita I believe. She was given the Prickly pear margarita instead. Even though it was a mistake, she said it was fine and she actually preferred the latter. They are very generous on the chips and salsa. I&#39;m sure I ate a whole bowl of chips and salsa myself. 

I really wanted the enchiladas but I was trying to cut back on my dairy intake. A sista&#39;s digestive system is on the fritz right now. I settled for the fajitas. I knew it would be too much food but I wanted leftovers for lunch at work tomorrow. 

I ordered the mixed meat fajitas that came with chicken, steak, and shrimp. There is NOTHING like the sound of your food coming out on a hot skillet and smoking up the whole restaurant. It was great. The vegetables I didn&#39;t care too much for. I didn&#39;t like how they sautéed the onions. But everything else was good. The steak was cooked great and the chicken wasn&#39;t dry. My favorite was the shrimp. They were HUGE and very flavorful. Next time I may just order shrimp fajitas completely. 

My friends ordered the Quesadilla and a 3 taco plate. They said their meal was delicious. One of them is a chef and if he enjoyed it, I know it was good. I also noticed that they offer tailgating and bussing over to Sports Authority field for Broncos games. What a great idea. I would love to attend that one time. 

I really enjoyed my meal there and I can&#39;t wait to go back."

We chose to do bottomless mimosas because they had a juice station where you could mix whatever juice you want with your mimosas!! What a clever idea. There were at least 6 or 7 different juices... grapefruit.. pineapple.. orange.. guava.. strawberry...  etc etc. It was fun mixing different juices together :) 

Instead of having brunch food, my friend and I decided to have the fajitas for two. It was of course DELICIOUS. Their tortilla is almost like pita bread.. which I loved. :) Everything was savory and cooked to perfection. 

The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it&#39;s a little too pricey.. my friend and I paid $45 each for brunch on a saturday afternoon LOL. oopsie.. didn&#39;t mean to do that. I don&#39;t mind paying that much for dinner.. but definitely not a brunch budget. 

I also tried their green chili on a different night, and OH MY... definitely one of the bests. :) 

I would definitely come back for dinner.. I know they get really busy around dinner time though. I came here around 7:30 on a Friday night once and the wait was like an hour... definitely passing on that. So try to avoid the weekend dinner traffic!"

Definitely Tex-Mex, which I am A-OK with.  I came here on a Thursday night around 8 pm.  It wasn&#39;t too busy and we were seated immediately.  

We started with queso, guacamole, and margaritas.  Margaritas are massive and pack a punch.  One was all I needed.  The queso wasn&#39;t my favorite, but I still ate a ridiculous amount of it.  The guacamole was decent. I likely wouldn&#39;t order it again since they give you so much on the side with the fajitas. 

Speaking of fajitas, this is where La Loma really excels.  Fajitas are typically my go-to at Tex-Mex joints, so I believe I am a harsh critic when it comes to them.  Luckily, La Loma produced delicious ones (hence the 4 star rating). Quite pricey at $18, but these are high quality fajitas and the serving is huge.  You can definitely share the regular order instead of getting the order for two people.  The steak was cooked perfectly. The fajitas also come with a great assortment of sauteed peppers and onions.  I loved that there were even some spicy sauteed jalapenos in the mix.  The tortillas were super fresh and made in-house.  They give you so much stuff on the side that is it almost ridiculous.  I could not believe how many leftovers I had.  

I can&#39;t really attest to how good any other items since I only tried the fajitas.  If you are looking for some high quality fajitas and strong margaritas, this is your place!"

For dinner there was a mixture of tacos, flautas, soups and tostadas, there weren&#39;t any complaints in this round either, we were even brought another bowl of the green chili salsa with there handmade tortillas on the house!

Drinks were plentiful, and not too sweet.

For the main course we had the mixed grill fajitas for two, guacamole, queso, and various desserts. The guacamole was good. Chips were perfect. Queso was a little too runny and not much flavor to it. 

The mixed grill fajitas were great. The chicken and steak were prepared well and quite flavorful. The shrimp were outstanding. They were large, perfectly seasoned and cooked. The tortillas were truly a surprising delight. 

The desserts were great as well. 

One negative is the table location we had. It was right by the tortilla machine and in a busy travel corridor. Several times as waiters whisked sizzling fajitas to other tables I felt splatter hit me. This fact alone lowered my rating. 

I&#39;d certainly recommend this place to others and I&#39;d go back."

We went early and they were not busy yet for the lunch rush,, but the food was a bit on the cool side. I did the combo plate and the meat on the tostada was cold and the green chili was cool, but still very tasty. I think they were having new location issues. I thought the décor was nice, but I miss the tortilla making machine. What I do no Is, now you have to pay for parking and down where they are located, it is not cheep!!!! So you need to add that additional expense onto your meal ticket.  I hope the other location that they talk of, does not have the parking expense. I don&#39;t think I will go back to this location. They may think in the future of stamping something so your parking is free. This location is great if you live or work downtown and I hope they can pull enough from that. I guess conventions, ball games, may sustain the new move. Just was a bit disappointed and I was never disappointed with La Loma&#39;s. I wish them good luck."

I saw good reviews for La Loma both on Open Table and here on Yelp, so I decided it was worth a try.

The first good thing to know about this place is they have their own private lot and it&#39;s pretty sizable, so unlike a lot of places in the Highlands, parking isn&#39;t a concern.

We went in at 5 on a Saturday evening and the place was already packed-but getting our table was incredibly seamless. We let the hostess know we had a reservation and right away someone took us to our table, a nice booth by the window.

The drink list is really good-it has everything from classic Mexican beers to margaritas, mojitos, and Mexican mules. I had a Dos Equis amber from draft, and my fiancee had their house margarita, which was very tasty.

Their chips and salsa to start are great-the chips are amazing, and the salsa has just the right kick to it. For food, we both had burritos, both smothered with green chile-she had shredded chicken, I had bean and cheese. We both loved ours and had the whole thing, including the delicious Mexican rice and refried beans on the side.

The food came out crazy fast-about 15 minutes after ordering, and was hot and fresh. Our server was very friendly, and checked in with us the perfect amount of times.

The service here is awesome and it&#39;s great to know there is a nice sit down Mexican place in town that really cares about their quality all around. Thank you La Loma!"

I know La Loma has been around for many years and maintains its reputation for amazing green chili... But the food nowadays really leaves something to be desired. All of the food is either under-seasoned or resembles &#34;food&#34; from Taco Bell. I wouldn&#39;t say the food is horrible, but nothing I&#39;d go out of my way to return for. There is absolutely nothing special about this restaurant anymore and I am baffled at how busy it is. 

The drinks are decent, the homemade tortillas are awesome, and the desserts are actually great. 

The staff is also crap. They either ignore you or seem bothered to be serving you, every time. 

Overall, La Loma is overhyped anymore and I can assure you there are many more Mexican food restaurants in Denver that will leave you feeling satisfied."

Went for happy hour today and we were promptly greeted by our super nice server Adam and some of the tastiest chips/salsa I&#39;ve ever had. Ordered some wine and a peach frozen margarita. After a few minutes Adam came back to take our order. We got the sarapes, finger rellenos, tacos dorado, and happy hour combo. 

Our order came out in less than ten minutes! Woohoo. This restaurant is on their happy hour &#34;A Game&#34;.

Everything was delicious. Great service throughout dinner! Will be back, all the time.

As a native who also lived a handful of blocks away for a period of time, I should probably be ashamed.  But I wasn&#39;t.  I assumed La Loma was one of those institutions that&#39;s been around forever but is really not that great (like The Broker or Casa Bonita).  Imagine my (pleasant) surprise when I realized I&#39;ve been missing out.

I came in on a Friday for lunch with a group of coworkers.  Luckily we got there right at 11:30 as it appeared if you arrived at 11:30, you were stuck in a line stretching outside of the building.  The interior is much nicer than I envisioned with a cozy fireplace.  We ordered a round of small house margaritas and they were pretty decent.  The chips and salsa were tasty as well.  The chips were freshly fried and still warm and the salsa had just a little heat and lots of oregano.

But after sampling many a chili relleno in this town, I think La Loma has the best.  The perfect marriage of the Denver style eggroll wrapper relleno and New Mexico style battered and fried chili.  This one had a super crispy exterior and lots of good cheddar cheese.  The green chile has pork, but the enchilada sauce made a delightful substitute.  I thought the fluffy Spanish rice was also some of the best in Denver and not just treated as an afterthought.

Luckily, the boss picked up lunch so I can&#39;t speak to the prices, but that was always a deterrent for me when checking out the menu - but that was when I was under the impression that the food was average Mexican fare.  But since it&#39;s above average, I feel the prices are warranted.  Maybe not so much for the margs.

Glad I finally made it in to this Denver institution!"

I loved the patio, my company thought there were too many bugs... Inside was pretty nice though.  Small cafe spot feel but a bit larger.  We only waited about 5 minutes to get a table.  

Service was good.  Prompt, polite and attentive.  
Drinks seemed a little light handed... But maybe it&#39;s just me.  Food was tasty as always but I feel the quality and quantity is a little better on 13th.  

It&#39;s pretty much the same menu, and recipes.  Lacks the warmth and charm... Really more of a 3.5 but 4 because it is really tasty and close to home."

The best part of our brunch was their hilarious menu. Maybe ask to keep one at the table to read while you wait for your order for a chuckle. 

Had to try the cinnamon roll, since it was mentioned so many times in previous reviews. Pretty good, but I felt like it could have used about 50% more cinnamon. Would it be weird to ask for some on the side next time? ;o)

Service was friendly, but inattentive. Only one offer for a coffee refill, but I passed because my cup was still half full, and then it was never offered again. Water wasn&#39;t offered or brought, and despite several attempts to catch our waitress&#39; attention, I was never able to ask for some. 

Husband got the Avon scramble, and liked it. I thought it was small in size, which actually translates to normal serving size vs. ginormous restaurant proportions. Just be warned. 

I had the Frittata, which was nothing like a normal one, but accurately described as having a Mexican twist. Did not enjoy this at all. Packed full of raw onions and way too many chives. Also could have used some diced tomatoes in my opinion. I couldn&#39;t eat even half of it. Side of potatoes looked completely unappetizing, and were left untouched. 

I&#39;m starting to have philosophical trouble with people just being passive-aggressive on Yelp!, so I&#39;m trying to be more &#34;human&#34; and focus on personal relationships. When the waitress finally came to give us our bill, I mentioned that there were far too many raw onions and it was not good. Her response was a flat, &#34;ohhh?&#34;. So I tried, she failed, and here&#39;s my review. 

Outside patio looked nice."

I&#39;ve lived by here for several years now &amp; have only now recently ventured into this breakfast joint! Their menu is pretty expansive &amp; includes sandwiches, omelettes, scrambles, waffles &amp; French Toast. I tried the Golden Triangle sandwich with bacon, smoked turkey breast, tomato &amp; cheddar cheese that came with a side of swirly pasta salad that had olives, onion &amp; a sour vinegary dressing.  Adding avocado is 55 cents more. The portion size was enough for two breakfasts for me. Their house coffee is very good. I would definitely come here again. I liked it more than Denny&#39;s. They don&#39;t have a lot of pancake options like IHOP though."

I like independent places and this one has been here a long time.  That being said, I found much room for improvement.  The menu is really confusing to read as they have all these odd names for their dishes.  On one page they tell you that they include menu items from other restaurants!  They say the DEVIL made them do it (the DEVIL being letters made from names of the places they ripped off the recipe)  Odd...  I was also struck that they have 3 &#34;benedict&#34; dishes on the menu but none is an eggs benedict, just strange variations.

After digging through the menu I found that they make their own corned beef hash!  I love a good hash.  It comes with two eggs and the menu doesn&#39;t say it but it comes with choice of toast too.  I wish the menu had mentioned it was served as a skillet.  It arrived as a pile of fried potatoes topped over by corned beef with fried eggs on top, the toast balanced on the handle.  The corned beef tasted great but the dish was overwhelmed by the amount of fried potatoes under it. It would have been better if they cooked the potatoes with the meat.  
My guest had a Lookout Mountain omelet which was huge and was stuffed with ham, they also come with toast though the menu does not say.  

The staff seemed out of steam, not overly energized and actually seemed kinda indifferent.  I watched 3 bus girls standing waiting for people to leave but my coffee empty.  The server only checked back to drop off the check without us asking for it.  I had considered one of their &#34;famous&#34; cinnamon rolls but changed my mind partially based on another Yelp review that said they taste microwaved and sealed by the early check drop.  

I really want this place to pick it up because they have no real close competition, but the price tag is high for a tired menu."

Let&#39;s start with what&#39;s not appealing...the entire outside of the restaurant!  I almost passed again because of how shabby the outside looks.  The parking lot is all cracked and needs to be repaved, trees are over grown and need to be trimmed, the patio and its white picket fence need a lot of TLC and are certainly NOT inviting...at all, and the entire place needs a pain job...

Apart from all of that, I went inside...different story inside, it&#39;s cute and charming and clean!  I was waited on immediately, the menu is robust and I was hungry, so it was hard to choose.  The coffee was a good dark roast, served with cream and hit the spot!  I can&#39;t brag about the food as I just had eggs, toast and potatoes, so nothing exciting, pretty basic, but Dozens did it well!  My eggs were perfectly cooked, the country potatoes were super yummy and the sourdough bread was a thick slice and perfect for dipping in my egg yolks.  Everything was cooked well and the coffee was awesome, very fresh and inviting, the entire menu!  I will be back for sure!  

Dozens, spend some money on maintaining the outside of this super cute restaurant, it needs some TLC."

The service has always been just passable. Get &#39;er done. No smiles. Meh.

The have a new menu and the food is now overpriced. Plus, they nickle-and-dime you with upcharges for everything. For example, if you order an omelet, it comes with mushy potatoes and bread. If you want something better, like fruit or vegetables, it&#39;s $3! It&#39;s just so...classless, especially if you are already paying $12 for an omelet! Coffee is ridiculously overpriced, too. If I&#39;m to pay Starbucks prices, I want Starbucks coffee. The food is slightly better than alright, if you know how to order it. The coffee is what I can only refer to as &#34;diner&#34; style.

The atmosphere is outdated and divey. Used to have a nice patio. The patio is now not worth it. Crappy little wobbly plastic chairs. They are so bad they posted signs all over saying they have a weight limit and not to rock in them. You know what? Get real chairs!

Honestly, for a $15 omelet, I&#39;d rather go to Snooze."

I live nearby and have driven by it many times, but never thought to try it until I read the Yelp reviews. It would always pop up as a nearby breakfast/brunch spot so I thought I&#39;d give it a try.

Treated my mom and boyfriend to Sunday brunch; food was just OK. My mom ordered the Imagine A Great Omelette, which is their version of the Denver Omelette (green pepper, onion, mushrooms, ham, and swiss cheese). It was your average omelette but pricier. I had a hard time finding omelette options with meat and ended up ordering the Northsider (that included sausage) but it was just doused with tomatoes. I had to pick some of the tomatoes out because it was overpowering. I ended up with an extra &#39;side of tomatoes&#39; from the pile I made. 

For the omelettes, there is an option for half size that says it&#39;s the same portion as other breakfast spots (like Denny&#39;s, Village Inn, IHOP), so it&#39;s a little cheaper. But to me, the portions here didn&#39;t seem much bigger than the usual -- since I ate it all! Hah! I&#39;m just a sucker for breakfast foods/brunch spots. My boyfriend ordered The Stock Show, and together for three omelettes and three waters, I spent $55 on breakfast. Ahh! Not what I expected.

I do like the neighborhood cozy feel of the place though! And the menu is cute with fun, sassy descriptions. It feels like your at home in mom&#39;s kitchen. But it ends with a slap in the face when mom charges you $50+ for your egg breakfast!"

To start, we arrived on a Saturday morning and were placed on a list. No time given for how long they thought it would take to be seated. No greeting. Just took my name. Ok...

We waiting about 15 minutes, no big deal. Our name was called and we were directed to our table. Not one word was spoken to us, even when we said thanks. Ignored us and turned around. 

Lastly, we waited about another ten minutes for someone, anyone, to approach our table. One server walked by in the ten minutes we waited. She just dropped a ticket at another table, again zero communication... Not even to the table she was giving the check. 

After she walked by and I saw nobody else on the floor, we called it and left.

Each serving was more than expected.  The quality of the ingredients used is FRESH! For once, I was able to get fresh jalapeños in my omelette.  No random canned food here!  Try the green chili, not much spice but very flavorful for the old folks with sensitive GI problems.
