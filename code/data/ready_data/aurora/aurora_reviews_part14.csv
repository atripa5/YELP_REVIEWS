We were looking for a place to hang out with a group of friends that wasn&#39;t too a) crowded and b) loud (we wanted to talk, not shout over super ear-splitting music).  We came upon this place and it was oddly empty for a Friday night, but we took advantage of it and claimed a spot on the patio.

We worked our way down the infused vodka list, some were great, some were terrrrrrible.  Service was very attentive.  The DJ was awesome - great music to dance to once we got the inkling, and he even played the ENTIRE Star Wars Cantina song for us.  

Still not sure what&#39;s up with how dead it was, but here&#39;s my 4 stars to hope it gets more patronage, it made my last night in Denver super fun!"

It would be a great date spot I suppose, but for a single person or 2 buddies it was rather pointless to pay for food/drinks basically by yourself.

The infused vodka shots were great, and the bison grass vodka drinks interesting (and strong).  Food seemed solid as well.

I suppose part of the problem is the popularity of the close by front porch, they always seem slammed.  Maybe do something to drag some of the patrons over?"

The music was blasting. We stood and waited for a while before someone acknowledged we were there. They only served pierogis when we went which is fine because that&#39;s what we were there for.

We had 2 of the pierogi sampler with a side of mushroom sauce. They were pretty good except you don&#39;t know which kind you got until you eat it. I had one too many sauerkraut pierogis when I wanted the beef pierogi. They could have plated them better."

This isn&#39;t your typical flavored vodka - THIS tastes exactly like what it&#39;s infused with. Coconut, jalapeño, horseradish, black pepper...it&#39;s difficult to articulate how potent the flavor is in the vodka or just how smooth this stuff is. Incredible!!

A great group of us ended up at the bar and we had a blast with Sarah at the helm. I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t make mention of the pirogies. Holy smokes - they are amazeballs!!! I recommend sharing a sample platter if you have a few people...that&#39;s the stuff right there."

I like the atmosphere of this bar and it wasn&#39;t too crowded unlike the pubs; however, there was only one server who was also the bartender. So she was quite busy with guests at the bar and in the booths. 

With only one server, we waited for more than 30 minutes for our food. Once our food arrived, it did not disappoint. We had the polish feast, which was the sampler platter that included a stuffed cabbage, 5 pierogies, a grilled kielbasa, a schnitzel with mushroom sauce, sauerkraut, beets and cucumber dill salad.

The ambiance is that of a night club.  I asked my wife if this was a night club that served food or a restaurant.   Once the food arrived it became apparent that it is a bar 1st and the quality of food is their last concern.
The pierogies are from Pierogi Factory, they do not make their own.  In fact I do not think they make their own anything.  The pierogi sandwich is on a burger bun straight from the grocery store; soft, and sugary.  With burger dressings, all over kind of bland.  It came with fries, they are obviously straight from the freezer to the frier.
My wife got the borsch, which tastes like nothing more than chicken broth with some beet juice added.  She also got the salmon sandwich, her sandwich did not come on a bun (confused)... not that it mattered, the buns are no good. 
Any foodie will be able to tell that nothing was fresh,  It was not hard to tell that the salmon was frozen, everything was frozen.

Being in a car for so long can make you go insane. Two hours and $110 later, I finally stepped into my hotel room and quickly searched for &#34;bar&#34; on my handy Yelp app. Polished Tavern populated as one of the top results, so off to Polished Tavern, we went!

I&#39;ve gotten down at a few Polish pubs in my day, but none like this one on 15th and Lawrence. Overall, (with Yoda voice) traditional, it is not. 

Does this pub have an identity crisis? Possibly. To be honest, upon stepping in, I thought Milwaukee&#39;s Finest and I rolled into some secret European club. Why? Well, for one, they have LED lights hung about errwhere. And by errwhere, I mean underneath the main bar, high top tables, and the shelves where the bottles of liquor sat. 

Secondly, there&#39;s a lounge to the right of the entrance with several Ikea lights hung about. That alone is pretty interesting for a pub!

Perhaps the greatest surprise, though, were the rectangular cutouts in each high top filled with ice. (Ice!) I guess it&#39;s convenient to keep my beer cool... I&#39;ve never seen this anywhere.

So yeah, it&#39;s not a traditional pub. 

Regarding their drinks, they have a decent local beer selection, and too bad I didn&#39;t have dinner plans because I definitely would have tried some of their pierogies and infused vodkas. I needed a beer, though, and bought one of their local ales (which was great). Nonetheless, as far as straight up chillin&#39;, this place is A-OK.

*Kind critique: I think some of the chairs for the high-tops could be replaced. I thought I was going to break one of them."

Neither of us took our coats off. I get it, chilled vodka, but the atmosphere was cold and sterile already. We shared the sampler platter and I also ordered a burger. The platter was good, especially the sausages and the cabbage rolls, and was so large that I had to take my burger home. The pierogies were less flavorful than I expected (and not made in-house, per the menu). My burger was served dry with no condiments (have never understood this) and was overcooked and dry inside to boot. The fries were terrible, of the frozen and entirely unseasoned variety. Our waitress was friendly but it took her so long to check on us, we didn&#39;t order another round of drinks because we had finished eating, though we both wanted another drink mid-meal.

I went here before Evita and had the pleasure of meeting up with some other Yelpers. I love it when that happens! I was able to sample a variety of delicious pierogis off of the happy hour menu. I believe there were three varieties that consisted of some kind of cheese mix, potato and meat. I&#39;m not sure I could pick a favorite, and for the price why not try them all! I followed up the apps with a burger. It was absolutely delicious! I posted a picture so people could see how perfectly pink it was. It definitely helped keep the vodka in check!

Speaking of my favorite drink...I tried a pear infused vodka with soda, which was delicious, as well as a bloody Mary. They make their bloody&#39;s with different kinds of infused vodkas, such as dill and horseradish. My only request would be that they had more of a &#34;salad&#34; on top.

That being said, it was hard to figure out where to sit to eat dinner. There were lots of bar stools (not good for my knees), some low trendy couches (ok for my knees, but likely to end up most of the meal in my lap) and then a few dining tables. After perching on the couches for 10 minutes, we were finally approached and told we were welcome to sit at the tables for our meal - thank goodness!

There was only one server (and a bartender) on for the night - she was amazing, but service was fairly slow, given that she was having to take orders, run food, check on tables, clear tables, drop checks, pick up checks, return checks, refill drinks, etc. Two other people who seemed to work there appeared to be off duty, just sitting at the bar, which made it more odd. However, she was so kind, helpful around things like vegetarian questions, and made us feel very welcome, despite our empty iced teas.

Everything we put in our mouth was delicious. The appetizer of fried pierogis? YES. My partner&#39;s pierogi sandwich (that IS a thing)? Amazing. My legit (and vegetarian!) hot borcht? Nothing like Manichevitz - this was the real deal. Most importantly, my giant platter of spinach, potato/cheese and mushroom/sauerkraut pierogis? LIFE CHANGING. We were so full, but so worth it...as were the dessert pierogis we took home to try the next day. All of the things were fantastic and we&#39;d get them again (though in small quantities) any time, any day...preferably when they have a few more staff.

The only real downside? Trying to find parking downtown - ugh!"

When we were walking up to the Polished Tavern, it looked like your typical bar with your typical, average bar food. When we walked in we were immediately seated. It was great! The interior decor is so trendy and modern. It is a great atmosphere. I am so glad we went here because the food was excellent!! Our server was very attentive and helpful when ordering-- because we are not familiar with polish cuisine. We ordered the Sampler Plate and Cajun Mac N Cheese. The Sampler plate was bomb and the Cajun Mac N Cheese was super creamy and delicious. It turned out to be a ton of food but it was sooo good.
We were surprised the place did not have more customers; but the food and service were great. We will definitely be going back!"

We arrived at about 9:56 and unbeknownst to us, the kitchen was set to close at 10pm. We were ravenous and had not had any dinner. We were about to leave to find somewhere to grab some food when the waitress came rushing back to the table, stating that she had asked the kitchen to stay open for us. We were so pleased and surprised by this! We then had some food (pierogies, kielbasa, burger, sandwich, all a bit lacking in seasoning but decent) and I tasted the peach and cinnamon infused vodkas, which were AMAZING. The service was wonderful and we will definitely be coming back, especially for the vodka. They have so many different flavors to try!"

Being half Polish...how could I not love this place!? I might be biased...but I really loved the Polish theme. Not something you see all of the time. Love that they carried a bunch of Polish beers, including Zywiec and many Polish vodkas.

The interior was trendy, beautiful, modern and was a really cool place to hang out for a while. It&#39;s a lounge style atmosphere and the ambiance makes me feel like it could fit in anywhere in NYC. Love the sleek and loungey atmosphere! Can I please get to the highlight of this review...THE INFUSED VODKAS! So many to choose from, and they go down so smooth! You can even mix flavors! We did banana and cinnamon which was AMAZING. I would seriously fly here just to drink that combination. Tasted like the real thing for sure, was very flavorful, but without being overwhelming. Was cool to see flavors like black pepper, horseradish, habanero, and garlic which would probably be awesome in a Bloody Mary or as a shot. You can get pitchers or carafes of the infused vodkas which is cool. I had a chance to look at the Bottle Service menus for kicks and giggles. Bottle service anywhere is a stupid concept to me, but the low low prices of $140 to $200 was incredible considering the same thing in NY would be 500 dollars! BEYOND upset that I didn&#39;t get to try any of the food, but the local crowd I was with said everything is amazing. Bartenders were great and easy to have a conversation with. 

Deducting one star because besides five other people, we were the only ones in there. It was a Friday night, so I&#39;m not sure why this was. This place seems like a really happening spot, expected there to be more of a crowd. 

Overall, I REALLY was impressed by this place. Cannot wait to come back here on my next trip to Denver!"

Decor is a nightclub-ish meets ice skating rink.  No, not an Ice Bar like Vegas or Dublin has, but it&#39;s made to look like one with big, no wait, HUGE snowflakes hung from the ceiling and rows of ice at every table.  Something you don&#39;t normally see at the Happy Hour at Chili&#39;s is the Yelp check-in special -- buy 1 order of pierogi, and get the second order free.  When I say drew &#34;me&#34; in, I mean drew ONLY &#34;me&#34; in.  A nice looking place, very trendy, but totally empty with only 1 diner (me) at a table, and 1 drinker at the bar.  While pierogi&#39;s most always make me smile, a place where I can only hear my own breath doesn&#39;t quite make a happening place at a Happy Hour.  Therefore, a traditional happy dance was not warranted.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnmy7wyXCJI

Back to the piergoi:  I love love love any 2 for 1 idea - but can filled dough be any near as good as my grandma&#39;s?  After all, my Oma gave them all to me for free...not just 6, and a full bag of them to take home.  Well, I after eating 1 or 2 of each kind, I sent it my plates back.  The dough was not cooked well enough, and it tasted like flour-flavored gum.  Not good.  Within 10-15 mins, a whole new order was brought to me.  Better, but still not great.  I had 1 plate of potato, and the other of meat.  With sour cream on the side, it was topped with green and red pepper, and onions.  The peppers made it a nice presentation, but flavor-wise, it&#39;s not traditional and the onions should also be browned a whole lot more -- if caramelized, even better.  Insides of both are fine, but not amazing.

The menu is not expansive so you won&#39;t be able to have a full Polish feast.  All in all, I was not overly enthused about my experience to the Polished Tavern, even though I drank a nice Polish beer, Żywiec, and acted as if I rented out the entire place for a party of one.  Overall, I&#39;d rate it under 3.0 stars (2.75), but at night...I could see this as a high 3-4. 

If I ever return to the Polished Tavern in present-tense, I&#39;d do it right and forego the happy hour, and arrive late with my own peeps.  We&#39;d drink the night away with one of their many types of flavored and infused vodkas, or specialty cocktails.  być szczęśliwym i żyć w pełni"

The atmosphere is trendy and relaxed and not extremely crowded because the place is pretty spacious with an outdoor patio that unfortunately it was raining so we didn&#39;t get to take advantage of.  The prices were also great, even for bottle service, there is ice inset in trays at each table where they put your drinks and bottles to keep them nice and cold too.

There were two other gentleman there and they left so it was just me. The bartender was really nice enjoy talking with her about Poland. I also enjoyed their selection of beers. They had a lot of Polish beers and even some German beers. Their menu looked very interesting and I settled on the Polish Snitzel on the recommendations of the bartender. I thought it was fantastic! I just wish there would have have been more of the cucumber dill salad on the side. I hope to make it back do this little restaurant before I leave Denver.

It sounds weird but you have to try it. There are about 15 different flavors and you can even mix 2 together. I then ordered a chocolate espresso martini and my boyfriend got a Moscow mule. Both were fantastic. On to the pierogis, we ordered the sautéed kind and got a mix of the potato and the meat. Both were so delicious, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. My boyfriend ordered the schnitzel and it was crispy but tender on the inside with this amazing sauce. I had the cabbage with rice and meat and it was equally as good.

We took our time reviewing the Martini menu and all the infused vodka&#39;s they offer.  Wow, the list is infinite.  

I had three martini&#39;s on this first visit, yes that&#39;s right I counted.  I think this is as high as I count (making sure not to embarrass myself).  My favorite of the evening was the Orange Sin Martini with both orange and cinnamon vodka.  This one was smooth and sensational.  I had tow others that weren&#39;t as memorable.

I&#39;m not liking the fact that their HH Menu is not on their website nor is their very extensive drink list.  Why not guys?

We also shared a few appetizers.  The pierogi&#39;s are 2 for 1 on HH and we tried the Chef&#39;s Special, sweet potato and jalapeno, this one definitely kicked you in the pants.  The other one was more traditional and very tasty.  You can definitely tell they are home made and very authentic here.  We also tried the Zapiekanka which has, sautéed onions and mushrooms served over a French baguette with melted mozzarella cheese and topped Cezary`s secret sauce.  This was very tasty as well and great depth of flavor.  I would order that again, best to share since this is a bit heavy.  

The hip and trendy vibe on the inside is great.  Our waitress was sweet and gave out great drink recommendations.  HH prices are good and they also have a great patio to use when the weather is nice that I may just take advantage of.  

If vodka is your drink of choice, what is taking you so long?  Grab a drink or three and try some bad ass infused vodka&#39;s."

Going on to to the review, I wanted to try a new cuisine while I was in Denver so I ended up coming here. The waitress was very helpful and highly recommended the Polish sampler for anyone who is new to Polish cuisine, like myself. For 20 bucks, this dish was worth it; you get Poland on a plate and is delicious. I also came in during happy hour and pricewise, no one can beat the $2 infused vodka shots. Definitely beats paying 6 to 8 dollars a shot.

I would definitely come back if I ever visit Denver in the near future."

Horseradish-infused vodka shots with a pickle chaser.  Jalepeno vodka is good too.

Pierogies - all excellent, but the sauerkraut ones are the best.

The meatballs are my favorite entree (can&#39;t remember what they&#39;re called in Polish).  They are SO GOOD, I have to find out how they make them - I don&#39;t even like meatballs!  

One thing I would not recommend is the borscht soup.  I usually really like borscht but instead of being full of cabbage and beets, it was just beet broth.  Not what I was expecting."

Night 1:
I came with a Groupon and tried the pierogi  (Polish dumplings) platter ($15) which features three kinds if pierogi: 
1. feta &amp; spinach
2. sauerkraut &amp; mushroom
3. savory meat

They all tasted pretty heavy/dense to me but were beautifully presented and were pretty filling. I haven&#39;t had pierogi too often so I do not know if that texture/density is common for that dish. I also tried the poppy seed cake dessert for $4 which did not taste like poppy seeds at all and did not seem the freshest. It was supposed to have walnuts and raisins in it but I didn&#39;t even sense that those ingredients were in there. It had a chocolate sauce on it that tasted artificial and did not pair well with the cake. I also tried the kielbasa sandwich which comes with sausage, caramelized onion, sauerkraut and a salad. I enjoyed the salad very much and the sandwich was a 6.5/10. It wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t something I would crave again. It was happy hour when I came (HH: daily 4-7PM) but you can&#39;t use the Groupon on happy hour items. Their happy hour menu includes infused vodka shots for $3, well drinks for $3, and 2 for 1 pierogis. Sundays-Thursdays 10PM-closing they offer 2 for 1 infused vodkas. I tried some cucumber vodka with lemonade as well as a mango vodka. The cucumber vodka was tasty but the mango wasn&#39;t as good. There are a LOT of vodka flavoring options and you can essentially mix it with whatever you like. 

Night 2:
I tried the onion rings, nachos, pierogi platter again and a cranberry vodka. The onion rings and nachos were alright. 

This place has a lounge-feel with contemporary furnishings and decor. There&#39;s high-stool areas with tables that surround an ice pit which I thought was pretty neat. Both times I was there it seemed like there was only one man (possibly the owner or co-owner) was running the entire place (at least in the front, I am sure there were chefs out back). The same guy was host, taking orders, bartending and serving the food."
polished-tavern-denver,Frank G.,6Qa2zOaT7XLeuAShppYrXQ,"Mililani, HI",1,1,0,10,79,mKc4aunl2J4VY4jCOsRcsA,5.0,2014-05-27,"I am half-Polish by descent but I have never been to a Polish restaurant.  I have lived for most of my life in Hawaii and, beyond French and German, European food is not generally very well represented.  Anyway, I stumbled on a Groupon for The Polished Tavern and purchased it so that my family could try it while visiting Denver.  When we got there, my wife and kids were a little put-off.  My wife thought it was too upscale for the kids.  My kids were really hesitant about the menu items.  However, I know that just about everyone in the family loves pierogis (Polish ravioli).  Also, I saw that they had schnitzel on the menu and pork cutlets is another favorite in the family.

The family attitude changed very quickly.  We had a very nice, friendly Polish waitress.  She made us all feel welcome.  I ordered a Polish beer (Lomza) and my wife ordered an Apple Martini.  I loved the beer and my wife was surprised to find that her martini was one of the best she ever had.  A really nice touch was that the center of our table was an ice trough.  You could put your drinks in it to keep them icy cold the whole time.

We started with potato pancakes and shrimp scampi cocktail.  My 6-year old fell in love with the potato pancakes.  They were served with sour cream and apple sauce and were very light and flavorful.  We all enjoyed the jumbo shrimp that had been sauteed scampi-style but were served with a great cocktail sauce.  Both appetizers were excellent.

For our entrees, my son ordered the Polish Schnitzel, my wife ordered Grilled Salmon, my 11-year old ordered Potato and Cheese Pierogi and I ordered Grilled Homemade Kielbasa.  A pleasant surprise was that they had a &#34;happy hour&#34; pierogi deal in which you got two orders when you ordered one.  Since an order is 6 pierogi, we got 12.

The schnitzel was light and crispy.  Perfectly fried.  It was served with home fried potatoes that were slice so thin they were practically potato chips.  They were awesome!  My wife&#39;s salmon was delicious.  She was enjoying it so much that she, playfully, told me it was awful and that, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t want to try it.&#34;  Still, she did give me a bite and it was cooked just right.  It came with a light, creamy lemon sauce that did not overpower the fish and was served on a bed of jasmine rice.  My kielbasa was just like my dad and uncles used to make.  Nicely spiced and smokey.  It came with sauerkraut and home fried potatoes.  I added caramelized onions.

The pierogi deserve special attention.  Normally, at home, we get frozen pierogi from the supermarket.  We boil them and serve them with melted butter and sour cream.  My daughter thought this is what she was getting and was initially displeased with the fact that these were sauteed in butter and served with caramelized onions and mushrooms.  As soon as she tried them, though, she said, &#34;Dad, can we try to make pierogi like these?&#34;  Because we had a double order, my 6-year old daughter had these, too.  She also loved them.  In fact, we all got to try them and found them to be the best pierogi we&#39;ve ever had.

All-in-all, this was a great dining experience.  Truthfully, this is a very nice upscale restaurant in downtown Denver.  I could see this a place to go for dinner with a date or to have dinner before a show.  They have a great collection of beers and vodkas.  Still, my family really enjoyed our visit and will definitely return."

Ambience - really interesting concept, with a &#34;hole&#34; in the middle of the table that is filled with ice. You get to put the drinks on the ice to help keep the drink cold. But honestly, I felt so cold from all the chill halfway through dinner. I wonder what they do during winter?!

Food - I would say the pierogis are pretty large in serving size. I got the sampler platter that had around 18 pierogis for $15. It wasn&#39;t spectacular in taste and the food itself was rather dry. I had to drink water to help me with swallowing the food. My boyfriend commented that he preferred the pierogis from Costco, sigh. I also tried the Polish hotdogs which were too salty for me. Something that they seem to be good at are caramelized onions; every dish had caramelized onions and the waitress kept asking if we wanted to add more onions on our dish. Beef sliders were a-ok - nothing special...

Service - Oh my gosh, they are awfully slow and there weren&#39;t even that many customers. Many fellow yelpers had the same observation as well, I guess you just have to be very patient."

I stopped in with Erin H. before Evita last night. We were originally going to split the pierogi sampler entree for $15. However, our friendly and attentive server informed us that the better deal was the HH 2 for 1 pierogi plates. I&#39;m glad she did, this is a terrific deal! $10 got us 6 savory meat pierogi and 6 potato and cheese. 

The potato and cheese were perfect pillows of deliciousness. However,  I found the savory meat ones to have a texture akin to already chewed brisket. We washed it down with a fine diet soda made by Coke. Erin also had some soup that she appeared to thoroughly enjoy and I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll review soon.  The best part? It was all covered with the Yelp Deal I purchased.

I hope to follow up the garlic vodka with a pickle vodka shot next time i visit.  I ordered the potato pancakes as well as the pierogi appetizer.  The potato pancakes were served with apple sauce as well as sour cream on the side.  They were absolutely delicious.  The potato and cheese pierogis were amazing and the spinach/feta piergois were not bad.  Both appetizers cost $7 each and I feel that is a very fair price.  The ambiance is nice and relaxed, kind of dark with cool low blue lighting.  Worth stopping by if your in town and walk past it."

So we were there for happy hour before we went to the Buell for American Idiot.  So, we ordered a couple infused vodka drinks and some pierogies.  Now the pierogies were part of the happy hour deal.  We ordered our first round ... it came out, the food took like 15 minutes.  Also the wait staff didn&#39;t come back for a surprisingly long time.  When she came back, we ordered more drinks, and somehow she forgot a shot.  Then when I corrected her on this, it took seven or eight minutes.  Also we ordered more pierogies.  After about 15 minutes waiting, we told the waitress that we had theatre tickets and wanted to know (with about 40 minutes available) if we would be able to order more pierogies.  She advised that it normally takes at least 30 minutes for any food.

WHAT?!?! IT IS THE HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL!!!!  Don&#39;t you think you would try to be at least a little ready for happy hour?  

And we were not alone in seeing this horrible service.  The table next to us also noted that there were 3 bartenders standing doing inventories and such and you know ... not servicing customers.  This was my wife&#39;s second try and both times were abysmal, they won&#39;t be getting my money a second time."

I sampled their pirogi and kielbasa at the Westword Dish last week, and I couldn&#39;t wait to have a full meal here.  So when mom wanted to take me to dinner for my birthday I grabbed the phone to make a reservation. 

We were greeted and seated immediately by a smiling face who also ended up being our server, Monique.  She was great, bringing us our wine, water, and my shot of horseradish vodka (holy smokes was that awesome!) right away.  For an appetizer we ordered the bigos which is kielbasa with sauerkraut.  Absolutely delicious, with a good flavor and a nice little bit of spice to the sausage and very tangy cabbage with more diced up kielbasa.  We both had a tough time deciding on our entrees, but I finally went with some pork meatballs while mom chose the cabbage rolls.  Everything was absolutely perfect, and those mashed potatoes were the best I&#39;ve ever had!  I also very much enjoyed their beet salad. 

The owner came over and introduced himself halfway through our evening, invited us to do a shot with him, which we gladly accepted, and then sent over a couple more after we finished dinner.  I can honestly say that it was a pleasure to shake this mans hand. 

The restaurant is located in Writers Square, one of my favorite little pockets of Downtown Denver.  The place itself is very spacious, with a beautiful bar and large tables.  The patio is also great, just below street level, very roomy, and built more for smaller groups.  Now, I will warn that it&#39;s more of a social spot than a quiet dining room, but that just makes it fun.  (And I&#39;m pretty loud anyway, so I fit right in.)

I have nothing bad to say about this place at all.  Everything was perfect, it&#39;s now one of my favorite restaurants of all time, and I can&#39;t wait to come back!  Thank you for a great experience!
Prost!!"

I didn&#39;t eat that time, but tried their house special Bloody Mary, and was hooked. It seems to use their dill pickle, jalapeno, and pepper vodkas; it&#39;s well blended and so, so hot. Delicious!

Came back for the food, and happened upon their pierogi special. The veggie one was a bit lackluster, but technically it was free, so I can&#39;t mind it much. The main meat pierogi was delicious; the outside was just a bit crisp and the meat was a bit spiced, and super filling.

We went on a week they had a &#39;black tea&#39; vodka infusion, which was light, and quite nice. My Bloody Mary was perfect, as usual. I enjoyed the kiwi vodka; the banana tasted a bit too much like candy."

As we planned for about 20 people, I emailed the address provided on the website and got very prompt responses from Cezary, who was friendly and wonderfully helpful the whole way through. He was great at helping me choose drinks and food for everyone without breaking the bank, and on the night of the event, he and our waitress were incredibly professional and it was clear they really strived to make it a special night for everyone.

Every time I&#39;ve been here, the food has been delicious and impressively well-priced. Obviously don&#39;t miss out on the pierogies -- they offer a variety of fillings and serve them till midnight! -- but I also feel you can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu. Everyone loved the potato pancakes and, of course, the infused vodka. 

Even if it&#39;s not for a party next time, I can&#39;t wait to come back here whenever I&#39;m in Denver! There&#39;s a great variety of seating options, room and music to dance, creative decorations, and plenty of space outside to enjoy those warmer Colorado nights. Thanks for another great experience!"

But I&#39;m going to go with 3 until I try it again. There was nothing fundamentally bad about my experience, but nothing that left me excited either.

I really liked the pierogies, and they have great happy hour prices on drinks and food. But, the atmosphere was a bit sterile to me with music that I didn&#39;t really like. And the infused vodkas we tried were too muted for my preference. 

I really wanted the infused vodkas to be like The Capital Grille&#39;s Stoli Doli- huge flavor making you forget it has vodka. Or like the infused pickle shots at The Retro Room. To be fair, I don&#39;t know if those other places add extra flavor to their infusion and maybe the ones here are &#34;authentically&#34; infused. But, we tried the coffee, grapefruit and basil infused vodka served straight up as cocktails. They were good, and insanely strong, but the vodka flavor overpowered the infused flavor.

The pierogies were yummy! We tried the recommended spinach and feta, as well as traditional potato and cheese. We all preferred the traditional potato and cheese, and I really enjoyed the sauteed onions and mushrooms served on top.

I like the overall concept of this place, and would love to order something that takes advantage of those troughs of ice at each table. So I will definitely be giving it another try, and hopefully a chance to improve my rating."

I had a few pierogis, stnizel and some infused vodka at the bar.

Pierogis where top of the line and paired nicely with the vodka(s), stnizel was typical, but nothing special.

Atmosphere in the bar was a little bit of a singles scene, but it is open (and serving) late which is always a plus in my book."

The menu actually has a pretty good variety, so if you&#39;re not into Polish food, you can find a burger or a salad to suit your taste. 

The waitstaff was on top of things, not to mention both professional and personable. They accidentally brought out the wrong dish to one person, and instead of just taking it back allowed him to keep it (box it up) and brought out the correct dish. Another person wasn&#39;t crazy about their soup, so they took 10% off their entire ticket. This is definitely a place that wants customers to come back. 

My food was wonderful (got the schnitzel, which came with their awesome cucumber salad), drinks were refilled promptly, and they even did separate checks for our group of seven. 

I really hope more people will give this place a try. It&#39;s trendy, but friendly, has great quality food and excellent infused vodka. I&#39;ll definitely be back."

I used to work with an older Polish woman who introduced me to the deliciousness of everything Polish - and this place lived up to everything I knew and more; from their pierogi (potato &amp; cheese and the meat were awesome) to their house made sausage to their libations! In addition, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they carry an extensive list of polish vodkas including a personal favorite of mine, Zubrowka (a Polish bison grass vodka).

The service is really excellent and the atmosphere is fun and vibrant. The drinks are excellent - as they should be for the price. I had two cosmopolitans and they were deliciously strong (AND $11 EACH). I was definitely feeling happy by the end of my second drink! Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t feeling happy enough to love the food.

I felt that the food left a little to be desired. I ordered 6 potato and cheese perogies and 6 mushroom and sauerkraut perogies. The potato and cheese perogies were really just okay for me. The best part was that they were covered in caramelized onions. There was just an odd taste, and unfortunately, I can&#39;t put my finger on it, but it was keeping me from loving the potato and cheese perogies.

The mushroom perogies were really not my thing. Turns out, I don&#39;t love sauerkraut IN a perogie. Live and learn, I guess.

We then both ordered dessert. My husband ordered the Polish apple pie and I ordered dessert perogies. The dessert perogies were supposed to be filled with a sweet cheese and drizzled with a raspberry syrup. Not my favorite. Not at all. I didn&#39;t even finish them. I was expected a cream cheese-style cheese in the perogie, but instead, I&#39;m pretty sure it was ricotta. The raspberry syrup was very thin and simply created a puddle in which my ricotta cheese perogies were swimming. The polish apple pie wasn&#39;t BAD, but it wasn&#39;t something to be excited about. Maybe I just don&#39;t like Polish desserts? Perhaps. Regardless, I was unimpressed.

Other than to drink, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back."

Once we parked, I asked Siri where the nearest Pub was and he listed Polished Tavern as the closest to us, win.

I&#39;m so mad that our waitress&#39;s name is escaping me right now but I will have to recall it and update because she was super nice!  Of course, it was WAY early (like 6:30) so the place was fairly empty but regardless - she helped us make a delicious drink decision (peppermint chocolate martini, um - yum!), entertained our &#34;how happening&#39; is this place in a few hours&#34; inquiry with funny details, and major bonus - sent us off with 2 free strawberry vodka shots that were deelish!

Now to the food - UHmazing!  My sister ordered the pierogie sandwich and a house salad, the salad was a meal in itself and definitely wasn&#39;t one of those Denny&#39;s side salads with a block of iceberg lettuce and two tomatoes.  I happened to see potato pancakes (my fav)  as part of a meat dish and asked if I could just have a side of them, along with the sauerkraut / mushroom pierogies and man - I fed my face!  

The plates / presentation of the food were beautiful as well - they matched the decor in that way, this is definitely not your Daddy&#39;s tavern.  It&#39;s incredibly inexpensive too, considering the ambiance, service, food, and designer drinks - we can&#39;t wait to go there again!

Ordered half pound of ribs and half pound of brisket also each was on ounce short. Yes people I weigh my food lol. Brisket is pretty dry and just salty not much flavor o it.

You&#39;ve heard about their participation in numerous local charitable events. And so, let me tell you a bit about the food served at StevO&#39;s Pizza &amp; Ribs.

Y&#39;know, it probably comes as no great surprise to hear that StevO&#39;s specializes in pizza, but their topping selection might strike you as a bit unusual at first. Well, yes, they&#39;ve got artichokes and chorizo and shrimp, but those aren&#39;t what I was thinking of in this case. How do peanut M&amp;M&#39;s grab you? No, that&#39;s not a misprint - try it and see! Or what about macaroni &amp; cheese? Salmon? Sauerkraut? Spam? (OK, I&#39;ll stop with the &#34;S&#34;&#39;s). Corn? Mandarin oranges? Clams? Broccoli? See? Those other create-your-own pizzerias are for amateurs aren&#39;t they? And StevO&#39;s will let you mix-n-match to your heart&#39;s content too, so you don&#39;t have to just imagine how some of those combinations will taste. (You&#39;re welcome). You can even do a calzone - if you choose this option though, it&#39;s probably wise (as the proprietor will no doubt advise you) to limit yourself to four toppings to avoid making an ungodly mess.

But if you&#39;re just not in a pizza kind of mood on your visit, by all means don&#39;t fret - you have some other possibilities to partake of, culinarily speaking. I quite like the meatball sandwich, with its generous lashings of melted cheese, but you could also stuff your buns [ahem] with a hot link or Italian sausage if either of those sound more appealing. Alternatively, see what you think of one of their barbecue options, like pulled pork or brisket. StevO&#39;s in fact has many different lunch specials available so you can affordably try quite a few of these along with a side item (I enjoy the lightly-mayo-y macaroni salad in particular) and a drink. And how could you end your meal without a rather large wedge of their creamy cheesecake? Yes, as you may have surmised, there&#39;s no place quite like StevO&#39;s - words simply cannot do them justice. I guess you&#39;ll just have to stop by and check them out yourself, won&#39;t you?"

It is a bit more expensive but I don&#39;t mind. One thing I will mention -- I&#39;ve talked to one of the employees on the phone and he was very rude, but when I came into the store there wasn&#39;t an attitude. I appreciate that and will probably return here merely cuz the pizza is great."

Either the place doesn&#39;t value its customers safety or its a place so dangerous that it needs to arm its employees. Nothing says hospitality like a gun.

Not only was my pizza DELICIOUS, it was delivered in about 30 minutes, and the delivery guy, Tim, was awesome! Incredibly nice guy, like he was genuinely delighted to be delivering the pizza. I didn&#39;t think customer service like that existed anymore! His attitude set the tone for my day and made my entire experience.

So I just got off the phone with the supposed &#34;owner&#34;, who cussed me out, called me an idiot, a pot smoking loser, etc. etc. To preface, I&#39;m from out of town and finished a gig at 3am, looking for food. I call Stevo&#39;s from my hotel, I ordered a pizza, and gave the exact address I am at. The employee ran the card and placed the order. All is well.
30 minutes later I receive another call (this time from the &#39;owner&#39;) saying that I am out of the range of their store. He was noticeably irritated since they had JUST noticed the address I had given them was out of range and they had made the pizza; he insulted me for not knowing that my location would be out of range of their store (it&#39;s exactly 6 miles away - a 15 minute drive). I explained I didn&#39;t know and offered to pay EXTRA for him to deliver - $15 extra in fact (since I&#39;m on per diem). This bothered him even more; I argued that on Google Maps, it says the store is only 6 miles away, which is why I thought it&#39;d be within delivery range. He responded &#34;Oh? Are you using Google Maps in Russia?&#34; Yikes.
He went on to insult me and called me a &#34;fucking stoner idiot&#34; to think they would deliver that far away. I tried to explain I GAVE THEM MY ADDRESS BEFORE ORDERING, but he didn&#39;t seem to care about that. He threatened to keep the charge on my card, to which I said &#34;go right ahead&#34;, as that&#39;s a direct breach of contract. 
I&#39;ve never written a yelp review before, but I think it goes without saying - do NOT order food from here. I understand 3am is a shitty time to be working anywhere, but this guy (owner?) was a blatant, unprovoked asshole and refused to admit he had fucked up. There are similar reviews about this guy on their YELP account - STAY AWAY."

But oh your god.. the chick that works nights is incredibly rude whenever I call in food. I get it. You work graveyard at a food place. Can&#39;t be that awesome. But I&#39;m not the one who put you in the position to work there. Luckily, the delivery drivers are always super nice.

After a long morning of moving boxes into our storage unit down the road, we were on the hunt for some high protein, low carb sustenance to help us through the afternoon.

I&#39;ve seen the VW Beetle with the mohawk many times before and recall telling myself we have to try this place at least a dozen different times, but not until this weekend  did I actually follow through.  

We opted for a 1/2 pound of ribs, an order of brisket, two sides of potato salad and a couple of drinks.  The price was reasonable and while the gentleman at the counter had a little trouble with the credit card system, it was resolved prior to the GF returning from the restroom.  

The restaurant itself was a bit dirty, not unlike 90% of the other restaurants in this area, but definitely not something that was bothersome or disgusting by any means.  Just not somewhere I&#39;d visit on a date or a special occasion.  

Onto the food...

Potato salad - definitely not made fresh, but it was good.  No complaints and as long as you know what to expect.

Ribs - I&#39;ll be back for more.  Not the best I&#39;ve ever had by any means, but they were smokey, good and hot.  

Brisket - Smoke flavor was good, but the meat itself was pretty dry.  I won&#39;t be ordering it again, but it wasn&#39;t any worse than I&#39;ve had a numerous other BBQ joints.

I am not sure what folks are expecting of this place with all of the horrible reviews.  After all it is a hole-in-the-wall place that serves Pizza, BBQ and Mexican, not a 5-star joint with a 3 month wait list who spits out James Beard award winners."

Awful brisket sandwich. Dry. Regular kraft BBQ sauce. Ick.

Awful wings. Over cooked and saturated in a crappy excuse for wing sauce.

The whole appetizer sampler came from a frozen bag obviously. Cmon batter your own shrooms and chicken. It makes a world of differnce.
Pizza dough seemed premade and just plain gross.
Everything was pretty much just awful.

Being fair, it&#39;s a generous size serving, hot and juicy and cooked nicely but really not worth eating for that taste. Maybe their other food such as pizza is good.

So OK partially my bad - I placed an order on the phone for pickup and it was after work, with me running late, and I forgot to mention the Groupon.  I&#39;ll take the blame for this, I am scum.  Ordered a rack of Ribs and 10 Chicken Wings ($30) since the reviews below were not crazy about the Pizza.

Got to the place which was completely empty so figured Monday night is not the busiest.  I announced I had a Groupon and Steve told me &#34;I should have told them when I ordered.&#34;  I apologized and said I forgot.  Apparently the order was rung in for $30 and voiding or reversing is not an option.  He said I could use the Groupon next time but it expires in 2 days and I said it was the real reason I came over.  He said he could not do it and I said &#34;OK sorry I guess its not going to work&#34; and prepared to leave.  He said they would have to throw the food out and I asked what options there were and could he not do an override?   Then he did the math and said &#34;OK you can pay the $10.&#34;  Pulled out a credit card but with a huge sigh from Steve, promptly returned it to my wallet and pulled out cash. Crisis avoided.  

Got my food and he asked &#34;you live around here?&#34;  Odd question but I said no I&#39;m in downtown.  He then said &#34;OK good, next time you can go somewhere else....&#34;  and that was that.

I want to say it was all worth the effort and I am now purchasing false beards and sunglasses to return.  Unfortunately the Ribs were dry and while passable, nothing really unique. The pig must have been a healthy guy as they were on the thin and scrawny side.  Can&#39;t say they made the meal.  Chicken wings were like any other with a slightly weird metallic aftertaste that I can&#39;t quite put my finger on, probably would not try these again.   So I guess the best course of action is to take the advice of the owner and &#34;Go somewhere else next time.&#34;

Oh...  I did get a chuckle out of the coupon on the Take Out box.  It proudly proclaims &#34;we deliver food from any restaurant&#34; - I can only guess that this is a safety net for whatever disappointments SteveO&#39;s offers, they will always bring you something more agreeable from elsewhere."

All of their ribs are freshly made, that much I could tell, but the wait was a tad excessive. I&#39;m willing to chalk that up to cooking time and no fault of their own. 
That being said, what I got was less than satisfactory, a full pound of ribs for $11 when maybe eight tenths of the weight was pure bone, and what meat I got I couldn&#39;t taste passed all of the liquid smoke they flooded it with. 
I still intend to try their pizza challenge some day and am willing to give them a second chance because the staff was very friendly and helpful, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll give the ribs a second go."

Saying things like &#34;well, you better tip the driver&#34;....&#34;you wasted our time and our food&#34;..... I admitted to the mistake but he kept going on and on......Could not tell me when the food would arrive because &#34;well whenever my driver frees up from other orders since you don&#39;t know where you live&#34;....

They tend to be pretty slow at getting food out I also feel like in my personal opinion that the meat has smoked for too long and it has a very overt powering flavor. And the meat that I did have (ribs and brisket) on two separate occasions was very tough and dry. Not tender like I think BBQ should be. Brisket tends to have a little more fat in the grains off the meat and this one had none, leading to the toughness and dryness. The slaw is really good as well as the potatoe salad. BBQ sauce was good as well tangy and smoky. But I would go there for the BBQ meat and that fell sorry for me. But there carne asada tacos are really good! That was the big winner for me. Most of the staff odds friendly except for one time I called in and she sounded like she was tired of listening to me talk and ask questions.

I ordered 1/2 lb of ribs and 1/2 lb of brisket, and except for minor differences in the types of meat, the taste was all the same due to the smoke flavor!  Not a good smoke flavor either.... I was imagining they hook up the exhaust pipe of a diesel truck and smoke the meat that way.  I know that&#39;s pretty harsh, but I can&#39;t otherwise express how BAD the meat tasted with that smoke flavor!  The fried corn on the cob was ok, but the amount of batter they use prevents its all from being cooked and was unnecessary.  Finally, I got a slice of cheesecake for dessert, and that was good, although I&#39;m sure was not made from scratch at the store.  Its unfortunate, I wanted to like this place, but won&#39;t be ordering again!"

I experienced the same type of attitude from the owner &#34;StevO&#34; as Doug R. did on his Yelp review. Right off the bat StevO was unpleasant and rude. One of his first questions was &#34;Do you live around here?&#34; I didn&#39;t know what that had to do with anything, but my assumption now is that he only wants to take care of his &#34;regulars&#34; who live close by. I had heard about the interesting toppings on their pizzas such as Brisket, M&amp;Ms, Mac &amp; Cheese, etc. so I wanted to give it a try. I started to look at their menu at it seemed as if StevO was bothered with my presence or the fact that I didn&#39;t know what I wanted after having just walked in. I decided that I would try a pizza with brisket since I love brisket and heard about this as one of their signature toppings. 

As I waited for the pizza, I sat down in their dining area. That&#39;s when I started to get creeped out. The place was very dirty as if they cleaned once a month (if that). There seemed to be grease, dirt and grime everywhere. The walls were super dirty as were the tables and the floor looked pretty gross as well. I started to have doubts about going through with the pizza, but I&#39;ve eaten at a lot of greasy spoon hole in the wall type places that were awesome so I decided to tough it out.

Once my pizza was ready to go, I asked if they ever have any specials or coupons running to which he replied in a rude voice &#34;Nope, we don&#39;t really want the coupon clipping penny pinching type.&#34; I told him that with the prices of his pizzas (very pricey)  it might get people to keep coming back. He then replied &#34;Well next time you can just get your pizza somewhere else!&#34; Seriously??? I made up my mind right then and there that I&#39;d not be coming back. I wish I could give a half star or zero stars for this place as I&#39;ve never had such a bad customer service experience... and this was with the owner! It took a lot for me not to get into it with him, so I just gave him a dirty look as I left. When I got home I took one bite of the pizza and it was so greasy and the brisket was so dry that I just threw the pizza away and said I was done with this place.

I would warn anyone contemplating getting pizza from here to stay away. I&#39;m surprised they are even in business with an owner that rude and with a place that dirty. I usually try to stay away from writing negative reviews and stick to the places that I think are worth mentioning, but I thought it was my duty to warn Yelpers and prevent an experience like this from happening again."

Problem 1: At midnight, when the delivery guy parked in front of my neighbor&#39;s house, his stereo was bumping shitty hiphop so loud our windows were rattling. 

Problem 2: They forgot one of our desserts. The delivery guy&#39;s take on it was, &#34;well I didn&#39;t pack the order, so it&#39;s not my fault.&#34; Dude. You&#39;re the delivery guy. You&#39;re the last line of quality control before it hits the customer. Check your fucking orders, pard.

Problem 3: The brisket. This was hands down the worst brisket I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Seriously. It was indistinguishable from shoe leather. Didn&#39;t even look like meat. It was completely inedible. That&#39;s 12 or 13 bucks worth of beef brisket that went to waste. Couldn&#39;t have even chewed it if we&#39;d wanted to. Ten year old beef jerky is more tender.  

Okay, that covers the crap. Now on to the good stuff.

Success 1: The macaroni salad. Awesome! Cold, creamy, tasty. Couldn&#39;t have asked for better. Really hit the spot.

Success 2: The ribs. Oh my damn. Tender, smoky, falling off the bone. The ribs were dope. The sauce was a nice mix of sweet and spicy. 10+ Would order again.

Success 3: Hey, they deliver at midnight! Cool.

In conclusion: Will probably order again. Will not order the brisket."

I discovered this place via an app that helps find late night food places. 
I work late into the night and these guys deliver until 3am. After seeing previous reviews, I didn&#39;t expect much but it only had to blow away frozen burritos and spaghetti o&#39;s so what did I have to lose? Well wasn&#39;t I pleasantly surprised! I got a pizza and garlic cheese bread. Both were tasty and delicious, bread was randomly shaped and not sliced but I don&#39;t really care.  It was hot, fresh, yummy, and the delivery girl was great. I called after ordering to make sure they actually did deliver this late and was on hold for a bit as they were busy, but the gentleman who answered the phone answered my question and was courteous. I will definitely order from here from time to time as my bank account allows it. It&#39;s good to know that tasty food is indeed available when I get home from work!

*update* I order from these guys every few months. I don&#39;t do a lot of takeout because I&#39;m on a tight budget, but when I get pizza, it&#39;s generally from here whenever I can do it. Their service has always been wonderful. I&#39;ve had delivery and pickup, but never dined in. I&#39;ve had great experiences with both delivery and in store. Their cheese bread is just entertaining as well as good. I&#39;m kind of picky with my cheese bread. They make it just the way that I like it, and it&#39;s always a treat to see what kind of creativity is going to come out of that box."

WHY was the sauce on my pizza green? Why was my pizza green? I then googled their name and read the host of people on here who have also experienced this.

No where on their menu do they state anything about this horrible thing they do to your food. I was unable to eat it because of the disgusting thoughts and look of a pizza with green sauce. How do you folks even know if people are allergic to food coloring or may be affected by it? At least state something about this disturbing thing you do to the food people order from here.

I will NEVER order from here again and advise other people to stay far away from this place too. I don&#39;t need a group of unorganized stoners making me Disgusting looking food...I had to go to 711 and buy a Digiorno, cause in this case it was way better than Delivery."

I recently had the same experience as a fellow Yelper below simply because I bought and used a Groupon that the company willingly put out to the public.

Since the Fine Print (below) says it&#39;s not valid for delivery - I called and placed and order to a very nice young man on the other end of the phone. I got off the phone and thought - gosh, that man was nice. This is going to be a great experience!

Well, that all changed as soon as I walked into the empty restaurant to pick up the food I ordered. An older (dare I call him) gentleman gave me my total and I gave him my Groupon. 

Well - that is where everything changed!

He proceeded to tell me that I didn&#39;t say I had a Groupon when I ordered so he can&#39;t take it. I apologized and said I am so sorry but I didn&#39;t know I had to. He said that it says that in the fine print (see Fine Print below which I copied and pasted DIRECTLY from my Groupon)

Can you fellow Yelpers please help me find where it says you MUST say you have a Groupon when ordering over the phone ... Bueller ... Bueller.... that&#39;s what I thought - IT DOESN&#39;T!!!!!


The Fine Print
Limit 1 per person, may buy 1 additional as a gift. Limit 1
per visit. Valid only for option purchased. Must purchase 1
food item. Not valid for delivery. Must use promotional
value in 1 visit.


So - the Pissed-Off-At-Groupon owner then tells me I can come back another time to use my groupon and pay the full price now. I apologized and said that&#39;s not an option right now. So, he said, he could cancel the order and just re-ring it up. I said that would be great. He then tilts his head to the side and says - OH REALLY??? That&#39;s really ok with you!!!???

WOW!

At this point - I was prepared to walk out - but I explained to him that all he needs to do is cancel the order, re-ring it up with the Groupon but tell the kitchen staff - hey don&#39;t make that order - then reconcile the books later... (not hard right?)

Then I had no cash to pay the overage - another total bad on my part ... at this point I know I am the scum of the earth and I am going to hell. At least, that&#39;s how the owner made me feel! So I guess it hurt his heart that I was paying with a credit card -again another aspect of the business that the company willingly signed up for.

Then he proceeded to completely bash and complain about Groupon and how he was not told of all the fine print on his end. I politely said - well, maybe you shouldn&#39;t have signed up with the company and you shouldn&#39;t sign up with the company in the future. Which he agreed with me shocking! He also said I should really rethink about EVER buying another Groupon again and how it&#39;s a SLIMY company... his words not mine.

Then he asked me if I live around here and I said YES - I drive by your place every day to and from work that&#39;s why I wanted to stop in and support a local business with my Groupon. Well, that certainly changed his tune and he was asking me to come back again and again .... (too late - damage done!!!!) 

Everyone has free will to eat and not eat where they want - but the food was gross, the customer service was non existent and I would highly recommend you taking your money and appetite someplace else!"

Showed up about 20 minutes later and Steve-O greeted me with a nice and surprising hug! My order was ready to go. He chatted me up and rung up my order. Told me he&#39;ll deliver for any other restaurant as well, in case you&#39;re ever feeling lazy and want something from a place that doesn&#39;t deliver. 

The ribs were awesome! The pizza was pretty decent with pineapple and pulled pork. Steve was right about the BBQ sauce! Price was on par with what I&#39;d expect and didn&#39;t think it was out of line. 

Didn&#39;t use the amenities and can&#39;t speak to that but I didn&#39;t feel the general cleanliness was anything to warrant reconsideration.

As we drove on Havana we saw Stevo&#39;s and there&#39;s a big $5 lunchtime special so I turned into the lot. I like trying hole in the walls out!

I gotta say, this place is not so &#34;pretty&#34; but we gave it a shot. Stevo&#39;s has joined with a Mexican restaurant, so now they serve pizza, ribs and tacos with a salsa bar. 

We went to the counter and ordered our $5 meal. There were a lot of lunchtime meals to choose from but we ordered the two slices of pizza and a can of pop. Steve slung the pizza dough in the back like a champ. I asked him if he was Steve and he said yes. He was a very nice man.

&#34;Stevo&#34; brought out our slices out after about 10 minutes and they  looked good, fresh and piping hot...we had to wait to take a bite. It&#39;s not the best pizza I have ever had but I was satisfied. It&#39;s sorta New York style with a thicker, fluffier crust and the sauce was basic but I liked how my onions and green peppers were cooked, not just thrown onto a cheese pizza and heated up. I hate when pizza places do that.

I did not go into the bathrooms but my friend did. She didn&#39;t say anything and I didn&#39;t ask. 

I want to get Steve on a restaurant show and get Stevo&#39;s a makeover. He seems like a good guy and I mean, he can make you pizzas shaped as hearts or footballs. He also drives a volkswagon bug for deliveries. The mexican food doesn&#39;t look half bad either but don&#39;t worry, Steve&#39;s not making the tacos."

To begin, SteveO will deliver your order in his super cool lifted VW Bug with a mohawk. Talk about fun for the kiddos. And me--it&#39;s find watching him drive down to our house.  
The pizza has always been outstanding, and they have a great selection of unique toppings. 
We tried the free ribs with pizza deal, and let me tell you , the ribs are super yummy. SteveO uses a special blend of several types of hard woods to smoke his BBQ, and it all has a very unique delicious flavor. 
We ordered BBQ sandwiches instead of pizza one night, they were awesome. We have also had the macaroni salad and potato salad, and they are some of the best I have ever, ever had. 
We ate in one night, and my son had a meatball sub. Apparently also delicious. 
So, the place is not fancy at all, but for a very good casual meal, the food is really spectacular. I encourage you to support this small On Havana Street business. They&#39;re a good family puttin&#39; out some good food."

I ordered ribs, brisket, cole slaw and beans. The cole slaw was sour, bone dry, and room temp. The brisket was so tough it became jerky. The ribs were tough and tasted like ashes. The BBQ was disgusting, and spicy. BBQ is supposed to be sweet.The bread was a stale end cut piece. The beans were the only edible thing edible , I&#39;m sure because they came straight from a can. Salad..ha! Lettuce, cheese , and pepperoni slices? Really ? I&#39;m scared to try the cheesecake. I eat out A LOT, I&#39;m not picky and I&#39;ve NEVER ordered a meal and had every single item be literally un- edible. I shouldn&#39;t have ordered BBQ from a place called stevos pizza but you could just taste the lack of pride they take in their food I can&#39;t imagine the pizza is any better. Oh and it was $28 are you kidding me? This was the absolute WORST meal I&#39;ve ever had. Every bite was more disappointing than the last.

Let me start of by saying, the place looked questionable when we walked up to the front door. And I try really hard not to judge people but I was a little startled by the young lady at the cash register. Heavily tattooed with accompanying piercings. I pulled myself together and reminded myself that it&#39;s not nice to judge people. She at least said hello...because its a pet peeve of mine when establishments can&#39;t &#34;greet&#34; me at the door.

It was our first time there so we were a little conflicted as to what to get. The deal gives you ribs, pizza and soda. But we were trying to decide if we wanted something else. Ended up getting some wings too. So while waiting for our order, we deciphered there are two separate business ran out of this place. A Mexican restaurant in which they take their own orders too. Hilarious.

Hubby felt the owner, Steve had a little attitude too. I didn&#39;t catch it because I was sitting down. But I did notice he was a little unkempt and dirty. Also the tables were straight FILTHY!!!!!!! (Didn&#39;t use the bathroom...so don&#39;t know the conditions.)

The FOOD....honestly, the ribs were very good. Fall of the bone. I&#39;m glad we asked for the sauce on the side because i didn&#39;t like it. The wings were okay. I think he bakes them instead of frying them. The pizza....I liked it enough to eat a second helping.

All in all, I would go back for the food ALONE but only carry out. This place is a little pricey. I could see if the establishment was a lot cleaner, then I could rationalize the higher prices. Wish there was a 2 and 1/2 star button."

The ribs were tasty; slightly smoked flavor, very fatty in a good way, and falling off the bone. 
The sauce was straight out of a Kraft jar, but I happen to like a good bottled BBQ sauce, so no real demerit there. 

Problem with this family operation is that the place is filthy dirty. 
Skeevy Dirty. The kind of dirt that closes a place down. 

If the restaurant wasn&#39;t bad enough, the bathrooms were NYC Port Authority Dirty ---Pop A&#39; Squat Dirty, take the roll of TP to touch anything dirty, nightmares all night dirty !! 

YUK !!!! 

So, as long as you can stomach knowing that no one is washing their hands with soap and basic sanitation is nonexistent, then you&#39;re good here, as the ribs really were quite good. 

Not sure how to rate the value....2 lbs of ribs were $20 if that helps. 
Didn&#39;t have the pizza, but from memory it was well under $10 a pie---

This is an area in Arvada that is fast becoming my favorite for a little over a year now. It&#39;s cute. It&#39;s almost idyllic. A light rail in the works just across from it. It just gets better.

So I haven&#39;t met the owner yet but according to Chad the first face and person that welcomed us she&#39;s a legit Kentucky native. Who made Arvada her home and opened this truly legit Bourbon heaven about a year ago. 

Finding something this fine unexpectedly was so great. We were walking and there it was. Yup. Walking has been so good to me. I&#39;ve made good friends hiking. Now I found my personal heaven. Because if you know me you know I&#39;m what they call a Bourbon Bi***. Lol!

Everything bourbon is here. Their happy hour has a short list. Don&#39;t worry. It will turn you into a fan anyways. We tried all their happy hour offerings. The verdict? Two thumbs up!

A few things worth a special mention. One of the HH drinks is Peaches and Cream. Bourbon cream did you say? Pizza with two toppings. It&#39;s not the toppings because we all know it&#39;s just the icing on the cake. It&#39;s the dough. It&#39;s crunchy, burnt on the side but still foldable. I am a major fan! 

The staff. Chad and Ryan. Awesome people!

Outside patio. Perfect two front doors. Too much bourbon? You will find that two doors helps :) Metered parking in front. 

Wood everywhere! The bar. Very inviting.

I took my best friend here and she herself wasn&#39;t familiar with this little coffee shop with amazing food. The whole vibe is very mystical to me as they have paintings of unicorns, dim lights, miniature dining sets, and the staff is overly nice!! Their food is awww-mazing. The Bacon &amp; Bleu nachos are only $4 and they have ranch, BBQ, tomatoes and of course bacon. The coffee menu is beautiful. They have a wine list and lots of meals to go fourth. They have a mini bakery with scrumptious looking pastries. The music is serene and not too loud. 

The coffee is very flavorful: Seventh Heaven was real soft and not too strong. You can start with 12 oz., to even more. They start off with a cup for $3.49. 

My friend had April Showers, which were a lighter coffee as well. This place is beautiful and out of a dream. We look forward to coming back."

So let&#39;s start off on an okay foot by offering Novo as your choice of coffee. That&#39;s fine, not spectacular. It makes for a decent offering given that I don&#39;t think there are many (if any) other coffee shops around Arvada that offers Novo. It was fine, as is Novo.

Pretty big points though for the Reese&#39;s latte. I didn&#39;t try it but it definitely sounds like a unique drink choice and one I&#39;ve never seen before. I tried my colleague&#39;s latte, it was also fine.

Other than the Reese&#39;s latte, the big thing that stood out to me was the cherry almond Danish, which was awesome. One of the better Danishes I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ve seen it at other places so I&#39;m sure they have a place they get them from but it was still pretty awesome.

The overall space is decorated industrial style. The seats at the bar are wicked high, so be prepared if you&#39;re short person to extend some flexibility.

Although limited, they have great rotating draft beers.
Pizza is decent - lots of gourmet pies but I don&#39;t know that they are award winning. They are certainly far better than any other pizza ive experienced at local breweries (aka Kokopelli)
Atmosphere is five star rustic cool. Great date place. Very cozy. 
Seating is seat yourself so if you are there and eyeing a table, you had better go make a deal with the people at the table before someone else pounces on it. 
Service was a bit slow but not because of the servers, just because it was a little crowded on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm. It opened up at 9 pm but also was not more than a 15 minute wait for a table. Basically you just drink beers at the bar until your table clears up.

Thankfully I found The Bluegrass and we got there just in time for happy hour. My coffee and bruschetta was wonderful as was his pizza and beer and so fairly priced for happy hour! The service was great and I will definitely be returning!

The only suggestion I have to improve the experience is to keep the live music at a lower volume.  It was so loud about a month ago that my date and I had to go elsewhere because we couldn&#39;t hear each other.   This small place would be better without amps for the music."

I was expecting loud, obnoxious, foot stomping bluegrass music, and to my relief, it was fairly quiet, with a classy ambience.  

They make REALLY STRONG drinks!  I enjoyed the beer I drank there.  I believe it was an IPA.

The pizza was good as well.

I believe they need more staff, though, because it took an awful long time to be served, refilled, etc."

This place is a true gem in the Old Town section of Arvada. One of the great things about this place is the perfect balance they strike between their day and night business. In the morning, they serve up tasty pastries and breakfast burritos along with amazing coffee drinks. 

As the day progresses, they offer a very tasty pizza and a fantastic selection of beer and bourbon, served up by a super friendly and knowledgeable staff. 

To top it all off, they almost always have a band or musician playing some great tunes to keep the night rolling. 

Definitely make this a go to spot if you are anywhere near the area and want tasty food and drink served up by a great staff!"

Dinner worked well and the bourbon was OUTSTANDING. Not so much the ability to catch up. First, the pizzas were good, nothing special, but solid and well-priced. Their bourbon selection, cocktails, and server knowledge are first rate. Really good space and charming decor. The only caution I&#39;d offer is to watch for live music. The place is small. Even though we chose a table near the back, the music from the guitarist was deafening. We absolutely could not carry on a conversation. Unfortunate. My friends who have also dined during music express the same concerns."

Last night however I switched it up and had a group of about 10 of my friends meet for a little Birthday get together and The Bluegrass did not disappoint. Service was friendly and quick and the food was delicious. Somebody ordered a ridiculously amazing desert  (I don&#39;t recall the name)that looked like little donuts with chocolate and honey. I dove into that and got my fat kid ON! Our waitress/bartender (Allie maybe?)was great and took care of everyone all night. This is my first ever Yelp review but these folks put together a bar I can call my favorite.

What&#39;s not to love with a place that has bluegrass, coffee and bourbon, so my girlfriend and I went here on a Tuesday evening for date night. The people were friendly and the food and drinks were great, but about 30 minutes into a great conversation, the music started and we couldn&#39;t hear ourselves think. It was one guy with an electric guitar, plugged into an amp and speakers designed for a place 3x the size. He was a good musician and I&#39;m sure meant well, but we had to leave because we couldn&#39;t carry on a conversation and there was no place to go to escape. Frustrating."

I only have them 4 stars because the one time I ordered a cocktail (foxtail blackberry mint julep),  they gave me a glass full of crushed ice and bourbon with a whole mint leave. No muddled blackberries/mint and no sugar that a traditional mint julep should have. I couldn&#39;t finish it because it was too strong."

We didn&#39;t have dinner because we had just eaten, but the pizza looked delish!  We will definitely try it next time.  

The place is small with seating and a super high bar that you will surely fall on your arse if you&#39;re a tiny bit wasted, and some standing room in the back.  Great atmosphere and live music.  The staff was awesome,  3 ladies and 1 gent working the bar and tables and 1 super busy cook that rocked out food left and right.  Great job everyone!

We wanted and after dinner coffee and I opted for the Kentucky Bourbon hot coffee and the hubby had a cold bourbon coffee.  Both were great - the coffee was a medium brew and they were not shy with the amount of alcohol they pour in their drinks either."

The food was great, and they have gluten free pizza, and the cocktails were decent. 

Why not 5 stars? While the people were super friendly, helpful, and courteous... They need more of them. 6pm on a Friday needs more than 2 people to serve a full house. I witnessed these 2 poor souls wait, serve, bartend, answer the phone, bus tables, and work the register. Things were missed (no napkins),  cocktails were rushed (Sazeracs need just a rinse of absinthe) , and waits were long in between visits. Again, these were super servers and I don&#39;t blame them, they just need help.

They have very generous pour on bourbon and whiskey, unlike most other places that serve you a 2oz pour for over $10.  I&#39;m very picky with pizzas, and I think what they serve is pretty good.  Their menu is somewhat limited as their kitchen is pretty small, and I wish they have more selections on the appetizers. When they first opened, it was such a quiet, cozy little place for a few people to enjoy drinks, and I think they got popular very quickly, especially in the evenings.

Great concept seen through just about perfectly. I love coffee. I love bourbon. I love pizza. Live music nights can be so hot or miss though. It&#39;s not that big of a place for it and naming your establishment bluegrass really limits your options. I have had two wondeful experiences here. Once during happy hour and once when using the 15 for 30 deal all by myself. (That was fun!). There was going to be a third night but the civil wars wannabes I heard from outside were playing the slowest, most depressing sounding something that perceived to be the cause of the two parties that were leaving. So i got back in my car and went somewhere else that night. In summation. Bluegrass is amazing. I hope this place stays around for a long time."

Had the kebedah with rice and added a side of bread. 1) the meat was bland. No spices. It was like eating a hamburger patty. 2) the rice was boring. Long grain white rice in enormous quantity with a touch of saffron. 3) the yogurt side was bland. Tasted like sour cream and a touch dill. Seriously? It was hardly enough to moisten the dried, bland meatball thing. 4) the bread tasted like a soft, unsalted cracker. It was dry, which compounded the fact that the rice was so boring and dry. 5) the half of a charred tomato!? What is this? Why? Didn&#39;t even touch it. 6) the price. No. $9 for rice, skewer of ground meat, bland sour cream sauce, and blackened tomato. No drink. No bread.
Could this place be improved? Sure. Stop serving the tomato, don&#39;t be afraid of spicing the meat and rice, serve half as much rice and throw in some salad (tabbouleh maybe?), add half a bread (and do something about the lack of moisture in the dough), and charge prices more appropriate to the quantity of food you&#39;re serving (I&#39;m thinking charge $9 for the above referenced improvements and throw in a fountain drink). ...and all this at risk of being bullied by the owner (read previous reviews)."

We like Middle-Eastern food so it was a go!
First, as good as the idea of having your menu with pictures is, on the walls and behind the counter in new style digital lit signs, it makes it very hard to see and decide quickly on the first time.  And the descriptions on the signs behind the counter were in rather small print.... all making it more time-consuming to decide. You can tell it&#39;s all made right there because the bread oven was there with the gentleman making it. I had the lamb kabob with rice.  The dish also came with a grilled tomato half that added more flavor to the dish.  Nothing special to say about the rice, but I added salt and pepper and it was fine.  The gal at the cash register had to spend alot of time with each new customer explaining the dishes.  That&#39;s good service and the gentleman/cook/owner? was kind.

I found Babajoon&#39;s and bookmarked it.  Last night I came with a friend to sample.  This is a fast casual concept so it was but a mere glance of what I assume Persian food to be and taste like.  

I ordered the salmon skewer which was perfectly cooked salmon.  The rice was a little under salty for my taste but a quick dash of salt got it to my preferred level.  The salmon and rice were very good together although not a unique flavor profile.  I also ordered the eggplant appetizer which was absolutely delicious and like nothing I&#39;ve had before.  I paired this with the home made bread which was a little like Indian naan with the fluffy pieces but an altogether more yeasty flavor.  The combination was delicious and what I would order again in the future.  

Service was fast and pleasant with an employee coming to clear our plates when we were done."

I tried so many different restaurant here in Colorado and I&#39;m happy i ended up to find this place,the foods and flavors! Omg that was what i looked for.
Quality,fresh foods,fair prices,that  makes me to drive 25miles to come here and get my favorite food which is kabab kubideh.....i love this place because they treat me as friend not just like the customer which is really important for me and others....I&#39;ll strongly recommend this place!

Amazing customer service - friendly and walked us through the menu. I was a fan of the photos and description. 

Selection - broad! Three lamb dishes alone to select from. Although I went for the Harris Ranch Beef with rice and a side of Hummus and Bread. The best hummus I have ever had. Ever. 

Chicken Kabob was tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. 

Garden Salad with fresh and lemony. 

We will soo be back."

PINK... He insisted in cooking more food for us, and bring out another plate. By that time we grossed out and just wanted our money back.. He claims that the health department considered the chicken cooked at 168 degrees and that he temped the chicken before he saw that the chicken he served us was in fact RAW.

Needless to say the health department was called, don&#39;t waste your money.

They did not disappoint. The service was top notch. The owner spoke to us for the entire time we awaited the completion of our takeout order. He also advised us to come in and try the food in person stating that the food loses something once you put it in a box.  He also recommended the salmon kabobs for our next visit stating that they were some of his favorites.

We elected to share the beef and chicken kabobs. They came with a side of rice seasoned with saffron and a grilled tomato, a slice of lemon to squeeze to taste, a cup of hot sauce (best on the chicken) and a cup of Tadzhik sauce for the beef. The beef was tender and well seasoned. It was set off remarkably well by the Tadzhik sauce, simply delicious.  The chicken was, in both of our opinions, just average. It was a bit dried out and not seasoned in a way that was particularly savory. The saffron basmati rice on the other hand, YUM! The grilled tomato didn&#39;t add much and my son, he&#39;s 15, said it was gross. I&#39;ll chock that up as an unsophisticated pallet... ;-)

The place was a cozy little place with Persian decor. It was well kept, clean, not cluttered, and well appointed. 

We&#39;ll be going back to try the salmon kabobs. 4 stars because I cannot rate it a 4.5 based on the chicken. The rest of the experience was a 5 all the way."

I was pleasantly surprised that they are locally owned! They have the tidy appearance of a clean franchise, but the character, charisma, and individual care of a small business.  The food is excellent (had one chicken and one fish Kabob) and the service is spot-on.  Even with ordering at the register, we were asked multiple times if everything was OK and if we needed anything.  Authentic food, great rice and salad for sides, and custom-oven-baked bread! YUM!

The staff/owners are wonderful people who really want to make sure you have a great experience.  They will explain things to you if you&#39;re unsure, and generally are just very pleasant and inviting. 

Everything I had tasted amazing, like a home-cooked meal. I ordered the Joojeh kabob, but got to taste the beef plate as well. The hummus was fantastic and you really can&#39;t beat that bread. 

I also really appreciate that they go the extra mile by using quality ingredients, something I wish more restaurants would strive for. I&#39;ll definitely come back."

This is surely not the place you&#39;re looking for. If you want to pay an arm and a leg for pencil thin kobideh, then please help yourself. You have a wide array of choices- fine rice as dry as the sands of the Loot desert, salad as under dressed as the images of belly dancers in your mind, and bread that you can watch the owner make love to while you eat. The fresh bread looked good, but be prepared to pay for it! If you order mezze be prepared to eat it like pudding- per the owner&#39;s suggestion. I highly recommend eating the dip this way, imagine your delight when you eat the Persian equivalency of nacho cheese with a spoon. Very underwhelmed by this place and wouldn&#39;t be upset if they went out of business by the Persian new year. 


To amend my review in response to being bullied by the owner- your policy is consistent with going to McDonalds and having to pay extra for your buns because gluten free people can&#39;t eat bread. I urge you to revisit other Persian restaurants in the area and check your competition."

After running some errands in this neighborhood, we decide to have Dinner here.  That recent visit was on Friday March 14th 2014.  Time was about 18:30hrs.  This establishment is situated next to Qdoba on its right, and on its left is Tokyo Joe&#39;s.  Man at that hour, this vicinity is DEFINITEY Jam Packed especially the Parking Lots!

Yes, this establishment has their own &#34;tandoor&#34; oven which they make their in-house breads aka &#34;Lavash&#34;.  Yes, you order at the counter and they will given you a &#34;NUMBER Token&#34; and they will sent your order to where you are seating.  We decide to seat ourselves on the High Tables with High Chairs aka Bar Stools, which is facing the Car Park and The Patio. There is also some seating areas at the Patio and also a Private Room available inside this establishment. 

I wanted to order the Eggplant dish, but the staff at the counter said, they removed this item from their Menu.  *Sigh*

From what I could recall we ordered the following items :

*  Shish Beef with Dill Rice option ($9.95)
*  Chenjeh Kabob With Beef Chunks and Basmati Rice option ($12.95)
*  Noono Paniro Sabzi aka Salad with Mint Leaves, Olives, Feta Cheese ($5.99)
*  2 Fountain Drinks ($3.78) 

If I am not mistaken our order also comes with their Special In House Made Breads that looks like &#34;Lavash&#34; or &#34;Nan-e Lavash&#34;.

Thankfully when we arrived and ordered, it was before the DINNER crowd.  We managed to get our food at about 18:53hrs ish, but the Special In-House Made Breads aka &#34;Nan-e Lavash&#34; were give ONLY after we finished our Main Entrée.  *SIGH*

The Noono Paniro Sabzi, is a Salad that comes with Thick Julienned Cucumbers, Chopped Tomatoes, 3 Mini Black Olives, 2 Green Olives, A Bunch of Mint Leaves, 2 Mini Squares of Feta Cheese, 3 Radishes, on top of Shredded Lettuce.

For our Main Entrees, some of the Vegetables were over-charred resulting in burnt taste.  Hubs order comes with Beef, 1 Onion Wedge, Zucchini, Green Bell Peppers, option of Rice with Dill, Charred of Half Tomatoes, One Lemon Wedge and Shredded Lettuce.  My Main Entrée comes with Onions, Beef Kabobs, Cucumber of some kind, Charred Tomatoes, a Lemon Wedge and Shredded Lettuce.

Overall, the food were indeed Underwhelming for our personal taste.  The Service from the Owner was 4 stars, but some of the staffs still need to make sure who ordered what, and they should know, which order goes to which table etc etc.

With $36 for Dinner, I feel DEFINITELY, There IS ROOM for Improvement, especially with regards to portion, and the flavor of the food.  Maybe we are NOT exposed to this kind of Cuisine.  NOTHING WOW us at all.  *DOUBLE SIGH*  *SAD FACE INDEED*

Hence this is a Generous 3 Star Review.  Left the establishment about 19:30hrs.  The Managing Partner of Babajoon&#39;s his name is Robert Hosseini.

The food had slight variations as to be expected when it is cooked to order from fresh ingredients. The place is clean and the staff is friendly and accomidating. (They welcome dogs on the patio and give them water too - bonus!)

It is located between Tokyo Joe&#39;s and Qdoba - two diluted &#34;ethnic&#34; chain resturants reheating mass- produced foodstuffs. Do yourself a favor and walk past those places and try some real, cooked food. If you are new to Middle-eastern food (this place is specifically Persian) give it a try. Its a little hard to pronounce but you probably know all the ingredients with the exception of a few spices and it&#39;s way, way better than the offerings from their neighbors."

I have been here probably 35-40 times since it has opened, and the quality of the food has been outstanding.  My top recommendations are:  Kubideh, which is a beef kabob; Hummus and bread (which they make from scratch in-house); Chenjeh, filet medallions.  The salmon is also terrific, a newer item.

My mother-in-law, who is Persian, makes (to me) the best Persian food I have ever tasted.  However, Babajoon&#39;s is RIGHT there, especially the Kubideh.  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.  The owners are very kind and accommodating, and of course, friendly.  

The only thing I don&#39;t like about Babajoons is that since we moved to the other side of Westminster, it&#39;s not as close as it was!  I&#39;m hoping they open another location soon."

Everything is homemade in house and all the ingredients are fresh.
It&#39;s a little pricey but it&#39;s worth it for the fresh ingredients and generous portions.
The thing you MUST try... the babajoon&#39;s ice cream. It&#39;s made with saffron, pistachio and rose water - I think they should put them in pints and sell these. Just amazing.
The service is friendly too. The staff gladly makes recommendations about seasoning, what to get, etc.  All and all, this is worth a visit or two. If you&#39;re not hungry, at the very least, stop in for the ice cream."

I met my friend who is married to a Persian man so she knows Persian food. She recommended this place. Her son said the kubideh is comparable to what he has had in Iran. We started with Ghaymeh Bademjoon (eggplant, beef, tomato stew). The meat was fall off the bone tender it just melted in our mouths. Big chunks of eggplant were equally tender and soaked up the seasoned (but not overboard) stew. We also tried the Mirza Ghasemi, and eggplant, garlic and egg mixture that I slathered all over the homemade, still hot out of the oven fresh bread. I was surprised to learn the Ghasemi had egg in it. It&#39;s not &#34;eggy&#34; in any way. 

For our entrees, we ordered the kubideh and barg (beef strip) kabobs with rice. The barg was tender, juicy and flavorful. But the kubideh, I&#39;ll be dreaming about for a LONG time. It&#39;s really that memorable. The portions were generous and they don&#39;t skimp on the rice. The basamati rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Being Asian, an appreciation for perfectly cooked rice is in my DNA.

We finished our meal with the Zoolbiya &amp; Bamiyeh pastries. The Persian version of a mini funnel cake and donut hole with a honey and rose water glaze. The sweets perfectly complimented the mint tea served in traditional Persian fashion. Sugar cubes are placed between the teeth while sipping the tea as it passes over the sugar cube. 

I&#39;m already thinking about my next visit to Babajoons and I&#39;ll be dreaming about the kubideh. Yes, I think about food that much."

Had to use hot sauce and salt. The bread was fresh and delicious though. The service was friendly. I just feel the prices are a bit steep for what you get.

I&#39;ve been looking for a good middle eastern restaurant in the Denver area, since I&#39;m moving here in June 2014. This was the first middle eastern place I&#39;ve tried so far, but it definitely did not disappoint. Standard, traditional Persian fare. Nice staff. Potential room for a party. If you have a palate for Persian, then try this place. 

I had the sultani, and my girlfriend tried the badamjon. Both of us were pleasantly surprised at the level of authenticity, preparation, and value. Definitely try this place out for some exotic variety!"

I enjoy kabobs, I too am a meat popsicle, and damn I am good. 

Went inside, was greeted right away by what I presume to be the manager since they only opened Saturday. He handed me a menu to read and made a couple suggestions, good guy. I ordered the beef kabob with an extra skewer and basmati rice; price was acceptable albeit a bit on the higher side for lunch. It took about 10 minutes for them to prepare my lunch since everything was made to order. They even have this drum looking clay oven thingie to bake the bread, very authentic indeed. The manager offered me free hot tea while I wait, once again, good guy.

At any rate, the food was really tasty! It came with two halves of a grilled tomato (I don&#39;t do tomatoes personally, but meh), and a side of shredded lettuce. Personally I think they&#39;d be better off if they did without those or replace that with some grilled onions and peppers if the customer chose rice instead of bread or salad (you can choose your side with your entree); but to each their own. I also would have loved, loved it if they had either baba ghanoush or hummus available with it. That would have definitely added another star. 

tl;dr - in haiku form

tasty beef kabobs
grilled over an open flame
would go back again"

Pricey for lunch.  Basically to get meat, veggies on bread with a sauce put me back $13.00.  No drink.  Too much to eat for lunch, but might be doable to split with friend for dinner.  Food was a little bland, but the sirloin chunks were tender.

I will probably try place again in a month or two after they have had time to make adjustments.  With a few tweaks I could give this place 5 stars."

Wasn&#39;t to sure about it. My parents and I decided we were going to grab a bite to eat for diner. My mom does not try new things (she wanted Tokyo joes) I changed my direction and both my parents followed. We were all glad we did. The service was great everything you order is fresh. You can see them throw it on the grill. We sprung for it all rice, bread, and salad. We were all able to share I love the simplicity of the food but don&#39;t let it fool you there is tons of flavor. Rice is amazing. Salad was a salad but even then they make it with the simple ingredients.  THE BREAD OMG they make it fresh in a clay oven if you&#39;re on a no carb diet us this as your cheat it&#39;s so good really heavy though.

The menu is a little confusing which the manager is open to opinion.  You get meat, rice or salad or bread... prices are a little high but I was always taught you get what you pay for. And here you get fresh and organic. If you want cheaper prices go next door to the knock off Mexican food or knock off Japanese restaurant. Just my opinion. Try it you&#39;ll love it."

Stopped in for a lunch as we love Mediterranean food. Read previous reviews about being expense. Figured, how bad could it be?  One kabob (which was tasty to their credit) with salad or rice or bread just seemed lame. Went with the ground beef kabob with salsa and added bread and a sauce. Wife did the same and split the sauce. Add one drink and we just had ourselves a $29 lunch.

The food is really like a 3.5 to 4 star rating but the value is a solid 1 star.  A bit of rice, a small salad and a half portion of bread with sauce (why is this not included?) and id pay 10-12 bucks. 

Just to touch on the good the bread is delicious."

The bread was warm, but hard it had been sitting around and reheated. The Kobiedah had a warm surface but the middle was cold, it had been pre cooked &amp; reheated. 

The Chenjeh was freshly prepped and good.

I am not Persian, but I have been learning about, cooking, and eating Persian food for about 20 years. Sadly, Denver has been wanting in the tasty, affordable and unpretentious Persian food genre for quite some time. . .Not anymore!

I have eaten there a few times since they opened  about a week ago (yes it is that good).  Everything is fresh and cooked to order.  The staff, although still learning the ropes, is very enthusiastic and helpful.  The owners have greeted me every time as soon as I walked through the door, and they clearly are excited to present their food and their new restaurant. 

Babajoon&#39;s Basmati and Saffron rice (Chelo) is light, fluffy and buttery.  Topped with either the chicken or filet kabob (Barg), it is heavenly.  Their Koobideh ground beef kabob is also very tasty.  It is lightly seasoned, so you can taste that is made from quality beef.

I highly recommend the mast-o khiar (like a tzatziki) with the kabob.  Delicious!
Additionally, I tried their daily stew specials.  They serve a yellow split pea stew flavored with tomato, turmeric and saffron, with what I think was a little dried lime common in Persian cooking.  Absolutely heaven. 

My Mom and I particularly enjoyed the Mirza Ghasemi, which is a flavorful, rich, and smoky egg, tomato and eggplant dip, served warm with their homemade bread.  They even have an authentic Tanoor oven!

Another tasty treat, is the vegetable Torshi pickles.  Picture a tart, tangy, and herbaceous giardiniera, made from Mama&#39;s secret recipe. . .To die for!

Finally, they have my favorite Persian frozen desserts!  Babajoon&#39;s pistachio, saffron, and rose water ice cream is out of this world!  I always get this and the rice-noodle and rose water ices known as Fallodeh.  With a squeeze of lemon, it is wonderfully refreshing.  I get both and share with a friend because I can never decide which one I want.

If it sounds like I am gushing over this restaurant, I guess I am.  I have not had decent Persian food since I quit my job in a Persian restaurant in Monterey.  Babajoon&#39;s does not disappoint!

*A note about Persian food: it is not the same as Arabic and Greek food.  You will not see hummus or baba ghanoush there, so don&#39;t expect it.  There are however some wonderful and tasty dips that go perfectly with the delicate and subtle flavors of lime and saffron that flavor much of the cuisine&#39;s dishes."

The kabob was awesome, had a similar taste to a meatball, but it was very good. I got a greek style cucumber yogurt, rice and a tomato. This place is FANTASTIC. I would come here in a heart beat. I&#39;m taking my wife here for dinner Saturday night.

I got the lunch special beef stew with rice for 7.95 which is very reasonable for lunch. It&#39;s so much rice and to add a salad is way too much food for one person at lunch. I have to say my mind is not changed. I am dying for some sauce, something to give a little flavor that&#39;s not going to add on four bucks to my tab. The only free condiments are salt pepper and a paprika mix on the table that adds color but no flavor. I also had the menu explained to me and most items are 5 oz of meat for $10-12 with one side (rice or veggies or sauce). You can add 3 or 4 more ounces of meat for about $4 or add rice or salad or sauce for $4. Even a piece of pita bread will set you bake like $3.50. The food has tons of potential but the owners should open there eyes to why I am the only person on here for lunch at 12:30:( 

Also, the same friendly guys who explained the menu to me before he took my order (maybe the owner) sat down for his lunch while I was having mine. He had some rice a little  salad, just normal portions of each on one plate, and he started eating then went back for some sauce. Heeey yooouuu! We want the same thing that you want for lunch:)

I have to say the staff is sooo friendly and even brought me some tea on the house when I was finished with my meal. They seam passionate about the food they serve and the quality of it. I really want them to make it!"

Or something.  The website is not yet functional.  The menu confused me with options that seem inconsistent from item to item.  Some come with rice, some come with salad, some you have to choose.  Bread is either an included option choice, or you have to pay for it separately.  The service needed constant supervision from the owner who was super-friendly and hospitable.  The food took a while to come out, too.  

All this said, the food blew my mind.  I like Middle Eastern food, but I never expect high quality meat or unique flavors.  Here, I was eating a gourmet meal.  The chicken was insane, and so was the beef/eggplant dish.  They also have salmon on the menu, which is not my thing, but I know it&#39;s a preferred option for many people.  

All and all, I felt as if I started out giving pity sex to a short and geeky blind date but who then gave me the best orgasm of my life.  Nice surprise.  

In retrospect, it&#39;s a bit pricey as compared to other restaurants of this type--at least for all the options not included.  And, as someone said previously, some hummus and maybe falafel would be nice on the menu, too."

We tried to order online to pick up the food but the website wouldn&#39;t let me put the order through. It said my address was required but there wasn&#39;t a place for me to put my address in. I mentioned it when I called my order in and was told that the manager would be told about it. When I came in the woman at the front counter asked if I was there for the pick up order and then told the manager I was there. He came out and asked if I would be willing to call the guy working on their website because there seemed to be things getting lost when he calls them with a customer&#39;s story. Of course I was willing to help out so he gave me a free hummus and bread to use next time I came in. Even the guy I called about the website issue was friendly and took the time to listen to what I said and offered a solution for me to try along with saying he would play with it a bit based on what I said."

We ordered the Mirza Ghasemi appetizer with the fresh Babajoon bread, the Babajoon doogh, the Koobideh and Chengeh meals. Everything was excellent. My only compliant was the dill rice - I was expecting the typical dill rice that I&#39;ve come to expect from Persian restaurant with lima beans and fresh dill. This was dill weed rice with garlic! I wasn&#39;t a fan so I would recommend sticking with the white rice. I was a little surprised to see noon paniro sabzi on the menu for $5.99 - seems really expensive since that is typically free at Persian restuarants - but I guess I can understand it since it&#39;s more of a quick-serve place. As much as it doesn&#39;t feel like a true Persian meal without it, I couldn&#39;t get myself to spend that much on bread, cheese and herbs! The Koubideh seems like the best value and was seasoned very well. The place was very clean and the owner and staff very nice and attentive. We will definitely be back!"

I ordered the hummus and pita and a chicken kabob.  My friend ordered the beef and chicken combo and added a chickpea salad.  We also tried the yogurt soda.  All of our food was delicious.  I probably would not do the yogurt soda again, but that&#39;s a matter of taste.

The meat is hormone and antibiotic free, so you pay a dollar or two more for that, but we definitely thought it was worth it.  It&#39;s very easy to eat gluten free, dairy free, or just about anything free here.  You can order a la carte or get a combo plate.  While the food is cooked to order, this place offers fairly fast food without all the downsides of &#34;fast food.&#34;

I&#39;d recommend it for anyone who&#39;s health conscious or if you are having a business lunch and don&#39;t know if anyone has food allergies.  There&#39;s also a private dining area."

As soon as our family walked in we were greeted by the owner. He was very friendly and welcoming and explained the driving concept behind the restaurant. I saw that they had a stewed lamb special and just had to order it. My wife ordered kabobs and we got some kids meals with chicken and rice. The lamb meat was very tender and took little effort to fall off the bone. The broth the lamb meat was in was also amazing. The flavor of the broth made you realize just how long they had to cook it to render such a depth of different flavors. My wife also thoroughly enjoyed her kabobs. The vegetables were fresh and cooked well. All of my kids loved their chicken and rice. Throughout the meal one of the servers checked on us periodically to make sure our needs were met.  Overall if your looking for great home style mediterranean cooking then this is the place for you. Great food and great service! We will definitely be coming back here as often as we can.

Friendly workers, but the wait is a bit much. Took about 40 min for 6 tacos, I think they need to turn the heat up on the grill to cook the meat faster. There were about 3 people ahead of me so it&#39;s kind of a longer wait. I only came here because of the good reviews! There isn&#39;t horchata here either! Just the bottled soda. Again, I have no idea why it took so long, but for that reason alone, this will be my only visit. 

Even for dining in they mostly use disposables, so don&#39;t expect anything fancy, just really good food. Not a big deal, keeps things easy. I do highly recommend the tacos, some of the best street tacos I&#39;ve had, but not worth the wait when I know of many other places that serve up tacos just as good and x5 faster. If you got a bunch of time on your hands, come give this place a try, but if sitting around for almost an hour for some tacos isn&#39;t your thing, any other Mexican place would suffice."

In the time it took them to make six tacos I could have gone to the carniceria, bought the meat I needed, went to the panadería to get my tortillas, gone home, cooked the meat, made my taco, driven back, and still would have had 15 minutes before my food was ready. It probably took 45 min to an hour and I was the only person in line at about 3 on a Saturday. 

 Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food is good (however the tacos are small), the price is good (about right for the small tacos). But it&#39;s all about how much you value your time. If possible call ahead about an hour before you want your food and go pick it up."

The only downside was that it took 20 minutes for my breakfast burrito to come out. If you&#39;re on a time crunch, I would definitely come here earlier to wait for your food.

I want to give more stars because she seems to be the waitress, cook, cashier, and everything else since she was the only person I saw working there.  While I want to support independent businesswomen in Aurora, the food is what I came for and it was not great.  

I had the asada burrito, which was a good size, but there was only beef, beans, and rice in it.  The picture showed there would some veggies so that&#39;s what I expected.  Forgiving no veggies, the burrito didn&#39;t have much taste and the accompanying salsa was bland.  My boyfriend ordered 4 different tacos and he said they were fine, but they looked a bit small and on the dry side.  The guacamole didn&#39;t have any chunks of avocado or any other ingredient, like it had been pureed or bought from a store.  Same with the salsas."

I probably should have been concerned when another customer got up and said thy have to leave because of how long it took and they did not offer her a refund, a half assed apology is all they could mutter.

Not the best street tacos that I&#39;ve had in Denver, but still good and much less expensive than other notable street taco joints. Very small inside, but there are tables if you want to eat there. 

The good: good tortillas, tender meat, good verde salsa, lots of fresh cilantro, the price. Each taco is 1.50 (they are pretty small), nice ladies behind the counter doing the cooking. 

The bad: the &#34;guacamole&#34; - this entirely smooth and fairly thin paste tasted like store bought guacamole with preservative. Definitely not delicious fresh guacamole. Wouldn&#39;t have bothered me so much, but it&#39;s a dollar to add it. Just don&#39;t get the guac. Maybe they have fresh avocado, I will try to add this to my tacos next time.

Boyfriend got a chicken burrito and was in heaven. Breakfast burrito for me and lots of of guac. Walked in at 8:55 (they close at 9) and the women working were so unbelievably sweet. It was like, walking into my mothers kitchen late at night asking for a snack and her graciously abiding.

I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon and must have started a trend because the people came rolling in after me. I got three tacos for under $5 and they were made to order and pretty outstanding. I got the pollo, aside and carnitas. This was just enough to fill me up for a busy afternoon and so delicious! I could have had three more and been happy but neither my waist or wallet needs that.

Time was about 18:30hrs ish.  There are like 2 other families, dining in that evening.  Ahh...  Now I remember...  This establishment was once a Middle Eastern mom and pop shop aka (Tasty Kabob), which NO LONGER Exists, aka CLOSED which made me a little sad..

So now Tacos La Morenita, got hold of the space lease.

With the Simple Menu, they offer, we opt for the following items :

*  Asada (Beef) Smothered Burrito ($7.00)
*  5 Asada (Beef) Tacos @ ($1.50) each hence it was ($7.50)
*  1 order of Lengua Taco ($2.00)
*  1 order of Al Carbon (Beef) Taco ($1.50)
*  2 Bottles of Drinks @ ($1.90) each, hence ($3.80)

Our Dinner with tax was $23.54 that evening.

All in all, it was an OK Dinner.  Hubs said it was OK too, with regards to his order of Asada (Beef) Smothered Burrito, and the 5 Asada (Beef) Tacos he had.

I opt to have 1 Al Carbon Beef Taco and 1 Lengua Taco.  Both Tacos, I ate, nothing stood out.  YES, there are Cilantro and Raw Diced White Onions on all the Tacos we had.  I realized on my Al Carbon Beef Taco, they also put shredded Mexican Cheese, in which I was hoping I could have more of those.  ONLY 2 different kind of Salsa, or Sauces are given that evening too.  In terms of the Salsa, it was just OK..  NOT as spicy as we are hoping for.

The lovely ladies who are behind the counter took our orders and one of the Elderly Lady, cook our order.  Both ladies are indeed courteous, though I cannot deny, our order too awhile for it to be ready.

Left the establishment about 19:20hrs ish.

C&#39;mon, star-stingy people, get over yourselves.  This is her livelihood!.  You are not critiquing some high end eatery.  It&#39;s a street taco joint with a few other items on the menu.  The owner is a very sweet, humble lady making living with her delicious, affordable, awesome food and service.   Street tacos are supposed to be that size to fit in the palm of your hand, fyi.  
Also, if the guacAMOLE is ordered pre-made, I can&#39;t say I blame her.  Avocados ripen too quickly if you&#39;re not selling a lot of guacAMOLE on a daily basis.   Would you want to throw your profits out with the trash all the time?

The addition of a few new elements, they still seem to be having trouble with one of their walls, makes the place much more inviting and less scary.

Bacon, ham, carnitas, sausage and chorizo all with green chilli. As mentioned on previous reviews, there are really only 2 ladies behind the counter. So if you are looking for a quick burrito like Santiago&#39;s, don&#39;t come here. We waited about 15-20 minutes for our 5 burritos since the order was placed. I think we&#39;ll call in first next time. That being said, the lady is cooking one burrito at a time and during the wait it smelled delicious! Once we got our order, we had another 20 minutes drive home before consumption. This tested the temperature, by the time we dug in it was still nice and warm. 

First impression after cutting my burrito in half: gooey center, eggs, bacon, diced potatoes, melted cheese and my perfect view of the right amount of green chilli. The tortilla wasn&#39;t soggy or wet and had a good hold without falling apart after your first bite. I noticed there weren&#39;t many pictures on how the breakfast burrito looked on the inside, so I&#39;ll attach one to my review.

The burritos came with red and green salsa on the side. Both complemented it very well. Green salsa is a bit tangy and has a kick to it, red has a lot of depth and feels like it was roasted. Loved them both! 

So all in all, give this place a try. I definitely will go back to try their other menu items. Seems like the chef puts a lot of effort in her food. Thanks for the morning fuel!"

So far, I am finding that is correct. This hole in the wall taco joint is a fabulous find. Cheap cheap and more cheap. I love some street tacos and they are only $1.50 each at Tacos La Morienta. Nothing on their menu is above $7.50. They barely speak English and they provide some of the best verde salsa I have ever had. I got 5 tacos and Brian got a smothered burrito. Cheap dinner and extremely good food. When I asked for extra verde sauce, she gave me a helping portion with a smile.  I love this place and it is now my go to for tacos in Aurora."

They are almost always hole in the walls, they have gringo scaring items on the menu (beef tongue anyone?), Spanish is the primary language spoken, and the menus are short and specialized. 

Tacos La Morenita hits all the marks. The sign outside the tiny storefront simply says, &#34;Tacos.&#34; I love it. Seating is limited and most people get their orders to-go. When I walked in I think I was the only person who ordered in English. And the menu is limited but authentic. All great signs. 

Specifically, one item caught my attention. The window outside proudly boasts about their famous Green Chilli Nachos. I can&#39;t ever say no to a great set of nachos, so my mind was made. 

The nachos are incredible. I opted for pollo. An absolutely huge portion for $6.50. Topped with generous amounts of avocado, lettuce, sour cream, cheese... and oh my... that green chilli/salsa mixture. So unique and delicious. They have a pretty strong authentic spicy kick, so be prepared. Really the best nachos I have had in a very long time. 

The tacos are very good too, but a little dry for my preference. In any case, I will be back again and again for those nachos."

I also had an excellently balanced, tasty platter of Green Chili Nachos with Asada. The layering was such that there wasn&#39;t any bare chips in the bunch. Chips, steak, beans, cheese and chili were arranged with care. Then they were topped off with avocado and sour cream. Each chip had a bit of flavor that was outstanding. But it was tasty but a little odd that there wasn&#39;t any jalapenos. I was told later I could have pickled or fresh. I finished it without adding them as it still tasted great.

The food is awesome, its very cheap and fresh. Portions are small but cant complain for what you are paying. It took about 15 min to cook my food and the whole time she was cooking she had a full conversation with me. Very polite, nice and with such great manners. I ordered carne asada fries(small order), 5 tacos(small tortilla) and 1 sope(regular size). They didnt know what carne asada fries were so i had to explained it to her and she did a great job. The tacos were great and so was the sope. My only complain would be that the green sauce is very spicy. 

Its a must...the ladies cooking that night said they were from Los Angeles,CA but they are originally from Guadalajara,Jalisco. This mom and pop taco shop will guarantee you great food and great service...So stop by and get your self some tacos. I really recommend to call in the place gets packed very quickly on weekends."

They have a small menu but everything is cooked to order. Seating is small so take out the is best option. Call your order in otherwise you&#39;ll be waiting 10-15 minutes for them to cook it. Even longer if they&#39;re busy. 

It&#39;s well worth the wait though. So much flavor in such a small taco! And at $1.50 each I&#39;ll never eat another taco anywhere else! The chicken and carne asada are my favorites! 

Only suggestion would to add a seafood protein(shrimp or sometime of fish) and a side of black beans!

Reminds me of traveling through Mexico or South Texas and stopping on the street for some tacos. They&#39;re that good!

There isn&#39;t much room to sit down - tables only seat 2. This is just a warning in case you&#39;re hoping for a place to have a sit down meal.

I had tacos, my boyfriend had a torta. Both were delicious! The salsa they provide, too... GOOD. Taking these things to go and heading over to Dry Dock made for a great Saturday afternoon.

About the food - it is straight forward, super authentic Mexican food. You get street tacos in pork, beef, tongue or chicken. You can also get burritos, sandwiches and quesadillas with the same meats. No alcohol is served. Expect typical Mexican and American sodas to drink."

The Asada tacos were very bland. The meat didn&#39;t taste marinated, if it was I&#39;m not sure what it was marinated with because it had almost no flavor. 

The Adobada tacos were weird. I&#39;m pretty sure they use cloves in their Adobada marinade because I could taste cloves and as a result the flavor was very odd and not something I&#39;d order again."

There are not enough places to get that kind of food in this area.  However, I think that Tacos La Morenita is a worthy successor.  First off, they are not spending a lot of money on decor (which you cannot eat).  They put up some fresh paint, and cleaned up the dining area (which is appreciated).  However, they are still using the Moroccan  tagines for decoration, as well as the framed poster of middle eastern spices.  Kind of funny, but who cares?  The tacos are $1.50 each, and they were quite good.  They use the double tortilla here.  I appreciate this, because your taco does not fall apart.  I tried the carnitas, the adobada, the asada, and the al carbon (sadly, they do not offer al pastor).  I did not try the pollo or the lengua.  All of them were good.  They had solid flavor, were served with the traditional onions and cilantro, and were tasty.  None of them was what I would call outstanding, but none had any issues either.  

I had a can of soda with my tacos.  They also offer mexican soda in the bottle and bottled water.  Other menu items include tortas, quesadillas, burritos and sopes.  They also have breakfast burritos.   On the weekends they offer menudo. The ladies working on the day I came in were both friendly."

My wife and I have tried just about everything on the menu other than the Menudo (which is only served on Saturday), but we will be stopping in to try that this weekend.

Now on to the review:  Having lived in San Antonio and visited a few small towns in Mexico I am very critical of most Mexican restaurants. However as soon as we walked in the door we could tell this was going to be an authentic experience. You know that it cant be bad when every one of the 10 or so people in the small dining area were speaking Spanish. That is a good sign.....

We ordered the Tacos for the kids, Carnitas for myself and a bacon breakfast burrito for my wife. Rather than being served from a steam table,  the very personable ladies behind the counter made everything fresh to order. Later I would learn that they actually go through a great deal of trouble to make sure all of their ingredients are fresh and not pre-made then held over.

Now on to the food..... Oh my, really, oh my !!!! Even my children noticed the difference. The Tacos were FRESH authentic and amazing (not the Americanized versions my kids were used to) the Carnitas (how I judge most Mexican places) were nothing short of perfect. And the burritos..... Well we have been back once or twice a week, EVERY week, since we found this place. My wife usually orders the Bacon breakfast burrito, myself I like the Bacon and Chorizo breakfast burrito. However we also recommend the Chili Fries, Carnitas, Tacos and honestly have yet to find anything on the menu they don&#39;t prepare excellently. 

We have been back many times since, and can honestly say that this is probably the absolute best &#34;Mom and Pop&#34; taco place in all of Aurora. It is certainly the best we have had. 

While probably not deserving of Five stars in the traditional sense, as mentioned it is a &#34;Hole in the Wall&#34; type of establishment, however I base my ratings and reviews on the ability of the restaurant to deliver what you are expecting when you walk in the door.

La Morenita delivers a product that goes far beyond what I ever expected when I walked in and at an amazing price for the quality, freshness and care that goes into each order. Five Stars is all I could give, to give four would be to underestimate the authentic amazing food they serve.

Great Job !"

Got 2 chicken tacos and they simple but delish. The meat was very flavorful! I loved the red and green salsas they had - and would have likes a little more topping on my taco, maybe lettuce or tomatoes - but being a newby I didn&#39;t ask! I will next time! We also saw the nachos and suckered ourselves into those. Umm, yum! Chips, refried beans, chicken, green chili and cheese. You can&#39;t go wrong! Also big slices of avocado! I also tried a sopes and this was so yummy, sort of like a mexican english muffin with beans, chicken, tomatoes, queso, sour cream. It was really tasty and 1 was super filling, especially with all the other food!

It is priced really well and e staff is super friendly! I will be back for sure!"

I&#39;ve only been here a few times so far but will keep coming back.  The food is great and the price is right.  It is probably the freshest Mexican food you will ever have.  The people cook the food on a large griddle top stove right where you can see.  And one of the times I was there I got nachos, and I saw her cut the tortilla and fry the chips right then.  The people are very friendly.  The inside of the restaurant isn&#39;t much to look at so you would probably prefer take out.  So far I would recommend the nachos, sopes, and burritos."

Complementary tomatillo and red chile sauce are also provided with your order.  Due to the dining area size we order to go and everything is packaged in fine order.

No rice and beans here which is just fine.  Those who relish (Lengua) tongue, can also get their fix via taco, sope, quesadilla as well.

Everything cooked like grandma used to make. Prices are very reasonable, true to form menu, and if you are unfamiliar with the cuisine our server did an excellent job in describing the flavors to expect.

Pork BBQ plate is delicious, get the garlic rice with it and the pickled papaya for the side (somewhat fatty/sweet pork with a tangy spicy pickled papaya on the side is a great combo). If you like pork belly, give their lechon kawali a try, it&#39;s crispy and served with a sweet liver sauce (so good). 

I give it 4 stars because I am definitely a fan and others who come here will get a cultural culinary experience. 5 stars if they were more consistent with what they have available.. sago at gulaman they were out of sago, and the dessert shelf was empty (sad panda). Something for them to work on but doesn&#39;t take away from them just being awesome."

I really wanted to like this place, but only found it to be mediocre at best.  It was an especially warm day so when the food server asked what I wanted to drink, I asked for the sago gulaman.  &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but we do not have that.&#34;  What?! What do you mean you don&#39;t have it? Ugh.  So when it came time to order, we asked for kare-kare.  &#34;Sorry, but we ran out yesterday.&#34;  What?! Okay, so you ran out yesterday.

I had the veggie eggrolls (way better than the ones in Chinese restaurants), Kare-Kare Oxtail soup, Lechon Kawali pork belly, halo-halo, and Sago Gulaman.

This time we were impressed! The service was friendly and fast!  We were told to sit anywhere we like, and as soon as we sat down our waitress was there ready to take our orders with a smile.
We started out with Lumpia Shanghai, waters, and 2 calamansi juice. Juice was good. The Lumpia had the meats coming out of the rolls but the flavor was still good.  
For our main dishes we ordered the Lechon Kawali, Daing Na Bangus, and Sisig. Let&#39;s just say there was none left! The Lechon Kawali was crispy but not dry. The Bangus was fried just right. And the sisig was full or flavors with perfect texture.  
Even though we were already full, we still ordered the Halo Halo. This was my wife&#39;s favorite part of the meal because she hasn&#39;t had this in a while. This too was good and definitely something to try if one has never had this before.

We (4 sisters) ordered an appetizer and four dishes: the Shang Hai Lumpia, the Lechon Kawali, the Pancit Bihon, the Chicken Adobo, and the Kare Kare.  For desert we ordered two Halo Halo, Ube and Coconut.

The Shang Hai Lumpia were just that, tiny beef egg rolls.  It reminded me of the frozen Lean Cuisine Fajita Style spring rolls at your local grocery store.  

The Lechon Kawaili was very fatty, oily and BLAND.  It came with a dipping sauce on the side that none of my sisters and I were fond of.    

The Pancit Bihon was by far the most likable dish.  It had texture and a palatable flavor.  

The Chicken Adobo was dry and sad.  Each of us took a bite of the chicken and left that dish alone.  It was so dry that when pulled apart it kinda just shredded into pieces.  The flavor was also weak.  I&#39;ve heard great things about Adobo chicken and this was truly a disappointment.  

The Kare Kare was okay but bland.  It had a strong beef flavor and hearty.  We added salt and it went from a 2/10 to a 5/10.  

The garlic rice was the Best but I wouldn&#39;t come back to just eat that here.

The service was good.  Two young lady helped us out.

The two Halo Halos we ordered were yummy.  Two sisters didn&#39;t like the beans.  Next time, if I ever go back, I think I&#39;ll just ask for a scoop of Ube, Coconut, Mango and Pineapple ice cream and skip all the extras.  

I do not anticipate coming back here with all the other Asian restaurants in the area. 

Total cost: $80 with tips."

For starters, the chicken adobo was meh...tasted okay, but the chicken was extremely dry.

So, I cannot say this place is the best filipino restaurant ever but my boyfriend and I like it here. The waitress is very friendly and always remembers us and our orders (especially mine since I always order the same thing unless they are out!) 

I always order the Longaniza which is a sweet and spiced sausage that is seasoned to perfection. They make their own sausages and I love it!!! I&#39;ve also tried other dishes but by far this is my favorite. Note: Their garlic rice is also worth trying if you like garlic. 

On the other hand, my boyfriend usually orders Sisig or Kare-Kare. They are both good but I prefer Kare-Kare because the oxtail in Kare-Kare is very tender but the pork in Sisig is fried, chewy, and oily. Keep in mind though, Kare-Kare is not very salty nor sweet. Some might say it needs some salt but the red side dish (that comes with the dish)  acts as a salt and when ate together, it is perfection.

Overall, great place to go if you want to try filipino food!

Ambiance: very casual (don&#39;t expect too much)
Staff: very friendly (only one waitress)
Food: pretty good
Cleanliness: might not be the cleanest restaurant I&#39;ve ever seen but sometimes those places have the best food! :)"

If its busy, aka all 6 tables are full, just be patient. If you see a dirty table, tell the waiter you&#39;re waiting for the table and maybe, just maybe, they&#39;ll clear it off for you in about 5 minutes. 

The food is delicious. Garlic rice on the side and give me two scoops. An order of the lumpiang shanghai but bring an extra sweet and sour sauce cause that isn&#39;t going to cut it. The chicken or pork BBQ on a stick is street food like you want it to be. Salty, smokey, and a little sweet. Good stuff"

The sago is a disaster. Tastes like water with boba. Horrible. Worse sago gulaman I&#39;ve ever had. 

The sinigang was a major disappointment. I expected some jaw tingling soup. It wasn&#39;t very sour at all. I came here for sinigang, this is not sinigang. 

The lechon I ordered just because. I loved fried pork fat so I figured I&#39;d get it as a filler and a snack.  Thank goodness I did as it was all I ate. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Crispy but soft. So good. This dish is why I even gave this place 3 stars.  

I drove an hour+ to eat here. I would not do it again. If it was 10/15 minutes away I&#39;d probably come back for the lechon."

They were out of a couple of things... I forgot to mention in my first review that they were out of A LOT of stuff. 

Anyway, just like what most reviewers said... It takes awhile to get your food. I&#39;m assuming they cook some of it fresh. The garlic rice was a miss, which was a shame-- the last time I had garlic rice here, it was amazing.

The nilagang was really delicious, good broth. It didn&#39;t have a lot of meat though. The sinigang was okay at most (most sinigang tastes the same to me anyway), but it lacked the meaty pork; it was mostly bones. 

Since I live in Denver, I don&#39;t have much options for filipino food. I think it&#39;s time I start learnin&#39;!"

I am so happy to get my Filipino fix finally!! Coming from Hawaii where you can get authentic Filipino food not only at many a restaurant, but probably your best friends family&#39;s house I am grateful there is at least one place I can go here :) I recently celebrated my birthday and I knew I had to have me some delicious Pinoy fare. 

Sunburst Grill reminds me of home. Everything from the decor and furniture and colors that never really match, the worker that is friendly in a way only someone from the Philippines can be, Filipino television with people singing terribly, and the FOOD!!!! I was one happy son of a bitch on my birthday :D We started off with the Shanghai Lumpia as an app with sweet chili sauce. These looked like meat cigarettes the way they were rolled. Very yummy and good for two. I wanted something completely unhealthy for my meal so I went with the Lechon Kawali. It is a fatty pork dish that has crunchy skin and tons of fat. I think more fat than meat, but I was in heaven!!! It also came with garlic rice that would satisfy any garlic lover. Perfect combo but you can not eat this too often or suffer a massive heart attack. At least you&#39;ll be happy while eating it :) I was also super excited to get HALO HALO!!!! This Filipino dessert is a perfect way to end your meal. My fav part has always been the ube ice cream and the way it mixes with the shaved ice. So refreshing! This is something very different for dessert and you won&#39;t find anything like it in Colorado. It brings back great memories every time I eat it :) 

I am one happy asian now that I have a local Filipino restaurant to go to! Sunburst Grill seems like it is a place to go for lunch and can get pretty busy. There was only one server while we were there, but he gets to everyone and the food still comes out pretty quickly. Great new place I have discovered! I  will be back maybe for some &#34;chocolate meat&#34; which is not chocolate! It&#39;s blood! lol!"

The Longaniza is made here from scratch, and sometimes comes in patties. The generous portions of garlic rice and eggs that came with it were heavenly. I had bbq pork skewers the first visit and Tocino the second. Both delicious.  The skewers came with a small side of Pinakbet, vegetables with shrimp paste, that I couldn&#39;t get enough of.

A parfait glass of halo-halo capped off this satisfying meal perfectly.  The family who own and operate Sunburst Grill couldn&#39;t have been friendlier or more attentive.  Great service."

It was my first time eating Filipino food, so I was a little put off by the strange new flavors, but my overall impression was good.  

Sorry, I don&#39;t remember the names of what I ordered, but the main dish was fried pork with garlic rice and pickled mango.  The pork was good, but very different from what I was expecting: I thought it was going to be like a schnitzel, but it was more like chicharonnes - crispy fried pork and skin, very crunchy and greasy but good!  The pickled mango was yummy - my only complaint is that I only got a little bit of it, about as much as you&#39;d get ginger at a sushi place.  The garlic rice was the stand out winner:  hot, garlicky without being offensive, and buttery.

For dessert I ordered something I can&#39;t pronounce that was like a Filipino souffle.  It came baked on a banana leaf and tasted a bit like really moist cornbread with banana flavoring and topped with coconut.  It wasn&#39;t as sweet as most desserts, more savory, but it my book, that&#39;s a good thing.

Overall the food was good but not something I see myself craving very often, so the food I&#39;d give 3 stars.  The service, however, was excellent.  An older man (the owner?) seated me at the bar and chatted me up about what was on TV while I waited for my food to be cooked.  He was attentive about refilling my drink and checking in on me without hovering and was perhaps one of the nicest people I&#39;ve ever met in the service industry.  Based on his kindness and hospitality (plus the garlic rice) I&#39;ll be back to see if I can find a dish that better suits my palate."

The owner was so graceful to open his restaurant just for us.  This review is long overdue.  We were here on Tuesday October 26th 2010.  I did not know they changed their timing, but when I made the reservation, the owner said its ok, just for us, he is willing to cook for us.

I cant deny it took awhile for them to cook all the glorious delish food for our group which there are 13 of us while we are there.  I even &#34;warned&#34; my frens to have slightly more patience waiting for their dinner since its a mom and pop shop.  They cooked the dishes individually and from scratch!

If I could recall properly, these were what the group ordered :

*  Vegetable Egg Rolls
*  Chicken Barbeque Platter
*  Pork Barbeque Platter
*  Crispy Pata
*  Inihaw na Pusit
*  Shrimp Skewer Platter
*  Tinolang Manok
*  Nilagang Baka
*  Kaldereta
*  Daing na Bangus
*  Salmon Grill
*  Sisig
*  Halo Halo
*  Turon

My main entrees were Grilled Squid (Inihaw na Pusit) and Kare Kare.  My main entree came with Garlic Rice.  I like the Kare Kare, its comfort food Filipino style for my taste bud!  I was slighlty disappointed with the Grilled Squid, coz its was way too sweet due to the soy sauce.

Above anything else, I would like to extend my many thanks to the owners of SunBurst Grill, for cooking for us on their DAY OFF.  At the end of the evening, I also purchased Chicken Barbeque Platter to go for Hubs.  I dont mind returning to this establishment when needed."

We yelped and found this place near the office. None of us had ever tried Philippines&#39; food ever before so we were kinda intrigued. One thing to keep in mind is that they use pork and chicken for everything. When I asked whether they had any vegetarian options he said &#34;we can take special order for you, we dont usually have anything vegetarian&#34;. I got the thin noodles (Bijon) with veggies and eggs and it was amazing. The egg rolls that I got as an appetizer were really good too.

We decided to try out a weird dessert called &#34;Halo Halo w/ ice cream&#34; We decided to go with Taro Ice Cream for the ice cream. It was awesome. Even the Flan that we took was really good. 

Definitely a place to go back to.

The only thing we did not like was the person serving us (I am not sure if he was the owner) kept interrupting our order and kept advising us against whatever we wanted and keep disagreeing with out choices. The food was good though."

The food was good especially the Bbq chicken but they didn&#39;t have some of the menu items we wanted and for the price you pay, the portions of food is not what I&#39;m used to.

They do not have a liquor license, so we tried ALL of their juices: mango, coconut, and their version of lemonade - all good. We got some spring rolls which were HUGE. We tried a noodle dish that was very breakfasty even though not on the breakfast menu. The big hit was the char-grilled chicken with garlic rice. Garlic rice is my new favorite thing! We also made sure to get the Halo Halo for dessert and ended up taking home two other interesting desserts from their case: a tri-color rice pudding and a sweet corn pudding. 

Our service was fine. We did not wait for anything. I can&#39;t give it 5 stars because they don&#39;t serve alcohol, the decor is outdated, plus some other minutia. I will say it was clean and can recommend Sunburst and will return!"

Service is very slow as the server was also the cashier and busboy.  Food was decent and portions are reasonable for individualized plates, however pricing is around $8 to $9 for entrees.    I really enjoyed the Longaniza and Lechon Kawaki.  I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the Kare Kare or the chicken adobe as they were just ok.  We asked for the halo halo dessert but they could not deliver due to staff shortage.  None the less the service was friendly, food acceptable and atmosphere homey because of the size of the establishment.  It&#39;s honestly the closest Philipino food place near me (30min away) so if I ever need my fix I can go here. I&#39;m still on the look out for other good eats!"

Food Favorites:
* BBQ Pork Plate - skewered pork, seasoned well and grilled to perfection
* Pancit Bihon - very thin noodles with meat and veggies... sprinkle some lemon juice, and you&#39;re good to go.  Although there&#39;s some resemblance to Korean Chop Chae, don&#39;t expect the flavor to be anything like that... this dish is light (not oily) with subtle flavor.
* Halo Halo Dessert with Jack Fruit Ice Cream - fruits, beans, jellies, leche flan, crushed ice, evaporated milk, ice cream, and other delicious goodies in a large bowl... overall ridiculously yummy!

Also Recommended:
* Chicken Adobo - simple flavors and ingredients; looks like boring stewed chicken, but very tasty

Prices/Value: for three entrees and a large dessert, the total came to $27.  The two of us were happy and stuffed, and we even had a small box of leftovers to enjoy later.  For fresh food that&#39;s tasty and not greasy, this is an excellent value.

Service: excellent; even when every seat was taken in this place, the one waiter managed to juggle everything perfectly for every table.

Ambiance: somewhat small (maximum seating is around 40); flat screen TV showing the Olympics (nice touch); relatively clean.  

Parking: in the strip mall lot.

Check this place out... even if it&#39;s just for dessert (especially the halo halo), you won&#39;t be disappointed."

But I can tell you this:  everything I tried at Sunburst Grill was fantastic!

A bunch of friends, including Kat A and Hans O, and I checked out Sunburst Grill last night and much to everyone&#39;s pleasure and amusement, it was an amazing experience.  

Sunburst is situated in an unseemly strip mall, but certainly is doing the strip mall a favor by locating itself within its realm.  You&#39;ll be greeted by a cozy space and a friendly and attentive staff.  The menu is extremely helpful: it explains all of the Filipino names, so you&#39;re not guessing about what you&#39;re ordering.  (Thank you!)  Because we were such a large group, we all ordered several different dishes and shared everything.  Twas a lovely communal, familial even, experience.  All of the dishes were fabulous and flavorful.  We even splurged on desserts and had mango ice cream, ube ice cream, and halla-halla (sp?).  Ah, so good!  And most importantly, easy on the wallet!

I&#39;m thankful Sunburst is reasonably close to my home because I will definitely be back!"

And being in a city where there are virtually NO Filipino restaurants and much less Filipinos..I didn&#39;t think I really had any other choice. But I had heard about this place from Thomas S some time ago and got quite a few of us together to trek down to Aurora to check it out.

Sunburst Grill is located in a pretty nondescript strip mall, blink-and-you miss it. We were greeted very warmly by the staff. We got right down to business and ordered lumpia, kare-kare, sisig, chicken adobo, kaldereta, pancit and lechon. We all decided to share each other&#39;s plates.

Let me say this-yes I am Filipino, but I am probably one of the pickiest eaters on the planet and because of this I don&#39;t eat a lot of my own cuisine. I pretty much stick to the things I know like adobo, lumpia, kaldereta, pancit etc.  I couldn&#39;t even bring myself to try the kare-kare, athough I hear it was good. My favorite of the night: LECHON! We liked it so much we ordered another serving. 

We also ordered puto, leche flan and halo-halo for dessert. The halo-halo brought me right back to my childhood days. And topped with ube ice cream..yum!

I got to speak to the staff for a little while and see where exactly I can track down those Filipino goodies I so crave (Lotus Asian Market!) They were super friendly and made me homesick for my family, and I&#39;m not just sayin&#39; that cuz they are also Filipino! 

Two things though that I disliked-one, the location is so far from my house and two, the portions could be a tad bit bigger. But I will be back, oh yes I will!"

At one point, Aurora boasted no less than four, yes, four, eateries of this type for my delectation. Now, for various reasons, we are currently down to one. But what a clean, cozy one it is.

Yes, SunBurst Grill does have sandwiches, hot dogs and the like. But c&#39;mon, wouldn&#39;t you rather have some Sisig (pork chunks served in a sizzling pan with an egg to mix in?)

Or what about Kare-Kare, a peanutty tripe and oxtail casserole which is even better with the fragrant (hee!), salty neon-purple shrimp paste called Bagoong. Yes, it&#39;s a little different, but would I steer you wrong?

You could also come just for Merienda (nibbles) and have Bibingka, a densely sweet butter-cheese-salted-egg cake. But make sure you pencil in a nap afterward!

To drink, how about some Calamansi (native lime) juice, or a coconut juice to moisten your palate? End on a high note with Leche Flan (Pinoy cheesecake) or Halo-Halo (wow, how do I describe this? Combine fruits, beans, coconut milk and crushed ice in a glass, top with mango or purple yam ice cream and you get the picture. Don&#39;t forget, Halo-Halo means &#34;mix-mix&#34;!).

SunBurst Grill is so delicious, and the manong (older gentleman) who owns it and his staff are so friendly, that I can&#39;t help giving it 5."

I&#39;ve been here twice now and will continue to come back. It&#39;s a cute, casual, small restaurant. I been to other filipino restaurants in Los angeles where they usually serve it Panda style, but this wasn&#39;t like that. 

The Kaldereta is probably my favorite on the menu. It has a lot of flavor and really tender beef brisket. Sinigang is really good too if you like sour soup. Crispy Pata was delicious. Pancit palabok is also one of my favorites. 


Kare-kare was a big disappointment. The first time I ordered it - they had already run out. It takes a long time to boil oxtail when you&#39;re making it in kare-kare so I understand. The second time I ordered it they actually had it, but there was no flavor. 
Maybe it&#39;s just cause I&#39;m use to how my parents cooked it. With the agaman cooked in the sauce. They don&#39;t have diniguan (chocolate meat) on their menu, but they have most of the popular filipino dishes on the menu."

Of course, I went just before the Pacquiao fight, so I had the entire restaurant to myself.  I&#39;m half Filipino and grew up on Filipino food since my aunt did all the cooking, so braving the 45 minute drive to this place was well worth it, even if it meant I had to eat alone.
I started with Lumpiang Shanghai and ordered Lechon Kowali for my entree.  The lumpiang was crispy and hot without being greasy.  It was also a very large serving size so I ended up taking most of it to go.  Lechon kowali holds a special place in my heart.  It reminds me of the picnics we would have when I was a kid, where the extended family would gather and someone would order a whole roasted pig.  Then an uncle would don and apron and a large butcher knife and hack the pig to bits until every bone was picked over.  Crispy, delicious carnage.  The Sunburst Grill version did not disappoint.  Crispy skin with tender white pork on the inside, served with white rice, papaya salad and the traditional liver sauce.  Delicious!
Since I drove such a long way, I decided to take Kare Kare and a Bibingka  to go.  Unfortunately, it had been so long since I had had Kare Kare that I forgot it was traditionally made with tripe.  Tripe is one of the few ingredients that I just cannot stomach (pun intended) thanks to the lovely barnyard smell that filled the entire house when my aunt used to cook it.  I picked around the tripe and the oxtail was delicious and tender, and the peanut broth was also flavorful.  Bibingka is one of my favorite desserts of all time.  Sunset Grill&#39;s version is full of coconutty flavor with subtle hints of egg custard, topped with shaved coconut and baked into a banana leaf.  Incredibly delicious and beautiful.  
Sunburst grill definitely fulfilled the comfort food craving.  I only gave it 4 stars because while the food is wonderful, it will never beat my aunt&#39;s cooking.  Mabuhay!"

We have never had Filipino food before. So, when we started to look overwhelmed by the menu, the waiter (owner?) helped us extensively with ordering. Since we were getting our order to-go, we were going to head over the the liquor store across the street while our food was being made. With this information, he also recommended a Filipino beer to pair with our food.

The egg rolls are different from the usual Asian fare, but they were delicious with both pork and shrimp filling and very crunchy. I got the Sisig (after being I &#34;warned&#34; that it was pig parts) and it had great flavor and to-be-expected texture. We also got one of the noodle dishes, which was more of a crowd-pleaser.

We will definitely be back!"

The construction in the shopping center is nearly finished, so it wasn&#39;t tough to get in here (though I&#39;d probably swim some croc infested swamps if need be).  We started with Shanghai Lumpiah and then tried the Sisig (rockin&#39;!), the Longaniza (may need a 12 step program), Chicken Adobo, the squid dish (can&#39;t remember the name, but I haven&#39;t had squid that good in Colorado in... maybe ever!), Lechon Kewali and one other that my food addled mind can&#39;t quite recall.  Seeing as this was all for two adults and two fairly young kids, we took a great deal home and I&#39;m already waxing poetic about the Longaniza and garlic rice!

They weren&#39;t so slammed busy today as they were last time (every table full and a line three parties deep), so the proprietors had a chance to chat a bit.  Very personable and friendly to the kiddos.

My primary regret about this place (aside from taking so long to discover it) is that I am so stuffed to the gills from dinner that I haven&#39;t had a chance to try any of the tempting desserts - there&#39;s always next time!"

The dishes are awesome! Get a plateful of Lumpiang (mini pork/shrimp egg rolls or vegetable egg rolls) and the rice noodles dishes with the awesome seasonings are to die for and for under 7 bucks, its a great deal! I personally love their Crispy Pata(marinated and deep fried pork hock) Can we say CRACKLINS! surrounding a thick, meaty center! Super tasty! Probably not something you would want to eat everyday because well fat, fat, fat. Its also $16 which I think is a little steep because I can get those at the Mercado or Sav-a-lot for 1.99/lb, although the ones at Sunburst are particularly huge and meaty. I also understand that its a process to make it... it takes time. It also takes time to cook those so call ahead or dont be in a hurry. They have another dish with oxtails and tripe that im thinking of trying next time. Nah, ill prob get the Crispy Pata again. Yum! The pata, oxtails, and tripe reminds me of Menudo and Posole(which I grew up eating) since the ingredients are similar(probably why Im not scared to try them) but very different dishes and ethnicity of course. Dont forget to get the Garlic Rice, which is so very yummy! Very nice service and quaint little restaurant! Ive never run into a situation where they didnt have what I asked for and have never had bad service in the 3 or so years I have sporadically visited, eating in and ordering carryout.

We had Squid (of course), the sour soup (a completely satisfying meal in itself, don&#39;t miss it), the deep fried pork hocks (yes for the hock lover), and a rather ordinary tomato based beef stew recommended by the Americanized waiter.  I have to say, I wish I&#39;d tried the stew with bitter squach but I think he was afraid I wouldn&#39;t like it.  We loved everything else.

It looked like they had a different take on the usual dishes, so it must be a regional thing.  Everyone in my group seemed happy with their dinners, and the place was packed.

They can&#39;t really handle large parties, but they rearranged the restaurant for us.  The place is family owned, and our servers were the children of the owners.  Their daughter was in the 10th grade and she took our orders.  Her younger brother ran food to tables.  The service wasn&#39;t quick or efficient, but it was adorable.

I was sharing food with a friend at my table so we ordered the egg rolls to start along with diet cokes.  For our entrees we ordered the Chicken Adobo and the Sisig.

It was incredibly hot in the restaurant though it was chilly outside, so be prepared for that.  We slowly got our drinks as they brought them out one by one.  Our egg rolls came out at about the same time as everything else, and the Chicken Adobo was the first entree to come out.  It came out about 15 minutes before the Sisig.

The egg rolls were wide, with much more wrapper than filling.  I was expecting little &#34;cigars&#34; so that was odd.  After a bite, I gave the rest of mine to someone else.

We both ordered garlic rice and it was really good.  Most people put chili oil on it and we all gobbled it up.  The Sisig was a little too salty and very greasy, but the flavor was good.  We didn&#39;t finish it.

The Chicken Adobo was strange to me, though it was good.  The meat had been stewed for awhile and it was very tender and flavorful, but there was no sauce.  The dark sauce that I love was nowhere to be found.  The plate just consisted of a couple of pieces of plain chicken with some rice on the side.  We ate all of that dish, though.  It was good, but I wouldn&#39;t call it Chicken Adobo.

We ordered the Turon for dessert and it also wasn&#39;t what I was expecting.  It was just like like the egg rolls with a bit of underripe banana inside.  I ate the banana out from inside it and left all of the greasy, deep fried egg roll wrapper on the plate.

Other than a few green beans that came with one meal. there were no vegetables to be had on the entire table.  We all missed our veggies.

I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ll be back, though I wish them well.  The owners were chatting with us and they were very friendly.  It&#39;s definitely a popular restaurant."

But I ordered my favorite Lumpiang and it wasn&#39;t anything what I&#39;m used to.  They were hard with hardly any filling inside.  Then I ordered the Linguiza sausage which was so greasy and fatty that it made my tummy hurt after only a couple of bites.  My husband ordered the fish which was pretty decent, but everything else made us want to go to Taco Bell to get satisfied."

I think it sums it up well when Anthony Bourdain went to the Philippines and Augusto Elefano explained that Filipino cuisine isn&#39;t as world-famous as other Asian countries b/c we have so many islands and that contributes to our diversity.

Anyways, suffering from a lack of comfort food in Denver, I decided to head on out to Sunburst Grill off of Iliff and Chambers. The restaurant is small and quaint, however, stepping into the place immediately comforted me. Now, I went early on a Sunday afternoon and the only other people there was a Filipino family from California who were visiting and enjoying a good Filpino meal.

Now, when you order, you are going to have to be patient w/the food. Filipino food preparation is very tedious and takes a while (watching my Mother cook as a child). They have all the Filipino staples: Kare-Kare, which is oxtail, tripe, and some veggies in a peanut sauce served w/a side of ultra-salty (but ultra-good) bagoong shrimp paste. They have Sinigang which is a Tamarind-based stew w/veggies. They also have my favorite Lechon Kawali which is roasted and fried pork served w/garlic rice. 

They have other non-Filipino offerings such as sandwiches and hot dogs, but c&#39;mon! You are in a Filipino restaurant! For the beginners, I would start off slow and order Lumpiang Shanghai (essentially egg rolls, but much better), Chicken Adobo, and Pansit Bihon. Those dishes will help you ease into the wonderful world of food that no one else really celebrates!"

Inside, few tables, sushi bar with no sushi, clean, an aquarium, a kid greeting customers, a very cozy mom and pop shop.

Since we were in seven people and we are all comfortable in sharing, we ordered a bunch of food; lumpiangs, sisig, beef adobo, chicken adobo, kare-kare, lechon kawali, bihon. Plus desserts: flan, puto, and halo-halo...

I go to DenverAurora every summer to recruit/scout in the annual CO Fireworks tourney the City of Aurora puts on around the end of June. Over 100 softball teams from all ages with their families flock to Denver, Boulder, and Westminster since there are 2 other huge ASA softball tourneys going on. With over 200+ college scouts, not many are filipino. Since I am, I crave filipino on this trip ALL THE TIME. 

I get tired of eating at chain restaurants during this full week. 

So........one day headed to Olympic Park to go watch a 16U team from Hawaii, I glanced at the parking lot of Sunburst. No cars. So I drove on. Afterwards, on my way to Aurora Sports Park, I drove on Chambers again, no cars.....so I didnt bother to stop. 

Finally, on the last day of my trip. I just said &#34;eff it&#34;, I&#39;m gunna try it even though its empty. I ready the menu, picked chicken adobo over steamed rice (other option was garlic rice) since its hard to mess that dish up. 

To my surprise, it was very tasty! Almost as good as my father makes! While I was there, there was 3 phone orders all requesting for crispy pata. Even though when I went for lunch an no one was there, I wished I wouldve stopped days before. Sometimes you can&#39;t let looks win as hole in the wall places are usually good!

I found a place now that I can eat every summer when Im in Aurora!"

I looked up the menu before we went to this place for lunch...they had three vegetarian dishes on the menu - the squash and green bean in coconut curry, the mango-papaya salad, the eggplant banana salad. They were out of all three :(
So, finally I had a tossed iceberg lettuce salad (yea, that&#39;s very Filipino) and spring rolls.

Needless to say, the fat and hungry gal inside of me was well, still hungry. 

But I will say this - the hostess was so apologetic she had nothing else vegetarian...and I was pretty damn impressed with that. Being a vegetarian is not that easy, but I rarely ever have the waitress feel that bad about it. Its true...Filipino&#39;s are indeed the friendly!"

First off, location wise it&#39;s on A concourse up on the mezzanine. You literally just take an escalator up and you&#39;ll be there. Not that hidden but peoples brains turn to mush at an airport when it comes to directions.

The food itself isn&#39;t anything special but it&#39;s surprisingly good for something from an airport. The taste comes out to something that&#39;s slightly better than Chipotle. And it&#39;s not even that expensive compared to other airport fare. In all it&#39;s one of the better restaurants at the Denver airport.

Trust me, if you find yourself in this terminal there is nowhere else worth going besides Mesa Verde.

The food isn&#39;t half bad - of course only judging by airport standards. I mean, it sure beats the vending machine, amirite!? My chicken chimichanga was served rather like a fancy dish. That&#39;s fine. It tasted fine. The odd thing is I really wanted more tortilla. Sounds weird. But this thing tasted like a fried egg roll the size of your hand. Way to thin and filmy for a chimichanga tortilla. But hey you can live with that if you need to eat before your flight. 

If you even make your flight. Slow poke server over here doesn&#39;t come around to take orders or serve drinks or check on plates except for random 12 minute intervals.

Mesa Verde specializes in Colorado Mexican cuisine (similar to New Mexico type cuisine). I had the huevos rancheros for breakfast and it was delicious. Eggs smothered in a flavorful red chile salsa that had hints of cumin and lime, served on top of refried beans and crispy corn tortillas.

I tried a flight of whiskey for (three tastes) for $15 and had the carnitas tacos for $10.25. I always enjoy trying various drinks/food, so I asked for the waiter&#39;s top three whiskeys and he did not disappoint! They were all very good and each one was unique. Now mixing this with tacos before a flight probably wasn&#39;t the best idea, but they kept refilling my water so it worked out! Haha 

The carnitas tacos were very small. The meal came with three of them, rice and black beans (spicy!). It didn&#39;t quite fill me up all the way, but I still enjoyed the tacos a lot. Next time I am in Denver I think I will try something else on the menu, but if you are looking for something light - this is a great option!

Service left something to be desired - we asked for cream for coffee 3 to 4 times to multiple different people and by the time it came out we were done eating.

The last time I was here was returning from my interview in KS to Vegas thanks to Frontier Airlines.  Since that was almost 2 years ago (and I remember having the ceviche), I decided to go back today when my flight out of Denver was delayed for a delicious lunch.  I sat at the bar in front of a TV showing ESPNU, next to a nice guy who bragged about his daughter who was about to go to college.  

I ordered the salsa flight (fresh chips with 3 salsas: tomatillo-mild, pico-mild, and ranchero-spicy).  I also ordered the Colorado wedge salad without bacon.  I used to grab this salad to go from their express area and it was memorable!  First it came out with bacon but the bartender quickly took it back and got me a fresh one.

The wedge has roasted corn, chopped hard boiled egg, diced fresh tomato, queso fresco, and ranch dressing.  It is served on top of a bed of fried onions.  It really is scrumptious for a salad (and obviously not too healthy).  At any rate, it filled me up for the rest of the day and I did not need dinner.

This is a great spot to eat in Terminal A and also to watch sports.  It is one floor above the food court/shops/gates so take the escalator up from there.  If you are in a rush, there is an express ordering counter on the left side of the restaurant."

Let&#39;s get two negs out if the way. The only reason they didn&#39;t get a 5 star.

1. I was seated promptly, but had to wait a bit before someone noticed me. As in I almost left. Hostess dropped the ball? 
2. My breakfast burrito came out lukewarm after quite a bit of time. I don&#39;t mind waiting. Had two hours to kill. But don&#39;t make me wait for lukewarm food. It&#39;s like anticipating hot salty McDonald&#39;s crack fries in the drive thru late at night. And waiting and waiting...Just knowing the reason you are waiting is because they are making some fresh fries!  Just for you!! Then sensing something wrong because you can&#39;t feel the heat as your hand enters the bag and finds cardboard fries. Damn that sucks.

Pluses? It was smooth sailing from then on!
1. The server (Bar 1) was charming and attentive once they finally got to me. 
2. I asked the server to nuke my lukewarm burrito, and I likely would have been satisfied with that. Instead they brought ought a fresh one. It was fantastic...for airport food. Way better than anticipated.
3. The price is more than fair...for airport food.

Take the train downstairs to the A gates, look up and enjoy the view from the platform before you board, and go upstairs to the mezzanine. 

Quality food and a good place to drink if you have a long layover or get delayed.They even offer an Express side for to-go orders. 

In my experience, the food is traditional Colo. Mex-Tex. (Tex-Mex isn&#39;t the best description...) Buffalo and venison dishes are tasty and interesting, and they offer American standards (burgers, burritos, etc.) Good selection of appetizers including nachos, chips &amp; salsa, fries, and bacon-wrapped deliciousness.

They really shine in the Colorado seasonings and preparation for soups, chili and main dishes. Not afraid to use vegetables, and do it well. Even the salads have an interesting twist or two!  Haven&#39;t eaten breakfast, but it looks good.

I think the pork green chili is incredible, and the Sabana de Pollo was superb on a recent visit. (Grilled chicken breast covered with Asadero cheese and black beans, with TONS of finely chopped cilantro &amp; a few tomatoes on brown rice with seared serrano pepper. They brought two extra ones quickly when I asked. (Serranos are among my fave to grow and eat). 

Known for tequila and margaritas, they also offer a full bar (and Bloody Mary bar!) with specialty drinks and ~ a dozen taps, 6-8 local brews. Margaritas are freshly made, and classics (coin) are served in a double old-fashioned glass. I enjoy those very much, and the server&#39;s suggestion for the Corralejo Coin (w/ Corralejo Reposado) was great. It&#39;s smoother than other coins they offer.

Comfortable setting (and seating) with local art on the walls in the restaurant side.  My experience with service has been good or very good. A long time ago (15 years at least) it was also a smoking bar.  Fresh air is better than nostalgia, it turns out."

The service was horribly slow. We were there for over an hour. Luckily our flight was not scheduled to board for another 20 mins.

The buffalo queso dip was tasty but looked like it was sitting out for a while as there was a thick film on top. The food was mediocre at best the street tacos were only ok. Not flavorful. The Ceviche was missing onions and cilantro (but listed in menu). It also way had too many jalapeños. The Carne asada was cooked to the right temp but was charred. 

We asked for sour cream, a side of salsa and limes, all which were added to the bill but never brought out.

Came in on a Sunday morning for a beer and breakfast - the place is kinda out of the way in that you have to go up from the gate-level (to the airline club level), which means it is a bit less crowded (good).  

Breakfast skillet was awesome - had it veggie plus green chili - gc was great.  Prices for beer are reasonable and good selection (even have that epic 3% IPA silliness if you aren&#39;t used to 5000 elevation)."

I started with the buffalo dip (7.50$) with an extra side of pico/salsa (1$). Chips were warm and salty, just how I like it. The dip needed more salsa to bright the heaviness of all that queso. It was a lot, we barely finished 1/3 of it. 

Then we had the holy guac buffalo burger (med-rare) (13.50$) w a side of tumble weeds aka onion rangz (2.95$). Good stuff, solid burger. Oily onions. 

Finished the meal off w some Denver wings in BBQ sauce (9.50$). Very saucy &amp; delicious wings. BBQ sauce was tangy, smokey, &amp; had a hint of spice. 

Definitely the better choice in that terminal!"

Yes, it&#39;s true! Mesa Verde has it down pat. Located on the second floor above the endless chaos of the main concourse, ascend to Mesa Verde and treat yourself to an actual meal, while separating yourself from the throngs of airport humanity. 

I was seated for breakfast on the &#34;patio&#34; portion of the restaurant, and was delighted that I had a server who was friendly, attentive, humorous, and sensitive to the time limits of an airport patron. I wish I could remember his name!

The breakfast menu is great. For just a couple dollars more than the chain crap on the main level, you can opt for the breakfast basics or eggs and bacon, or you can really treat yourself to huevos rancheros or chilaquiles. Since I eat as much Mexican breakfast as I can when in CO, and this was my last meal before returning to not as authentic locales, I opted for the chilaquiles, and they were off the hook amazing. I especially dug the extra helping of both fresh and pickled jalapenos that I had to smother all over the dish! The salsa was amazing too, and even the coffee was tasty, with frequent refills.

There&#39;s something really nice about knowing of &#34;secret hideaways&#34; like Mesa Verde when you&#39;re in an airport. And when you have the luxury of a little time, or you&#39;re saddled with a delay, it&#39;s even better knowing that Mesa Verde is here, perched high above the airport madness, but still so close to the train and your gate."

We were quickly seated and noted that the restaurant itself is quite large. You have your option of main dining area, &#39;concourse patio&#39; or bar. We were seated in the back with a few other patrons, which was just fine.

I ordered a paloma to start and my husband had a beer. We were kindly brought waters and I was stoked as mine tasted like they had floated limes in it. Only to find out that it must have just been me/my glass as no refills tasted that way and my husband looked at me like I had 3 eyes. Anyhoo, wasn&#39;t a super fan of the paloma as it was very bitter, but it helped to cut the future spice in my food.

I ordered the barbacoa burrito and my husband had the chicken tacos. My burrito could have fed four people and was very good, though quite spicy. I think I made it half way through and sadly had to leave the rest. My husband exclaimed several times how much he enjoyed their beans and liked the tacos as well. 

Service here was the main thing that stood out, as it was fantastic. Our waters were never less than 3/4 full and we never had a dirty plate hanging out. Our server was wonderful and very nice.

After all, it might just be the last time for you to get a kick of that green and red chile Colorado does oh so well. 

Coming straight out of the side security entrance for Concourse A, I found this spot tucked away. Without anytime to sit down for a meal, I ordered a one of their skillets that consisted of diced potatoes topped with a blend of sautéed peppers and onions, chorizo, cheese, red chile and a couple of over easy eggs to go. Does that sound like a lot? It was. Does that also sound like a big ol&#39; mess? You betcha! My dad had recommended grabbing a breakfast burrito which I&#39;ll admit, would&#39;ve been a little less to take on. Unfortunately, I&#39;m not a huge fan of scrambled eggs so this skillet was more up my alley. If you are a BB lover, I suggest grabbing one of those.

Thankfully, this skillet was a delicious mess. I was a little wary while eating it at the gate before boarding my flight. The chile gave off a strong (yet mouthwatering) odor and I&#39;ll admit, when it was all thrown together in the styrofoam box, it didn&#39;t look all that appetizing. The most important part is I was able to scarf it down before boarding my flight. After all, this is DEFINTIELY not something I&#39;d want someone sitting on the plane next to me to be eating (although I&#39;m not a big fan of eating anything warm, odorous, etc. on planes, in general). Stick to pretzels, people.

Moral of the story? If your flight is at an unfortunate hour where breakfast beforehand just doesn&#39;t seem possible, Mesa Verde should be your first choice for that wakeup call."

Kudos to the kind airport employee who recommended going to the upper level to find Mesa Verde. It was indeed a step up from the typical airport food and alcoholic fuel depot. ESPN was on a couple TVs, but I grabbed a spot at the other side of the bar and fired up an episode of Breaking Bad to go with a brew or two.

Round 1: Mojo IPA from Boulder Beer (4 stars)
Round 2: Hazed and Infused Dry-Hopped Ale also from Boulder Beer (4 stars)

Fourteen beers were on tap (around $6.50) with a full bar for other drinks. The bartender was a sweetheart. Quick, but not a nuisance. Dare I say perfect?

For some pub grub to distract me during the boring scenes with Skylar, I started with Chips &amp; Guacamole ($7) plus some extra Jalapenos. The peppers added the right amount of kick ... just in time for Walt and Jesse to pull me back into the episode. I know I should of probably ordered Los Pollos Hermanos chicken or something, but for more food, I got a Street Steak Taco ($3.25) which helped fill in any gaps left from the guac.

With decent beers, perfect service, and filling grub, there&#39;s no reason I won&#39;t choose Mesa Verde again when stuck in Concourse A of the Denver Airport. Ask yourself, &#34;What would Heisenberg do?&#34;"

I had the Sábana de Pollo (chicken breast with Asadero cheese, black beans, and chimichurri with cilantro lime rice and a roasted serrano pepper) which was very good.  The chimichurri was delicious and the pepper added a nice bite to everything.  I just wish I&#39;d asked for a second serrano.

Boyfriend had the steak quesadilla. It was fantastic. Really good quality meat - tender and full of flavor (not fatty or chewy at all). I had the pork carnitas street tacos and a skinny margarita. Tacos were delicious. I&#39;d probably just order the house margarita next time. Over all, a great experience.

I got the Veggie Burrito and salsa flight. All the salsas had LOTS of ground black pepper in them which was kinda odd. Maybe that was to cover up the Pico de Gallo which seemed to be several days old and on the verge of going off. I didn&#39;t eat much of the Pico but now every time I burp I get reminded of how not very good it was. 

The veggie burrito wasn&#39;t horrible and at least had mushrooms and poblanos in it and not just beans and rice. However the mushrooms had some kind of very sweet teriyaki marinade on them which made me wish they weren&#39;t in there to begin with."

The restaurant is on the second floor of the A Concourse and is away from the crowds that frequent the restaurants before traveling to their gates. I was looking for a quick bite to eat before my flight and the lines for the usual breakfast spots were 20 plus people deep waiting for their coffee and donuts, thus I used my trusty Yelp app to guide me one floor up to a delicious Bacon Burrito with a steaming hot coffee and a newspaper. The bacon and eggs were still roasting and perfectly rapped with hot seasoned peppers and onions that hit the spot to wake even a vampire from a century slumber!

We had about an hour and wanted an entire meal so we sat down and ordered, but you can sit right in the bar and have quick service! 

We had their house tequila as a margarita, and it was not only tasty but strong too! They came out quick and just to order (on the rocks with salt)!

We shared the chips and salsa appetizer that comes with 3 different salsas! All 3 were tasty and worth trying. 

We then ordered the side salad which was great and large enough to share. They have a chipotle ranch that&#39;s very good and has a nice little kick to it!

Since we were going to be sitting on a plane for a couple hours we shared our dinner and it was good we did because the Chimichanga was huge! I asked for it to have the spicy sauce drizzled on it and it really added to the taste!

The manager was on site and very helpful, he answered our questions about the menu with knowledge and pride! The waiter was quick, efficient and helpful! Our only issue was the guacamole I ordered on the side never showed up and he caught it but I didn&#39;t want it by that time.

Atmosphere: 5/5 
Parking: N/A
Cleanliness: 4/5
Green:  5/5


       Walking through the busy aisles and terminals of an airport is generally regarded as an additionally stressful aspect to an already stressful situation (traveling) so more often than not we&#39;ve come to expect overpriced gift stores, kiosks with food sitting out for some time, surly-looking shoe shine men, etc. so it comes to the surprise of many yelpers and myself that this airport location is really doing Denver&#39;s reputation a favor by delivering well in terms of food, service, and decor. 

       The interior of Mesa Verde is a modern take on the classic westward expansion, along with heavy Mexican hacienda aspects that pay homage to the Front Range region and Colorado as a whole. Unlike many overpriced yet divey airport restaurants / bars, this one truly delivers at a level above the others in terms of actual atmosphere - I could almost forget I was in an airport.

      The menu is also a reflection of the region and features such local favorites as green chile sauce, red chile sauces, smothered burritos, nachos, soups, etc. There are some healthy / vegetarian options too but some of the sauces are not fully vegetarian or vegan as they contain chicken stock, check with your server for healthy options. On the other hand, you could just say to hell with it and go to their smoking lounge with a shot of bourbon but hey. 

      Otherwise, if you have time between flights and don&#39;t want to drop that thirty dollars on a &#34;I got high in the mile high&#34; tee shirt, than by all means, stop by."

I opted for the quail, which was fantastic, and perfectly cooked and seasoned with a maple glaze which was amazing even though I usually prefer keeping sweets out of my savory dishes. My wife got a filet minon  (well done bc she is pregnant) which turned out surprisingly tender and flavorful despite the doneness.

Finally, the service. After only about 15 minutes of waiting on food the manager came out and apologized for the wait, explaining that one of the quails got overcooked and the chef refused sending it out so they redid it. He insisted comping us a few drinks for the trouble. (1) wow. I appreciate a hands on manager and pro-active  that seeks to make things right like this. We barely even  noticed it was taking long.

Most of the table enjoyed their dishes but the scallops were rubbery and flavorless. The sear was visible but the texture of the delicate sear was gone, possibly from being under a heat lamp for too long.

We just so happened to come here again on a Tuesday night, less busy than last time, we got a 7.15pm reservation at about 5.30pm. 
Our waitress forgot about us after bringing the water. Someone else saw us looking around for her and took our orders. After that we we&#39;re never forgotten about! 
I got the fig, bacon and goats cheese flatbread to start, it was good but a bit skimpy on the goats cheese. Don&#39;t be shy people, you could have doubled it!! Hubby got the tuna tartare which was just as good as last time.
For my main meal I had the tuna salad and a side of scallops, only 3 scallops for $10 but damn they&#39;re good. The salad was great too. Hubby had a perfectly cooked steak. 
The desserts were good, love the $3 minis. The peanut butter one lacked in peanutty flavour a bit. There was peanuts in it though so not too bad. Hubby smashed his coffee one in seconds. 

Review #1
Glad we booked! Tuesday night and the place was packed! The complimentary valet was full before 7pm.

We arrived inside after finding a parking space about 5 mins early and while we waited was offered champagne. Shortly after we were seated. 

Our server Kristin was very nice but spoke fast so it was a bit hard for my in-laws to understand. My father in law thought she took too long with the drinks.

Around the table we got appetisers: ahi tuna tartare, Asian chicken skewers, grilled artichoke and the backed mushrooms with lump crab. Good reviews from everyone except the grilled artichoke, I&#39;m pretty sure it was as it should have been but we&#39;d never seen it served like that before. 

Mains: 2 x lamb racks, scallops with lemon risotto and cedar plank salmon. Everything was cooked perfectly and really tasty but the boys did mention that the lamb itself was lacking a bit of flavour. 

Dessert was perfect, served in a double shot glass, filled with all sorts of things. Kristin bought them all out on a platter and we chose off that. They were $3 and the perfect size, not a great big dirty piece of cake, just a petite little something that there&#39;s always room for. I had the key lime pie and it was delicious!! 

All up including wine it was about $300 for the 4 of us, decent price for a nice meal."

We were seated and presented an anniversary card as well as a rose.  Nice touch.  Our waitress was top notch.  Usually I can look at a wine list, find one that I&#39;ve had before, and call it good.  But the wine list here is fantastic.  Not only do they describe the wines, they make them all sound so amazing.  So when I struggled with which one to get our waitress asked a couple of questions on preferences and went and grabbed a few glasses for me to sample.

The salmon I had was absolutely perfect.  My husband had the braised beef and he could not stop talking about it the whole dinner.  

This is a great place for an anniversary or special dinner.  It was a tad on the loud side as we were sitting in the main room and it had some large parties going on.  It looked like there were additional seating areas in other rooms and I think I would request one of those next time."

We came tonight with my husband and his work associates expecting to be blown away by the freshness of gourmet cuisine. Wow, was I wrong. This place was too damn loud to enjoy anything, for starters, and started to regret coming here. 

Redeeming value of our server who was a vivacious young lady named Jennifer who poured an excellent glass of wine.  She was every part the classic server with good etiquette and timing. It appeared that the rest of the serving crew was disorganized or understaffed with some guy in a suit (manager?) rushing about in a harried fashion. Not fun to see. 

Appetizers came out after 15 minutes and we had the hummus plate and steak &amp; blue cheese flatbread. Pretty tasty. I ordered the spinach salad and had to hunt for all 3 pine nuts and half a sliced strawberry hidden amongst the greens. I think it had a slight dusting of Gorgonzola cheese somewhere mixed in. Pathetic. 

Then another 30 minutes later our entrees came out. I opted for the &#34;chef&#39;s recommendations&#34; of boneless short ribs. What a shock. A lump of brown with five long, thin wrinkled things which looked like overly roasted witches fingers. Nasty tasting carrots is what they were next to a chunk of short rib which was so overcooked as to be dry and pasty like liver, with hardly any sauce to speak of. A tiny dollop of white horseradish sauce on top and two tablespoons of cheese grits were schmeared under it all for some idiotic reason. I sent it back, and thinking I&#39;d like a hearty substitution of soup, ordered the potato leek soup. 

Double whammy of yuck. No potato flavor to speak of and all I could do was grind the salt and pepper on top in a feverish attempt to salvage it. I choked down half but shoved the rest away. I glanced at my husband&#39;s New York strip with longing and speared a bite or two. It was tasty but way overcooked for medium rare! He just shrugged it off which angered me more. 

For the prices they charge, I expect amazing food. What I got was over-imagined Mumbo Jumbo fancy crap. They took simple recipes and tried to improve upon them in disastrous ways. Creativity is a good thing, but at this place, it seems to be over-thought and warped to the extreme. I won&#39;t be back anytime soon."

The menu has a good variety of options. The first time I came here I had the Caramelized Scallops off the year round menu. They were deliciously prepared and the risotto was tasty.

The 2nd time I had the BBQ chicken salad. Much lighter and more flavorful than the BBQ chicken salads that typically litter every menu. There was so much chicken I couldn&#39;t finish it! The presentation was cool and I would definitely get this again.

The 3rd time I tried 2 items off the seasonal specials menu. The cup of corn soup left me wishing I had gone for the bowl. The tomato and watermelon salad sounds strange but is very good.

They also offer little desserts that are quite tasty. The s&#39;mores was super rich and oh so good!

This is definitely the place to dine at Park Meadows!"

The high level service is noticeable from the moment you approach the front door.  The valet person doubles up as a greeter and opens the outside door for you, another person opens an interior door.  Staff is everywhere, and busy giving guests top notch service. 

Asking the waitress about a certain wine (and they have 52 by the glass) prompted her to bring us a sample to taste (wow! I didn&#39;t even have to ask!) 

The food is fantastic. Stuffed mushrooms are heavenly.  The lobster parppardelle is heavenly, with homemade noodles and a good amount of lobster. The scallops were ordered at our table and we&#39;re also seared to perfection. 

The build out inside is super classy. The restaurant is beatiful."

The idea behind this restaurant is to follow the trends of the year, meaning serving dishes in season according to the 52 weeks of the year. It&#39;s cool you can get something different every week!

I walked in to find a modern decor and ambient lighting. Very clean interior and welcoming staff. The bar had ample seating so I met with the rest of my party and then we were sat. Our table was in the main dining room. It was VERY LOUD. Two members of my party were combatting colds, so it was difficult to talk with the hordes of screaming women at the table behind us. No matter, it&#39;s not the restaurant&#39;s fault, next time we will ask to be sat somewhere a little quieter. Or, you know, water down the wine being served to the gaggle of housewives cackling and yelping behind us. ;) 

The appetizers we ordered were the flatbread and hummus. Surprisingly good! The hummus was whipped and fluffy and the flatbread chips were addictive. There was also a mushroom and steak flatbread pizza thing that was delicious, although the steak was tough and overcooked. Our server was Jennifer, a very sweet young lady, probably my age or younger, and she was attentive and experienced. We all liked her a lot. 

Now to the main courses. I got a lobster pappardelle-I ordered it extra spicy because I&#39;m crazy and that&#39;s how I like it- and it was delicious. I liked the pieces of asparagus and generous lobster. My mother ordered some sort of beef rib with grits and overcooked carrots. It was disgusting, actually. The carrot was charred, I guess for an art effect but the meat was so overcooked on her dish. She kindly asked our server to bring some potato and leek soup instead, which was obliged. The soup tastes like potato and leek but was otherwise flavorless! I didn&#39;t realize soups only taste like two ingredients. We&#39;ve never come to a restaurant where not one but two dishes were disgusting. 

The salads were okay. The spring salad was much better than the spinach salad. I make a homemade apple cider vinegar salad dressing that has much more flavor than the vinaigrette they use. They were skimpy with the nuts and cheese. 

While I understand that restaurants strive to make a name for themselves in the industry by creating new and unusual dishes, I feel like Seasons 52 lost sight that sometimes the best tasting recipes are the simpler ones. Once you over complicate it, it doesn&#39;t taste as delicious, and I&#39;ve been cooking my whole life. When you add 17283947 ingredients to a dish, it won&#39;t fare well with diners.  I am by no means a food critic, but I know food and there&#39;s not a lot I won&#39;t try. 

The most redeeming qualities of the evening were the fine wine, excellent service and the seared scallops. But to be honest, for that price of our dishes, I&#39;d rather seek out a quieter atmosphere and better tasting food."

We stopped in on a Sunday night and although the place was packed, we were seated right away in the large dining room. The decor is very inviting, bordering on romantic! Low lighting and warm color scheme add to the ambience.

I ordered a very interesting shrimp scampi appetizer that was unlike any skimpy I have had previously. I could not detect any telltale signs of garlic or parsley; however it was almost like the shrimp portion of the Jambolaya dish also on the menu. Perhaps I might have even ordered the wrong thing but regardless it was quite tasty.

My husband ordered the scallops and said they were among the best he&#39;s ever had. Perfectly cooked and on a bed of what I think was either polenta  or grits.

Service was exceptional without being overbearing; this is a place to which we will return often when we resettle here in June!"

We were a party of six, so there was quite a variety at the table--pork, salmon, scallops,chicken. The general consensus was that the food lacked flavor and seasoning. The salt shaker got quite a workout. 

I got the scallops with fresh corn risotto. It was actually a very good dish, but lacked salt in the preparation. I added a side of their famous mac &amp; cheese and couldn&#39;t believe how underwhelming it was. Really just blah. There are certain things you don&#39;t skimp on, and this American Classic is one of them. Two of us got this and had the same reaction. Also, many dishes had seasonal vegetables, and all were overcooked and shriveled. Not sure what went wrong there. 

Our starters which included flatbreads, and our cocktails were all very good. Desserts are nice as well. And again, service was excellent. 

Overall satisfying experience, and they accommodate larger groups just fine. Just be prepared to lower your bar if you&#39;re a foodie."

We came around happy hour when the place was fairly empty. Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. The prices were pretty reasonable especially considering how artfully everything is prepared here.

I was curious about the &#34;duck wing lolipops&#34; but went with something a little safer, flatbread and chicken skewers. We each had a cucumber cocktail, super refreshing!

Something I love about this place is that they work with seasonal foods, which means it is going to be fresher, taste better, and leave a less impactful footprint from having to transport foods over large distances.

I am so glad we checked this place out, we loved their happy hour. We topped it off with a pecan pie dessert and it was out of this world. When we left I noticed there was a wait, apparently it gets very busy here around dinnertime on weeknights.

I can&#39;t help but also mention, the staff here look like models on the cover a GQ magazine. Check this place out!"

I asked hostess, how long is a couple more minutes in which she responded about 30 more minutes since there are 7 tables ahead of us that checked in before us. About 35 minutes later we were finally seated. After we were seated the manager came out and apologized for the delay.

Every time I&#39;ve been there I have had one of their proteins which could either be a fish, a chicken, or beef or even lamb.

I feel so fortunate to have been treated to a tasting of various brunch items and adult beverages at Seasons 52. I highly recommend Seasons 52 for a cozy date night or a leisurely brunch.
I sampled the eggs benedict, made even more decadent with brioche instead of a traditional English muffin. The smoked salmon flat bread? Amazing. Pair this with one of their mimosas or bloody Mary&#39;s and you have a perfect breakfast. I especially liked how they topped the flatbread with a healthy amount of lemon zest. This is what made it so special.
By far, you must - and I mean must - try the duck lollipops on the appetizer menu. Sweet and slightly spicy, juicy and flavorful - you cannot stop eating them! 
If you have a sweet tooth for brunch, by all means order the French toast, also made with brioche.

I&#39;m sayin&#39;, it feeds into my (very particular) view of an on-point spot.

So, without takin&#39; anything away from them, I&#39;m inclined to patronize this spot for convenience, an&#39; not much more. Like, if you&#39;s a high school kid before Homecoming who saved they allowance for a month or two and wanted to impress a young lady, this yo jam. Otherwise, I&#39;d find somethin&#39; else.

More than anything, the decor and ambience (a term I use lightly) is more like a hotel restaurant/bar, nah&#39;mean?  The servers are nice and attentive an&#39; all that, but in that way like they be expecting a certain clientele (which you could clearly identify walkin&#39; in). So if you ain&#39;t that, they kinda don&#39;t know how to adapt.

&#34;Yo, don&#39;t call me sir. My father is sir.&#34;

I will say the flank steak rare is right on point, and when the bartender ain&#39;t know what a French 75 is and does equal parts champagne and gin you end up smilin&#39; while you sippin&#39;.

Started with a flatbread and the duckwing lollipops - both were really good!
Got the pork chop (medallions?) - it was pretty good (not great).

Dessert came out in a bunch of bigger-than-shot-glass glasses on a tray - an interesting assortment - I got the chocolate/peanut butter option - really tasty!

We ordered porcini mushroom bisque , crab cakes, duck wings, oak New York steak, and the salmon. Their complimentary desert was absolutely delicious, we got the lemon berry one and peanut butter one.

I really enjoyed the duck wings, salmon and crab cakes. The salmon came with a little basket of vegetables, thought that was a nice touch. The steak was perfectly cooked but quite bland and the toppings were too sour. Crab cakes were also just average, but they used real crab.

Drink:
Bourbon berry cocktail, was too strong for my girlfriend she&#39;s a wimp, but I liked it.

For my mother&#39;s 52nd (!) birthday, we made reservations here, and I&#39;m really glad we did. We try to rotate fun restaurants each year, but we may have to make this one our go-to because of the incredible service we got here! From the (complimentary) valet to our fun and informative server, Jeff, everything was smooth sailing from the start.

Fun plus: they&#39;ve got a Master Sommelier in-house (and if you&#39;ve seen the documentary, Somm, or know anything about sommeliers, you&#39;ll know that that&#39;s no small feat... so trust that ALL their wines are delish!), and it shows. Our sweet shiraz was a big hit at our table--especially with the birthday girl.

Speaking of, the service manager that evening, Graham, came over to wish her a happy birthday... with a beautiful pink rose! That was such a sweet, unexpected touch, and it really did brighten our (already cheerful) moods. On top of all that, the entrees were all good--the filet mignon (mmm), scallops (yum), lobster pappardelle (wow), and short ribs (nice). Then... this truly magical celebration tower of treats came out, complete with a candle on top, and we all got to choose our favorite dessert.

All in all, we all had a BLAST. From the delicious food to the extraordinary customer service and attention to detail, Seasons 52 does it all. We will definitely be back to celebrate... well... whatever! I&#39;m sure no matter what, it&#39;ll be special."

Based on the above average reviews of Seasons 52, I went in really expecting to have an enjoyable time. Unfortunately, due to several factors detailed below, it was only ok.

Factor 1: we were seated near the glass wall to the kitchen; normally kind of a cool spot for taking in the culinary action! Not cool that this was also where the wait staff chooses to hang out and gab, guffaw and generally carry on about their weekend plans when they&#39;re not tending to their tables. My wife and I had to compete with their conversations numerous times and it got annoying. Probably should have said something to the manager, but the fact I had to even consider doing so was unfortunate.

Factor 2: my wife ordered the filet mignon, medium rare. It arrived quite the opposite - well done. Thus began that awkward situation of eating as slowly as possible (I had the NY strip) so a new steak could be prepared for her. To the management&#39;s credit, they did bring a complimentary soup while she waited, but her new steak still arrived - despite my best ultra-slow eating efforts - as I was a few bites from finished. Quite the bummer for a special occasion.

Factor 3: the food - while decent - was pretty far from amazing. After reading the many positive reviews, I was really hoping for something special. In the end, my steak was just ok; comparable to an Outback Steakhouse offering. It was dry for being cooked medium and the accompanying seasoning of chimichuri sauce with toy box tomatoes just didn&#39;t work for me. Also, my mashed potatoes had some hard lumps.

For some positives, my wife&#39;s filet - when it finally came back medium rare like she originally requested - was quite good and flavorful. Definitely the better of our two steaks. Also the comped corn soup they brought her was very good. Finally, though our visit wasn&#39;t great for the food, the staff assigned to our table (the non-gabbers) was top notch. 

In summary, Seasons 52 was a fair place to eat for us. Not quite worthy of all the praise, in my opinion, nor our special occasion."

I stick with the chefs suggestions because those items use seasonal ingredients and are super fresh.  I highly recommend their soups, especially the asparagus with lemon Chantilly cream.  Lots of fresh light flavors.  For the salad I liked the organic field greens because they put on just the right amount of sunflower seeds and the dressing did not over power the greens.  Finally, if you eat here, you have to try the flat breads.  Again from the seasonal chef suggestions, I recommend the crispy prosciutto and asparagus.  It&#39;s big enough to split if you are with a friend, and for $11.00, ordering one of these is a complete no brainier!

The staff is very professional and seem to look for ways to be of service.  My phone was running out of battery and Grahm, the manager, offered to loan me his charger so I could call my Uber after dinner.

everything was absolutely impeccable; the service, the drinks, the appetizers, the entrees, and those incredible little desserts (my favorite was the amaretto!) i was just above and beyond blown away at the entire experience. that&#39;s not an easy task for 20 people and they pulled it off with ease and class- WITH a full restaurant to boot!

if i lived in CO i would frequent this place all the time- i will have to settle for the one near me! i hope it&#39;s as great as this place.

highly recommend!"

I understand that this is actually a &#34;chain&#34; restaurant.  I don&#39;t care. It is wonderful. 
Every time I eat at Seasons 52 I am impressed with the food, service, drinks and atmosphere.  It&#39;s great for a quick professional lunch a business dinner or a romantic formal evening out.  Its a warm and welcoming first impression from the decor to the promt greeting and service at the front door, it&#39;s perfect every time.

Their food always tastes fresh and is served beautifully.  I love their seasonal menu changes and everything always tastes &#34;fresh from the garden&#34; rich in clean lively flavor.

Their cedar plank-roasted salmon is my favorite dish.  I LOVE their flatbreads.  Carbs be damned.  And speaking of carbs, whatever you do, don&#39;t miss out on one or two desert cups to top off your dinner.  I actually called in an order of two dozen mini desert cups for a dinner party I attended last year when I needed to take a &#34;special desert&#34; and was delighted to be deemed a heroine all evening. lol..

It can get very busy in the evening, I would recommend you have a reservation and the main dining room can be very noisy.  If it&#39;s only two of you, I would highly recommend grabbing a booth in the bar if you can find an opening.  Their free valet parking is always fast and professional.  We had a very late evening one night and the valet stayed extra late without batting an eye at us.

I&#39;ve never been disappointed with anything at Seasons 52.  Technically, I had an undercooked piece of salmon once and sent it back to the kitchen.  I was immediately greeted by the head chef who apologized and quickly provided me with a new piece of salmon cooked to perfection. 

Seasons 52 is one of my favorite &#34;go to&#34; places for a wonderful dining experience."

Upon an early arrival for our reservation time, we checked in with the hostess and stated we would get a drink at the bar.  When it was time to be seated, we walked to the hostess stand and it was a clustered and confused mess.  Next, the table they wanted to seat us at was in the far far back corner next to a large group with many children. If people do not come in with children they do not want to sit literally on top of a table full with children!!!  I did not realize this was a revamp of chuckecheese!! I immediately requested another location, which turned into a nightmare experience of excuses and waiting and subpar seating.  Being told a booth was reserved yet no one was there?  Management did nothing to satisfy us with this situation. Our meals were good but the flatbreads and salads were flat in taste and quality. Presentation/plating  of the meals were lacking and less than impressive. Our server was good but once we paid the bill she never again appeared and we were not comfortable to sit and talk even though there were empty tables all around.  I think the service needs to improve and this place needs to cater to less large groups and focus on the tables of 2-4   Recommend the bar and reservations.  For the area not sure I would return for a dinner there but may try happy hour.  However, If you want a chain go to flemings or perrys ..."

We tried Seasons 52 tonight with our kids as we were stricken with food ennui and all of our usual places left us uninspired.  We are SO happy that we did.  We had heard raves, but raves in the burbs can be dubious.  (Think &#34;She is prettiest girl in the bowling alley!&#34;) 

We were not disappointed.  6:30on Monday night and the wait was 45 minutes. However, the host staff graciously kept an eye open and alerted us that there was a table open in the bar.  

First, it&#39;s VERY nice - stone tile, fireplaces, lots of wood, etc.  In general it was packed with business people and &#34;couples of a certain age&#34;.  At first I thought the place was SO nice that they might be snobby about our kids (eight and four).  Once we were seated in the bar our server, Justin, dispelled that notion quickly. His service was consummately professional. The menu was varied, but didn&#39;t feel like Cheesecake Factory overdone.  I cannot remember having dined in a place were so many things appealed to me on a single menu. Usually it&#39;s one or two things that catch my eye. Not tonight. Every section, every column held something I craved.  (Full disclosure... I was starving...)

Let me shorten this up (too late):  porcini soup and angus chili were incredible. Shishito peppers and Brussels sprout apps were excellent. Roasted pear and spinach Gorgonzola salad was divine. My flat iron steak left me a little cold with the butternut squash and red peppers, but the meat was perfect.  

And the way they tempt you with dessert is marketing genius. (And of course we gave in.)

I will reiterate that our server Justin was truly top notch. Not just for the burbs, a real pro in general. 

If you&#39;re a food snob you may be put off by its location in the Park Meadows parking. Your loss.  Well done, folks. We will be back!"

We ordered the lollipop duck, Roma tomato flatbread, and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. All were delicious, especially the duck, so tender. I loved my Ahi Tuna salad and my husband enjoy his lamb, but it wasn&#39;t his favorite. Our wonderful server, Ryan, did a great job! He was attentive, informative, and had such a great attitude.

Having sampled much of the Denver culinary scene, this restaurant fell short on quality and creativity.  The starters we had were good but nothing out of the ordinary.  The salmon was good but the roasted vegetables could use a bit more seasoning.  Their wi-fi was down that night so our presenter had to download the webinar from her phone.  Apparently they have technical difficulties on a regular basis according to our event organizer.  Overall, there&#39;s plenty of options for fine dining in the area beside 52."

I ordered a cup of the mushroom soup and we split the lobster and mozzarella flat bread. Both were pretty good with the flatbread being more like a cracker. I thought the soup could have been a tiny bit creamier. 

We both ordered cocktails and both were delicious. Mine was a pear, vodka and St. Germain concoction and the hubs had a berry whiskey combination. 

For our mains, I ordered the grilled mahi with green veggies and sweet potato purée. The fish and sweet potatoes were well done. The hubs got the steak with red wine mushroom sauce and Yukon smashers. His wine sauce was flirting with being a tad too salty. We both thought the green veggies lacked in flavor and could have been finished in a more exciting way. 

Dessert was well done with a song and dance as the waitress called it. She brought out a tray of shot glass sized desserts. I got the key lime which was very good except the meringue was slightly runny. The hubs got a mocha chocolate cake caramel one that hit the spot. The portion was absolutely perfect and gave just the right sweet level without ruining the healthy meal."

My niece has moved to Denver and took the light rail to Lincoln and I picked her up to take her to lunch.  I have wanted to try 52 so thought it would be a nice treat for her.  Well - she had been many times and was thrilled to go again!

I don&#39;t know why many of the reviews I read about the flat bread stated - not enough for a main meal, or too thin, etc.  Yes it was thin - but I guess I&#39;m partial to a cracker thin flat bread - to me it was perfect.  I had the lobster and fresh mozzarella - well it was plenty enough for me as a main meal - and I - sad to say - am not a svelte model thin (too redundant?) person.  My niece had a piece and I left a piece.  To me - more than plenty of food.  Oh - I forgot to mention that it was simply delicious.

Niece had the Maryland crab wedge salad along with tamale taters.  She cleaned her plate!

Our server was terrific - allowing us to try a couple of wines before selecting.  I thought that was a nice touch since it was lunch time and we were requesting a glass each not a bottle.  Overall a really terrific experience."

The GM, Jordan, runs an incredible operation. I&#39;ve had lunch in the dining room, lunch at the bar, dinner at the bar, and dinner in the dining room. Each visit has been superlative.

1. Make a reservation if peak dining time. 
2. Enjoy. 
3. Yes, you will have a dessert. Give in to the dark side.  

It is a little surprising to learn this is a &#39;chain&#39; restaurant - Darden (YardHouse, Longhorn, Olive Garden) - but they got this higher end, fresh, seasonal, flavor without mindless calories concept spot on.

A first glance at the menu and it&#39;s like...what&#39;s not to like about seasonal fare...in addition to weaving autumn squash with tuna tartare, duck lettuce wraps, flawless burgers, roasted lamb chops...but the delight is in the details. 

The duck lettuce wraps have two sauces - a zesty take on a classic hoisin, along with a really nice citrus vinaigrette that really brightens the duck - and perfectly selected butter lettuce.    

The lamb with pomegranate - very good. I had scallops on a prior visit and they were seared to perfection. 

I&#39;ve sampled a few of the flatbreads and I have to say my fav so far is the artichoke/ pesto chicken/caramelized onion/red pepper/arugula. The &#39;crust&#39; is so thin, it is absolutely guilt-free and well-balanced. 

The tacos - again - the details. The guacamole is spicy, zesty...and beautiful with the marinated red onions and cabbage, mole sauce. The tomatillo and enchilada sauces are unique and wonderful.  

The wine list is masterful although not faultless. The &#39;house&#39; or entry level wines are so-so and so I recommend passing those and going for the varietals that you know you like...there is a HUGE selection by the glass. The vino vehrde, for example, is a very fine selection for the price point. 

I am awarding five stars because I think they have hit this &#39;seasonal fresh fare but at a respectable price&#39; concept out of the ballpark. NO wonder this place is always packed. 

I LOVE their dessert concept. Tiny glasses of sweetness such as pumpkin spiced pie with ginger snap, Belgian chocolate with chocolate dripped cookie, key lime...each person can order what s/he wants!! At $2.95...go nuts!! 

I am so tired of places with the over-sized desserts that you HAVE to share because they are huge and you never really want the choose one but it makes no sense to order more than one...so you compromise. Who wants to compromise (on dessert)? 

Our server today, Alex, was flawless. Personality, grace and the perfect balance of I am going to upsell you and you will love me for it. His carding me for wine and presumptive delivery of dessert...I&#39;m a huge fan. 

You guys get it, Kudos to you. 

It&#39;s a balance to offer fresh/seasonal with locally-sourced...and keep prices real."

I really liked the mushroom soup they had a few months back. Their lobster flat bread is perfect and pairs well with a nice crisp Sauvignon blanc. We never have luck with the lobster tails, they&#39;re always very well done and rubbery. So we won&#39;t order lobster tails anymore since it&#39;s happened at least 5 or 6 times. They offer a really good strawberry basil martini which is super yummy. Their stuffed mushrooms are also good but I think they still need perfecting as the mushrooms get stuck to the dish and not much inside them?

It truly has been a great month of trying out fun places all around town and seasons 52 did not disappoint. People do underestimate the value and power of exceptional service and I must tip my hat off to our server Mathew T (there are 3 other matt&#39;s there apparently lol). 

The recommendations he made where spot on, valued the time my date and I where having a conversation / moment and didn&#39;t rudely interrupt. Made sure to ask and then listen - more importantly than all of that when he finally got our orders he stated &#34;excellent choices, you won&#39;t regret it, I&#39;ll get started on preparing your dinner right away&#34;. First he was right we didn&#39;t regret the choices, the scallop entre is well seasoned - the asparagus was crispy not soggy or overdone and the risotto  was well blended in with the greens. 

The dessert tray was not a display. You get to pick your dessert and then grab your dessert :) 

Great job all around, including the manager that came by to see if our evening was going well and if there was anything she could do.

We didn&#39;t have a reservation and the wait was very long, as a result, we had our dinner at the bar. It was a good experience, however, a few times we asked for things and didn&#39;t get them as they were so slammed.

Everything we ordered was exceptional. 

Appetizer crab cake (special)
Warm Spinach Salad
Crisp Romaine &amp; Baby Kale Caesar Salad
Lemon and Herb Roasted Whole Branzino

The evil dessert selection....makes it hard to say no when they are these cute little shot glasses filled with all kinds of yumminess! We had the amaretto cake and the mochachino. Both were amazing and I felt a little less guilty because they were small portions."

The bar area is very cool and could be a fun option for HH some time which I noticed runs M-F from 4-6:30.

The 3 of us opted to share a couple different plates/entrees. They offer a gluten free menu. They emphasize seasonal dishes but I didn&#39;t feel as though fresh produce was showcased in their menus. The food was good but the whole space and presentation definitely had a chain restaurant feel to it.

We ordered the scallops with butternut squash risotto, the mahi mahi tacos wrapped in lettuce, and the warm herb-crusted mozzarella with tomatoes. All were good but nothing stood out. The mozzarella was a &#34;chef suggestion&#34; and sounded better than it was. Portions were very good. I felt the scallops were a tad over-priced but the tacos are a good value.

The wine list is pretty average. We ordered a Petite Syrah for $48 and it wasn&#39;t anything to get excited about. The wine glasses are small so the pours will also be small.

The service is good and attentive- almost too attentive. We were there for around an hour and were probably checked on every 4 minutes. I prefer this to no attention, but we were chatting away with each other and it was more of an intrusion for our table. The staff should learn to read social cues a little better. However, they were all very nice and warm and so I can&#39;t really complain.

It should do well in the Park Meadows location but I don&#39;t feel the need to hurry back."

1.  This restaurant is part of the Darden chain of restaurants
2.  Everything on the menu is supposed to be under 475 calories (consider that a Big Mac is 530 cal), then look at the portion size in the pictures and your eyebrows should raise appropriately.

The owners of Red Lobster and Olive Garden have decided to branch out to the fine dining arena and give it a go, and biases aside, I have to say they&#39;re off to a good start.

The restaurant setup is beautiful.  The bar, the booths and the dining area are all exquisite, and the lighting was just right.  Good buzz, not too loud, so it&#39;s a great place to take a date.

The food itself was okay.  Massive portion sizes that I&#39;ve come to expect from the suburbs.  However, because each one clocks in under 475 cals, you don&#39;t have that gross overstuffed feeling at the end of the meal.  I was sort of amazed by how they were able to achieve this and so I asked.  They seriously limit the use of thing like butter, salt, fat, oil, etc.  Lots of things are baked in a wood oven or grilled.  This was reflected in the taste and texture of a lot of the foods... the vegetables I thought were a little dry, the risotto was also a little dry.  What they were able to accomplish for under 475 was amazing, so I&#39;ll give them credit for that.  Perhaps this is what food used to taste like before butter.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll keep working to improve the taste.

The staff is very nice, but perhaps a little unaccustomed to dealing with diet restrictions.  They got something wrong on our appetizer order and promptly made amends.  The manager even came over and offered an apology, and the dish was comped... a very nice touch for a slip up.

So yes, overall, I was impressed.  For a chain restaurant, they&#39;re trying to get a few things right which deserves some cred.  Give it a shot... if you can get a reservation."

My friends and I went for light dinner, and I was overjoyed to find they had my favorite wine (which I discovered at S52 in Chicago) - Jam Jar Shiraz. We got some flatbreads and had a nice waitress. I&#39;d love to come back for a full meal.


Edited (9/21):

Seriously considered dropping this to a 3, but I&#39;m hoping we just had a bad experience. Five of us came for lunch, and we ended up waiting an hour - ONE HOUR - for our soups and appetizers. If you have a corporate job, you know that between driving, being seated, etc., that already places you at about 1.5 hours. We clearly didn&#39;t have time for entrees, so we had to book it.... so we thought. Our bill turned into a complete mess, and we had written exact instructions (they broke down the bill by person 1-5, and we wrote our corresponding CC #s and last name next to each) and they managed to cross-charge, double-charge... it was truly astounding. Finally, a girl came who was able to settle it all, but by then we were two hours in and extremely late to get back to work. FYI - this was a weekday lunch, and we had a reservation. I overheard the hostess say a wait of 40-50 minutes."

I had cancelled another reservation strictly because Seasons 52 promised me a table outside.

1. Shame on this restaurant for putting Mirassou Pinot Noir on the menu and charging $6.50 for it (a whopping $0.50 off at happy hour) -- you can get an entire bottle for that price for this plonk. It&#39;s indicative of their overall wine list frankly not being very creative or appetizing. With a few exceptions, which brings me to #2 --

2. Wine flight and flatbread special for $15 or $20. This was a decent value and had tasty options for wines. The flatbread was very tasty, but see #3 --

3. Flatbreads were tasty for what they were but very skimpy. See my photo. If you folded it all together you&#39;d have the equivalent of half a grilled cheese sandwich as far as quantity goes, it is so thin. So, if you&#39;re thinking to eat if for dinner like you might the super happy hour flatbreads at Brio for $3.95, you&#39;ll leave hungry. 

Highlights: very nice atmosphere -- relaxed but elegant surroundings, hopping and busy with people but realize if you&#39;re in the bar area that everyone who came in after you is trolling like sharks to grab your seat the moment you leave your seat to freshen up.  Fair number of single ladies aged 40-60 enjoying the atmosphere, as well as couples and groups. They have booths in the bar which looked comfy. Get there early for happy hour!

Tasty food: Their happy hour scallops were worth the trip on their own --$5 for three large and perfectly cooked scallops (on the rare side, served alone in a shell).  Their bowl of beef chili was super terrific and hearty; it was served with an odd single piece of dense bread."

It&#39;s a little on the pricey side and can get very noisy.  They change their menu 4 times a year to work with what&#39;s in season.  The lobster and mozzarella flat bread is enough for a meal for one or a great app for two people where you want to take some leftovers home from your dinner plate.  I&#39;ve had the scallops there several times and they are always amazing.  A friend had the Chilean fish, the waiter de-boned it at the table and she said it was fantastic.

Had the Lobster flat bread and it was good. Crust was crisp and the toppings were fresh and well proportioned. I had the Filet and stressed that I  wanted a true medium preparation. the steak was PERFECTLY prepared.  for desert the offer something like a &#34;small plate&#34; selection. I had the pecan pie dish and it too was delicious. I would recommend this spot when you&#39;re in town or live near by. Service was top notch for my table and from what I observed from the surrounding tables it was consistent.

Sat in the bar this time for a casual dinner, and again we had excellent service by a very knowledgeable waiter.  My wish is that they have beer on draft, but since they are a wine bar beer isn&#39;t their focus.  Seasons 52 is known for their seasonal menu which keeps the menu interesting, the focus is definitely on what&#39;s in season. Started the meal with the mushroom flatbread, very thin crust and flavorful.  Also tried the Brussels sprouts, they were good, not great.  I really enjoyed my dinner size salad with fresh ahi tuna, again lots of flavor.  Their desserts all come in a shot glass so you can imbibe without overdoing.  Their  focus used to be all dishes under 475 calories, but they&#39;ve since expanded and added a few dishes with a higher calorie count for those who want a heartier dish.  Seasons 52 is a busy place so I&#39;d definitely recommend a reservation."

I started with the artichoke &amp; goat cheese flatbread. YUM! Then I had the sesame grilled salmon salad for dinner. That was the best salad I have ever had... Everything worked together perfectly. The presentation of the salad was also very neat, it came out in a clear plastic tube on a plate, and as they lifted the tube up the salad slid out, and landed neatly on the plate. 
I would highly recommend Seasons 52 to everyone! It&#39;s so comforting to have a restaurant where you don&#39;t have to be scared about how many calories are in your meal!"

I ordered the pork tenderloin served with a sweet potato mash and Brussels sprout leaves with green beans. The pork was cooked medium rare and was just right. The Brussels leaves and green beans were cooked just to my liking (a little crunchy not soggy). It all felt fresh and the portion was just right, although most would consider it small for the price you pay.

Our first visit to revelry. First impressions are a huge deal and this came with a few negative impressions. I&#39;ll start with the good:

Our server Kevin was friendly and kind. He explained the specials and was attentive with refilling our coffee and checking on us. 

I ordered the bagel and lox which was small but really really good. The tomato was great and the lox was fresh. My man ordered the standard breakfast. Which exactly is what it was. Eggs, hash browns, toast and no flavor.. But edible. The &#34;homemade&#34; hot sauce tasted exactly like valentinos. 

Negatives:
This place is tiny. Like super super tiny. They have accomplished squishing as many people in a area as possible. I assume the aisles aren&#39;t up to fire code based on how small cramped and tiny it is. (Not that I care about code but this place is like a can of sardines)

LOUD. Don&#39;t come here and try to have a conversation.

The water they brought to our table had floaties of who knows what in the bottle. Noticing it as we poured water into our glasses. Gross. 

The coffee is mediocre. Watery light and no flavor. $2.50 for a cup of coffee. 

Bathrooms - 1 unisex bathroom that is meant to be shared between all customers. Someone didn&#39;t think that through...

Not sure I would recommend this to anyone. Nothing food wise was wowing. Overall another generic hipster concept. Nothing special."

I want to LOVE it SO badly.

I went this weekend to give it another shot. I had visited about a week after Revelry Kitchen had opened and hadn&#39;t yet been impressed with the food and the service had been quite slow.

Cue Saturday.

Arrived around 10:30 am and was surprised to see the restaurant a bit empty. I was greeted by the sweetest hostess. I let her know I was waiting for my counterpart and that I would be happy to wait in the wings until their arrival. She was very thankful as, apparently, there was an emergency in the kitchen and they were running short with only two cooks. YIKES! 

After my bloody mary cohort arrived, we asked if we could be sat and sip while we waited for the kitchen to catch up. We were quickly sat outside on the lovely patio.

I ordered the Tru Garden Vodka bloody mary and my gal pal fired things up with Ghost Pepper. Both were delicious, but I&#39;d recommend it spicy next time. The Tru Garden was tasty, but not quite as refreshing as I&#39;d hoped. I knew the kitchen was behind, so we ordered something easy...the Lobster Deviled Eggs. I&#39;m a sucker for a deviled egg any which way.

We asked for another minute but sadly didn&#39;t see our server for quite some time. We finally caught the hostess while she was wiping down a table and asked her to grab our server so we could order. She came by in a jiffy and we took the plunge.

*The Benny
&amp;
*The Roasted Vegetable Hash with a side of bacon

The food took almost an hour and we were dying in the heat (which, shame on us because we thought it was a lovely morning, but didn&#39;t think to ask for a shaded space or to move) but we were brought a few extra bloodies that were rung in by mistake (score). Breakfast with a buzz? I&#39;m in.

The food was delicious. The hash was creamy and rich with a hint of sweet from the carrots and beet. Bacon was fried to crispy perfection. The benedict was stellar. The english muffin was perfectly toasted and every bite was a flavor explosion.

We got the check at 1:05 pm. It was a long brunch.

Had the food not been stellar, I would not be back, but I&#39;m looking forward to third time&#39;s a charm. Next stop, El Burro (t&#39;s the size of a small child wrapped in a tortilla) and the Lemon Poppy Seed Waffles."

I met a colleague for brunch here recently and we had a fantastic time. It&#39;s little, cozy, bright, and cheery with a magnificent menu. Plenty of options for the sweet-tooth: smores pop tarts, churros donuts, pumpkin cinnamon rolls, fluffy pancakes... And then they&#39;ve got your savory items covered in style: bagel &amp; lox, daily frittata and soup, meantballs and gravy, lobster deviled eggs... yep. 

I ordered the frittata of the day which had goat cheese, arugula, tomato, and onion. It was seasoned beautifully and was sooooo huge and amazing. The perfect texture and seriously full of flavor. It comes with a nice little greens salad on the side with vinaigrette. Ideal portion, but I wanted to try the soup du jour too. Apple and leek! It smelled gorgeous, but it was a liiiiittle too thick and appley for me. Too much like applesauce.

I didn&#39;t enjoy one of the incredible cocktails on my visit (dumb. I&#39;ll be back), but I did have &#34;the Pink Rose&#34; which is a sparkling grapefruit juice with rosemary. Aromatic, bubbly, and on point. Next time I&#39;ll order the adult rootbeer float or the lavender lemonade with house-infused blueberry vodka. ;)"

Took 45 minutes to get a table (understandable for the time I went). Waited another 50-60 minutes for our food after we ordered. The restaurant was small and cramped... and from my observations, everyone in the restaurant had to wait about the same amount of time. The food was amazing though! As I was finishing my last bite I thought to myself, &#34;Wait, wasn&#39;t this supposed to be gluten free??&#34; I might go again but maybe at a less busy time and I would ask for a table that wasn&#39;t against a wall, if that&#39;s even possible."

It would have been nice to have been told while we were waiting. On top of that, outside of a couple apologies (which I appreciated), I think we should have been compensated or given something for spending over two hours of our day there.

Chicken and waffles....gluten free! Biscuits and gravy...gluten free! Churro doughnuts...gluten free!

The food was good. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my partner ordered the Cubano. Apparently, the chef is from Cuba so we thought the Cubano would be a fitting choice. The meat in the Cubano was tender and moist and the bread had a nice texture, soft with a grilled crunchy exterior. The pickles and mustard were bland and needed more zing. The fries had a nice appearance, but didn&#39;t taste fresh. My partner also said that his food wasn&#39;t warm. 

I was excited that I have a place where can I eat gluten free fried chicken and waffles...one of my favorite dishes that I thought I may never eat again. While living in Chicago, I went on a chicken and waffles binge...which probably resulted in my gluten intolerance. This dish at Revelry falls in the average to below average range. The portion size was small on the chicken and I was left wanting something more impressive. I didn&#39;t feel fully satisfied leaving the restaurant. 

I will come back here because of their gluten-free menu and to try something different...perhaps the biscuits and gravy next time and the chocolate 3-ways."

Staff was friendly and helped us find a great spot outside (a blessed February day in Denver). Got use menus, drinks and took the order very fast. All the staff was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.

The food was outstanding and there are several things on the menu that I am anxious to try. I did have the Lobster BLT and loved it! Fries were great too. So looking forward to goign back."

They can make almost everything on the menu gluten free and is one of the only breakfast/brunch places that I have found that is not only safe for those with celiac, but tasty as well. 

Oh my oh my oh my, I was so excited to try their #GlutenFree chicken and waffles.  I have not had fried chicken in years because I could not find a recipe that made the chicken this crispy &amp; no restaurant that ever made it. Yum yum yum!!! 

Unfortunately they are taking this off the menu tomorrow, thank goodness I came in today. They are also taking the bagels &amp; lox off the menu, which is a total bummer as well and why I gave them only 4 stars. They also have some seriously yum fresh blueberry pancakes, yep, order those.

I have seen Revelry mentioned in several &#34;best of&#34; lists, and there was absolutely nothing at Revelry that lent the slightest clue why this place isn&#39;t reviled instead of revered.  I came in just after 1:00 PM today (Saturday), and the indoors seating was roughly 10% occupied, and all had food in front of them, so the kitchen might be finishing entrees or desserts - definitely an untaxed kitchen. This should be a quick meal, and if this place is as half as good is it&#39;s purported to be, this will be a great meal! Ummmm - yeah? NO!

For some reason, it took almost a half-hour to get two entrees - Steak &amp; Eggs (medium-well steak, scrambled eggs) and Lemon &amp; Poppy Seed Waffle, and a side of bacon.  I also requested that my server &#34;drop everything, ship everything&#34; - drop the whole order, and deliver as each item came up. But, everything arrived all at once - and everything was frigid - even the well-beyond well-done steak. Hell, there were three two-tops that got sat, and served their entrees before anything was delivered.

The Steak &amp; Eggs: the steak, as mentioned, was way, way overcooked - even for a medium-well steak - although it wasn&#39;t too dry, it seemed to be bathed in butter or some kind of oil that kept it from being crunchy. But still, way-overdone - and descriptively closer to cold than warm. The eggs were just okay - and cold too. The best part of the whole meal was the small portion of hash browns on the Steak &amp; Eggs entree - wonderful texture and flavor (with &#34;house ketchup&#34;), although very, very greasy.

The Lemon &amp; Poppy Seed Waffle: bland, bland, plain... Yawwwwnnnnnn. The best part of this dish was the vanilla whipped cream - good texture and flavor. But the waffle was only slightly better texture than an Eggo, but less flavor. The lemon curd was insanely sweet - shave-your-tongue sweet, but when combined with the cardboard waffle, all I could taste was bland cardboard taste separate from the awfully sweet lemon curd.  Never saw, tasted, or even smelled a poppy seed, either. I wonder how many boxes Eggo waffles I could&#39;ve gotten for the $11.00 instead of this utterly pitiful waffle dish. (Note: I haven&#39;t had Eggos since I was a kid - they&#39;re very unhealthful and bland - couldn&#39;t ever imagine eating them ever again - unless the only other choice was Revelry&#39;s waffles.)

The bacon - although ordered &#34;crispy - but not crunchy&#34; - was way-overcooked - very crunchy. Fall-apart crunchy. No-flavor, bland, just-this-side-of-cinder&#39;s texture.  Total bacon abuse - blech.

The orange juice was pretty good - color and texture seemed to be fresh-squeezed, but the flavor was a little stale. It might have been squeezed on-site, but there wasn&#39;t anything &#34;fresh&#34; about this OJ.

The coffee (&#34;Revelry Kitchen proudly serves Denver&#39;s own Luna Roasters Gourmet Coffee&#34;) was okay.  Nothing special...  But the coffee cup was bottom-tapered - it held no more than 8 oz of coffee at a time, and my cup was empty more than ten minutes each of the three times I finished the &#34;cup&#34; of coffee (she never refilled my cup when dropping off the check until I left another ten minutes later.

I&#39;m at an utter loss how anyone could&#39;ve liked this place. Are all the friends and family of the staff working overtime on Yelp, Zomato, and all the other review sites to prop this place up?  My entire bill came to $34.50 - before tax. I would&#39;ve been fine to pay three times as much for a perfectly-prepared meal - but for more than $30, the food, drinks, and service should have been much, much, much better.  Hell, I&#39;d prefer Perkins, Denny&#39;s - even McDonald&#39;s breakfast over this meal."

A large group of my friends decided at the last minute to get together for brunch on New Years Day, of all days. One of the busiest brunch days of the year, and everybody we called predicted 1.5-2 hour weights. On a whim, I called Revelry and they said they&#39;d be able to seat us relatively quickly (although they do not accept reservations or call-aheads, just an FYI). We got there and were seated almost immediately, which was awesome. 

We were all STARVING. A few of us got pancakes, some cinnamon rolls, some sammiches, some juice, some bloody marys. A nice assortment of breakfast foods. And then we waited. It took over an hour for us to get our food, and when it came, it was over the course of 15 minutes. And of course, the hungriest people ate last. That&#39;s the negative. But I&#39;m willing to overlook it because of two things. 

1. Everything was fresh and friggin&#39; amazing. The lobster BLT on fresh baked bread was seriously incredible. It came without the ailoi by accident, and I didn&#39;t even care. In fact, if I were to order it again, I might order it with the aioli on the side because it was so good without it. The bread was gluten free, but I never would have guessed, so for all you gluten free people out there, TRY THEIR BREAD! And the bacon was amazing. I also got to try a bite of my boyfriend&#39;s cinnamon roll and it was to die for. Everybody loved their food. 

2. When I brought our issue to the owner&#39;s attention, she went above and beyond to rectify the situation. I just wish I had spoken with her sooner. She clearly cares about her customers and takes pride in what she does. 

So...that said, I look forward to my next sammich there...because I will be getting a sammich. Because their bread is OMG good."

We got seated quickly midday Saturday, but it was most fun having lunch there on a weekday, where there was a steady stream of patrons, but the environment was more relaxed and quiet.

Definitely try this new spot in the Highlands

Forgot to mention the pesto fries- unbelieveable!

hope to go back soon and try more of their ever-changing menu"

21SEP2015

Just checked the website and the menu.
They jacked the price of beets by 40%!
And, the burger by 20%.
Inflation in the USA is running at 2% and they are raising prices by 20-40%. This is insane. I am not happy.

20AUG2015

+ Warm welcome from both host and bartendress.
+ Atmosphere is soothing with wood, brick, gray and white paint.
+ Smooth operation even though it was opening day.

+ Food.
++ Beets. 5 stars for the beets for $5. They were tender. The goat cheese, fig, walnuts complemented them perfectly. I loved the charred scallions on the side. Get this dish!
+ Churro donut holes. Tasty.
+ Burger. Excellent choice of smoked cheddar. Bacon. Fries. All for $10. I ordered medium rare and got medium.

+ Flatware. Browne (http://www.halco.com/viewjpg.php?section=table_service_flatware), hefty.
+ Napkins. Large cloth. Mostly cotton.
+ Wine by the bottle. At 4x the glass price.

- Limited beer selection. Nothing on tap.
- Wi-Fi. Is free, but is pathetically weak at the bar. Much better on the patio.
- Website. 04SEP2015 - getting a little better. Cannot see menu with medium size browser window."

1.) Food: I had the fried chicken and waffles, the husband had biscuits &amp; gravy, and my mother in-law had the Northside Rancheros. 
Fried chicken was not great at all. First, they put the gravy on top of the fried chicken, making it slowly get soggy. The gravy really wasn&#39;t very good and had a weird bitter taste. The fried chicken was wayyyy over cooked, had large chunks of overcooked breading, and was barely warm. No good at all. The waffles were standard waffles and were pretty tasty, but tasted better on their own so that the gravy didn&#39;t taint their flavor. Really wanted this chicken to be juicy and I&#39;m still bummed this didn&#39;t kick my craving for great fried chicken. 
 Biscuits and gravy arrived nearly cold and my skinny husband was still hungry afterwards with the smaller than expected portion. They were pretty tasty though. 
Northside Rancheros received rave reviews.

2.) Wait for food: It took 50 minutes to finally get our food, and it arrived cold. No one even thought of saying anything because our server rarely came around and by then we just wanted to get on with our day. 50min to receive a simple food order and to get cold food? No thanks. I&#39;ll go somewhere else next time. 

3.) Slight annoyance (no impact on my review), they first said the wait was 30-45min. Then 20min later they said it&#39;d be another 45min. Not sure if this due to the host, or due to their EXTREMELY long wait time for food.

Overall, a pretty annoying and underwhelming experience. It&#39;ll take a while for us to try Revelry again."

Cons:
Service was bad. Really bad. Seated right away on a Friday morning with less than half of the tables full. They left us with menus, water and silverware for a ridiculously long time. Finally had to flag someone down to take our order. Drinks were brought out quickly but waited a long time for the food to come. Nobody ever came to check on us once the food had been delivered. Sat for at least 10 minutes with empty plates before the bill was brought to us - without even asking if we wanted anything else.
Biscuits were tasty but small and the gravy was hard to find since there was so little of it...definitely not a full brunch entree size, especially for the price.
Boyfriend&#39;s chicken and waffles were just meh. Waffles were good but pretty standard, gravy was again minimal and chicken was crispy but over-battered.


Pros:
They let me sub Brussels (delicious) for eggs with no up charge.
Adorable space with nice patio and good decorations.
Menu with lots of options, including a daily frittata which sounded great.
Revelry mimosa was boozy and tasty but not really anything like a mimosa??

Probably won&#39;t be returning anytime soon."

The food was pretty good. I ordered the chicken and waffles and was thrilled to eat fried chicken that tasted like actual southern fried chicken. The staff was knowledgable about celiacs and I can safely report that I had no reactions to the food. 

I look forward to returning for cinnamon rolls."

They chicken was so well cooked and crispy. I way over stuffed myself on it because it was so good. I hardly ate the waffles- although they were really good too. I also got a mimosa- that was good- nothing spectacular like the chicken and waffles but I can&#39;t complain.
My only ding about the food was that I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of the sauce on the side for the chicken. It just didn&#39;t have a flavor I really enjoyed. It wasn&#39;t bad but not the best- I wish there was more then one offer for the dipping sauce.
Also the customer service was excellent,. We say outside and the the sun was directly in my uncles eyes so our waiter got a umbrella out for us. When he realized it was sitting hitting him right in the face he adjusted it so that we all would be comfortable. I thought this was really nice- we didn&#39;t ask for him to get one he just went ahead and did it. He came up to the table multiple times to ask us if we needed anything and got us more drinks. 
Food and Service both got 5 stars and I would love to come back here."

We shared our orders and loved every bite. The kitchen really pays attention to all the details. From the blend of flavors to the presentation (for brunch!). 

We started with the soup du jour which was a sausage, kale &amp; potato soup. My husband doesn&#39;t like kale but he liked it in the soup! It was served with a nice toast with pesto. Delicious. 

Next we had the bagels and lox. Nice presentation of cream cheese and capers to the side. Toasted crispy onion bits on top were such a great touch as well.

Last we got the lobster BLT. Yes a lobster BLT. First we&#39;ve seen and such a great idea! For our personal taste we would have liked the toast to be more crispy but I can&#39;t take a star off for that. The fries were perfectly crispy and everything was yummy. 

To finish it off our waiter was really nice and everyone who worked there seemed to enjoy being there. Just a great spot for brunch. 

Thank you for a great meal and experience!"

For only being open two weeks, there were a healthy number of people there for Saturday breakfast, with nearly all of the the outdoor tables full and quite a few folks inside as well. Very kid &amp; young family friendly while still inviting to those of us without kids.

All in all my visit was a mixed bag. I had a mug of tea that was very good quality (no brand name on the bad, but very good), but the mug &amp; bag came without a saucer. So my choices were over-steep the tea, drink the cup very fast, or set the bag on the table (and forego a second cup). I was outside, so the table probably would have been fine, but it would have dripped on somebody&#39;s legs.

The prices were great (very nearly everything was $10 or less), and the ingredients were good quality. The quiche of the day is actually more of a tartlett of quiche, rather then a slice as you might be expecting. The tomatoes, bacon, etc. in it were all wonderfully flavorful, but it was maybe 3/4&#34; deep and 1/2 of what I got was crust. I&#39;m used to a much higher filling-to-crust ratio in a quiche, and while the crust was flaky and tasty, I wouldn&#39;t have minded less crust and more filling.  It also came with a side salad that over whelmed it on the small plate and had an overly salty dressing. The greens themselves were fresh and crisp, with a couple kinds of cherry tomatoes.

The inside is bright and roomy. If you were at either of the two previous restaurants there, it was generally dark and closed-in. Not so now. Light colors, big windows with open shades, lots of light. And the patio space is as nice as a patio can be right off of 38th Ave. There is just no way that you won&#39;t get street noise when the patio opens right out to something that busy.

As I said, the quality of the ingredients all seemed to be very high, so I&#39;m guessing the owners and staff will hold themselves to similarly high standards and the other inconsistencies will get sorted out soon. And at those prices, they are going to be VERY popular as a result.

Oh - and their web site is horrible. You don&#39;t need to look at it because you&#39;re reading about them on yelp. But on anything less than full wide-screen the information you want, like hours and location aren&#39;t just off the screen, you can&#39;t scroll to them either. I really hope they didn&#39;t actually pay anyone for the web site. If they did, they should demand their money back."

We were there on Sunday morning, Aug 21, 16.       when we arrived we were told we had a 45 min. wait.  We waited as my niece really wanted to eat there.  1 hr later we were seated.   Our server then told us that we had another 45 minute wait as the kitchen was slow.   our food finally came out 1 hrs and 15 minutes after we had ordered.     I had ordered the easiest breakfast......2 eggs overeasy, toast, no butter, hash browns and fruit.   The eggs were under cooked, I was given &#39;heels&#39; bread, soaked in oil when I had specified &#39;no butter, hash browns that looked like they came from McDonalds and fruit 5 minutes later. The manager came over and apologized for the delay with one excuse after another....we were understaffed, the oven went out and the refrigerator wasn&#39;t working.     Frankly, I was worried about the quality of the food after hearing the fridge went out and why did our food take so long when nothing any of,the 5 of us ordered required the oven.  Everything was either cooked on the stove top or a sandwich.   It was rude and inexcusable that the woman offering all the excuses did not offer a discount or any other compensation for our inconvenience.     Don&#39;t waste your time and money going there."

So, our friend says, &#34;My friend just opened a restaurant, let&#39;s try it for brunch.&#34; The menu sounded amazing, so the six of us cram into a car and head over. There&#39;s a wait, but we get in pretty quick. So we order drinks and some appetizers for the table. Our drinks don&#39;t come for about :30 minutes and one was completely forgotten about (when we asked our waiter about it, maybe :15 minutes later, he said that he just totally forgot to put it in...however he had written it down). During this time the owner, a friend of the guy who&#39;s with us, comes by and tells us that she told our server that because we&#39;re friends and they don&#39;t know how to handle the crowd that he shouldn&#39;t worry about us as much....hmmm. Now if I had a friend bring 5 other people to my new restaurant I would want them to have a great experience so that they would come back, but that&#39;s me.

 Okay, so right around when the forgotten drink arrives (which was supposed to be a spicy bloody, but is really just unmixed vodka and what tastes like tomato paste, not juice) we order our meals. Three of the six get the chicken and waffles as it&#39;s been recommended by the owner. After this our &#34;appetizer&#34; finally arrives...it&#39;s been over an hour at this point. We got some nutella and banana pancakes (the only thing we ordered that wasn&#39;t awful), and some queso fundido which was more of a sauce and really just not that flavorful. 

Okay so we eat....and wait another hour for our main food. It comes, looks great, we start eating. Immediately, one of the chicken and waffle orderer&#39;s says, &#34;Hey, is there something wrong with your guys waffles?&#34; So, yes there&#39;s something horribly wrong with the waffles...this super strong, bitter aftertaste that is so bad they can&#39;t even be eaten. Something is really wrong...like the ingredients are messed up. They are literally inedible. So we&#39;re chatting and we&#39;re like, &#34;Do we tell the owner friend?&#34; I mean surely you&#39;d want to know if you were serving inedible food, and clearly this wasn&#39;t intended to be served this way. So she comes over to see how everything is and our mutual friend breaks the news to her. Her response is, &#34;That&#39;s so weird that you say that because like three other tables have complained about them today.&#34; Again, I&#39;m baffled. So, people have been complaining about them...but you are not only continuing to serve them...you are recommending them and have not tasted them yourself. She tosses a few more excuses our way and then goes. All three chicken and waffle eaters cannot eat their waffles...so half their breakfast is gone. The other two meals that were ordered: Northside Rancheros and the Fritatta (which was split) also go unfinished, because while those aren&#39;t inedible they really just aren&#39;t that great.  

So, we&#39;re now on the 2hour 30minute mark, I have to get out of this place. Finally we flag down our waiter and get our bill. Nothing has been removed or discounted. Again the waffles were not inedible because these are picky eaters, there was very literally something horribly wrong with the batch (we&#39;re thinking too much baking soda or something) that made them that way. Since it&#39;s clear that our waiter is not going to come pick up the check we finally take it inside to pay so we can escape and leave having lost almost 3 hours of our lives, with everyone still hungry and baffled by the experience we had just had."

I love the area that they have set up shop.  The outside seating was a little loud due to passing traffic, but I&#39;m betting on a busy weekend you&#39;d hardly notice, and also there is plenty of seating inside.

We were somewhat dissapointed with their pancake batter.  Tasted a bit acrid to the point we brought it up.  However, staff was quick to not make us feel crazy, and asked for a replacement dish (chicken and waffles-the chicken was fantastic and again staff was so gracious and took care of us!).

This place is new, and there are still some kinks to work out.  However, the passion and customer service shines.  I am betting I saw one of the owners 4 times,  as well as the chef.  There is a clear commitment here to creating a great place.   And for me,  regardless of hiccups, makes me excited to come back again .

Huge winners on customer service, and as a side note their cocktails were creative, delicious, and reasonably priced!  Neighborhood start-up doing many things right.

**edit** Brought to my attention by a friend (not ownership), batter is gluten free. Not my jam, and if this was more apparent, perhaps would have considered another option. Still doesn&#39;t diminish from this being an up-and-coming gem."

We arrived on Sunday around 11:30-12.  If you have 2 hours to spare for brunch, this is the place for you.  The chef and the waitstaff are on vacation time.

They added chilaquiles to the menu! The red sauce is delicious, chips stayed crispy, total flavor reminds me of Mexico. The hash browns are light, crispy, almost fluffy if a potato could be that.

We were informed that most of the menu could be done gluten free! Yayyyyy! We also ordered coffee, which was excellent and a beverage, the garden smash. The smash didn&#39;t look like much but we were pleasantly surprised upon tasting it. It was full flavored and delish! Sweet and savory with a hint of citrusy spice.

I have been following them closely on social media. It was great to finally eat there. We were seated promptly and our waiter was attentive and delightful. Loved the interior - cozy, charming and comfortable. I had the veggie hash and some French onion soup. It was really good and the servings were a nice size and well presented.

We started by sharing a maple-pumpkin-cinnamon roll (with bacon!), which, by itself, was absolutely worth the hour&#39;s drive it took for us to get there-and it got better from there. My wife had the veggie hash with poached egg, and she said it was great. I had the biscuits with chorizo gravy, (which included a scrambled egg), and it was absolutely marvelous. The food is fresh, flavorful, and actually healthy (yes, even the biscuits and gravy!). My Garden Bloody Mary was among the best I&#39;ve ever had, and their coffee was good too. Can&#39;t say enough nice things about this place, the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is fun without being pretentious, and Chef Socarras and his kitchen staff do wonders with food.

My friend and I could barely communicate because the place was so loud.  This seems to be a theme among the newer places in Denver - horrible acoustics creating an environment where one has to add to the noise by screaming to their companions just to converse.
Food was pretty good, though the fried chicken coating (w/ waffles) was very dark...suspect that batch of oil was past its useful life.  My friend said the biscuits and gravy was excellent."

She told us all about the restaurant before it opened and how excited she was. I have been so excited to try it out since she told us and we  finally went in on Monday to have our meeting there; I fell in love.  It definitely exceeded my expectations, Vanessa (and her family) really out did themselves! Everything is great from the food to the atmosphere to the customer service. 

I ordered the Mario sandwich, it was delicious and the portion was sized well. My coworkers ordered the Lobster BLT, the Veggie Bake and the green chili Biscuits and Gravy and they all had amazing reviews. Definitely a 5-star rating, hands down. I can&#39;t wait to come visit for brunch on the weekends, or for their new dinner menu.

The service was friendly but what takes away most of the stars is that it took nearly an hour from getting seated to having our meals served. There was a steady flow of customers but waiting as long as we did was unacceptable especially when a couple who was seated 5 minutes before our food arrived had their meal in less than 10 minutes. The food was tasty but to drop $40 for a couple of entrees and coffee seems a bit much. I&#39;ll stick to Javier&#39;s and DJ Berkeley.

I would love to see more options on the menu, but there was enough variety to not get cornered (although not enough variety to warrant many revisits). That being said, although the simple eggs, bacon, and hash-browns breakfast tasted good, I do not believe it to be worth $9.   Perhaps 3 eggs and thick cut bacon would make the price a bit more defensible.  Felt like I was paying more for location and ambiance."

The strip mall location is deceiving but once inside the space feels welcoming and cozy. Outdoor patio around back is lacking views as it backs up to a vacant lot and you often have to share the space with smokers. 
If you love Alaskan beers then you will love the beer selection. A couple of rotating taps of local beers would be a huge win for the 49th and folks looking for more variety in their beer selection. 
Hamburgers are the way to go if you are hungry and are some of the best in the area. I&#39;ve had a couple of times where the kitchen has gotten the temp wrong (mw instead of mr) but the staff has always been quick and friendly in terms of sending it back to get it done right."

The only minus point is that there is only one low table in the whole place.  It is high tables otherwise.

The inside is much more inviting than the outside in the shopping mall. Definitely give it a try - the bar is Alaskan themed with lots of Alaskan beers and fish options. I had the fish sandwich and it was amazing! The fish was cooked perfectly, the bun was very soft and not overwhelming with bread, and the pickle and relish was fresh. They give you so many chips or fries too! The fries had a great spice to them and the chips were crunchy and not greasy. Our party had the BLTs and fish sandwiches and everyone was pleased.

Perfect spot to watch the games on Sunday or get a casual bite to eat after work.

If your a Littleton local this is a great spot to try!"

I can&#39;t say enough good things about the service. We wanted for nothing. The friendly staff anticipated our every need and provided accordingly. I know it might sound like I&#39;m some kind of wanna be royalty, but it&#39;sa rare treat to have a meal without looking around for someone to bring you a fork or a side of something. 

Their food is really quite tasty and the Alaska concept is fun. The Man had the salmon fish and chips, and I had the special whole soft shell crab Sammy. The Boy had the calamari which was perfectly done and a generous portion. 

It&#39;s just really nice to go to a place that isn&#39;t just a money machine for an investor. Too often in Denver, a restaurant sets up shop, does great in the beginning, makes money, and then dies a slow painful death from a lack of care and passion. Someone obviously cares here, and that means EVERYONE cares, and it really shows."

An Alaskan-themed bar and grill in the depths of a Southwest Denver strip mall. You walk into the 49th and are transported to a much cozier, cabin-like atmosphere than anything outside would suggest.

We tried the burgers and the beers which were both tasty. The service was good and, even when the server ran into a few snags, they were apologetic and made it right.

If you&#39;re in the area looking for a burger, beer, and some good company watching football, give these guys a try. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

The outside doesn&#39;t look like much being located in an old strip mall, but the inside has been transformed into a cozy Alaskan cabin complete with a &#34;wood burning&#34; fireplace! 

We ordered the Deadliest Catch Crab Dip, which is a hot, cheesy, crab and artichoke dip served with crudites and baguette. It was delicious! I thought it would taste funny with some of the cold veggie crudites, but it paired very well together.

For dinner we both ordered burgers. I ordered the Denali with pub chips and asked for a fried egg on top. It was good -- very filling as it had two burger patties on it. My wife ordered the Kodiak burger. The bacon jam on the burger was not sweet like you would expect a fruit jam to be. It was more of a bacon puree. The burgers were great, but we did not feel they were anything special.

Next time, I&#39;d like to venture out on the menu and try something more &#34;Alaskan&#34; and unique to the menu -- something with crab or fish in it!"

As everyone else mentioned, the place is located in an unassuming strip mall off Kipling, but once you step inside, the surroundings are warm and service is friendly.

Our waitress was super sweet and had great recommendations. We started with the Cape Nome chicken wings - half Alaskan buffalo and half Jalapeno-Lime Jam. I want to put that Jalapeno-Lime Jam on EVERYTHING now.  Seriously, the wings were awesome. Perfectly hot and crispy, without even having to ask for extra crispy! (because, c&#39;mon, no one likes rubbery wings!)

I went with the Hangover Burger because I&#39;m a sucker for any burger with an egg on it, and the BF had the lobster mac &#39;n cheese with Cheeto crumble crust. The food was great. Perfectly cooked burger, hot and crispy fries and the pasta dish was fantastic as well. Really, we were pleasantly surprised at how awesome the food was.

One of the owners was behind the bar and we chatted for a  few minutes - super nice guy.

I don&#39;t like far from the 49th and I&#39;m stunned that a place this good exists and I&#39;d never heard of it. Definitely a bit of a hidden gem.

So, the 49th is a reference to our 49th state and it is surprisingly wonderful! I had their burger special (a Hawaiian burger) and my first impression was that the serving size looked small. Honestly though, I think the portion was perfect rather than places that give you way too much food.

As for the food itself, wonderful! Burger nicely cooked and flavorful, very inventive too. My colleague got the salmon and she loved it. She said it was better than most of the salmon she has ever had.

This place is on the higher end of 4 stars and I&#39;m definitely coming back to try their wings! They sounded amazing and this place is just awesome. If the wings hit the mark, I&#39;ll have a hard time holding back that fifth star."

Service was still excellent and the food quality has improved a lot. Not sure if sauces were what did it last time, but this time I had no complaints.
Although, Do not get the beer cheese and pretzels, it&#39;s just pretzel sticks with cold creamed cheese.. Do the crab cakes instead and you&#39;ll be much happier.

We were starving so ordered a bowl of chili first thing. That day they had elk chili which was so outstanding! We didn&#39;t get beers but they had a great selections.

Ryan K. came to The 49th on a snowy, cold Denver evening, which we found fitting for our first time to The 49th. The place stays very busy, even early on a Friday night--however, just put your name on the waitlist and you&#39;ll surely be seated in a relatively short amount of time. 

There&#39;s a feeling of coziness at The 49th that really makes you feel like you have been transported to a small mountain town--cozy atmosphere/lighting, friendly servers and bartenders, and delicious food = a GREAT combo.

We waited about ten minutes and then got seats at the bar. Beer lovers, rejoice: a decent number of both Alaskan and local Coloradan beers are on tap. Our bartender and server, Josh, is also the owner of The 49th: very kind and accommodating guy. 

For food, we ordered:

- The Deadliest Catch Crab Dip: a very creamy and rich dip, served with raw veggies and warm baguette slices. Flavorful and filling! $9.95

- Kenai Crab Cake Sandwich: Yum! I haven&#39;t had such a delicious crab cake sandwich in quite awhile. Tasty 49th sauce on the crab cake and the price is really reasonable for the amount of crab cake: $12.95

- Cordova Chipotle Glazed Salmon: Ryan K. ordered this and thoroughly enjoyed the entree. The salmon flaked perfectly and was served over aromatic rice and veggies. 

We&#39;ll definitely return to The 49th soon again!"

I was a bit hesitant to try their burgers even though the different toppings looked amazing because I&#39;ve never had a elk burger. All their burgers are 60% beef and 40% elk blended. I&#39;m not a big fan of gamey taste or buffalo, I just like my beef. To be honest if they didn&#39;t advertise it as elk I wouldn&#39;t know it. Slightly sweet taste but otherwise not much different. Their fries are way better than their pub chips. 

My wife got the fish and chips, those were great too. Along with that we got the crab and artichoke dip and it was amazing. I&#39;m tempted to come here and just split a bunch of appetizers, it&#39;s the strongest part of the menu. Can&#39;t wait to go try brunch. 

On a weekday for lunch they only had one waitress who also served as bartender, but she was all over it. phenomenal quick service and food. 

The only negative I can say is all but one of their tables are bar height, I prefer a lower table especially when we are with my daughter who is in a wheelchair."

I was not disappointed! The place was packed when we got there on a Wednesday evening, which is usually a good sign. We had a party of 6, and they were very accommodating and friendly. Delicious salmon, fish cakes, elk meatloaf, fries, and chicken club! Everything was very well made and fresh with large portions. The atmosphere is so cozy with the log cabin siding and a fireplace - you feel like you&#39;re in a lodge in the mountains, not a little strip mall off Kipling! There was so much on the menu I wanted to try, so I&#39;ll definitely be back so I can order something else."

We happened upon it one day, and thought we would give it a try. Since then it has become one of our favorites. It&#39;s tucked in the middle of a strip mall, and it&#39;s got a great patio for the summertime. 
The food is absolutely amazing, I try something new every time and I have not been disappointed  once. They have a special everyday which either myself or my husband will try and share with something off the menu. Every couple of months they will have lobster mac and cheese and it&#39;s phenomenal. 
My favorite thing is the Salmon Fish and Chips, I highly recommend it. 
The owner is so nice, and you&#39;ll find him behind the bar, or running around helping the servers, it is really a great team of people working there. We complimented the food to him and he humbly gave all the credit to his chefs. You can tell he really loves his business and his staff. Everyone helps one another effortlessly. We always have the same server and she is wonderful! Never have to ask for refills and she always remembers what we like to drink. They have great beers on tap, my fave is the Alaskan White. 
It a town full of chains it&#39;s refreshing to have such a great local restaurant with amazing food and service.

Otherwise the place is a proto-corporate (meaning it looks like a cool chain) tavern with cool food. They had three different kinds of fish crabcakes in one appetizer! Was tasty. Wings were good too.

Amazing food! Much more than the typical bar food fare.

My favorite would be the Knik Blackberry Bourbon Burger 
49th features some very unique options such as such as Glenallen Grilled Cheese- try with Grilled Apple and Bacon.
High quality seafood option recommendations include Alaskan &#34;Cake&#34; Flight- 3 unique Crab Cake appetizer or their Seward Blackened Cobb Caesar Salad.

Thinking about it -- whatever you choose food will be on point.

Favorite is the horseradish vodka in bloody Mary served with an abundance of treats.  Also, if your on business and need a &#34;nerd&#34; corner with plug in - they got it.

Lots of Alaskan brewery on tap. I was a bit hungover from a concert and the Bloody Mary hit the spot. 

They made a delicious burger with jalapeños, I remember the bun being very tasty and the meat cooked to proper temperature. 

The bartender was busy but still very attentive, I would have had another Bloody Mary but I had to hurry out to meet some friends for disc golf down the street from here.

We started with the delicious seafood dip which came with several types of fresh veggies and toasted french bread bites.  I got the soup &amp; salad.  The mixed greens were so fresh.  Hubs got the fish and chips made with salmon.  They also had a cod option which he said he&#39;d want to try next time.

Being raised in Alaska I couldn&#39;t resist coming here after moving out to Morrison from Denver.  Since we were looking for a new neighborhood hangout we decided to try this place first! 
I love the decor, it&#39;s rustic (like Alaska) without being too kitschy.  They have a nice little back patio area, but limited seating. I suspect this fills up quickly on nice evenings.  The menu has your normal soup, salad, burgers, and sandwiches but with Alaskan names. However, I find this incredibly appealing because it triggers a lot of nostalgic memories from my childhood.  
I ordered the Knick Blackberry Burger, medium.  It was slightly over cooked (not enough to send back) and I found the jalapeños to overpower the blackberry jam; but overall I enjoyed the burger.  My boyfriend ordered the Birch Creek Breakfast Sandwich.  It was delicious! Next time I come, if it happens to be during brunch, I am ordering that!  Service was also excellent!

All the burgers are a combination of beef and elk meat, which goes along with the Alaskan theme perfectly. The food is mouthwatering and very well priced, they also offer daily specialty drinks/entrees which is a very nice addition to their menus. 

The service is what sets this place apart! From the amazing waitress to the kitchen manager and bartender/owner everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. We ended up staying all the way up to closing just talking to the bartender and kitchen manager. 

Overall I cannot speak any higher of this place! It surpassed all of my expectations. I recommend this place for all occasions.

When I read about it, I thought the theme sounded a little cheesy, but it turned out great. The food is different from a lot of bar food. Yeah, there are burgers, but also elk meatloaf?! My brother is a fish snob, but he really liked his fish and chips--and he was stoked that he could get it in salmon; neither of us had seen that before. I had the crab cake sandwich. I was a little weirded out by getting a lime wedge instead of lemon with it, but it worked with the spice level (I probably would&#39;ve come to Colorado sooner if I&#39;d known that the food is actually spicy here, and there&#39;s green chili everywhere.) The beer list is basically all Alaskan, except for Coors, if you count that as beer.

On a Friday night at 7, there was a short wait. So, we grabbed a couple beers while we waited--Alaskan Brewing Company is well represented there--and we sat at the bar when a couple seats opened up. 

I ordered the Haines Hangover burger, medium rare, and my husband ordered the Mt. Iliamna burger, rare. Like I said--I eat meat very rarely. But when I do, I want it to be cooked perfectly, or at least within range. Our burgers were PERFECT! I was amazed. And they were so delicious. The fries that came with them were amazing too. 

I know, I know--it&#39;s a burger and fries. But it really wasn&#39;t just a burger and fries. It was delicious.

That is $9.  My last visit ordered the BLT &#34;Special&#34; with avocado, and it came to $12!!!  It is basically the chicken club without the chicken, how can it be so much more with less food?  Especially the protein. 

So I recommend you stay away from specials, stick with the Chicken Club, Fish and Chips, Crab Cake Sandwich, and the Blue Cheese Chips.   Also, skip the Berry Salad, it is very bland."

If you want a crazy-good burger and some of the coldest, flavor-packed beers known to man, this is your place.  It&#39;s more small bar than restaurant but it has a homey feel about it. Service is top shelf.  I was greeted immediately upon entering and offered a table.  

The &#34;hangover burger&#34; concept wasn&#39;t unique as I&#39;ve had burgers topped with eggs before. What was unique was the combination of elk/beef burger cooked perfectly medium topped with cheddar cheese, home cured and wonderfully crispy bacon (thick), French fries and an over easy egg somehow fit inside a lightly toasted part roll/part bun.  It was amazingly juicy, perfectly seasoned, not &#34;over-cheesed&#34; and didn&#39;t need one single condiment.  I garnished the burger with an order of home fried pub chips that were good enough. I complimented the hangover with an ice-cold APA from Alaska (several beers to choose from including the standard pedestrian beers that Denver is famous for).

There is really something for everyone here; great appetizers, fish, burgers, fill-in-the-blankaterian options and homemade mac and cheese (wish I had room to try this but no).

Thanks again Yelp for pointing me to a little piece of a state I may never get to.  I&#39;m going to order elk from my local butcher and see if I can duplicate the hangover.  Even if I can, I&#39;ll be back to the 49th."

We ordered the Denali burger and the blueberry brownie. The burger was definitely filling and hit the spot. The brownies was fantastic and the flavored were very well done. We probably would&#39;ve ordered a second brownie if we had room. We didn&#39;t order any drinks but it is neat to see things served in Mason jars.

We live around the area and I just  happened to come across this place as I was scoping out new restaurants.Just like the others say: it looks like a dive esp. From the run down strip mall it&#39;s in. It is a TOTAL GEM!! 
When you walk in it is completely different then the exterior appearance. It looks like an Alaskan cabin inside.  The bartender was also our waitor as it was a Sunday and they weren&#39;t overly packed so there was one waitress for half the bar and the bartender was a waitor for the other half.  He did an excellent job and was very nice as I asked him a bunch of questions regarding what the best choices were for food.  The menu had a variety of things to pick from but it wasn&#39;t  overly extensive- everything looks appetizing!  We got the crab dip for an app and it was Excellent- it came with an assortment of fresh veggies to dip and French bread. YUM!! For the entrée I got the elk Bourbon Burger that had a berry jam, blue cheese and fried jalapeño on top of it with a side of steak fries! It was absolutely delicious - I highly recommend this Burger.  My hubs got the crab cake Burger, it was great too but too fishy for my liking!  
The beers came in Mason jars in 2 different sizes and were a decent price!  The Alaskan White is what I had and it was a really tasty beer. They also have a Pay It forward board that was interesting. Check it out when you&#39;re in The 49th, pretty cool concept! We will be back!"

This place is a gem hidden in what looks to be a small borderline sketch strip mall.
The atmosphere in the 49th is wonderful.  You feel like you are in a log cabin in Alaska from the décor, the fireplace, the high top wooden tables, everything is really charming.
The Alaskan beers on draft are fantastic. All served in tall mason jars. They have several on tap but I usually end up ordering the white because it&#39;s become my favorite.
We have been here several times now, usually for dinner.  Really love the wings, the dry rub seasoning is awesome.  I usually order the chicken salad for dinner, which is a huge salad with seasoned grilled chicken, some veggies, and really thin tortilla strips. This is the type of salad you can order even when you are starving, its delicious and will fill you up. I actual can never eat the entire thing.  My fiancé usually orders one of the burgers which never disappoints.
We came here for brunch one time....which was unreal.  We are very particular about bloody marys, and this place blew me away. We actually stayed longer than we expected so we could finish our drinks. We each ordered the &#34;Hair of the Bear&#34;.  This thing is huge, and the garnishes are plentiful and delicious.  These monster bloody marys were garnished with thick cut bacon, other meats, cheeses (like huge chunks of fresh cheese), and veggies.  It was basically a small meal in itself. Very tasty and impressive bloody mary to say the least.
Lastly, service here has always been amazing. The waitresses are all very friendly, attentive, and quick.  This is the type of place you will never get sick of coming to."

It&#39;s located in a somewhat obscure little strip mall, but it&#39;s easy to get to and has good parking once you get there. Some bears roaming the parking lot would probably add to the Alaska ambiance (but at the same time would scare the you-know-what out of me). Otherwise, I don&#39;t know how distinctly &#34;Alaska&#34; the motif is, but it&#39;s rustic, &#34;mountain man-like&#34; and pleasant. They were very busy on a Sunday night after a Bronco game, but attentive and concerned that our wait not be long, and overall our service was excellent.

The menu is very interesting, and all of our entrees except one were terrific. The less than terrific entrée was a special of the day - mac and cheese with elk meat. It sounded interesting but didn&#39;t deliver - was bland, served fairly cold, and pretty much across the board off the otherwise high mark of our orders. Other Yelpers have commented, and I agree, that the fish and chips were excellent - your choice, salmon or cod - we had the cod. Their burgers are made with a blend of elk and beef -  we had the Kodiak Burger - bacon jam, Swiss cheese, crispy onion straws, and grilled apple (delicious but a little sweet - I know, duh - with jam and grilled apples, what did I expect?). Haven&#39;t tried it yet but the Knik Blackberry Bourbon Burger (blackberry bourbon glaze, blue cheese crumbles, and fried jalapeno strips) and Eagle River Elk Meatloaf are on my &#34;to try&#34; list for return visits. And yes, I know that I can&#39;t whine when the blackberry bourbon glaze makes the burger &#34;a little sweet.&#34; Haven&#39;t been for brunch, but if you&#39;re of the mind, apparently you can go for the Moose Droppings chased by a Duck Fart (which they would have us believe is the &#34;signature shot of Alaska&#34;) - hey, don&#39;t blame me - I&#39;m just the faithful Yelp messenger.

Most of the menu items are under $10 and almost everything is under $15, so the value is there as well. 

The 49th - good food, good service, good value, and a different shtick - works for me."

The boyfriend was craving Mexican and we decided on this place since it had great reviews on here and was less than a mile away from home.

When we arrived this place was busy so my first thought was &#34;Wow, the food must be really good here!&#34; First the hostess seated us at a &#34;community table&#34;. If you don&#39;t have a reservation, you will be seated here and possibly have to share the table with others. I noticed a lot of restaurants are starting to have those. There were clearly tables available but since we didn&#39;t have a reservation we got seated there. It was a Tuesday night and didn&#39;t think we needed one. So we opted for the bar instead. 

The ambience is nice but one huge downside to this place is the noise level. The music is so loud and on top of that you can barely hear your own conversation. 

Our waitress was very knowledgeable on the menu. Chips and salsa are complimentary. We ordered the Brussels Sprouts which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. For dinner, the boyfriend went with the enchiladas and I chose the taquitos. He liked his dish but surprisingly when he asked for rice they didn&#39;t have any! Our waitress said &#34;we&#39;re not a traditional Mexican restaurant&#34;. As for the taquitos, I felt like the flavors were bland and it was missing something... like cheese. If you actually eat the chicken by itself, there&#39;s actually flavor but I think the other things on there overpowered it. At the end of dinner, they give you these really good cookies. 

Overall, the food was ok, portions were huge, prices were great but maybe this place is more known for their tacos? If we ever come back, maybe I&#39;ll order them."

My husband and I love tacos, so we decided to order several tacos, only to be disappointed 5 out of 7 we ordered.  The octopus and the chicken taco,  did not disappoint.  The pork shoulder was dry and definitely needed a sauce on top, the steak was okay served plain (no sauce, nothing). Maybe that was a mistake, when we received these tacos, but nothing was fancy or great tasting about them.  The salsa was good, Pig Nachos were good, but just a little heavy on the salt, the cookies they serve you when you&#39;re paying for your meal(s) was delicious. The Beer and Marg combined together was delicious, as well as my spicy Margarita.  The staff is not very friendly, which you would assume because of the environment. 

If the tacos were dressed up more, and the meat was not dry and the staff was more friendly, then I would give this place 4 stars.  I might come back, but I heard there are other great places throughout Denver that serve delicious tacos....like Comida in the RiNo district."

Soft corn tortillas (flour tortilla available on request, but why would you want that?). It&#39;s easy and fun to mix and match, as they come one taco per order, around $4 each. I can&#39;t even pick a favorite, because they were all delicious. One recurring theme is a smokey chipotle seasoning that flavors at least one component in each dish. 

Veg friendly options are the pinto bean cotija cheese taco and the seasonal veggie taco, which changes monthly. Mine came with asparagus, snap peas and crispy potatoes. Each taco is topped with a fresh raw component, like a slaw or thinly sliced radish, which adds a nice crunch and texture. Yum yum YUM! 

The drink list is very extensive, including some very nice top shelf Tequila. Prices reasonable, service outstanding, and you get home made cookies for dessert. They looked delicious, unfortunately, I steer clear of wheat, so I couldn&#39;t try it. 

Will be back for happy hour!"

The frozen margarita is my go-to, mostly because they constantly change it. They only have one type each day, but it&#39;s always delicious! I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here, but my review would not be complete without mentioning the amazing Brussels sprouts, the yummy tacos (I always go for the &#34;garden&#34; taco which has ranged from roasted cauliflower to breaded tofu...yum!), the salsas, and heck, even the Kale salad is delicious!

It has such a great vibe and the food is delicious. I would definitely recommend the happy hour here.  They have some great deals on some yummy apps. Tacos are only $2 and they are just so incredibly flavorful. Also they have a great seafood- give the salmon ceviche a try. 
The drink deals also great. They have a good deal on a shot/beer combo or you could always try their cocktail of the day.

Thousand dollar lingerie, and Jewels my only company... I cant help but to wish I could go to Los Chingones in Denver tonight. Can I just get a Lobster Taco please? Is that to much to ask? 

Parking Complimentary and Easy
Nice Restroom

Lobster Taco A+ Good as F 
Ive Never had a lobster taco in my life that I liked enough to pay for again~ Until now. Thank You Los Chingones! 

Shrimp Taco A+ 
About halfway through my first Shrimp Taco I forgot what the Lobster Taco tasted like HA! 
Ive been trying to determine which one I like better. Um. I&#39;ll let you know when I figure that one out. :D #FirstWorldProblems

Poke A+ Good as F 
I don&#39;t even like Poke. I blame Brian for this one. I would have waited for a friend to order it, then try a hopeful bite (usually to be reminded that I don&#39;t like Poke) However now I am addicted to Los Chingones Poke, and want some everyday. 

Relleno A+ 
Im 98% Gluten free. I knew not to eat it, but I knew according to the other food it would probably be amazing (and god knows I love the Relleno tacos at City Taco in San Diego) so yeah I ordered it~ My tum hurt haaaa, but it was worth it. I won&#39;t eat it again, cause I don&#39;t like to stress my body out, but it was amazing, and I want to eat it again. You Lucky non allergy havin B&#39;s you. More relleno for you. *Gives everyone with no allergies evil eyes -,- * jejejeje

Octopus Taco ???
Stop eating my Tacos Jose~! Jejejejejejjeejje
Will update review when I actually get to try one hmphf! :P 

Fish Taco ??? 
Why you no have Grilled Fish taco?  I loooooove Fish Taco~! Just cant do the fried ones (that gluten free thing.) Sad Face.
Until then I shall have the other Tacos HappE Face :D 

Shrimp Cocktail? A+ 
The Sauce that comes with this is soooooo amazing omg I pile a bunch of it on my big ole shrimp Chingona style cause thats how I roll with my food. No fear foo! Spicy you say? I challenge that! Bring it on. You will probably be on the losing end. Though there are those who like it so damn hot you cant taste the food (in which case I will humbly accept my loss) I like to be in a heaven of flavors~ not in pain. 
Who is the chef? Is he single!?! Someone get that man a bodyguard~! Jejejejejejejejejjeeje

Brussel Sprouts A! 
OmyLordy I have never had brussel sprouts made like this. So Freakin good and 3$ at Happy Hour?!? Im there! 

Complimentary Salsa and Chips A+ 
This Chips N Salsa is good. It is not your everyday crappy Chips N Salsa most places serve. Thank the Lordy for that. Salsa is Important~! The chips are really good too. I have to make myself stop eating them to save room for dinner. They are that kinda addictive cant eat just one kinda chip. Simplicity at its finest! Nom! 

Chris made me some kind of Delicious Non-Alcoholic beverage. The Bartenders are Talented and helpful. They have an amazing assortment of Fruits, herbs, all kinds of blends and interesting stuff going on behind that bar.

Customer Service A+ 
Wow everyone that works here is on it! Refreshing and Appreciated. 

Ambiance A+ 
Love the lively Vibe and Music in here. Im not one for happy hours, but Im down with this place. Lots of options for seating from Booths, to Hightop Tables, those interesting comfy chair tables, or the bar where the drinks are made, the bar where the food is made. 

Cons: 
None because Lunch is coming soon~! 


I look forward to coming back and trying the Salsa flight, Kale salad, Octopus Taco (-,- Joseee :p)  I loooove Guac and can&#39;t wait to try it here. Theres no way it could live up to mine... Or could it? : o ! Mixed drink one day, Pretty much everything I have&#39;t tried yet :D 

The Place I decided to try in San Francisco just did not add up. I&#39;m gonna hit The Mission next time for sure. The hunt for an amazing place in SF continues. I am happy to be returning home to Denver today, and Los Chingones."

The boyfriend and I finally moseyed on over last weekend before a play. 

The restaurant has a very industrial feel with exposed duct work and metal looking chairs. But then it has splashes of color like striped booths and wall graffiti. It&#39;s a fun marriage of styles that you don&#39;t usually see in DTC. 

We weren&#39;t too hungry (I mean, it was 5:30 on a Saturday) but I got the lamb neck taco and the red chili pork taco. They were both a little spicy, which I enjoy! The meat was perfectly tender on both. The boyfriend got the beef cheek taco. It had green chili on it so he said it had a little kick as well but didn&#39;t overwhelm the flavor of the meat. 

The house salsa was a good mixture of smooth and chunky. I don&#39;t like overly chunky salsa so I thought it was perfect. They bring a water pitcher/bottle to your table so you can refill your own glass, but almost every time they walked by they would go ahead and top us off.

I opted for a poma loma instead of the basic marg. It was yummy but the glass was small and there was a lot of ice so it lasted about 2 and a half gulps. I&#39;ll probably get it again but only during happy hour. 

It&#39;s exciting to have a fun, unique place in DTC, especially one I can walk to. I forsee myself becoming a happy hour regular. Especially since I plan to try every taco they have. You know, just so that I can give a proper recommendation to others."

Vibe: Big restaurant with an open bar so that you can either look outside on to their patio or face inwards, towards the restaurant. Beautiful painted murals all over the walls, with bright &amp; colorful furniture. Music was a little loud, but nobody likes to drink tequila in complete silence! 

Drinks: Good beer selection and extensive tequila selection. I had beer while my husband had one of their margaritas, which he said was delicious! 

Service: Amazing! We sat down right away and service was very attentive. Our water glasses were always refilled before we ran out. And our server was hilarious! Everyone we came across was very friendly. I could tell that the entire staff was very happy to be working there and they all seem to be having fun.

Food: YUM! And reasonably priced! Chips &amp; salsa are complimentary which is always a plus. Their complimentary salsa was very good but they also have 6 other salsas, so we ordered a salsa flight! The habanero salsa is hot as F. Their chipotle pineapple salsa was my absolute favorite though! Smoky flavor due to the chipotle, but also sweet from the pineapple. This is some of the best salsa I&#39;ve had in my life.

Bean Dip appetizer seemed like more cheese &amp; sauce, and less beans. I&#39;ll probably skip that next time but everything else was amazing! They have a great selection of tacos which are about $4 each, and you can mix &amp; match. Their steak taco was insanely good and the meat was cooked perfectly. I think my favorite thing about this place was that all of the tacos tasted FRESH, including their tortillas. 

Last, they served us their complimentary homemade cookies for dessert which were nothing like I&#39;ve ever had before! I can&#39;t remember the unique ingredients in the cookies but they were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had! I would come back just to eat 50 of their cookies!"

The atmosphere is cool and it&#39;s in a new area. Good drink menu, although all cocktails were tequila based. The food was amazing. The lamb neck tacos are our spicy favorite. All that we ordered was good. And they give you warm salty cookies with your check which I would go to get alone!"

The first time was a little unsettling because the first two tacos I attempted to order were 86d off the menu because all the meat was gone. Not a bad thing for the restaurant but not great for me. With this we decided to give it another try. 

This time my selection was available (lamb neck) and it was damn good. I also got the nacho appetizer as my entree and was not disappointed. 

Overall, a great add to the DTC area."

We stopped in for dinner while in town on business and needless to say I may just have to make up a true &#34;business need&#34; just to return to this place. 

The basics:
-Under no circumstances should you pass up on the shrimp and steak tacos. The shrimp taco was especially our favorite.
-The house margaritas are the way to go, they will quench your thirst any day of the week.
-The chips &amp; salsa are so good, but do yourself a favor and don&#39;t fill up on them, because everything coming after that is worth saving room for. 

We also ordered the salmon ceviche which was on a specials menu. Never having had a salmon ceviche we both were very pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the quality and freshness. 

So do yourself a favor and plug this amazing joint into your GPS and just go.....now. You won&#39;t regret it."

All of their meat is marinated 24 hours prior to serving (I know because I asked the waiter). That gives the food a depth of flavor you just don&#39;t get anywhere else. The second reason this place gets 5 stars is the price. Some of the most flavorful food I have ever had, at a low price. What is not to like. I also tried the Raw Bar. The yellowtail literally melted in my mouth. For dinner I toured all of their tacos. And the drinks were amazing. Authentic fusion drinks. Just delicious.

It has an industrial feel in the bar area and low lit, more romantic booth settings on the other side. We got there for happy hour (4-6pm) and they have excellent pricing. 

Pig Nachos $5, and $2 tacos. We tried the nachos (3/5 - they were very salty), two of the tacos (pulled pork 5/5, lamb neck 5/5) and the Chile Relleno (2/5 - tasted bland, no goat cheese as described, breading crunchy but oily). They do have a raw bar and I would be interested to try their sashimi, but raw bar seemed pricey - would be neat if they added some oysters to HH. You can get their house Margarita skinny for an extra $2. 

I&#39;ve had better &#34;elevated&#34; mexican food elsewhere, but I still give 4 stars for the great service and atmosphere and delicious tacos. Will try other items on the menu next few times we go and will update this review if something stands out."

The décor in the bar area was industrial-cool, but the music was so loud that it was a challenge to hear my fiancé speaking across the (small) table from me. Maybe I&#39;m just getting old and boring now I&#39;ve turned 30. 

We both ordered the house margarita (Los Marg) which was very heavy on the sour mix and very light on the tequila (I could barely taste it if it was indeed in there). The other drinks seemed heavily reliant on lots of sugary soda mixers, which really isn&#39;t my thing. 

The food was mostly just okay - the Brussels sprouts were tasty if a touch overcooked (thus rendering them a bit bitter), and the tacos were again, pretty okay (the octopus and chicken being the standouts in terms of flavour - and both the octopus and shrimp were cooked perfectly and weren&#39;t overdone), but the others were pretty standard. 

We did receive the complimentary cookies at the end, which is a nice touch, except sadly we&#39;re not really big on sweets. Our waitress was attentive and very enthusiastic about the menu, which is nice - though I wish the food and drinks lived up to the hype. 

I&#39;d maybe come back here for happy hour, so long as my margarita had tequila in it the next time."

We started out with appetizers; Tres pigs nachos, fundido, garden guacamole, Brussels sprouts, and chips and salsa. As you can imagine they were all outstanding. The nachos or smothered in cheese chorizo and other amazing things, I loved him. The brussels sprouts were also really delicious. Chips and salsa was good. The fundido was really good. Then to finish that off I had six amazing tacos. My favorites were the shrimp taco and the pork, but all of them were really good.

I wrote an awesome review and was excited to come back. So, a week later we drove down late in the afternoon and ended up here a little before 2pm, only to find out they were closed until 3pm. Naturally, we didn&#39;t wait, but that was our fault. I just assumed they were open for lunch.

Fast forward another week and we decided to try for a 3rd time. I live 10 minutes away and called ahead because it was a Friday at 5:30. They said they had no wait, so we hopped on down. When we arrived there were a few people in the doorway, but it didn&#39;t look too busy and we noticed several open tables when we passed by the windows. You could immediately tell that the employees weren&#39;t really sure what was going on, but we waited to speak with a host - one who greeted us with an iPad and a lot of confusion. The following is our dialogue: 
Me: &#34;How long of a wait for three?&#34;
Host: &#34;Um, probably about 15 minutes.&#34; 
Me: &#34;Okay, sure.&#34;
Host: &#34;I&#39;ll put you down for three in about 20 minutes.&#34;
Me: &#34;Uh, okay.&#34; *gives name*
Host: All right, that will be about 45 minutes.&#34;
Me: &#34;What?! You just said 15 minutes, and now it&#39;s 45.&#34;
Manager chimes in: &#34;We have a lot of reservations tonight. You should really call ahead on Friday and Saturday nights.&#34;

Dude, WE DID call ahead. So basically, out of three attempts, we&#39;ve managed to eat here once. When it gets busy, they are clueless. If you&#39;re going to eat here, probably steer clear of peak dining times. At this point we&#39;re 1 for 3. I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll try for this again."

I took my son for dinner after car shopping. I had a Margarita and I could have had two. We shared yummy Brussel sprouts, shrimp tacos and fish tacos. The shrimp tacos were delicious but I thought the fish smelled fishy. The Brussel sprouts were tasty and I order them everywhere.

Mexican in the area is suspect at best, that is until this place opened.  First off, if you go by the name &#39;the Badasses&#39; you better be good! And good they were.  Everything we had was awesome, almost, as was the service.  Our server was Carly, from MN, and she was on her game.  

Food is a bit adventurous, not your hole in the wall standard Mexican fare, but rather a regal version.  We started with the queso fundido and it was fabulous, even with the rattlesnake and rabbit chorizo. The low point of the meal had to be the brussel sprouts, then again, I am not a big fan to begin with. Next up was the Tamal and it was amazing!  We then added on some tacos (lobster and carnitas) which were also quite good.  I really enjoyed the lobster.  It had great flavor and a nice butter sauce.

Good drink selection with an assortment of cervezas to choose from. Little bonus came at the end of our meal as the chef sent out some cookies.  They were a mix with white chocolate, pumpkin seeds and chili powder."

The space is really cool and the staff are all fantastic. The price on drafts is a wee bit high and I&#39;d like to see a few spicy cocktails added to the mix, but it otherwise has a great menu.
Our first time in, we had grand plans to try a variety of offerings but we started with the Tres Pig Nachos and we were finished! The serving is enormous and SO.GOOD. I highly recommend this addition to any party table. If you order this as an entree for yourself, you will likely finish it because it is so delicious, but you will probably have to be rolled out of there.
Anyhoos, this last time we were in we opted for the Tamal, brussels sprouts, and 5 tacos. Everything was great. The brussels sprouts may have been a shade too seasoned- I do like to taste my veggies, too! But I would order it again. The tamal comes with a ton of guacamole and is very tender and yummy.
For tacos, we did the beef cheek, lamb, shrimp, veggie, and chicken thigh. My fave was the shrimp, followed by the lamb or chicken. But they were all very good.
We will return soon and definitely continue to work through the entire menu. Right now they&#39;re only open in the evenings but will start lunch service in January. Happy hour is M-F from 4:30-6:00."

los-chingones-dtc-denver,Cheryl L.,q1UgiumcDgva03ZHsTB0IA,"Canterbury, United Kingdom",1,1,1,527,55,dywyInRC_od_1FirNUrYAg,5.0,2015-11-09,"If you aren&#39;t on the mailing list for the TAG restaurant group you should be.  They were offering a friends and family deal prior to the full blown opening of the restaurant.  For this deal they offered your entire bill 50% off.  I couldn&#39;t pass this up.  So four of dined at this fabulous price and tried many things.  

In no particular order of preference:

Salsa flights - Rooster (house salad, comes when you sit down with chips), Chile Passila-Lime, Chipotle Pineapple, Guajillo, Tomatillo, Habanero (F**kin&#39; hot).  I liked them all, with the exception of Habanero (it really was F**kin&#39; hot and that would be an understatement).

Los Chingones Style Guac - Rattlesnake Chorizo, pickled jalapeno, cotija cheese, guajillo oil; I loved this dish, although at a regular menu price of $8, it was a very small portion for the price.  

Kale Salad - Black kale, apple, pumpkin seeds, cotija cheese, chipotle balsamic; One of the best Kale salads I think I&#39;ve ever had.  It had a tiny kick to it and I thought about ordering a second one but I ran out of room.  

Tres Pigs Nachos - Pinto bean dip, pico, crema, pickled jalapenos, sriracha-lime ailois, bacon, house made chorizo and chicharron; DELICIOUS!!!!!  How can you go wrong with three types of pig on nachos.  

Tamal - While it was good, it was my least favorite thing that I tried last night.  It was huge and stuffed nicely seasoned meat and it was a nice balance of flavor just a little under powered.  It needed something but I&#39;m not sure what it was.  

Fried anaheim Relleno - local goat cheese, apple salsa, black bean puree; This was a surprise favorite of everyone at the table.  The goat cheese added a nice tang although I&#39;m thinking it also had a different kind of melty, ooey, gooey type of cheese.  

Chicken Leg taco - There was a crunch to this taco.  I like when my dark chicken meat has a char/crunch on the edges - nicely done.

Beef Cheek taco - This taco fell a little flat for me.  The cheek while tender was underwhelming on the flavor for me.  

Garden Taco - Kale, sauteed squash; This is a seasonal taco and will at some point go away.  I liked this taco a lot.  I could have eaten three of four of this one.  My hands-down favorite taco of the night and perhaps my favorite taco ever!  

Wild Card Taco - Fried Oyster - My dining companion had this one and said it was good.  I&#39;m not a fan of fried oysters so I didn&#39;t try it.  It looked to have a good pile of oysters.  

Steak - again didn&#39;t have this but won the praises of my other dining companion, and she is pretty harsh when it comes to steak tacos.  

There is a Lobster taco on the menu that I so wanted to try but sadly they did not have them last night.  

Spicy Michelada - the menu says just a little bit of habanero - they lie.  This drink is burn your esophagus hot.  I was going to order one but decided I should try Dale Z.&#39;s first - glad I did.  I&#39;m still feeling the burn today.   

To end the meal Chocolate chip, mole cookies were delivered to our table.  I would say these are a cross between a snickerdoodle, chocolate chip and peanut butter cookie.  For me these were the best thing of the night.  

Our waitress, Lauren, was awesome - friendly, attentive and put up with our rowdy group.   The rest of the staff was just fabulous.  Our water bottle was never empty.

For it being the third night open there was no hint that they had just opened.  Perfect timing on the food and the staff was very knowledgeable about the menu.  Los Chingones DTC is definitely being run by professionals. 

Parking might be somewhat tricky once they get the apartments and other business are up and running in that area.  Currently there is street parking.  I was able to find a spot just down the block.  

Thank you for opening a location in the Denver Tech Center."

Started with the nachos and Brussels sprouts. Both very good. The nachos were not over loaded but still had a bit of something on each chip. The Brussels sprouts were good ( not sure how Mexican ) but a little over cooked for me, and I like crispy. 
They also had a raw bar. Yummy. I got oysters (from Washington state) and tasty we also got the tuna. This was the dish I would not order again. The mixture it came in was too over powering and way to much &#34;other&#34; stuff. It needed to be toned down and maybe served with chips.
I drank wine and my husband had a whiskey cocktail that was yummy.
The staff here were all great and so friendly. This is a must and so great to have it close by. I will be back."

Our server was Sunshine. Great service, good food! She suggested/sold us on the rattlesnake, rabbit, pork nachos. Never would have tried them on our own, but she definitely sold us on her &#34;pitch&#34;. Very good. We also had tacos and spicy margaritas, which were just as good. 
Crazy encounter with the host two hrs into our visit. He came to our table and told us he had a reservation in ten mins and we needed to go. With full drinks and confusion, it seemed as if we were getting kicked out. Long story short, our server insured we were fine and let us finish our evening.

It is a little tricky to find on the north side of Belleview Ave at the north of the DTC. I didn&#39;t let my prejudice about unbridled, new development going on in Denver influence me though. I thought it looked interesting, but the wave of sound that hit me when I walked in the door almost knocked me off my feet. This place is LOUD. At the risk of sounding like a crotchety, old fart, it&#39;s clearly trying to cater to the young, cool, hipster crowd...or maybe as a previous reviewer said, it&#39;s trying to be fun. The floor is cement, the walls are cement with sort of artsy graffiti type decor. Exposed duct work in the ceiling. This gives it kind of a cold ambience. It&#39;s also surprisingly big, and the seating is tight, and it was packed. Hence the noise level.

The tacos and the salsas were very tasty. It&#39;s been a while since we went there, so I can&#39;t remember exactly what we had, but I do remember them being mostly interesting and good. There was one (again I can&#39;t remember exactly what), that wasn&#39;t as successful a combination as the others though. 

The margaritas were the most watered down drinks I&#39;ve had in a long time."

Love the fact that you get these cookies that are great since they have a sprinkle of salt on top which compliments the sweetness. 

The reason for my three stars is...I got food poisoning from eating here. I never got sick before but this last visit I decided to try the Tamal and it just seemed like they reheated it because the food came out exceptionally fast. The Tamal was warm but I didn&#39;t think much of it and ate it anyways since I was so hungry. About 4 hours later I&#39;m in the bathroom puking my guts out. I can&#39;t even tell you how much it sucked because of pickled onions and hot sauce. Just awful. My poor dog stayed next to my side for over an hour when I was sick. 

I would still come back to this place, just not going to eat the Tamal"

We got the Tres Pigs Nachos and it was delicious!! It was packed full of toppings, all of which merried very well together! It had beans, pico, crema, jalopenos, sriacha lime aoili, bacon, house made chorizo, and pieces of very fried and crispy pig&#39;s ear.  I am a big nachos person and can tell you these are my favorite in Denver!  We also ordered the crudo, of which came with the Mahi Mahi, since they were out of salmon.  It was a smaller portion, albeit very delicious.  The servers also kept refilling our chips and salsa.  

I discovered this through the Denver Dining Out Passport book so it was BOGO, but would definitely pay full price for the meal!"

I&#39;ve been given poor directions before by poorly trained employees, but this takes the cake.  My GPS directed me to a location that looked almost deserted-an apartment building complex that was partially complete.  There were two restaurants that looked open, and neither one was Los Chingones.  I called the number on their yelp* page and was sent on a thirty-five minute wild goose chase.  WAIT!  It gets better.  When I first started out, I told the guy that I was at the corner of Chingones and Newport.  He replied that Newport was split by the interstate and that I was on the wrong side of I-25.  Then he proceeded to give me directions for THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES THAT FINALLY BROUGHT ME BACK TO THE VERY PLACE THAT I HAD STARTED.  See, it turned out that the corner of Chingones and Newport was at the northeast corner OF THE BUILDING THAT THE GUY ON THE PHONE WAS DIRECTING ME TO.  Yes, he sent me on a large circle that began at that corner and ended at the southeast corner of the very same building.

There is NO SIGNAGE out front, just a logo on the door that is not very visible at night.

Now-it just,keeps getting better, folks-I specifically asked the Directions Expert, who over the course of the last half hour plus of my life has become one of my best friends-if my food will still be hot when I get there.  Of course, he reassures me that it will since &#34;it hasn&#39;t even come up yet&#34;.  A lie.  I take it back to my room (about 3 minutes away by the Non-Direction Expert path), only to find that not only is it stone cold, but my new BFF aka The Direction Expert, has failed to put plastic utensils in my take out order.  

Perfect!

And to think I tipped this utterly incompetent, poorly trained (but nice) guy 20% to boot because I thought he was trying.  Either training needs vast improvement or else another line of work needs to be entertained.

No mas."

This place is truly chingon!!
I could go on and on listing the ingenious taco offerings (like the incredible cauliflower taco!), but as a New Mexican foodie I have to focus on what is honestly THE BEST chile relleno I have had in the state of Colorado!  ...and I have been on a constant search for a quality CO-relleno for over 25 years! While it strays a bit (a LOT actually! ) from the traditional NM relleno, it does so in a deliciously ingenious and exciting manner. This plate can absolutely rival ANY relleno plate in even the most posh of Santa Fe eateries! 

Always the harshest critic when it comes to mediocre Mexican/ New Mexican food in Colorado (and NM for that matter), I assure you this place is as good as it gets!
No, this is not your standard cheap taco joint (thankfully)...it is miles above and SO worth the price! 
This place would kill it in Santa Fe, and that is all that needs to be said.

We sat by the window in big colorful swivel chairs, definitely the most comfortable I&#39;ve been in a restaurant. 

The complimentary chips and salsa were a nice touch. I would like to try the flight of salsa next time. I had the cojita Taco which was fantastic, a little salty because of the cheese but the corn balanced out the salt nicely. I also had the fried Anaheim relleno which was decent but it needed some spicy to it. The apple on the relleno was weird choice but easily pushed off to the side.

My husband had the Los Chingones style guac with rattlesnake chorizo, lamb neck, beef cheek and octopus tacos. The lamb neck he found under seasoned but he loved the beef cheek and octopus tacos. I&#39;ve never seen a grown man try so hard not to smile with food in his mouth when he bit into the octopus taco. He really wanted to like the rattlesnake quac but it was so intensely over salted he had to send it back. The server immediately took it away and took it off the bill. One of the managers came by shortly after to check in but he didn&#39;t make it weird or awkward. My husband and I only send food back at restaurants we genuinely like because we plan to return. 

For drinks I had the los poma-loma which tasted like a pomegranate margarita and my husband had the house margarita which he said was strong and delicious. 

They don&#39;t have a desert menu but they do bring you warm gooey complimentary cookies at the end of your meal. They were really good but personal preference I would leave off the sprinkle of salt. My only other feedback is the music was way too loud. I couldn&#39;t hear my husband over the music and the chatty woman next to us screaming to be heard by her friends. I liked the music but it was just a tad below club loud which didn&#39;t fit the atmosphere. 

Overall the restaurant is beautiful, the food and drinks are good, the service is excellent and it&#39;s right next to the light rail. Los Chingones is a fantastic edition to DTC."

Have you ever met a metrosexual yuppie that just owns it? that has no desire to be traditional, dresses in gaudy overdone fashion and wears100 dollar fedoras &#34;ironically&#34;? Who goes to clubs that came straight out of a Stefon sketch from SNL? You might not like that guy, but it least he owns who he is. Thats Los Chingones. Besides the Tequila/Mezcal selection, which is top of the line, there isnt much in the way of traditional Mexican, you gotta head north on Federal for that.

But frankly, even if its considered dumb, I enjoy LC&#39;s company. Their experiments often pay off. I enjoyed each taco I had, from the chicken, to the octopus, to the one that I think was seitan and goat cheese (couldnt understand what the waitress was saying it was loud and I was tired)."

The chicken flautas seemed like they were filled with mystery meat, which we determined was just over-processed and over-chopped chicken filling.

Several friends recommended this place so I thought I&#39;d check it out. The atmosphere has a modern vibe, so l&#39;ll give it that. Only that.

I arrived at 6:15pm only to find that HH ends at 6pm. Really? (Maybe they have a fried ice cream social at 2-4). The bar is not very big, and seating everywhere in this place is hard metal stools, which put a hurt on my derrière in T-minus 5 minutes. I sat down to a background of totally frantic bartenders who had 0 social skills. 

I sampled a draft beer that I didn&#39;t like, but ended up with it anyway because the bartender didn&#39;t listen to my alternate request. He said the chips and salsa were &#34;on the way&#34; (akin to the Fargo car dealer scene of (C&#39;mon down!) and they never showed up. I would have settled for that TruCoat.
The reviewer who said there&#39;s lots of beer on tap is so very wrong. 

The menu looked pretty good, but I was already soured with the opening experience. So I wasn&#39;t going to ruin my food with a bad mood. I asked for my check, only to find that my Barbie-sized draft beer (Ok; Ken-sized for equal time) was about $7.00. Are you kidding me??

This place is awesome! A friend told me it was a good place for a drink and good food. They hit the nail on the head. Fantastic atmosphere, super friendly staff, tasty margaritas, and eclectic Mexican food. I absolutely love this restaurant. The first time I went, I couldn&#39;t figure out what to get.  I ended up starting with a salsa flight so I could try all of them. My favorite was the tomatillo salsa, but all were really good. For my entree I picked the tamal and a red chile pork shoulder taco. The taco was a bit bland, especially for having chipotle pineapple salsa on it. It was good, but I expected more out of it. The tamal was phenomenal! This is by far my favorite dish that I have had there. Oozing with chipotle cream, this dish is full of different flavors that all come together very well. I am in love with the tamal and can&#39;t seem to get enough.  Each time I go, I try something different, but add the tamal. I still haven&#39;t been to the location downtown, but if it is half as good as the DTC location, then I will be happy."

Honestly, there&#39;s not much different at this location. There&#39;s a new raw bar menu and the happy hour lamb neck taco is different and, dare I say it, a bit less exciting. It&#39;s still a tasty taco. The only odd thing was receiving chips and salsa after my meal was over. Hey! I&#39;ll take it still"

Food was fantastic (the beef cheek tacos are a must!) and the creative cocktails/margaritas were excellent (El Jefe spin on an Old Fashioned was great).

The service and staff is what completely stood out amongst the good grub/libations. I have an avocado allergy (I know - it sucks), and I whispered this to our server. The GM came out and explained that they sterilized the prep area and cooking areas just for me and our dinner.  Are you kidding me? Who does this?  Amazing &amp; outstanding!! Thank you!"

Hostess and waitress were both nice. Wait service was a little slow at times, but good for the most part. For a Tuesday night, the place was packed! Make a reservation!

The shrimp for the appetizer are HUGE (and delicious!). I ordered the enchiladas and said I was the odd one that didn&#39;t like spicy food so she had them put the tomatillo sauce on instead of what it comes with. Still really spicy for me. Good, but would order something else next time or without sauce is that is their mildest.  I know, I&#39;m a wuss!

Everyone else seems to like their food, there were 5 of us. They all tended to like spicier food, so it was perfect for them!"

Stopped in last week and they happened to be having a VIP event. We sidled up to the bar to endure they short wait for a table. Their Skinny Marg is a fav. Once seated we enjoyed a trio of salsas, the fried Brussel sprouts (a must try) and I had a pork taco - by far my favorite - a steak and a fish (the tilapia seemed a tad under cooked). The service was a bit slow, but I attribute that to ironing out the kinks at a new location. Plus, it was probably the first night they were completely packed. Servers and staff were super friendly and they comped our brussels since they actually arrived way after our tacos. 
If you&#39;re in the mood for Mexican, a fun atmosphere &amp; friendly service definitely head to this new location!"

First of all, I have been in the service industry for a long time so I noticed the finer points of service and they were spot on. My friend went the night before we went in together (7/21/16) and loved it so much that she told me we had to go again. The hosts were incredibly friendly and sat us on the patio as per our request for happy hour. Almost as soon as we were seated our server Donelle (sp?) Greeted us. She was hilarious and kind (seriously she is amazing, request her), she was so knowledgeable about drinks and food. With a few recommendations from her we chose the rattlesnake fondido and the happy hour pig nachos. Everything was fresh and so delicious. For drinks we ordered micheladas, coin style margs, and even a cocktail of the day which was a mojito with tequila instead of rum. Everything was delicious but it was mostly the service and ambiance that will bring us back. Our empty plates and drinks were promptly removed and our server was relatable and awesome. Also big shout out to the manager Brian who was great too. This place is about to blow up and it&#39;s obvious why!"

From street tacos in the slums of Guadalajara to the hipster taco joints in LA. I&#39;ve never had such an interesting set of tacos like this place. Despite the profanity in the name, the food was awesome. Top picks for me were the octopus and the beef cheek. The mahi was good as well. Quick service, a little pricey, but worth it."

It is super tasty, good drinks, trendy ambiance! Wait staff was awesome! Tried three different tacos first time I visited. Having grown up in Mexico, I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food abroad. Now, Im not going to say this transported me back to the taco stand in my Mexican home town, but I dont think thats what they are aiming for. It is a trendy modern twist to Mexican food, and they do not disappoint!
Be adventurous and try the Wild Card taco, chef&#39;s choice that night. 
It is hidden on the first floor on an under construction apartment/condo building.
Worth it!
I will definately be going back and next time taking friends!"

I&#39;ve been here several times since its been open and last night was no different. It was completely packed but we were seated in less than the time they estimated (always a plus). Due to the amount of customers the staff was a tad overwhelmed so I was expecting to get bad service. Boy, was I wrong! Yes, the waitress took a few min to get our drink order but she apologized as soon as she came to the table. Shortly after the manager was so kind to visit our table and inform us that the guac we ordered would be on the house. Not only that, he also served us some chipotle pineapple salsa (my favorite;seasonal) and then brought us a sample of the spicy Frozen margarita! Needless to say, their customer service was great despite the amount of customers. That tells me the staff truly cares about their customers and wants each person to leave with a feeling of wanting to come back. One thing that truly draws my attention to this place is that their menu continuously evolves. They are always adding new and exciting things! You can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu; EVERY dish is fantastic!! You&#39;ll find yourself craving them after! The ambiance has a low key, casual/urban feel, which I love, and the staff have genuine personalities. When an establishment has good food and good service they truly have it going on!!! Others should take notes"

Not traditional Mexican, but an awesome atmosphere with wonderful service. Only complaint is, the table we sat in seemed very close to the diners next to us. I had the beef cheek taco, as well as the lamb neck taco to try something different. I would have to say the beef cheek taco is possibly the BEST taco I have ever had. I had a margarita to accompany my meal. I got the house margarita and asked to make it spicy. It was also amazing, but had to order my second one not spicy because of the heat...

What a fun spot! We sat outside but at the bar top and enjoyed an appetizer and couple margaritas. The nachos were quite decadent. It had a little different flavor than the original nachos; bacon, crema and a queso/cheese dip that was light. Had burger type flavors in my opinion but it was a great taste. I tried the cinnamon margarita and it was so good! Also the original margarita and both had great flavor and just the right kick! We enjoyed this spot mostly because our bartenders were absolutely spot on. They were friendly and gave us plenty of room to feel out the place and menu while still making us feel at home. I am impressed. Definitely had a bit of boulder mentality, hip and laid back but we enjoy that so it was a great experience. Can&#39;t wait to visit more since we just live 5 min away."

Best Mexican South of Denver!

Brussel Sprouts, lamb taco &amp; pork shoulder taco were wonderful.  My husband got the salmon ceviche which was amazing... The lobster taco was underwhelming &amp; no one loved the house margarita but the &#34;Poma Loma&#34; cocktail was really good &amp; the guys loved their take on an old fashioned...

A renowned chef with multiple successes including Tag downtown, does tacos.  Well unfortunately the tacos were all just okay. We tried the beef cheek, pork, Mahi mahi, chefs special  (venison-pork sausage) and none stood out. The company I was with agreed. They ordered a guacamole appetizer w/rattlesnake chorizo and they said it was very under seasoned and had to ask for salt. We tried every salsa they had and again none really impressed. The house was my favorite. The service was lacking a bit. While friendly and informative, we ran out of chips a few times, (bigger baskets please!) asked for more paper towels (they have paper towel rolls on tables) but didn&#39;t get them without asking a busser a few minutes later. All in all, not impressed. Rubios has better tacos actually. Drinks were tasty. My margarita was very good. I like the setup but the execution fell flat."

We ordered some cocktails which were pretty nice and then some guacamole and chips to nibble on. The guac was quite bland so we sent it back and swapped for the house special. Then went for sprouts, quesadilla, poma loma and a shrimp / octopus taco. The sprouts were yummy. The quesadilla tasty enough. The tacos were OK, nothing to write home about especially. The Octopus was somewhat bland but the shrimp pretty good. Seems like a fun place and as I said. A-OK. One annoying feature: I don&#39;t know why they felt the need to put big TV screens showing sports all over the place. is this a restaurant or a sports bar??

A nice portion of food at a great price! I snagged a bite of my sister&#39;s beef enchiladas before she finished them off - much more flavorful than my cheese enchiladas. The cheese enchiladas were stuffed full of cheese, just needed an extra &#34;kick&#34; of flavor because the red sauce is pretty mild.

We got chips and salsa before we got waters.  I couldn&#39;t eat any more salsa until I got water because my mouth was burning.  We waited for our waters as the server cleared other tables and served one table.

My husband ordered the Tamale Plate which came with rice and refried beans.  The refried beans were very bland.  The 2 tamales were smothered in sauce.  He prefers tamales in the corn husk.

I ordered the Tacos al Pastor.  There were 4 street tacos with double corn tortillas, so I made 8 mini tacos.  The Pico de Gallo was very hot.

We went up to the counter to pay the bill since we didn&#39;t see the server.  They lose  star today for the lack of service."

Ambiance- The restaurant is located on a corner area in a shopping strip near the Movie Tavern. It was tiny but well organized and clean. 

It was a pretty cold night, and remained so inside the restaurant the whole time we were there. Our table was sitting next to a small space heater and I still had to keep my hands in my jacket sleeves/pockets to keep warm.

Service- I would say 8/10 of the tables were occupied when we arrived, and service was a bit slow. I think they were focused on cleaning and closing duties since it was nearing the end of their night. It was easy to go up to the counter and ask for anything we needed though. 

Food- I had a combination plate with a cheese enchilada, beef burrito and chile relleno. My husband had another combo plate with the addition of a taco. 

The cheese in the enchilada was not melted at all, not even on the ends. I sent it back and the waitress said that had never happened before. I give places benefit of doubt, and understand that sometimes things go wrong in the kitchen...but I saw another review on here that said the same thing, so I figured it was worth mentioning.

The crispy relleno was not the best I have ever had, but not terrible. The green chile over the plate was about the same. 

I did not particularly care for the taste/texture of the meat in the burrito.

Price- A second basket of chips is $2.95. Watch out for that. Otherwise Taqueria Jalisco prices are about the same as other similar Mexican places in town.

I don&#39;t think we will add this to one of our favorite Mexican establishments. 

TL;DR- Clean but chilly, slow service, food was unexceptional."

I dont know how this place is not shut down with all the health code violations that you can see from the front door and the register. 
The food was way below average, and this is coming from a guy who loves the greasy spoon joints.
After being scared about how poorly the place was kept, watching the woman who worked there touch money then prepare food without gloves or washing her hands, then eating and wishing I had picked up taco bell, when i went to pay, the woman told me to wait while she added up a bunch of tickets for other orders but no one else was in there!! Just me standing there waiting like douche while she struggled with simple math!

Tonight, they utterly failed for customer service.  I know from the sign on their store that they are open every night until 9 p,m.  I was in the area a bit late and stopped by at 8:10 p.m.  I thought it was strange since the place was lit up, and there were some customers eating, but the &#34;OPEN&#34; sign was turned off.  When I went in the door, the lady at the cash register gave me a strange look.  Then she said &#34;we aren&#39;t open.&#34; I peeked back outside to door to make sure my eyes hadn&#39;t betrayed me.  I told her, the sign says you are open until 9.  Then an older lady chimed in and said; &#34;We weren&#39;t busy, and the Broncos lost, so we are closing early&#34;.  Huh?  But, I am hungry.

We hit up this place before a movie the other night (its like 2 doors down from Movie Tavern). It isn&#39;t much to look at (imagine a bowling alley style room with a tiny bar and kitchen on one side and tables on the other), but I have to say the food will bring us back for more. 

I had the Tacos Jalisco (steak, jalapeno, peppers, potatoes, fresh pico and salsa). The hubby had the enchilada platter. I loved my tacos - the meat was seasoned nicely and the pico was out of this world. Plus there was lots of food on the plate - I couldn&#39;t finish - and all for like $20 + tip.

It&#39;s one of the very few restaurants near my house, and I would have been so happy to have a good little taqueria nearby.

The first time I went, I had the green chili.  Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure that they use those pork bouillon seasoning packets in their chili, because that was all I could taste.  It was pretty bad.  Mr. Mixer had a meat plate and was decently satisfied.   

Then we went again last week.  There was something strange about the salsa.  It just tasted weird.  I had a combination plate of a cheese enchilada, a relleno, and a beef burrito.  They were cold.  So cold that the cheese inside the enchilada wasn&#39;t melted at all.  The beef in the burrito had a strange flavor.  And while I usually like soft rellenos, this one was so soft, the outside was pasty.  Not a happy camper here.  But again, Mr. Mixer liked his Tacos Al Pastor.  And he really likes the grilled jalapeno that comes with the tacos.  So that&#39;s why I gave them two stars.

Sorry, Taqueria Jaslico, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back anytime soon."

I have to say that I truly do love this place.  Usually pretty consistent on service and flavors, however getting take out usually isn&#39;t as good.  The last time I had take out was in July.  The steak in my tacos was chewy and kind of rubbery.

On the flip side, dining in is usually a treat!  The food always comes out piping hot, fresh out of the kitchen.  I&#39;ve never once gotten the feeling my food was sitting for a while before hitting my table.  The salsa is always flavorful and has a little kick to it.  Like in my previous review, most places seem to dull down their salsa so they&#39;re not spicy.  I&#39;m not saying that the salsa at Taqueria Jalisco is super spicy, it just has a nice kick to it and you really don&#39;t get that too often.  Very cool!

Last night when we stopped in, both my boyfriend and I tried different dishes.  I&#39;m pretty notorious for sticking to the Tacos El Carbon as they are freakin&#39; DELICIOUS!  I&#39;m not usually one who eats red meat either.  This is a dish I always make an exception for.  So, in an effort to try something new, last night I ordered the fish tacos.  I&#39;m a big fan of fish tacos anyway and figured it was high time I tried Taqueria Jalisoco&#39;s version of them.  All I have to say is WOW!  They were tasty!  I sometimes expect the fish in fish tacos to be a little dry, but no, no, no... not this time.  Just juicy, melt in your mouth little nuggets of fishies in a corn tortilla with avocado, pico de gallo and cabbage.  Also, just like the Tacos El Carbon, they&#39;re super messy.  I think I&#39;m going to have to start referring to the tacos here as &#34;Napkin Destroyers&#34; because I always have to ask for extra napkins.  Between the lime juice, the juicy meat and the drippings from the pico de gallo, it just gets everywhere... all over your face, all over your hands and even has dripped down my arm before.  Never has something so messy tasted so good!  The fish tacos also came with rice and beans.  The rice was good, but the beans were very bland.  I was kind of surprised!

I also had an 1800 margarita last night.  Just as I expected, well mixed, tasted good and was a very enjoyable compliment to the meal.  My water glass also never went empty, which is always a wonderful thing as I LOVE water!  It&#39;s such a fantastic thing knowing that my favorite drink on anyone&#39;s menu is always free.

Taqueria Jalisco, I love you!"

I grew up in Indiana where we have amazing Mexican restaurants AND they use the crumbly white cheese! 

On a different note, Taqueria Jalisco is a diamond in the rough! This restaurant is a locally-owned establishment in an unassuming strip mall next to The Movie Tavern and Royal Hilltop. It is always busy! It&#39;s our pre-race ritual to eat here now (the night before triathlons). It&#39;s reasonably priced, consistent, and the food is well prepared. I always order the Tacos Al Carbon. The dish consists of 4 steak tacos (on corn tortillas) with onions, avocado, and cilantro. I wish I knew how they prepared the steak. It melts in your mouth. The flavors mingle and have a little party. We had their guacamole for the first time tonight and thought it was pretty darn good too. We&#39;ve had their tamales - also delicious. 

Another great thing about Taqueria Jalisco is the coupons. We get them regularly through the mail. We saved $5 on our total bill tonight (almost 25%). When we want Mexican and want to stay close to home, we almost always go here. Great service too. They definitely take care of you."

It is a notch above Taco Bell but not that flavorful.  The portions were perfect size, unlike some places that want to bury you in food.  The service was fast and friendly.

Hubby ordered a chicharrone burrito and 2 chili rellenos, crispy. That burrito was HUGE! It was filled with beans and chicharrones. His only complaint was that the chicharrone were too salty. I tried them and I agree.

Oh...and there was a LOT of takeout going out the door, so I&#39;d say they do a fair amount of takeout business!

Based on a previous Yelpers suggestion, I ordered the Tacos Al Carbon. DUDE!!! Can you say &#34;Party in my mouth?&#34; Those were, hands down, the best tacos I&#39;ve ever had! Look, when we go out for Mexican I&#39;m usually &#34;combo plate girl&#34;. Now that I Yelp, I&#39;m trying to expand my horizons! I am SO glad I did!!!

The service was understandibly a bit slow because they were so busy, but everyone was very attentive and they were running their butts off!

That said....this place is the first bad Mexican food I&#39;ve had in a very long time.  And believe me, it&#39;s less than a mile from my house so I really wanted to like it.

When I arrived, I checked-in on Yelp and commented enthusiastically about the Modelo Especial, then I ordered a crispy chile rellano and a smothered beef burrito.  There was nothing good to say from that point on.  
I am giving it two stars for the beer and the chance that I may come back to hang on the patio and give it another go.  After all, many fellow yelpers have rated this place well, and you guys rarely steer me wrong.  If I enjoy it the next time around, I promise to update my rating."

Tasted like 100% boxed, canned and nothing I could not make at home by going to the mexican isle at Safeway. We had Enchiladas, boring! Has tacos, pre fried very very thin tortillas with HAMBURGER that tasted like it had taco seasoning mix, and a tostada that was no better than Taco Bell. Now don&#39;t get me wrong Taco Bell has its place, but not in what is supposed to be a REAL Mexican grill. Ohhh yeah Margaritas that were poured out of a pre mixed bottle~~~ Seriously terrible. Hispanic cooks where is the pride?? I am from San Diego where our Hispanic community takes so much pride in what they serve, seems unless you go to Federal finding good Mexican food is very very hard to find. BUMMER"

It gets really busy on the weekends and the restaurant is very small inside. Not good for a large group at all. Once the food was great, spicy and flavorful. The other two times it was just ok. Kind of bland and the salsa tastes different each time we go. It varies from really really spicy to bland, needing some lime and heat."

I think the prices were ok... the food tasted good, however, both time i have gone the portions were very small.  This i why i have not rated this place higher. The portions were very small and left me hungry.

I had the #7 combo.  The chili relleno was very crispy and had a good taste, while the chicken enchillada tasted pretty good.  The taco was unimpressive and the Guacamole Toastada was decent.  Nothing really impressive in my book and as I said before, not fulfulling.

Honestly, although the food tasted pretty good, for the money, I will go to Taco Bell across the street for my &#34;Mexican&#34; food fix when super lazy, or go to Hacienda Colorado when i really want a great meal."

Carne Asada - The carne asada was extremely tender and delicious.  It came with three flour tortillas on the side which arrived at the table too hot to even handle.  The carne asada was served with rice, a lot of refried beans, lettuce, and guacamole.  The plate was a little too small to effectively slice up the asada and assemble tortillas filled with fixings.  The single napkin was also insufficient for the mess created by the meal.  
Flautas with chicken - This dish was not as big of a hit as the carne asada.  My wife complained about the flautas being fried too long and the chicken not being terribly flavorful.  She may order beef on our next visit.  

1/22/2011
Tacos al carbon - I had some misgivings about ordering this dish because I generally don&#39;t like corn tortillas.  I decided I had to try it based on all the positive reviews.  The Tacos el Carbon did not disappoint, and Taquiera Jalisco&#39;s corn tortillas were far better than the ones I&#39;m accustomed to getting from Wal-Mart or King Soopers.  It was four double corn tortillas and a spicy steak mix with onions and avocado slices.  The steak was delicious and overall it had a nice amount of spiciness to it.  I would say that the carne asada I ordered on my first trip was better because of the inclusion of guacamole, beans, and flour tortillas.
Tacos Jalisco -  My wife decided to order the tacos Jalisco after being disappointed with the chicken on our first trip.  The inclusion of potatoes in the ingredient list also provided a compelling reason.  She was blown away by the heat from this dish.  She tried my al carbon tacos and said that she preferred the flavor of the Jalisco despite the additional heat.
House Margaritas  $3.95 The margarita was nothing outstanding.  It reminded me of some $5 per bottle mix and some pretty cheap tequila.  I think this would be more appropriately priced at $2.95.  The margarita did provide relief when the spice from our tacos kicked in. 

1/29/2011
Fish tacos - I was expecting a heavily battered fish, but was surprised to find this version to be only lightly battered.  The fish was tasty, and was accompanied by corn tortillas, pico, avocado slices, refried beans, and rice.  For some reason this dish was moister than the things I had ordered previously at Taqueria Jalisco.  The corn tortillas did not hold up well to the additional wetness.  It was hard to eat them with my hands.  I ended up using a fork.  
Fajita Steak Burrito  - My wife ordered the fajita steak burrito.  The steak in this dish was not nearly as tender as the beef in the tacos Jalisco, tacos al carbon, or the carne asada.  There was too much steak, and it was too tough to cut with a fork.  She barely ate any of her dish.  I don&#39;t think she likes TJ very much after her third meal there.

2/12/2011
Carne asada - On my final trip before publishing my review I decided to revisit the Carne Asada.  I was tempted by quite a few other things on the menu that I do actually want to try.  Something with their green chili would be likely be delicious.  The Mexican Hamburger seemed tempting.   I also thought that I should perhaps I should try the chili rellenos, but after noticing I could order a single one of those from the ala carte menu I decided to do that.
Tacos Jalisco - My wife ordered her favorite from our first three trips, the tacos Jalisco.  She removed most of the jalapenos and found the reduced level of heat to be more tolerable and enjoyable.  I suggested she order it without jalapenos altogether.  She thinks that the jalapenos in the cooking process add vital heat to the other ingredients in the dish.
We both enjoyed the crispy chili relleno.  I am glad I only ate half of one because I think a full order of it would be a bit much."

I had the brassica salad and duck breast with pumpkin risotto. My husband had the chicken with cauliflower au gratin. Everything was cooked to perfection. Service was outstanding. The only hiccup came with our desert. It took a while, but when the waiter realized it he comped it to us. I thought that was a wonderful gesture. The manager came by to apologize too. It would not have not been an issue at all except we had to get to a show, and knew the time was getting close. Those things happen and I think they responded more than appropriately. 

My husband and I eat out at various &#34;nice&#34; places one or two times a month. Places that are rated very highly. So far, I can say this has been my favorite place this year and probably one of my favorite since moving to Colorado. We will definitely be back."

My friend ordered the scallops in a cheese frittata sauce with  French Toast/wannabe for $26. ( keep in mind these are lunch prices) 
They had a lamb burger but no cheeseburger; so I opted for the chicken sandwich.( $14) Enough with the radicchio &amp; arugula &amp; mixed greens &amp; bitter greens. NOT TASTY! I asked if the chicken sandwich came with coleslaw or fries. NO, a mixed green bitter salad. Welcome to Denver! The service was contemptuous and spotty. I also asked for extra mayo &amp; extra Ranch dressing &amp; was all but laughed at. They gave me a ramekin of aioli......eh.

The restaurant was at 30% capacity and seemed adequately staffed. After we were seated it took over 10 minutes to greet us and get us water. We ordered coffee and cocktails to start, with the coffee coming a few minutes later. After 20 minutes I had to inquire about our drinks. Five more minutes passed before they were delivered. There were unfortunately bugs in my dates cocktail so it had to be returned. It took another 10 minutes to replace it. 
Brunch finally arrived after 45 minutes. Thankfully the preparation of the dishes brought the meal back up to a 3-star. The chicken confit with latkes was exceptional as was the omelette du jour. We finished with phenomenal beignets and one of my favorite Madeiras. Still a mixed bag experience for me."

They have a few options for bread and the person circulated the room. You also have the option of still and sparking water. The server had to make a fresh batch of iced tea for me since they don&#39;t usually serve iced tea at dinner apparently lol. 

I would skip the lobster bisque if I did it again, go for a half order of their pastas. All were very delicious. The picnic plate was very tasty. 

The duck with the pumpkin risotto was beyond 5 stars. It was the essence of autumn on a plate. The steak was also good but the duck stole the show. The lamb was also top notch. 

The dessert that was my personal favorite was the unique black and white cheesecake. The black sesame ice cream was amazing the whole dessert was well balanced and memorable. The sampler of ice cream was a table favorite. The variations of chocolates were underwhelming. The strawberry coconut was not well balanced, very tart."

The place is pretty intimate and always seems to have all the tables taken. To start we had their pork belly app. It was super tender and reminded us of split pea soup due to the sauce on top. For the entree I ordered the artichoke tortellini. Very delicate with a hint of lemon. My boyfriend had their duck which came with a pumpkin risotto in an actual pumpkin and gooseberries. It was honestly one of the prettiest plated dishes I&#39;ve ever seen, very autumn themed. He loved his duck and thought the gooseberries were an awesome touch. To end we had the black and white cheesecake dish. This was the only thing we were not the biggest fans of."

Yelp led us to this place so we paid a visit. Note: Rioja dinner is NOT tapas style!They offer 5-6 appetizers, pastas, and main courses-- some can be ordered in half or full. So if you&#39;re looking for a chilled night with 3-hr-long 9-10 tapas over drinks, this is not exactly the place. 

Having that said, the food itself is quite good. Here are what we ordered:
 
Artichoke tortellini --get it. It&#39;s as good as other reviews said. The half order came in 3 pieces. The shell pasta is thin but held the stuffing together really well even when cut into 2 slices. The stuffing was creamy and aromatic - earthy, truffle, delectable, the braise/ sauce that comes with is light but flavorful

Fresh bacon-- IMHO pork belly can do no wrong. In this situation, the pork belly was braised and tender. It was good, but not off the park scrumptious. The puree sauce that the pork belly swims in is the true star of this dish. I didn&#39;t have a chance to ask what was in it but suffice to say it paired excellent with the pork belly! 

Sturgeon -- served over the fresh made buckwheat pasta. The flavor was light, zesty and multidimensional. I&#39;m not a big fan of well-done fish which was how the dish was served but if that&#39;s your thing then I would recommend this dish for a light dinner. Paired well with a glass of Albariño

We also ordered house sangria -- pretty standard 

Ended the meal with a scoop of Coconut Sorbet which was delectable. Highly recommend it!! 

Service &amp; Staff-- very knowledgeable staff and highly trained to be so hospitable. I really appreciated their high standard or service. They made sure that the patrons feel well-cared for: leading you to the restroom instead of just pointing, stopping to let the patron pass first, always smiling, etc. Another knock-out!"
rioja-denver,Stacey K.,F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A,"Irvine, CA",1,1,0,1297,40,vOOqP9Q1-dVucrt-9tWT_w,5.0,2016-06-10,"WOW, to the Amazing ARTICHOKE TORTELLONI - This is a must.

The artichoke inside the fresh, homemade pasta was turned into an oh-so-flavorful mousse.  Maybe it helped that it&#39;s artichoke season, but man, I&#39;ve never had anything like it.  The artichoke mousse was smooth, creamy, and very artichoke-y.  I don&#39;t think it would have been the same if the artichoke were kept in chopped up pieces.  This is served in a white truffle &#39;brodo&#39; (broth), which paired perfectly without overpowering the flavor of the artichoke. Bravo!

The BRAISED PORK CHEEKS were another highlight of the meal.  Fork tender, juicy, and nice thick pieces of cheeks!  Pork cheeks are already rich and moist, so imagine when this is slowly braised to perfection.  Served alongside ravioli, stuffed with even more pork cheek, with a light, creamy &#39;soubise&#39; sauce.  All topped with morel mushrooms, asparagus, whipped parmesan, and dill. 

I tried some of the FINES HERBES GNOCCHI too, and this was one of the best gnocchis I&#39;ve had.  I typically expect a heavy, chewy, piece of dough when think of gnocchi, but this was super light and airy, yet still had that chewy texture.  MAGIC!  I&#39;d order gnocchi more if all gnocchis were made like this.  This was served with butter poached lobster, saffron-fennel compote, asparagus, and lobster nage.  I would order this as my main course next time. 

I got all caught up with the main courses-- but the appetizers here are delightful as well!

The FRESH BACON here is amazing.  Slow cooked, thick piece of pork belly, seasoned with cardamom, and curried garbanzo bean puree.  If you love bacon, I would suggest ordering your own.  That top layer of the bacon is perfectly seasoned and has that perfect crispy-crunch!  Then you get that buttery, tender, pork belly meat.  The garbanzo bean puree matched perfectly with the richness of the bacon.  And I&#39;m glad the curry flavor didn&#39;t overpower the puree (or the bacon).

The RABBIT FLATBREAD is also very tasty.  Makes me a little sad every time I think about eating a rabbit, but a little wine helps drown away the sorrow.  The flatbread was balanced perfectly-- just enough toppings, the bread was cooked perfectly (I hate when it&#39;s soggy or burnt), and the rabbit sausage was so tender.  Topped with rabbit sausage, english pea-ramp puree, fava beans, lemon riccota, mozzarella, and pea shoots. This was a nice, healthy-ish appetizer.  This chef seems to love bean-based purees, haha. 

The RIOJA &#39;PICNIC&#39; is a nice charcuterie plate to share if you&#39;ll be sipping on some wine with your meal.  A nice variety of artisan meats, pine nut crusted goat cheese, gorgonzola, olives, fennel salad, orange confit, and almonds.  The gorgonzola was super pungent, it almost seemed like bleu cheese.  I&#39;m not a big fan of bleu, so if you are, you&#39;re in for a stinky treat!

For Dessert, the VARIATIONS OF CHOCOLATE was my favorite.  A trio of dark chocolate mousse, milk chocolate mousse, giaduja mousse, hand painted with white chocolate, chocolate miroir, and candied hazelnuts.  Each chocolate mousse had it&#39;s own flavor, and the chocolates were so light that I could eat 2 orders.  &#34;Guilt-free&#34; I guess, haha. 

For wines, we ordered two bottles:  

- 2012 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano: Italian red wine, rich and fruity, woodsy
- 2011 Sassetti Livio: Italian red wine, fruity (lemon-y, cherry), with some spice

Overall, I had a wonderful dining experience and would definitely return for several menu items!  Cheers!"

I did tip off the restaurant that our lunch would be in celebration. We were greeted warmly with glasses of champagne and a congratulatory note signed by the staff. We sat in a intimate, cozy corner table with a green suede bench. Friday lunch was not too busy, was great to not feel packed in or rushed.

From the menu we chose the French bistro salad, the lobster and sweet potato bisque, the artichoke tortellini, the chicken sandwich, and the barramundi special. I was particularly in love with the artichoke tortellini, so plump and served the right way in a flavorful broth. We finished off the lunch with the &#34;variations of chocolate&#34; dessert-so rich and delicious! 

The service was excellent and friendly. The staff even took the time to split our salad, bisque and tortellini into two separately-plated portions, which was a nice touch.

Had gone here for a friends treat and had made a reservation for 9pm. We were seated promptly. We started off with a bottle of a Tuscany red which was excellent. To start off, you get a selection of freshly baked bread that changes daily I guess. We had a jalapeno-pepper based foccacia which was amazing as well as a delicious goat cheese flavored bread. Spread butter over it and sprinkle some pink salt and you won&#39;t regret it.

For starters we got the rabbit flatbread, the rioja picnic, garlic and potato soup, octopus farfalle, and the hamachi crudo. Everything was great and the umachi was a wonderful blend of flavors and textures, and was the star of the first round. 

For mains, we got the Georges Bank scallops, the veg 4 squares and the Colorado lamb loin. The scallops were out of this world delicious, succulent, perfectly cooked and went superbly with the pepper jam and the saffron vinagerette. I&#39;ve not had such good scallop in a long time. It also came with a flaky spinakopita filled with eggplant which was delicious and paired well with the scallops.

For dessert we ordered the variations of chocolate and the handmade ice cream (pistachio, key lime and strawberry and coconut). The chocolate was great though I felt the white chocolate was a bit too sweet, a little lesser and it would have been great.

Overall, great ambience, excellent service and delicious food. A must try for a date or for any other celebration."

In terms of food, everything was delicious. I highly recommend the bacon (it&#39;s actually pork belly, I think) and the artichoke torelloni We also really enjoyed the sesame dessert.

First off, the wait staff and support staff are woefully unprepared to answer basic questions regarding the possibility of allergens and cross-contamination. 

Know that Rioja uses peanut oil as their main cooking oil; That tree nuts are used in many of their dishes and throughout the kitchen. And if one has a dairy allergy, most of their sauces are dairy based as are their desserts.

All these questions were asked when making reservations. The blithe assurances given by the person taking our reservations belie the facts.

Too bad for us but for those of you who have food allergies, now you know."

We ordered the fresh bacon appetizer (delicious texture and flavor!). Then the Vegetarian 4 squares (Beet marshmallows were a fluffy highlight ), the Octopus Farfalle (great blend of textures from octopus and heat from peppers), Honey Bourbon Braised Lamb Shank (deep flavors), and Snake River Sturgeon (fish was crispy outside &amp; silky inside. Buckwheat pasta could&#39;ve been cooked slightly longer to be more tender). THEN we heard there were dinner specials, Foie Gras and Artichoke Tortelloni. Both are amazing, really silky textures and harmony on plates. Finally ended the meal with an Apple Pie with caramel sauce.

If they worried about their service as much as their food, they would be the best. 

The food was magnificent. My husband and I started with their corn and poblano soup. It was very flavorful and rich. We then had the risotto, tortellini,  and scallops. Their sangria is delicious, highly recommend! The risotto was my favorite. It was creamy, savory, and very filling. 

The big problem was our server and the hosts. I made these reservations weeks in advance because it was a birthday and we planned the trip ahead of time. I even called 4 hours before our seating so that the hosts could make a note that it was my husband&#39;s birthday and bring out a birthday dessert. When we got to Rioja, we had to wait for a table even though we had a reservation. Then the server, a middle-aged american woman (do not remember her name), barely paid any attention to us. She was busy, all over the place, and barely spoke to us. She rushed through everything and in the end didn&#39;t even remember the birthday dessert. When I reminded her of it, she brought a single candle on a plate. It was so pathetic. I felt like it was a self-serve fast food restaurant. The quality of the service and food do not match up. 

Maybe it was an off night but we were really disappointed. The reviews were so great and we really looked forward to dining here. It wasn&#39;t even a weekend night so I don&#39;t understand the lack of service. Rioja - train your servers to pay attention to every guest please."

Made a reservation on Open Table for 2, 2 days in advance and was able to get a 7pm time slot.  When we arrived, we were seated immediately.

We were given drink menus first, then water, then eventually food menus.  It feels like there&#39;s a definite order to the service that encourages ordering a drink before knowing what you might have for a meal- and that&#39;s my one and only mild issue.  If you have four people and can agree on one wine, getting a bottle is a great option for the table.

Service is very attentive without being pushy.  Constant water refills happening without needing to ask, fresh bread baskets roaming at all times to fill an empty plate when requested  

We asked about the tasting menus and there were two options, a Five Course, and a Seven Course.  When initially mentioning that I wanted the Seven course, but my dining partner did not, it was mentioned that the tasting course would need to have participation of everyone at the table.  Some restaurants hold very tightly to this and won&#39;t allow you to waiver for food preparation reasons.  However, when asked if my dining partner could do the 5 course ($65) while I did the 7 course ($85), the server returned from the kitchen to let us know that the chef was in a good mood and willing to accommodate the request, which was ideal since the seafood parts of the 7 course were not of interest to my dining partner.

The tasting menu portions are actually quite large for a tasting menu experience.  They all felt like full sides or appetizer portions, even a full plate portion for some of them, rather than smaller tasting portions.  The space between plates was about 3-8 minutes, so we didn&#39;t feel rushed onto the next dish too quickly, and if we started to crave another course, a bread basket was there to satiate any extended in-between moments - though, in retrospect, it was probably partaking of the break that made it difficult to finish the last two courses- so keep that in mind.

Everything was wonderful, flavorful, and nicely prepared.  

During our meal, we were asked to move to another table in order to accommodate a large group, and we were offered additional desserts or courses in exchange for the table switch.  I declined the additional courses as we were already stuffed by the 4th course, and so our first round of drinks was taken off of the bill instead.  At another restaurant, this may have caused a stir and been inconsiderate, but it was all handled kindly, nicely, and we had the opportunity to decline the offer if it didn&#39;t suit us.

If you plan to have an appetizer, entree, and dessert- see if one of the tasting menus will suit your tastes- it&#39;s a fabulous deal and a great way to try more of the menu!   I tried to photo each dish so you could see what the tasting menus look like in food servings...."

There were three types of meats, olives, blue cheese cube, and a few other items. For dinner I had the gnocchi without meat. It comes with pork, but I had a vegetarian version. I don&#39;t eat pork, but the gnocchi was incredible. I really liked the gnocchi. There were small potato balls (gnocchi), and the sauce was delicious. It is a small plate and was filling for me, however, if you need larger portions this is not the dish for you. My friend had the Petaluma Chicken. This is the perfect size for a big eater! It was half of a chicken. And it was delicious!! I loved it!! For dessert I had the beignets and my friend had the PB &amp; J. Both were really good. The Sangria was okay. Not recommended."

I would spend your money elsewhere, especially in the Larimer Square area because they have a lot of options in that area that are much better. The service wasn&#39;t all that great either. Go somewhere else!"

A birthday dinner finally brought us into Rioja and I&#39;m so stoked to un-bookmark it from my list of &#34;to try&#34; places and cement it as a new fave. 

Okay, that&#39;s a lot of hype, but yes - it was/is that good. We arrived on time for our reservation and the hostess was even able to fanangle a six top for us since we had the car seat along for the little one. I&#39;m already impressed. 

We were greeted right away, water was served, waiter introduced himself, made drink recommendations, fielded our cocktail questions, and took drink orders. All of his recommendations were on point and didn&#39;t disappoint in what we were looking for. 

After some arm bending, we were able to get an appetizer that is only on their brunch menu and OMG. I don&#39;t want to say too much about that because I want to be able to try and get it next time too. Sorry, Yelpers. That&#39;s my little secret. 

Anyway, we placed a few additional appetizer orders - corn &amp; poblano soup, artichoke tortellini, and both were outstanding. Even the bread basket was incredibad. Goat cheese biscuit? Oh so heavenly. Lavender sourdough? Yum yum in my tum tum.

Finally moving on to entrées, we had the ribeye, seabass, lamb, and scallops. I don&#39;t think there was an ounce of anything left of any plate. Scallops were on point in a big way. Ribeye rivaled Elway&#39;s, lamb was oh so good, and seabass was yummy too!

Now, we aren&#39;t still hungry at this point, but when it&#39;s a birthday and they have ice wine on the menu - you go for a glass and get the strawberry coconut dessert. 

Oh my. I&#39;m still in food coma heaven. And the mint leaves with the check! Eat them all. Don&#39;t share!"

Made a last minute OpenTable reservation, which worked out really well. I was surprised that for such a popular and highly-touted restaurant, there were empty tables at 7:30pm. I guess, to be fair, the Broncos had just beaten the Steelers and people were likely at bars or at the game. Oh well, it worked out for us. Started by Jennifer Jasinski, a James Beard Foundation award winner, Rioja has a Mediterranean-inspired menu, which all was very creative and delicious-sounding. The restaurant is located in Larimer Square, near the 16th Street Mall, so perhaps you can stop by the bar after doing a bit of shopping.

As we got seated, I was incredibly clumsy and spilled a good amount of water on the tablecloth, but a member of the waitstaff came in like a ninja and replaced the tablecloth incredibly quickly. I was very impressed with the speed (and obviously embarrassed about my party foul). This guy was so fast that after he finished replacing the tablecloth, he came around with the huge bread basket, which had some different flavor profiles and textures: sourdough, rosemary, and caramelized onion. The bread was served a little cold, but the seasonings were great, and we would have asked for more, but we didn&#39;t want to fill up because the menu sounded so great.

As we ordered, we decided to go with a ton of different small plates to start, including the fresh bacon (pork belly with cardamom and curried chickpea puree), saffron linguine with Italian lamb sausage, and the Brassica salad (Brussels sprouts, shaved cauliflower, radicchio, and hazelnut vinaigrette). Holy moly, everything was great, but that saffron linguine was fresh, delicious, chewy, and to top it all off, came with a 63° egg, which just made the texture super rich and delicious. As for the entrees, we got the New Zealand venison, and the Liberty Farms duck breast. Both were excellent, and expertly presented with all the fixings like butternut squash, risotto, and huckleberries. The venison was likely my favorite, as it was a very flavorful cut, and cooked to a perfect medium rare.

The dessert though. I&#39;ve mentioned I don&#39;t really have a sweet tooth, but I do like a good chocolate dessert if it&#39;s available. We got the &#34;variations of chocolate&#34; dessert, which was hazelnut mousse, milk chocolate mousse, dark chocolate mousse, and painted white chocolate pieces, arranged sort of like a napoleon. It was all accompanied with chocolate ganache, candied hazelnuts and edible gold. You would think it might be a chocolate overload, but I really enjoyed it. So rich, so delicious, with my favorite being the dark chocolate mousse. Goodness, I would come back merely for that dessert, easily.

Service, as mentioned before, was fantastic. The waitstaff had great recommendations, were incredibly friendly, and very attentive. As for the prices, they&#39;re easily more expensive than most restaurants in Denver, but I can easily say it&#39;s worth it. You&#39;ll get a quality fine dining experience in a casual, yet trendy atmosphere. 

There is a reason there are 1300+ reviews, mostly all glowing and positive. Many touted this place as the best restaurant in Denver, and while my repertoire of Denver restaurants is pretty limited, I have a hard time believing otherwise. This should easily be your first stop in Denver, if you&#39;re looking for some outstanding food."

This restaurant is situated in the cutest part of town, lots of other restaurants, shopping and comedy clubs on the same block. 

My meal started with the French onion soup with gruyere chips on top of the ravioli. It was super good, but after trying the butternut squash soup that my sister ordered, that was way better!!!! I would order that next time.

We split the special flatbread, which was sausage and mozzarella. Wow! Wow! Wow!

For my dinner, I had the Petulma Chicken dish with cauliflower cheese bake and a salad on the side. The chicken is enormous! Way more than enough, as it was a half chicken. Juicy and delicious!!

The service and ambiance are perfect for date night, girls night.

Make a reservation and enjoy!"

I have nothing but good to say about the service. 

My vegetarian 4 square sampler was not good or creative or even interesting.  The artichoke tortilloni was superb. 

We sat outside on a hot night.  Inside was noisy and cool.  Outside was quiet and hot but we kept getting gusts of cool air from inside so that made it nice. 

Somewhat pricey, but worth it. Make a reservation if possible."

For the tourists out there: my boyfriend and I managed to get two seats at the bar at ~8pm having not been able to make a reservation even a week in advance due to the popularity of the restaurant. We were very fortunate to have secured even the bar seats - a quick glance at the restaurant decor (ambiance is at 90-95 percentile of all restaurants I&#39;ve been to) and menu made it clear that we had just walked into one of Denver&#39;s top restaurants.

The menu selection was good, though I&#39;d have to admit there wasn&#39;t much variety when it came to the dinner items. I recall seeing about ~10 entree choices and 3 pastas, though all were very reasonably priced ($25-40) for a restaurant of this caliber. Relative to normal restaurants I&#39;d say the food selection is superb, but if you were to pit Rioja against other fine dining restaurants, I&#39;d say the food is in the 50% percentile. Relative to Denver restaurants might be a different story.

To get into the bread: this is the most amazing bread selection I&#39;ve come across, even compared to the very few 2 or 3 Michelin starred restaurants that I&#39;ve been to. They prepare four types of breads: a lavender sourdough, a biscuit, a whole wheat roll with candied objects inside, and another one that I can&#39;t remember. The bread basket comes around 2-3 times and you can get as many pieces as you want. This bread was so amazing that I raved all night about how amazing the restaurant was, and I almost wanted to ask if there was a bread takeout option. The waiter was also extremely patient and encouraging that diners pick as many pieces as they want. I seriously can&#39;t explain how good the bread is - but for this reason alone this restaurant makes it in the top 5 of all restaurants I&#39;ve ever been to.

Would definitely come back again provided they don&#39;t remove the bread."

It was like a restaurant that thinks it is actually better than it is. And on top of that.. Our waitress was god awful!!! Its like if you position yourself to be a top notch restaurant you have to have well trained servers.... Right?? 

We ordered a few salads and potato soup as starters. The salads were really uninspired and lackluster and really only the soup was good.. But the fact that the soup was the only thing I liked was tragic and at the same time I felt like that soup is something I could get any time.

On to the pastas..we ordered their &#34;award winning&#34; truffle pasta and the octopus pasta. We didn&#39;t even finish the truffle pasta dish because it was overcooked. I mean it&#39;s pasta!!! Hello people if you are going to charge the price you do at least make sure you cook the pasta el dente. Yikes!

The steak in the omelette was super fatty and the potato served with it was super oily, over cooked on the outside and under cooked on the inside.

I love the set up as you walk in. They seem to have used every corner and made it a nook for diners to enjoy their deliciously and artfully prepared meal. 

We made a reservation for brunch yesterday and was really impressed with everything. The staff were awesome. The food was presented so well and oh so tasty. 

We started with Eric&#39;s House made donuts $6. They came in two pieces and was loaded inside with this wonderful Lemon Curd Mascarpone and some Blueberry on the side that you can either add or skip. I skipped. The way it came was enough for me. It was warm. Bite into it and the filling would ooze out and it may be messy for you too like it was for me but it was so good without being too sweet. I will definitely go for this again,

I had the omelette of the day. It was the first time ever I had an omelette without meat that I actually enjoyed. The grilled taste of Brussels sprouts was so earthy that it made me forget about my meat. So that was a revelation :) it came with a side of fruits. 

When you dine at Rioja remember to look around and appreciate their nod to its namesake the small town of Rioja in Spain that&#39;s famous for the Rioja DOCA Wines. One side of the wall is all bricks. The space is cozy without being too claustrophobic. White linen tables. Professional staff. 

A tip worth listening to: Try their Caf 43. It&#39;s an espresso liqueur 43, coconut milk, whipped cream, chocolate tuile. $12. It&#39;s a tall glass of perfection."

All dishes were top notch, especially the bacon appetizer, tortellini appetizer, scallops entree and the skirt steak entree.

We also had the duck breast with pumpkin risotto which was presented beautifully as the risotto was situated in a mini pumpkin on the plate.

The only downside to the meal was the delay between appetizers and entrees but the restaurant made up for by offering us two complimentary desserts. We got the chocolate mousse and beignets, both were excellent.

Highly acclaimed amongst local dining circles, no doubt in part to the James Beargoat d Award bestowed upon Chef Jennifer Jasinski in 2013 as Best Chef Southwest, it was on the recommendation of several including those at Work &amp; Class as well as Racca&#39;s Pizzeria that a reservation was made at Rioja, the painful parking situation and passive service admittedly unexpected while the food itself was every bit as good as the rumors suggest.

Located in upscale Larimer Square, several national chains blending with local restaurants and bars, Rioja is best described as Seasonal Mediterranean in approach and with tasteful decorating, a bar made for mingling plus two rooms adjoined by a central walkway the flow of the space feels brisk while gentle lighting leaves wooden surfaces looking sexy and sleek.

Offering much of the dinner menu at lunch, a similar situation witnessed several days later at Euclid Hall, diners are encouraged to listen to several specials before finalizing their order, the daily venison burger admittedly quite tempting though personal interests tilted more to small plates, others around me seemingly holding the &#34;Chronic&#34; Chicken Sandwich in high regard.

No doubt a place where suits are prominent, &#34;regulars&#34; greeted by waiters by name with amuses served selectively by the kitchen in a fairly obvious and discriminatory way, bread service features several housemade options the with a tiny cheese biscuit and roll of ginger and pine nuts both particularly memorable, though obtaining a second helping was rivaled only by water refills in terms of difficulty to obtain.

Deciding to dine in three courses, a half-dozen items served with pacing that was thankfully dictated by return of previous plates to the back, round one consisted of an elegant beet salad tinged in mocha with fruit and cheese balancing earth tones while a non-traditional take on French Onion Soup used ravioli in a clean consomee to replicate the classic in terms of flavor, though certainly not in texture.

As proud of their technique as they are of sourcing -  noodles, sauces and sausages all made on site, half-orders of pasta are a welcome conceit to those of smaller appetites and happy to take full advantage in terms of creating a tasting one would be hard pressed to decide between tender gnocchi dressed in grapes, blue cheese and walnuts or the roll of braised Lamb Belly Sausage atop makeshift &#34;Cassoulet&#34; consisting of Pickled Red Onion, Brioche Crumbles, Celery and Carrot.

Known as a place for desserts, longtime pastry chef Eric Dale&#39;s seasonal variations often amongst the most visually appealing in The Mile High City, &#34;special&#34; tables seem likely to end meals with complimentary Goat Cheese and Fig Beignets that were ordered and found to be pleasant though not &#34;amazing&#34; while the server-recommended &#34;Pistachio and Pears&#34; more than made up for any disappointment, the $10 plate a mix n&#39; match thrill ride with Pistachio Cake and Mousse each replicating the nut&#39;s flavor perfectly alongside Marsala Poached Pears with light licorice notes well matched to Vanilla Anglaise and Fennel Pollen."

We had a nice bottle of wine.  The bread was deliciously tender inside upon breaking into the crisp crust.  We started with pork belly bathed in a delicious, somewhat tangy green sauce.  My husband had the deer.  We grew up in Wyoming; we&#39;ve had our fair share of deer (which I don&#39;t really like).  He loved it.  I had a bite and thought it was actually tender and not as gamey as the Wyoming deer I&#39;ve had.  I had the halibut special.  The fish was seared nicely and had a delicious wine sauce.  We then ended with dessert, variations of chocolate.  The plating was all quite creative, but the end result, delicious.

We had reservations for 7:45 and weren&#39;t seated until almost 8:30. We didn&#39;t leave until 11- not really by choice but because service was a bit on the slow side.

Bang for your buck is reasonable here - we had a nice bottle of Spanish wine, did appetizers, first courses, entrees, dessert and dessert wine for a pretty reasonable amount.

Areas for improvement include: 

Timing - from being seated on time to readiness in ordering to food delivery. This just seemed way off - we were ready to order for quite sometime and it took awhile to get our order in.

Cuisine - while it was good, it did not blow me away. The hot pocket thing that came with my scallops reminded me of a hot pocket. It was over salted and no flavors really jumped out. There were also only three medium sized scallops on the dish, these were not the giant diver size, and because of this we could have used a fourth.

There was a lot of bread offered - A LOT. I&#39;m sure some people love this.

Overall it was a fine meal but nothing blew me away. We would try it again sometime, maybe during the summer months to see the menu changes."

There&#39;s only one other place I&#39;ve had scallops as good (Bouchon in LA). The pork belly was also fantastic, I love the curry/garbanzo bean purée. The lamb dish was good too, I think the blackberries are unnecessary- and eaten with the rest of the dish I don&#39;t think it fits taste wise. 

We had the black and white cheesecake dessert, and I really liked the cheesecake because it&#39;s not too sweet. But the dish has 3 small spoonful sized cheese cakes and a large scoop of the sesame ice cream, which was good, but as its a cheesecake dessert I would have liked more cheesecake, or at least an even amount. I love sesame crisps, but theirs tasted a bit burnt. But we liked the little sesame cookie dough balls.

They also have sugar coated spearmint leaves with the check which are a nice touch."

I would have given them 5 stars had it not been for the initial service and waiting.  We had reservations on a Saturday and arrived promptly but had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table.  I can&#39;t recall the last time I had to wait for a table with a reservation.  Anyway, a few minutes after we checked in, an older white couple arrived and they seated them promptly, even though I heard they had a reservation at the same time we did.  They were seated in the very front next to the window.  I don&#39;t know what that was about, but my friend had wanted to leave after she saw that, especially because we had been there first and had been waiting already.  Maybe they don&#39;t want Asians sitting in the front where people can see int?  Who knows.  The people at the front pretty much ignored us until we were finally seated.  Then we were ignored for a while at the table until finally someone came with a menu and water.  WTH.  Bad start, Rioja.

Luckily the food was delicious because it would have been a shame to have waited and gone through that for nothing.  The woman who passed out the bread was unfriendly - hopefully she won&#39;t get promoted to server.  The bread was good, but we were wary to get too full on it - you could choose between several choices. I ordered a couple of drinks and neither really did it for me.  I guess because they tasted very...neutral...neither sweet nor sour.   For dinner, we chose:

-Fresh Bacon - Pork belly on top of curried garbanzo beans.  The pork was tender, but what I really liked was the garbanzo beans, which surprised me.  It was a very good dish, but I didn&#39;t think it was the best thing I&#39;ve ever eaten, according to other reviews.
-Scallops - OMG - I&#39;ve had scallops many times in my life, but I have to say that these were the best.  The way they were seared and simply flavored was just amazing.  I have no idea how they did it.  And it wasn&#39;t salty at all!  I find a lot of good at restaurants to be oversalted, as if to make up for the lack of flavor.  I was happy to say this was perfect. 
-Artichoke Tortelloni - At first, my friend thought it was a regular dish, but the more she ate it, the more she liked it.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of artichoke, but I did like the dish (not as much as my scallops!).
-Triple Chocolate - Great dessert with various chocolate mouses sandwiched in between white chocolate and sitting on top of chocolate syrup.  While it wasn&#39;t as memorable as the other food, it was still a good choice for dessert.

We were still not completely full by the end of dinner, but we were at a good place.  The food was so good, we were tempted to order another dish just to try it, but we decided to grab a drink elsewhere instead. If I ever visit Denver again, I&#39;d definitely be back.  Make sure to get reservations - I made mine at least a few weeks in advance."

Lost one star because there wasn&#39;t a ton of food but what did come out was pretty great. The service was ok, but I asked for a tasting menu and it took so long and I was pretty hungry that I just opted for a regular meal.

The bar gets pretty dang loud, which is fine, but we sat right next to the sucker so it was hard to hear each other talk unless we also spoke up. The location is pretty cool as it&#39;s right on Larimer a few blocks away from 16th street so there&#39;s other stuff to do in the area. 

Next time I&#39;m in town I&#39;ll probably try someplace else. The prices were pretty high, and I had to have a snack later just to tide myself over."

My cousin and I went there for brunch on Saturday morning, and let me tell you: I am going to miss that place badly. To the best of my knowledge, I had the best breakfast/brunch dish I have ever eaten, there at Rioja this weekend. The meal started out strong with some fantastic sourdough bread brought to the table, an omen of the great entree that was to come. Service was very, very good.

That Sweet Potato Hash with eggs and pork belly, though? Out-freaking-standing. Complete A/A+ territory here. Grand Slam Home Run and then some...a thorough game-changer. I honestly wanted to lick the plate clean. For $12, it was nothing shy of a revolutionary dish to me. Here&#39;s the menu description:

sweet potato hash, blackened pork belly, poblano peppers, red onions, sunny side up eggs* $12

Everything in that description sounded good to me, and it was all *perfect*, with one very, very important thing omitted from the description: the mushrooms, and the mushroom sauce. Oh, sweet mercy: I was absolutely blown away with how well every part (EVERY SINGLE PART!) of this amazing dish went together. The mushrooms brought everything into harmony, and not one single thing was overcooked, undercooked, or seasoned incorrectly.

I mean, my gosh...the best breakfast dish I can ever remember eating anywhere, from anyone. Wow.

I had dessert, too, based on the strength of the entree. Dessert, pears and pistachios, was good, but I&#39;m not a massive pistachio fan, and ordered it more for the pears. I don&#39;t regret getting it at all, and it was good, but a pistachio fan would have been over the moon with it. A nice way to end things, but the entree had already secured the win in the best way possible. I&#39;ll be dreaming about Sweet Potato Hash for years. This place, based on my singular experience, deserves every dollar they make. If I get back to Denver again, I&#39;m going back. Period.

So apparently, nothing can overtrump the awe and wonder which Rioja achieved quite easily. When I can be wowed like that, it&#39;s *always* a great thing.  As good as it gets, indeed.  What an incredible first impression."

We sat at the bar and had basically a four course small plate menu.

Mocha-roasted beets: Amazing. It was pecans, puffed wild rice, vanilla, dried cherries, red shiso, some cheese that was like a creamy goat brie, but I don&#39;t know what it was. The pecans were not really necessary, although I get it for texture, but the rest of the dish was spot on.

Braised lamb rotolo cassoulet with pickled red onion colored by beets, brioche crouton, celery leaf and carrots. The lamb was out of this world and by far the prettiest dish on the plate. The carrots and bean combo were perfect as was the broth/just stuff. Once again though I think the brioche crouton was the one unnecessary ingredient especially as some were crunchy and come were soggy.

Octopus Farfalle: by far the best dish. the pepper medley was crunchy and hot without being overpowering. the tempura preserved lemons were fantastic.

Artichoke tortelloni: i&#39;m pretty sure this dish is illegal in a few states. artichoke mousse with truffle and gooey cheese?  Excuse my french but it&#39;s like sex on a plate.

The service was unpretentious and gracious. Had some great wine pairings, too. 

I don&#39;t know if they do tasting menus, but they really should consider them because as much as I wanted the red deer entree, getting the greatest hits was definitely a great introduction. 

Good stuff."

I got the app portion and while it look small, it was mighty. A full portion may have been too rich  when paired with the appetizer I also orderd.I found myself closing my eyes to savor every bite. I probably looked weird. 

I dined alone at the chef&#39;s counter. I eat alone often when I travel and sometimes the experience doesn&#39;t match that of a group&#39;s. This time my meal was timed perfectly. I had just enough attention. The Goldilocks portion. 

The service here is impeccable and you can tell that the chef has a strong command of the kitchen.

I would come back to try the tasting menu. Little details like the amuse and candied mint leaf at the end made the experience five stars.Make a reservation and come hungry and adventurous."

Food is a 3  or 3.5..  The servers were great and the host was very accommodating. I like how their computer system allows them to input notes and documentation so they can remember details about their interaction with you &amp; your reservation. I had truffle tortellni (artichoke mousse, white truffle brodo, queso de mano, chervil) &amp; thought it was very delicious.  My friend tried it and thought it was too salty. You could definitely taste the truffle flavor. The artichoke was a bit hard. It only came with 5 pieces of pasta so I relied on the free breads to get more full. They have a bread service which = a person walking around with 4-5 different kinds of breads periodically. Our bread person came by twice and I got to try the lavender sourdough, goat cheese roll and a ginger raisin wheat roll. The goat cheese 1 was my favorite. It was soft and most flavorful. I also tried the pan seared barramundi (pea-crème fraiche salad, honey poached carrots, pea shoots, carrot-coriander nage) which was presented very beautifully. The sauce was bright orange and there were lots of fun colors on the plate. I thought the carrots were great because they were soft and tender. The peas however were hard and undercooked. I had a rose that was so dry. It was slightly difficult for me to drink it. For dessert I had the white and black cheesecake (blackberry filled white chocolate cheesecake, toasted black sesame ice cream,blackberry coulis, sesame nougatine, black sesame paint). The sesame nougatine tasted like a Chinese herbal medicine store to me and the &#34;cheesecake&#34; was the size of 3 thimbles. There was no cheesecake crust, only the cream cheese portion. The ice cream was definitely larger in portion size than the cheesecake so I feel like the dish shouldn&#39;t be labeled as cheesecake but rather &#34;ice cream with small chunks of cheesecake.&#34; I liked that the ice cream wasn&#39;t too sweet tasting."

Had the lamb never and the salad. Seasoning overpowering on the burger and the salad had too much salt. Don&#39;t bother with the donuts. Not sure what was going on there.

I ordered the Petaluma chicken which is a huge amount of food compared to the other dishes that my party ordered. I was very surprised about the artichoke tortelloni entree because it was a tiny portion. All the reviews raved about it but maybe it tasted better than it looked. I thought the bread was okay, none of them were warm or soft and I don&#39;t really like how they come around and you have to tell them exactly which ones you want. Honestly I don&#39;t really get the hype of Rioja. I&#39;ve been wanting to come here for a long time but I was not that impressed for the price.

From the multigrain roll to the goat cheese biscuits to the lavender sourdough, the highlight of Rioja was their bread basket, so don&#39;t come here and expect to eat carb free. Our server brought out an amuse bouche, compliments of the chef, following the famous artichoke tortellini, which was thoughtfully plated. That set the tone for the rest of the meal. 

For my main course, I had the halibut. The portion was small, and I wasn&#39;t all that impressed compared to everything else we had. Luckily, I had a sampling of everything on the table. My friend had the lamb, and his only regret is that he wasn&#39;t able to take the bones home. A vegetarian would enjoy the different flavors on the veggie plate (a sampling of of artichoke, gazpacho, mushrooms, and quiche prepared in different ways). I&#39;d highly recommend the wagyu short rib, which melts in your mouth. For dessert, we share the delicious beignets, which was enough for all five of us to each have one. Lastly, the server came out with complimentary candied spear mint. 

All five of us left very happy and impressed."

Also ordered the ravioli with white truffle sauce, to die for delicious!!!  It was like a passionate kiss, I had to close my eyes while I tasted it! (5 stars)

It&#39;s gets worse, we ordered a &#34;Rioja picnic&#34; and a melon appetizer that was actually good and plated beautifully. My entree was a train wreck and for $40 bucks I wanted spectacular. I ordered some lame lamb dish that semi warm and far removed of any sort of spices. It was actually gross! My husband ordered some watered down scallop dish that was twice as bad, what&#39;s with the watery cream corn? We recently heard your restaurant went through a million dollar renovation.Apparently, zero was put into your menu! Neither one of our dishes were favorable OR hot!

It was our first time eating here and wanted to try their tasting menu.  Our server was even nice enough to switch the appetizers on the tasting menu if we wanted.  Our glasses were always full without even asking for refill.

I got the 5 course tasting menu since I like the wagyu beef. This is a good way of tasting a lot they offer with the right amount of portion if you are undecided.  There&#39;s also a 7 course one.

Beet was soft and works well with the goat cheese. Second course, the &#34;bacon&#34; is one of the softest pork belly I&#39;ve eaten which is complemented by garbanzo puree with curry. Third course, the wagyu is Excellent!!! Would personally prefer not to have the puree underneath since the beef is perfect in itself and puree makes it a bit soggy... But still good. Can&#39;t remember all the cheeses in the 4th course, some are from Spain with our favorite being the one on top of a fruit preserve.  Last, to top off a great evening, I had probably the best chocolate dessert I&#39;ve tasted. The trio of mousse is light and the ganache was rich with hazelnuts complementing everything. Definitely worth to come back even just for the dessert. A must try if you&#39;re in Denver."

The waitstaff was really nice and even brought us some veggies chips and a sample of something new they were trying while we were waiting for our order. I ordered the braised pork cheeks (delicious and perfectly done) and my husband ordered a lamb stew (that broth was to die for!). For desert we ordered the fig and goat cheese stuffed beignots, which were really good. The tokaji (dessert wine) was also really amazing. This seriously was one of the best meals I&#39;ve ever had.

FOOD 5/5
We ordered the bianca pizza and cheese plate for appetizers. First of all...the pizza was so delicious. Cheese but just the right amount of olive oil drizzled on top. The cheese plate featured four different cheeses with sauces as well. The highlight of the appetizers was the free fresh baked bread - lavender, scone, focaccia, oh my!

For my main course, I ordered the house favorite: artichoke ravioli. The ravioli was soft, flavorful and the broth that it came in was mouth-watering. One of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten. EVER.

SERVICE 5/5
We had another guest join us 10 min after we ordered our meal and our dinners still came out at the same time and quickly. 

AMBIANCE 5/5
This place looks small from the outside but is actually a decent size when you walk inside. Dimly lit and perfect for a date night or dinner with friends/coworkers."

Our first bites of the night were from the AMAZING bread basket. The waitress only gave you two pieces but they were all equally delicious. I tried to coax the girl in to leaving the basket, IT WAS THAT GOOD.

The first dish we ordered was the pecorino selection which was 3 different variations of the cheese with a complementary flavor for each one. My favorite was the cheese with the rhubarb jam. A nuttier cheese with a tart yet sweet  jam. (This dish also appears on the dessert menu which I thought was very interesting)

Then we had the picnic selection which was assorted cured meats with these thin pieces of focaccia crisp bread. There was also sweet almonds, orange marmalade, and smoked gouda. The radish and onion salad infused with truffles was mouth watering and really cut through the salt on this plate. 

The best entree on the table was the artichoke tortelloni. YOU MUST ORDER THIS !Many people have added photos of the dish but in case you haven&#39;t seen them they are pouches about 3 times the size of an average tortellini. They are creamy on the inside and lay in a delicious chicken broth based sauce. 

The steak, tortelloni &amp; vegetarian dishes were good sized portions but the two seafood dishes were not meant to feed grown men.  And don&#39;t get me wrong I enjoy salty food, but most of the items had you reaching for your water after a couple bites."

Our server (Robyn) was an absolute delight - attentive, understanding, prompt, cheerful. Service overall was professional. 

We started off with the pizza, which was okay, and the fresh bacon, which was amazing. The crusty top simply melted when we cut it and melded nicely with the garbanzo bean paste.

Next came the bread - not unattentively piled in a bucket, but in small slices in a large basket tucked under the arm of a server, who deposited a cute cube of butter sprinkled with salt and recited the options. I was most impressed by the lavender sourdough, whole wheat bun, and rosemary goat cheese biscuit. 

The pink Hawaiian salt came in an adorable little thimble-like container complete with a tiny metal ladle. Very fun to play with, if not use. 

As for entrees, I ordered the artichoke tortelloni and proceeded to shove the first one entirely in my mouth. My brain shut down for a second. It was that good. 

The duck with risotto was fine, salmon came with rich carrot purée and lemon zest, and lamb, I heard, was also quite good. 

Dessert: Cheesecake with black sesame ice cream. A work of art on both the eyes and the tongue. 
3 ice creams/sorbets with lace cookie - pear with licorice liqueur, apple crumble, and coffee. Good as well. 

Come if you have money to spend and an appetite for luxury, and look sharp. You&#39;ll enjoy yourself."

The restaurant has wonderful lighting and atmosphere and would&#39;ve a great place for a romantic dinner or special night out.

The wine list is huge and the wait staff were all experts at describing the various options and making recommendations. They also have a fabulous selection of craft cocktails.

The amuse bouche was smoked salmon on a cracker. It was light and flavorful and the perfect start to the meal. I had the pear and black mission fig and salad as my appetizer. It was well presented on the plate and delicious. My coworker opted for the fresh bacon, pork belly. I&#39;m not a big meat eater, but WOW! The dish was out of this world. For my entree, I opted for the Skuna bay salmon which was cooked to perfection and delicious. My coworker had the Tempura nori wrapped tuna which was another stand out dish well presented on the plate. We decided to share the Artisanal cheese plate for dessert, which offered a nice variety of cheeses. We were presented with a baked, sugar coated mint leaf to close out the meal and cleanse our palettes. The restaurant was beyond fabulous and I would jump at the opportunity to eat there again."

Rioja has become one of our favorite upscale restaurants in Denver, usually saved for birthdays or anniversary dinners.
The food is unique and gorgeous to look at. And it actually tastes good! The artichoke tortelloni is my go-to here- the broth is impossibly buttery and rich.

This restaurant has the elegance of high end, but the feeling of laid back rustic Spain.  All of the dishes seem simple in nature, but complex in flavor.  Service was top notch.  If you can only get a few things you must get the Fresh bacon, because paired with the garbanzo bean purée is life changing.  The artichoke tortellini is everything.  Finally, the pork cheeks with pockets of dill pasta bites with a Parmesan foam was what dreams are made of.  Everything here was amazing, but make sure you try the 3 top dishes I discussed.

Just WOW. 5 stars in every category - the ambiance, the service, and of course the food. My wife and I came here to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary, and it&#39;s literally impossible to imagine having had a better experience. 

We ordered the Artichoke Tortellini, then the Knife and Fork Salad, and the Barramundi fish entree. Another yelper described the tortellini as &#34;sex on a plate&#34;; my wife certainly thought so. Personally, I thought that high-praise was earned by the Barramundi. It is PERFECTLY prepared, from texture and unique assortment of flavors. In fact, everything here has a uniquely memorable flavor, down to those delicious pre-dinner biscuits.

And the service! Erin our server was very friendly and engaging, yet classy, and very respectful of our special evening together. We declined on dessert - we were both fully satiated by that point - yet Erin surprised us with a complimentary (and not surprisingly, delicious) dessert sampler.

The bill total pre-gratuity was $55 for the both of us, so it&#39;s very reasonable for what you&#39;get.

We are definitely coming back with friends and family! Thank you, Rioja!!"

We came on a Saturday night and had a reservation. We asked to sit in the front by the patio because it was such a nice evening. My husband and I had just arrived after a flight so we were looking for a good time and a great dining experience. The food runners were very friendly and explained our food selections in great detail. our waiter was able to give us good recommendations for wine and allowed us to sample a few items off the menu that we didn&#39;t order ourselves. We started with the bread that comes in a basket. They had very good flavor And we&#39;re a dry texture. We ordered the cocoa beets which were our favorite item we tried this night. The presentation was beautiful and I regret not taking a picture of it. The combination of flavored were creative and very unique. There was even charred rice that gave it a smoky flavor and the dish literally tasted like fall. We then had the charcuterie plate called the picnic, which was under whelming and was not worth getting. We got to try the artichoke tortelloni which was also under whelming. The ratatouille pachetti was pretty tasty. We also got to try the cheesecake and the beignets which both had good flavor. We really enjoyed the food and the wine was exceptional. Probably some of the best wine I&#39;ve had at a restaurant before. We look forward to trying more from here next time we&#39;re in town."

Sometimes at a popular restaurant, a small party of two is relegated to a, shall we say, creatively placed table.  We have a story about our &#34;anniversary corner&#34; from a few years back at a bustling high-end sushi establishment (we were squeezed against the wall at the end of a banquette with barely enough room for the server to maneuver around the table).  This year, we sat in the &#34;anniversary isle&#34; while servers and everyone else whizzed past us on both sides.  But the chairs were very comfortable, the service was impeccable, and the food was absolutely amazing, so we were able to tune everything else out and just enjoy ourselves (I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something else about gazing deeply into each other&#39;s eyes but, come on, we&#39;ve been married for 17 years).

The extensive wine list is devoted exclusively to the wines of Spain.  Since I know absolutely nothing about Spanish wines, I asked our server to help me chose one.  He asked me a couple of questions and came back with exactly what I wanted.  Mr. P. had some sort of spicy tequila concoction that he really enjoyed.  We sampled from the vast and varied bread basket, choosing the exact same two selections:  the goat cheese biscuit and the lavender sourdough bread.  We agreed that the sourdough was our favorite.

We shared a couple of appetizers, the hamachi crudo and a half order of the artichoke tortellini (fun fact:  a half order of any of the pasta dishes can be made into an appetizer). Both were crazy good and we decided that the artichoke tortellini was the better of the two by a thin margin, despite my having to mentally restrain myself from licking the dish clean (we were out of bread).  Entrees were presented in the form of crab risotto for me and halibut for him.  Both dishes were divine.  We decided to forego dessert since (1) we were very full and (2) we were on a mission to explore places in Denver we&#39;ve yet to discover.

Rioja should most definitely be on your &#34;to try&#34; list if you&#39;re not already a repeat customer.  I&#39;m already thinking about brunch on the patio.  Anyways, don&#39;t procrastinate like we did, just make your reservation and go."

I love this place.

Sat at the bar. Beer was excellent. Had &#34;Leaves of Lemongrass Belgian Witbier.&#34; Awesome. Tried to remember how to properly taste and evaluate beers like they taught us at Sam Adams. Don&#39;t quite remember - but I can unequivocally write this beer rocks.

Tried &#34;United in Oranges&#34; next. It is partially a homage to the Broncos. Very orange aroma. Slight orange taste. Crisp. I typically dislike fruity beers, but I like this one.

The atmosphere is laid back. I could see me bringing my wife, kids (college and HS age), or friends here.

I prefer food that tastes like someone&#39;s momma&#39; is back their cooking with love.  Well, I guess it&#39;s someone&#39;s daddy and dudes back there cooking.

Food - average / typical of a place that wants to have a downtown look and taste but they are suburbanites.

Beer - average 

I really wanted to fall in love with this place since its in my neck of the woods. 

I will say, boat loads of people folk to this place and they all seem happy and full when they leave.  I am just overly persnickety about my foods and beverages.  It&#39;s worth going there once to see if you enjoy it.  :-)"

Well I was incorrect, the rest of the orders were very timely. 

We ordered the dude fries to start. Man they were amazing. The perfect combo of cheese, thick cut bacon, garlic aioli sauce, and jalapeños made for an excellent appetizer. If you fill up fast then plan on sharing with a few people. 

We had the Fahrenheit 451 pizza as a meal and added pancetta. It was excellent. The ghost sauce made the pizza. 

Everything was reasonably priced except the pizza. $20 for a 12&#34; is high in my opinion. 

I didn&#39;t think the beer selection was very good, but I like hoppy beers, porters and stouts. I had the Diggity Dank which was a nice hoppy beer. My second choice was the regular Dank which was full of spices and not my style. 

Four stars for the long wait, the OK beer selection, and the high priced pizza. I would recommend going, the staff is super nice!"

The food is actually really good, although, there were some odd pairings (they gave me salsa as a side for what was like a mini-stromboli.  They have a full bar, but, they don&#39;t really focus on anything but the beer - no craft cocktail menu.  The best part of Dads &amp; Dudes is the friendly service.

Good sign for any place. First things first, we ordered two glasses of their best beer, Liquid Résumé, along with their über fabulous nachos! Spicy green chili and smoky mozzarella layered between tortilla chips to make a stack almost 7&#34; high! Its baked in a wood-fired oven to melt the cheese and then it&#39;s finished on top with sour cream drizzle and freshly chopped green chilies and tomatoes. Oh my gosh, these were amazing!! Warm and crispy and gooey and spicy all in one appetizer? Oh yeah!  :-)

Not to be offset by the nachos, we ordered the 8&#34; pizza called &#34;Tommy Gun&#34; and were blown away by its deliciousness, especially after we swapped out the olives for jalapeño peppers. We spoke with Zimmerman and had such great things to say about the food and drink. The place was neat, clean, tastefully decorated and had a wonderful vibe going on. We will be back!"

Service can be spotty. A couple of times I&#39;ve gone they&#39;ve forgotten an appetizer, salad or entree.

The beer is excellent.  The food is very good for a bar-first restaurant.  But the service is what sets them apart.  It took no more than 45 seconds for each beer we ordered to arrive at our table and by the time we put the empty glass was on the table we were asked if we wanted another.

Our pizza was good and the have a decent variety of options. I really liked the texture and flavor from the spent grain crust. I was not a fan of the wings. Way too overly sweet for a spicy sauce and the wings were just ok with more breads get then meat then drowned in sugary sauce. I tasted several beers and wasn&#39;t impressed. Creative yes, but the flavor seemed artificial and not well balanced with the malts and hops. I settled on a cider which was more sweet like apple juice then the tart I normally enjoy."

Solid, diverse, beer selection. Really enjoyed the thin crust Tree Hugger pizza and the $5 small Wedge salad was enough to share. Kids meals were fairly priced and the french fries I stole from my son were good.

This time we started with jalapeno poppers.  These aren&#39;t just your normal poppers.  They are wrapped in spent grain pizza dough and served with marinara and creamy ranch. Delish! The jalapenos were hotter than Hades, but the ranch helped balance it out. Then we shared a Prohibition pizza. In my opinion, this is their best pizza.  I love it.  Covered in green peppers, onions, garlic and spicy Italian sausage. To keep with the spicy stuff, I got an order of wasabi cole slaw. The cole slaw actually tasted like it didn&#39;t have any wasabi in it. I was a little disappointed, but the cole slaw was still really good. Also, a good tip, join their Speakeasy group.

The grub is tasty and the beer is darn good. I have come by on a date night and with two groups of friends. Every time I have come the place has been packed. I am not sure if they take reservations but it might be worth a try for dinner. 

I truly do enjoy this place, and if we lived closer would probably be a regular. The pizza is very good. We have had several and I can&#39;t remember their names but I will tell you watch out for the jalapenos. They can be hot. Like Kate Upton on the beach hot. Like Mt. Doom, melt the One Ring hot. Trust me here people if you value your regular bowel movements take a small first bite. 

You know and even though I still can&#39;t taste right from those peppers, I appreciate that. Dad and Dudes cook with real stuff. Real jalapenos don&#39;t always have the same amount of heat to them. I actually think it might be their way of trying to sell more beer, you know to help put out the flames. Ok. not really but, hey, maybe.

Walking in it is already welcoming, as I would expect any microbrew to be. We had the choice of inside, or on the heated patio. 

Chose inside. Noise level low enough for conversation. Good mix of music on the speakers. 

Being from the Chicago area (north sider, go Cubbies), my eyes lit up when I saw Italian Beef on the menu. I thought of my home town favorites Al&#39;s or Portillo&#39;s.  Though they had pizza and other goodies on the menu, I had to try. 

But first, we tried the poppers.  Jalapeño, cheese, real bacon, baked in their pizza crust. Definitely worth trying. Good strong flavor with a bit of a kick.  Served with a ranch sauce and a salsa. 

On to the beef.  A little different, as it was served on a focaccia bread. Serving size was good but less beef and more bread than its Chicago cousins.  

Good flavor.  Nice and wet. Definitely full.  Not quite Chicago but worth a return trip. 

For a side, onion rings. 4 ginormous rings in a seasoned batter. Yummy but perhaps a little heavy on the batter. Again worth the purchase.  

My wife had a grilled chicken Caesar salad. As par with the theme, a little different. Real Bacon and the lettuce was ever so slightly grilled.  Another good choice. 

Not a beer drinker so I didn&#39;t try any of the many brews. 

Service fast and friendly. Server did lot give us her name but knew the menu and was there with refills right on cue. 

Will return again to see if they can earn the fifth star."

Many brews on tap. Can&#39;t comment on how they were since I don&#39;t partake in alcoholic beverages, but the folks around us that did seemed to enjoy them. I tried their Italian sandwich and it was decent. The cured meats inside were good but I would have preferred a crusty bread over their soft, ciabatta style that they served. My wife had their pulled pork sandwich. I had a taste and the pork had a hint of smoke to it but I thought the bbq sauce it was mixed with was too sweet and overpowered the pork flavor. Average fare."

Seemed like there was only one server working that night. Waited probably 15-20 minutes before we even got our drinks ordered.  Toffee porter wasn&#39;t too shabby, but their blonde was tasty. Happy hour is pretty cool...beer and a one topping pizza for $5 bucks can&#39;t really argue.  Their dough was kind of rough...pesto and prosciutto was different, but ok. Pizza Blanca which was a veggie with ricotta cheese, garlic, and Olive oil was simple, light, and creamy.  A slice of bootlegger which had meatballs, pancetta, bacon, and roasted peppers costed me over &amp;5! I was better off ordering an entire pie for an additional $5! 

The chicken wings albeit crispy is so not worth $9 for only 8 pieces! It&#39;s completely and utterly robbery! I accidentally ordered the jalapeño poppers when I wanted the Stromboli bombers...they were just meh.

Service was incredibly slow, although our server was really nice seemed like she was the only one serving which is not a knock on her. The food was just ok...nothing stood out. Pizza dough was extremely tough to cut with a knife, but hey for $2 during happy hour, what can you expect?  We went during karaoke night so it was really loud, cool that people actually participated, if you don&#39;t mind some people being tone deaf. But hey kudos to them for actually having the cohones to step up to the plate, with the help of some liquid courage, and throwing caution to the wind, to stand up there along amongst strangers and totally butchering a song!"

Service improved with a recent(ish) management change, though upon visiting last week, it was back to being slow and mediocre (I wasn&#39;t approached until 17 mins after being seated. Our entire visit took an hour and a half for two people).

We primarily come for their food offerings. My husband loves their mac and cheese and I can attest it is quite delicious. Maybe the best I&#39;ve had lately. I usually go for the build-your-own calzone as the available toppings offer a wide range of choices. I also appreciate that the dough used is more of a multigrain per them using their spent grain.

I&#39;m not a super beer fan and find their offerings to be too strong for my liking. They&#39;re always kind enough to bring out samplers though, so I&#39;m not stuck with something I dislike. My husband enjoys their toffee porter and they do make a beer-garita, though again, it&#39;s a very strong and not in the tequila sort of way.

Prices are decent and if you can catch them on a good service day, you&#39;re set. Parking is ample around back and with the covered patio, wait times aren&#39;t bad."

We got two pizzas for the price of one with a coupon and their home brewed beer.  As far as the pizza is concerned, the ingredients are fresh and bold; the pizza sauce is homemade and peppery, different but good, and the crust has rolled oats and is sweet as I believe the dough is rolled with honey. For these reasons I would absolutely recommend a basic pizza like pepperoni or cheese, because their pizza is unique and good in its most simple state.

I wasn&#39;t a fan of the fresh but super spicy jalapeno slices on our spicy Hawaiian style pizza, nor the tasteless chicken on our Cajun pizza. The food was good and we had tons of leftovers, but it&#39;s really nothing to write home about in my opinion. It wasn&#39;t good enough to go back, but I may order a pepperoni to go sometime."

Really decent prices, about $10 per person with beer if you are splitting a pizza. A large pizza had leftovers for 4 people."

They just started serving brunch and I appreciated that they had a small menu, only five or six items long.  I ordered the green eggs and ham which I thought was just scrambled eggs with ham, cheese and pesto. Sounds heavenly enough but then I learned it was served as a calzone.

Um, yeah.

A breakfast calzone with pesto?? Be still my heart! Visions of what it would be like went through my head as I had my coffee and chatted with my boo. Then it came out and it was a sight for sore eyes. It was almost too beautiful to eat. Almost.  It was out of this world and I&#39;m a lucky girl because the boy likes to share so he took a calzone piece in exchange for a piece of his challah french toast complete with fresh berries. It was the best of both worlds.

I asked for Cholula and the waitress brought me this Cheech Gnarly Garlic sauce which I had to laugh at.   But once I tasted it, it was no joke, this sauce was amazing and a few drops went a long way. I&#39;m now on a mission to find it and secretly hoping that there will be a complimenting Chong sauce out there (a girl can dream you know).Coffee was hot and fresh, they have a nice little patio area to sit on and service was awesome but never got offered a free mimosa that is supposed to be complimentary with brunch, oh well. There is everything in the shipping center it&#39;s in (Target, Ulta, Ross, DSW, Sprouts) so it&#39;s a perfect place to dine at then do some shopping....or the other way around!"

Tried their beer first in a can and the fact that they can gives them credibility. We were there this weekend and not only their beer varieties were good and good food. They even had a nitro blond that i would give 4 stars, their wit was good as well. By the way, if you consume 30 bucks, they sell you a 4 pack of large cans for $6 bucks, good deal. They did not have stickers of the brewery though, I expect one nice sticker next time guys.  Keep the good work!

Ordered boneless wings (jerk bbq and honey bbq), Nachos, and bombers. Toffee Porter beer

Pros: Nice atmosphere, Clean, Service was good.

Cons: Overall the food lacked flavor. The wings were over cooked and extremely dry, The nachos were 90% chips and 10% toppings, the bombers were the best out of the three, however the marinara sauce was terrible and the ranch dressing just tasted like milk no flavor at all (it was homemade) so without a good Ranch or Marinara the bombers weren&#39;t that good.


All and all the food was just so bad I can&#39;t see going back again.

The staff is friendly, especially Steve Zimmerman the owner who tells everyone to call him Z and treats everyone like they&#39;ve been friends forever! 

The beer selection is plentiful and diverse enough to satisfy the most discerning of beer drinkers. We started with a flight- dirty milk chai with homemade whipped cream (heavy whipping cream, sugar, and creme de cacao) drizzled generously on top, the sunkissed braggot with hints of crystallized ginger and orange peel, the model citizen golden ale (a good easy drinker) and the piece de resistance- the leaves of lemongrass Belgian witbier (crisp, smooth, and bright flavors without any bitter aftertaste). 

The food- think down home cooking meets neighborhood pizzeria. We started with Dude&#39;s Fries- rosemary flecked creamy potato goodness studded with huge pieces of thick cut bacon, diced jalapeño and cheese all lovingly drizzled with garlic-basil aioli. Don&#39;t forget a side of homemade green chili to push it all over the top! 

We rounded out the meal with a 420 pizza- think supreme pizza elevated to gastropub status. Giant chunks of homemade sausage with fennel seeds and pepper flakes out the wazoo, tender mushrooms, crisp green peppers and onions and a solid staple of pepperoni slathered in chunky marinara and gooey cheese. Do yourself a favor and ask for a side of the marinara to really tie the whole pie together. The best part was the dough- crispy on the bottom and crust with a not-too-soft center. Dad and Dude&#39;s uses the spent grains from their brewing processes to enhance the pizza dough... So good. We&#39;ll totally be back!"

The brunch menu has an assortment of bacon centric options. Pancakes, hashes, tots. You want it they have it. Plus, if the dish doesn&#39;t have enough bacon you can order by the slice or make it a bacon flight and try one of each of their speciality bacon. 

I got The King. It is a bacon pancake with blackberry compote drizzled over the top, sliced bananas, peanut butter whip and bacon maple syrup. I went all in pouring the syrup and spreading all the whip. Oh so good. The bacon added a nice salty accent to the pancake. The peanut butter and banana combined for the classic flavor and added extra sweetness to the salt. The blackberry was tart but I couldn&#39;t taste it once I spread the whip. 

We also tried a slice of jalapeño bacon and candied bacon. I preferred the spicy version. The kick at the end was subtle but balanced the richness. 

My friend got the almond pancake which is a great gluten free option. It definitely was lighter than my bacon pancake! 

I got an order of bacon tots but I wouldn&#39;t get it in the future. They are very starchy and not very flavorful. 

Bacon Social House has a hip vibe with a beautiful location. They have garage doors that can be open during the warmer season and lead out to the patio. There is a full bar (mimosas all around!) and a second floor for seating. If bacon is your jam and you can eat it breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Bacon Social House is the place to be."

Bacon Bloody Mary - um hello - so good - great garnishes which include - you guessed it... bacon. 

Bacon Hash w/ Poached Egg - excellent flavor - made with sweetpotatoes &amp; chunks of bacon. Menu mentions it has smoked poblanos in it but I really couldn&#39;t taste it.

Polenta &amp; Veggies - yes, it seems sacreligious to order something WITHOUT bacon at this restaurant but this dish was truly amazing. Crispy polenta cake with lightly sauteed crisp asian veggies. It also has some delicious sauce - so much noms

My only issue with the restaurant was that the food seemed to take a long time to come out  About 5-7 minutes longer than is usual. We got there Sunday am before the big rush, but, once seated (at the bar which is a great spot), the crowds came in and the service slowed down. Excellent wait staff though!"

To start off, we had ordered a flight of bacon for $5. The flight of bacon consisted of paleo bacon, habenero bacon, candied bacon, smoked bacon, applewood bacon and BBQ bacon.. NOMS! I ordered the Costa Rica benny with poached egg on top - the base of the dish is a delicious jalapeno corn bread with a generous slice of pork belly, mango salsa and special chipotle benny sauce on top. This order can be spilt into two since the portions are huge at this restaurant with a price of $13! 

I will be back for more bacon soon~

Cheers!"

So, I planned a brunch and made a reservation. They weren&#39;t as busy at 9:45am but people really started piling in on Saturday morning - so I suggest you make a reservation or plan to wait. 

We ordered drinks and a bacon flight, they came out relatively quickly but our meals took FOR-EV-ER. Our waitress didn&#39;t apologize once for the long wait time and I really just wanted recognition that it was taking awhile and I wasn&#39;t just being impatient.

That being said, the food was pretty tasty - the habanero and BBQ bacons were my favorite. The bacon tots were not very bacon-y and were too crisp to be a tot - it was like a tot shaped burnt hashbrown. The crab cake benedict was good, perfectly poached egg - pretty solid. Honestly it was all pretty standard food that I feel you could definitely get elsewhere at a place that won&#39;t make you wait 45-60 minutes for your meal. I&#39;d rather just go for the bloody marys - I tasted some of each and they were all dynamite, as well as the kombucha mimosa - unique and tasty."

I have recommended this place and will return!

Bacon - AWESOME! Waitress recommended the Costa Rican Benedict (pork belly and pineapple on jalepeño cornbread-like base) I found it a little heavy and surprisingly absent of anticipated accent flavors. On a scale of 1-10...I wouldn&#39;t ask for that style Benedict again. 

There&#39;s more to explore and worth a second look though."

I have brunched at the best of them, but Bacon Social House is something special.  Every dish is made with precision and care.  Something I would expect at a fine dining establishment, but not necessarily from a bacon-themed restaurant.

First the food.  I ordered the Sunnyside Benedict with fried green tomatoes and smoked gouda pimento cheese atop poached eggs.  This might possibly be one of the best Benedict&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had...even without the bacon.  Perfectly poached eggs and fried green tomatoes that rival some of the best Southern style restaurants in the area.  This comes with a choice of bacon tater tots or seasonal salad.  I went the healthy route and picked the salad.  Usually I just expect nothing more than some mixed greens with a little vinaigrette, but they actually made a lovely strawberry feta salad that was an excellent counterpart to the heavy Benedict.

Another great thing about the menu (for the indecisive individuals such as myself) is you can choose some items a la cart, such as a single pancake or even a single strip of bacon for $1.50.  I recommend the candied bacon.  It&#39;s not as sweet as one might expect and complimented the smokey bacon flavor rather than overwhelming it.   

Now to ambiance.  This restaurant gets extremely busy, but has a nice, hipstery flow about it.  You can venture to the upstairs bar area for a mimosa or bloody while waiting for your table.  They also have a nice outdoor seating area lined with umbrellas and newly planted trees that will create some nice shade in the years to come.  For now, it can definitely get a little hot outside, even with the umbrellas.  Something to keep in mind, at least for the next month.

Finally to service.  Our waitress was extremely pleasant and polite, but seemed very overwhelmed with the amount of tables.  This clearly was not her fault, but I don&#39;t entirely understand why such a consistently busy restaurant doesn&#39;t have a larger wait staff.  Even as the afternoon went on and tables started to clear, we had a real hard time getting our waitress to finally bring our bill.  A little annoying, but with as delicious as the food was, it&#39;s easy to let that slide.      

So my new motto: I don&#39;t normally spend $70 on brunch, but when I do, it&#39;s at Bacon Social House.  And it&#39;s totally worth it."

It&#39;s located in the &#34;Highlands&#34; which is still the North Side to me, so it&#39;s pretty trendy and fun.  It wasn&#39;t super crowded yet, so we were seated right away.  

We decided to start with a flight of mimosas and a couple of flights of bacon as well as a side of the tots to share.  The bacon was delish, I really liked the candied &amp; habanero bacon.  The tots were pretty good.  I&#39;m not usually a fan, more because of the texture than the taste, but these were not your typical tots.  They were more like hashbrowns rolled into little balls and then fried.  

We all had different dishes.  Hubby and I shared the biscuits and gravy and classic bacon breakfast.  The other peeps ordered the bacon hash and BLT.  Now, we definately took our time to order, but it took a REALLY long time to get our food.  We really didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go, so we ordered a flight of sangria and just waited for our food.  I&#39;m not positive, but we may have had 2 flights before we got our food.

So, when we finally got our food, and a couple of the dishes were cold.  Hubby&#39;s eggs, bacon, and tots were room temp. for sure and my brother in-law said his eggs were cold also.  So we told our very sweet waitress and she took them back.  She brought the dishes back in about 1 minute.  All that was replaced on hubby&#39;s plate were the eggs.  Same exact room temp bacon and tots.  My brother in law said his food was still cold.  So they sent a manager over to talk to us.  He was super cool and very apologetic and got the boys new plates with hot food in no time.  I know things get hectic in resturants, and yeah maybe the food had been sitting there a while.  Mistakes happen and BSH definately handled the situation well.  And for this, I will definately give them another chance.  Oh, and the food was pretty delish!  LOL!  Cheers!"

Amazing flight of Bacon. All six tasted amazing, they were right when you can&#39;t go wrong with bacon. I had the Ring of Fire Bloody Mary to start off, my thrist was quenched. So tasty with an after kick. Then I chose the Bacon Shrimp and Grits and my taste buds exploded. The best Grits out of the south. The owner and chef have a lot of passion and take pride in their food. It shows in the presentation and taste. They also strive to make sure you have a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Great food, great atmosphere, and amazing service! Lots of local brews and drinks to choose from. Glad I came!"

I also love that their patio is shaded well into the early afternoon.  As you might have guessed, bacon is featured prominently on the menu.  I suggest trying a bacon flight, there are six varieties of bacon and you can do one of each or pick and choose your favorites (I really like the habanero and bbq, but they&#39;re all excellent).  Bacon tots are delicious as well.

BSH has a variety of build your own pancake or waffle combinations as well as options for scrambles, omelettes, or sandwich varieties.  Last time I was there the pancake on special was a chocolate chip cookie dough pancake that goes with a side of vanilla ice cream or whip cream.  That way you can moderate how crazy you want to go with dessert for breakfast or just go all in.  This is one of those places that you really can&#39;t go wrong, but if you&#39;d lie a recommendation try the hash!"

What I love about Bacon Social House:
+ Mod decor
+ Wine specials during happy hour
+ Outdoor patio
+ Located next door to a cheese shop

This little neighborhood nook is on the up and up, I like that Bacon Social House and the surrounding retail are tucked away from the street but not hidden. You can find it if you try just a little. 

I&#39;ve only been in for happy hour before and I hear that this place gets turnt for brunch. My interest in returning lies with dinner, since the menu is seasonal and from looking at things online, they&#39;re due for a fall menu soon. Yippee!"

#1 - Food was really really good. The prices are good for the quality you get. The pancakes are pretty fancy and thin, good but I think a little too over the top. The omelets, fruit and bread items are worth the price. 

#2 - The service was slow - the bartender was also playing server. I think they could use some more staff during brunch hours instead of 2-3 people. There was no silverware and I had requested avocado on my omelet and no avocado. We waited for quite some time and finally my boyfriend went up to the bar and asked for a side of avocado. Not a huge deal - the staff was very helpful but still something they could work on.

#3 - Street parking - so you&#39;ll have to spend some time looking for a spot but it shouldn&#39;t take you too long. Clean restaurant, very cool atmosphere &amp; the menu was fantastic.

The food really saved the 4 star on this one - I think they are still new and trying to figure things out. 
I&#39;ll be back again Bacon Social!"

We all ordered something different and shared the pancake flight and the bacon flight. I would totally recommend the bacon flight because of all the different kinds of bacon they have; we ended up taking a bite of each and concluded that our favorite was the candied and chipotle bacon. To our surprise, our least favorite was the original; the original had a kind of rubbery aftertaste. On the other hand, the pancake flight was a little disappointing to me; I wanted to order it because I saw a picture on Yelp. On the picture, the pancakes were big and had more toppings on them, so when we received the pancakes, I was a bit underwhelmed. Our favorites were the king and the strawberry fields pancake; we&#39;re not big fans of ginger, so we didn&#39;t like the sunshine pancake too much. 

I personally ordered the Costa Rica Benny and I loved it; it had slabs of pork belly and two beautifully poached eggs on top of cornbread. It was delicious! My friends all ordered different things such as the chicken and waffles, crab Benny, Carolina Benny, and the bacon hash. They also liked their dishes. Overall, this is a good place to get breakfast/brunch."

I have been to BSC twice, and experienced extremely slow service both times, but it&#39;s always insanely busy, so I will cut them a little bit of slack. The food and drinks are both really really good. I&#39;d recommend adding a few heaters to the patio so they can keep it open year-round - once winter hits the seating space is going to be cut in half until warm weather rolls around again."

A restaurant with fantastic swine in every dish of theirs whether it be breakfast or dinner? Count me in. I&#39;m a firm believer than bacon makes everything better so I went into Open Table to make a reservation for brunch with one of my friends. Unfortunately they didn&#39;t have any available for three weeks so I held onto my reservation and counted down the days until bacon fest.

It&#39;s a good restaurant but their operations could use some work. Like I said, I made my reservation on Open Table and checked in with the hostess but they never marked that I checked in. So I had to contact Open Table to clear things up. My friend and I decided to split a flight of bacon (which is just a plate of different kind of bacon, called it a flight is just cute and kitschy) and while our server rocked, the rest of the staff didn&#39;t have an idea of what was going on. We had two different servers ask if we ordered a flight plus tots and we told them just the flight and they just walked away. They finally just gave us both because everyone was getting confused and frustrated. Bacon? Good. Tots?! Order these now!! They were like a tot/hush puppy hybrid, pretty heavenly!

I ordered the Costa Rican Benedict featuring pork belly, chipotle hollandaise and pineapple mango salsa. I loved that you could order tots as a side or a sweet version of quinoa with berries, coconut and honey. Props for the healthy alternative BSH! I got the quinoa and the menu was fantastic. My friend got the chicken and waffles with some of the best sausage gravy I&#39;ve ever had and it was enough to take home for two meals. 

All in all, BSH is legit but they have some work to do with running the place and communication between staff. Be sure to make a reservation and try the tots!!"

I went on a weekend and found that there was no wait, like most breakfast joints in Denver have.   
I ordered a bacon flight, a bacon Bloody Mary, and an omelette.
Of the Bacon flight, only two of the bacons were really something different.  Maybe I am desensitized to bacon now, with every restaurant including Arby&#39;s serving pork belly.   Regardless, the Bloody Mary was tasty, and the BBQ bacon was good, but I am not sure that a $1.50 per slice of bacon is really worth it.
Nothing was really that extraordinary, and the service seemed a bit flustered at times.   She even forgot to order a few things for us.

Bacon Social House has creatively created a menu that incorporates pork and you guess it...BACON!!!  However, if you are not a big fan of pork products there are plenty of other items on the menu to choose from.  

I been here several times and overall this place is amazeballs.  I been coming on the weekdays for brunch so I do not know how pack this place gets during the weekends, however, waits during the weekdays are very minimal with fast service.  One time we even customized our own dishes and they were super accommodating to it.  My boyfriend and I wanted the Costa Rica Benedict, but without the smoked pork belly so we decided to substitute it for the smoked pulled pork of the Carolina Benedict.  It turned out amazing like every other item on their menu.  I also really enjoy Bacon Social House&#39;s bacon Bloody Mary.  It is by far one of the best bloodies I have ever had.

We started with a bacon flight...one of which was &#34;maple.&#34; It tasted like maple at first bite, but then it seemed to get hot...like spicy hot. We told the server we think we got something else by mistake so she brought us another one. She said it&#39;s not supposed to be spicy. SPICY...again. They must be cooking it all in the same pan.

Took forever for the rest of the food to get there. It was pretty good (3 stars) but I just can&#39;t look past the service. We got there around 9am and there were only maybe 4 or 5 other tables taken. 

We also had a few cups of coffee, the last of which tasted burnt (first 2 cups were fine) and was undrinkable. 

There were also LOTS of flies. They hadn&#39;t even opened up the large &#34;garage&#34; doors yet so they must have been trapped inside from the previous day or something. Not a HUGE deal, but certainly annoying when you are trying to eat.

The service is fantastic, the vibe of the building is super awesome, and I love the style of everything. The menu has a little but of everything, with tons and tons of bacon as you could expect.

The drinks: They have several mules (including a spicy one), margaritas, cocktails, and a pretty impressive tap list. All beers and mules I got were very good. My one complaint, and the only reason that keeps me from giving them 5 stars, is that happy hour is from 3-5.

The food: Fantastic. You must try the Bacon Flights. So effing good! If you are with more than 3-4 people, get 2 flights. Anything that has bacon on it, you pick what type of bacon you want, which is really cool. I always pick the Tender Belly Habanero bacon. Its my favorite! The tots are great, and the chicken sandwhich is SO much food and very very good. 

The service: fantastic! Both times, the servers have been incredibly polite and attentive. They are GREAT!"

I had been been wanting to try Bacon Social House, and had to miss going with a different group for dinner.  I really wanted to like the place a bit more than I did.  I must say, the service was excellent.  I just did not feel like the food quite lived up to the hype.  If it had, I would have been willing to go four stars.

I arrived early and grabbed a happy hour draft beer.  They had some solid selections from which to choose.  I went on to have a sour from Funkwerks that I really enjoyed.  The Bacon Flight (habanero, garlic, candied, applewood, paleo, and chef&#39;s choice) was tasty.  And although I am willing to shell out up to a dollar a piece for good man-candy, at $10 for 6 slices I was a bit underwhelmed.  Our social director divided these up into bite-sized pieces to aid with distribution and consumption. We also split some Bacon Tots, but texture-wise, these were too soft (like mashed potatoes) for me to really enjoy them.

At the recommendation of our server, I went with the &#34;BBQ ribs&#34;,  This was served with bacon mac n cheese, collard greens, and blueberry-chipotle bbq.  The collard greens were excellent.  I liked the texture and deep and dark flavor.  These were definitely the best ones I have eaten in recent history.  The mac n cheese was very good, although I prefer mine a bit cheesier.  The ribs were visually appealing, but I could not say much more for them.  It was a meager portion of meat and for my taste, they were overcooked (falling off the bone). 

For dessert, I had the overpriced, but very delicious Brown Butter Blondie--with choice of ice cream, and salted caramel.  Overall, I liked this place, but I need to be closer to &#34;love&#34; territory to justify the expense."

I love the combination of bacon, breakfast, and I was sold into thinking this place would really be a swell thought to go on a date with someone special. Kudos to the neighborhood built literally right next to this restaurant. That&#39;s where I parked. I heard really loud, (sorta obnoxious) club music and didn&#39;t think this spot would actually be the Bacon Social House. 

Upon entering in, I had noticed it was a mixture of bar meets coffee shop, meets club, meets vintage 50&#39;s era restaurant. This place is freakin&#39; huge!!! They have God knows how many floor levels and a outside patio. I chose the great outdoors and sat and browsed the menu. 

They have: Singles, Couples and Stacks of pancakes that you can choose. ($11 max for stacks for 3 pancakes.) and they sell breakfast omelettes, poached eggs, bacon, Bacon, BACONNNN All over their menu. 

I ordered the King platter and it came with three vanilla styled pancakes with lots of bacon bits inside, strawberry drizzle, banana bits and bacon maple syrup. I loved the flight of nine bacon strips which featured honey roasted bacon, fried, all apparently coming from different states like Tennessee, and even from out of the US, like Canada! They had a special bacon strip from Colorado. 

Drew was my main server and I enjoyed his service. It was kinda awkward with him but he completed the job :) I will be making this a to-go date spot in the near future."

In general, service was very good and the food was solid. They were super kid-friendly, which is a plus for us parents. I don&#39;t know how this magic worked, but though there were lots of kids present, it was actually pretty quite. All the kids were very well behaved.

The decor is fun and creatively bacon themed.

If bacon isn&#39;t your thing, don&#39;t worry, they have a full menu. We didn&#39;t order any bacon until our bacon-flight as an after-meal treat.

Get here early if you are coming for brunch! We managed to and got seated imeediatly, but 15 minutes later there was a line."

Bacon? No need to research any further. This bacon heaven is sandwiched between two buildings pushed back away from the street. Look for an obvious red sign. Yeah it says Bacon. Duh. :)

They do take reservations which is nice. Industrial chick decor with tall ceilings and a second floor option to dine in. A bar to your right as you walk in to the main dining area. 

Bacon is of course a praise to the bacon which most of us love. I do. What they do here is incorporate bacon into their dishes. What did you think they do here?:) BUT not in an overwhelming way. It&#39;s the perfect amount. 

The Bacon Tots is like tater tots with bacon pieces. It&#39;s a tasty starter to begin your foray into their offerings. 

I ordered Bacon Hash. It&#39;s two perfectly poached eggs with sweet potatoes and a smattering of poblano peppers. Do you think it&#39;s odd? Sweet potatoes with bacon? Wait till you try this baby. The poblano peppers is surely a good helper to break the largely sweet result the sweet potatoes impart. Simply because it&#39;s the largest amount in the dish. The hickory smoked country bacon covers the salty intake I crave in my bacon. The poached eggs? They provide that runny goodness only an egg can provide. 

This dish provided me with a lot in my mouth. Textures and taste and it looks good. 

Happy to report their O.G Mimosa is worth ordering as well.

Nice trying ya Bacon Social!! See u soon!"

We had both heard so many good things about it and were a little disappointed. I believe it was a case of high expectations and the experience didn&#39;t quite meet it.

I was not a huge fan of the menu (pretty limited options) so the hubs and I split the Mac n Cheese and Bacon sampler. The Bacon sampler was a great way to try all the type of bacons they offered. The Mac n Cheese was good but not the best I&#39;ve had in Denver (hence the 4 rather than 5 stars). I&#39;m not sure if I would order the Mac n cheese again if/when we come back.

The service was great. Our server was super sweet and helpful - especially after we cancelled the entree we planned to split. Additionally, the atmosphere is super fun. It does get a bit noisy though so don&#39;t plan an intimate date night here. The place is also a bit difficult to find as its not on the Main Street but rather down a bit. Just keep an eye out for signs.

I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll be back for dinner but we would definitely come back to try the brunch."

From the first interaction of getting a phone alert when our table was ready to a chat with the manager, they have nailed the customer service piece. 

We started our dining experience with the bacon flight. While all the bacon was very good, I like spice so habanero bacon should be spicy and this wasn&#39;t. Same for the garlic bacon which should have a discernible garlic flavor which this didn&#39;t. The paleo bacon was the table favorite with its porkiness - if that is even a word? 

Next were the entrees which is where we had some room for better seasoning. I went with the huevos rancheros which needed a longer cook time on the tortillas. They were the chewy impossible to eat presentation. The rest of the dish was good but not mind blowing. My mom enjoyed her pulled pork and onion omelet and my dad enjoyed his bacon and eggs. The hubs only ate half of his Carolina Benedict. The table agreed that the pork was under seasoned and didn&#39;t taste like a pulled pork should taste. The waitress was on top of it and noticed the half eaten plate. We let her know and she let the manager know who very nicely comped a dish. 

Hands down the best part of the food were the bacon tots. Super crispy on the outside and creamy bacon salty on the inside. Oh yeah. Those are the stuff of dreams. Totally on point along with the customer service."

Great menu selection for food and booze. Close to home and most importantly, they had lots of bacon!

No reservation and wait is 20 min on a peak time for Sunday Funday and I&#39;m not sweating it. Go to the bar and wait a bit but only cause the 2 bartenders are busy but I can see they saw us, but once they engaged you... spot on!

We finally got to our seats and had to keep moving from serving staff and patrons from bumping into our chairs. Got our first round of drinks and a flight of bacon, ordered our food and life was good. Ordered another round of drinks and then a third round but yet no food. Keep in mind, these drinks weren&#39;t flying to the table and now it&#39;s been about an hour waiting on food. 

So we are now frustrated, haven&#39;t seen our waitress to often and now we&#39;re tallying drinks and cash in hand cause we&#39;re ready to leave. Funny part was it must of been obvious we were disgruntled cause the table behind us waited 3 hours for food and told us good luck and that they changed their order to go. Plus by now we&#39;re sweating, those folks got burned and the sun is in full force on the patio. 

Food arrives, yay! All the food was solid but the bacon hash... Almost no bacon. So we donated bacon to his plate and ate. Costa Rica was amazing, bacon tots delicious, traditions benedict solid, basic bacon and eggs breakfast was good. 

Great drinks, awesome atmosphere, food is solid but the kitchen ruined it for us. Sad part is that when I shared this with my friends at work, this wasn&#39;t the first time this has happened. Thanks to the bartenders for the service otherwise this would have been a 1 star review."

The restaurant is located in a beautiful new building with lofted ceilings and huge glass doors that roll up in nice weather to join their patio. It was a bit tricky to find from the street, but it&#39;s there, just down the gangway! 

We came around 9am on a Monday and our server started off by offering us a breakfast shot! We politely declined, but whiskey, oj and bacon were all involved. 

Bacon Tots Side - I was a bit disappointed, no discernible bacon flavor and more of a mashed potato than tot texture. 6 for $5 seemed a bit much. 

Costa Rica Benedict - smothered in a tangy sauce, rich pork belly. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this, I choose the breakfast quinoa over the bacon tots as my included side, and I&#39;m glad I did! The quiona was the perfect sweet and hearty side!

I made a reservation for 7 on Opentable for 7:45. Everyone was hungry due to traveling all day. 

We were told the table before us should be leaving soon. I understand the restaurant could not ask them to leave. What I do not understand is why after asking over &amp; over again the wait, it took them so long to offer food to us as we stood outside on the first chilly fall night.  We sat at almost 9 pm.  The manager did provide several appetizers to us once we sat. This was worth one star. 

Our waitress could not handle simple requests &amp; took forever... Over 20 minutes for waters which someone else finally delivered. Took over 10 minutes to be told the beer I wanted was sold out. I requested to see the beer list. I had to hunt her down in the restaurant 10 minutes later to ask her for the list again. Her excuse was it got busy all of the sudden. Please no excuses. I am sorry is the best customer service at this point.

When the food finally arrived, one salad was not correct. It took over 10 minutes for a new SALAD to come out!

The bacon was awesome. This drives star number 2.

Management, please do not overbook your large table reservations &amp; teach your hostess how to provide proper customer service to the hungry customers, not wait until the minute before they are finally seated. Also, provide your wait staff with support when they are struggling and offer verbiage on how to respond to shortcomings.

One issue would have been acceptable. One after another is very disappointing."

We started with the bacon flight, which I highly recommend. I didn&#39;t know that bacon could have so many flavors, but the flight proved me and my tastebuds wrong! From the habanero (smokin&#39; hot) to candied maple, each is delicious in its own way. Ask your server to leave the ticket or the menu so that you can match them up.

I have a smaller appetite, so I ordered a grasshopper pancake and it matched the description perfectly. The flavors of mint and chocolate blended perfectly and the Oreo whipped cream was the perfect compliment. It was sweet, but not overly so.

The biggest complaint I had was that I would have loved more tots! The bacon tater tots were to die for, but they were fairly tiny and there were only 6. Perfectly crispy, slight hint of bacon flavoring...even my largely veggie other half couldn&#39;t keep his hands off of my tots. Sadly, there were none left to store in my pocket, Napoleon Dynamite style. If there would have been, I&#39;d be snacking as I type (Seriously.They were THAT good!).

4 stars because they&#39;re still working out some bugs (i.e. It took us awhile to get seated even with a reservation, the service was kind but slow and the appetizers came out with the meal). That said, Bacon Social is brimming with good food and lots of potential and should definitely be on your Denver brunch to do list.

Tip-It&#39;s a bit tricky to find because Bacon Social is set way back from the curb behind other buildings."

The bacon and beer fight were perfectly paired and are worth a second visit on their own merit. I really enjoyed the Kentucky Mule (that also comes with Moscow/vodka and Mexico/tequila options). The pork wings were cooked perfectly and the pineapple was a great pairing. I didn&#39;t like the BBQ sauce it was cooked in though. I also expected a lot more from the bacon tots... They were a disappointment.

Lastly, I had the bacon, shrimp, and grits and they were amazing! I&#39;ve already told my brother that we&#39;re coming back for them before I head back home.

It&#39;s nice to see some new places opening in Sunnyside as the area continues to grow. The new space is open, bright and well put together and I&#39;m sure it will have a great feel in the warmer months with all of giant roll up doors open.

Our server Fong was excellent and attentive and very obviously interested in our feedback. 

The habanero margarita was by far the best cocktail on the social hour menu and well worth a try. The old fashioned was average as were the food offerings on the social hour menu - nothing stood out as exceptional. The hummus plate was ok but an improvement would be more vegetables and/or toast points to go with the large serving of hummus. The kale chips that came with the hummus were good but they didn&#39;t necessarily make sense with the plate. The pork tacos were large but again, they were pretty average.

As I said, they are new and trying and I wish them luck as they find their stride. I&#39;m sure we will be back to give them another try."

We weren&#39;t initially going to get the flight of bacon but he talked us into it and I&#39;m SO glad he did :) in addition to our bacon cheddar tots appetizer. Both of which were phenomenal.

For the entree I ordered the bacon shrimp and grits. I thought the taste of the dish was good but was rather put off by a grit patty as opposed to creamy grits. My friend ordered the bacon burger which was also very good but the cream cheese was THICK and lots of it.

I&#39;m not sure why there is a bar upstairs when it is not functioning. It merely acts as a base for the waiters which I did not like. We wanted a fruity cocktail to start with which they really did not have on the menu but there was no bartender to ask upstairs. So Ryan went downstairs to the bartender and tried his best. The bartender sent up two lemon drops that were TERRIBLE and we could not even finish them but still were billed for. Ryan recommended the Moscow mules and we were thrilled with those! Guess that&#39;s what we get for not following the menu.

Like another reviewer stated, there were a lot of flies.

My only constructive criticism was the food temperature.  My food wasn&#39;t cold but it also wasn&#39;t piping hot.  I have mixed feelings on the reservations thing.  We had to sit at the bar because we walked in and that wouldn&#39;t have been my first choice.  I&#39;m not used to having to make a reservation for two people for brunch.  But on the other hand, I was just able to make a reservation for a larger group and that was such a relief.  I&#39;ll keep an open mind about reservations for now.

I think on a follow up visit they can earn more stars if they work out the new restaurant quirks I experienced on my visit there.

The good: When arriving, we were told there was an hour wait but were actually seated within about 15 minutes which was awesome, yay for squeezing people in more efficiently. Very nice patio situated off the street that is roomy so you don&#39;t feel crammed in. The menu has so many choices it&#39;s impossible to choose. The bacon...clearly it&#39;s delicious. You can&#39;t name a place after bacon and not have the good stuff.

The &#34;needs improvement&#34;: So while we were seated fairly quickly it appeared that our server was totally overwhelmed. Service was beyond slow and while the manager acknowledged it by comping us our appetizer which took 40 minutes to arrive, our entrees still arrived after many other tables who had been seated behind us received their food. Hopefully service gets better and they have enough staff to accomodate the tables they have seated. My dish which was the bacon hash, had several undercooked pieces of sweet potato. This is a fairly simple dish to make (I make a sweet potato hash at home regularly) so cooking potato correctly should be a no brainer for kitchen staff. I still ate the dish so clearly liked it, but would appreciate attention to detail. The rest of the party also seemed to enjoy the dishes and the emphasis of the bacon in everything. 

Worth giving this place a 2nd chance if they can figure out the little things throwing this place off kilter.

The chicken sandwich is TO DIE FOR, like drop dead from clogged arteries and be totally okay with it dead.

The salad was edible, not bad, but don&#39;t bother, just get a flight of bacon and a chicken sandwich. 

Bacon burger was fabulous of course.

Bacon tots were greasy and cold in the middle and had very little bacon in them - but I bet they are awesome when prepared well. Hence the 4 star review.

Why allow people to make reservations if they just get put in the queue with everyone else.  We live right down the street and used to come when no one was there. We&#39;ll definitely not ever return reservation or not.

Revised my review from one star to three stars because the manager did apologize and comp us our drinks and appetizer to make up for the wait."

Knowing the &#34;tots&#34; are more mashed potato bites helped...  And they&#39;re delicious.  Wonderfully smooth taters with little bits of bacon blended in...  

We had these as a side with the lamb sliders.  Sweet, savory, perfectly blended flavors.  I&#39;m not big on lamb but these were lovely.  To round out our meal, bacon mac &amp; cheese and Brussels sprouts.  The mac was soooo good.  Smoky, creamy, delicious.  And the sprouts were so lovely as well, with thick bits of bacon and the right amount of char.  

We were full and satisfied without feeling gross or bacon-overloaded and for less than $20 each, including a beer and an iced tea.  We skipped dessert this visit, but it&#39;s safe to say we&#39;ll be back.  Especially since service was attentive without being imposing."

And the bacon tots that came on the side of some of the dishes were really tasty-a real winner with the kiddos and adults alike.

Made a reservation for Sunday brunch. The appeal of this place is great; fun architecture, great looking menu, wonderful lighting. With two friends joining me, we couldn&#39;t wait to try as many things as possible. But...

This bacon flight you have been reading about is $10 for 6 pieces of bacon!! What in name of everything that is holy could they possibly be charging that much for? Coffee - $3.50 for drip! Those tater tots (made of potato, the cheapest food on earth), also $10!! Everything was overpriced, and then, disappointingly, not good.

The real reason for 2 stars is that none of the dishes were good. The bacon hash was so overcooked that the whole thing was mush, and it was pooled with butter at the bottom (I really wish I would have gotten a picture). The shrimp and grits was in a very heavy gravy that was neither brunch-like or pleasant. The bacon tots were the greasiest food I&#39;ve possibly ever eaten. With so many great Denver brunch spots, I hope the Bacon Social will step up its game."

We made the mistake of not having reservations, which admittedly is our own fault, so it was quite a long wait. While we were waiting it took a long time to order a drink as well. 

We tried the bacon flight, which was tasty, I liked it. Did it blow my mind? No. 

I had an omelette and my bf had some kind of hash. Both were decent, but average, nothing to write home about. 

I&#39;d be willing to try this place again, maybe for dinner, but my first experience was just ok."

I am not even that big of a bacon fan but put me inside Bacon Social House, and everything sounds delicious!! This place is just poppin, you can&#39;t even get reservations at a reasonable brunch hour but my group of friends just ended up going there and only waited for about 20 minutes before we were seated. 

This place is located in this little alley way on 44th street. It&#39;s actually a little hard to find so just keep that in mind. There are plenty of street parking in the area. This place is screaming the word CHIC and it makes me feel cool to be here. They have a big drink menu that includes bloody marys (bomb dot com one of the best I have ever had!!), mimosas, house coffees, and even wine and beer. I ordered the bacon bloody mary (because bacon duh) and it was soooooooo good. It was spicy and delicious and comes with a giant stalk of celery and chef&#39;s special black pepper bacon. I felt like I was eating a forest because the celery had so many little leaf stalks growing out of it. My friends got their coffee and they were delicious as well. The house coffee comes with unlimited refills and is better than most house coffees I have tried. One thing that I would comment on that is lacking is espresso drinks like iced coffees, chai etc. 

For brunch, I got the free range sandwich. It comes in a nicely baked bun with a giant piece of fried chicken, your choice of bacon, pickled cucumber, and cole slaw like salad. It also comes with a side and I picked the bacon tots (because bacon duh). They also have amazing hot sauces that are made here in denver so make sure you try them! My sandwich was absolutely phenomemonal. It was crispy, the flavor was so rich, and it was super filling. The bacon tots are to die for. I&#39;ve never had bacon tots before so I loved it. The service was attentive and all my friends agreed that this place is now on top of their list of brunch locations. I will most definitely come back and try their extensive menu which ranges from benedicts to sweet choices like crepes, pancakes, and lots of savory items. What a chic and cool place to meet with friends or come for a brunch date. Check it out!"

We had reservations and they were able to get us in within a few minutes of our arrival which I appreciated considering the huge lines to get in. We were seated outside and the patio was great. The music overhead was a little loud so I felt like we were either yelling at each other or repeating ourselves a lot. 
We ordered a flight of bacon as an appetizer. I had really hoped to sample the bacon before putting in my order and choosing my bacon but considering that the bacon didn&#39;t come out until a full 40 minutes after we ordered that didn&#39;t happen. The flight of bacon was yum. 
I ordered the eggs and bacon. I asked for the bbq bacon and got something else. I asked for a salad instead of tots and got tots. I might have asked for both to be corrected but it had already taken an hour and five minutes to get our food and I couldn&#39;t imagine how long it would take to get it corrected. 
The partner ordered the biscuits and gravy and they were REALLY good. Lots of rosemary, delicious biscuits, consistency on gravy was good and plentiful. He debated whether he should have ordered the second biscuit. Those things are hearty!
The kids both ordered burgers. Although they were on the kids menu (not kids prices) they were full-sized. The burgers were delicious. It took quite a long time to get ketchup after the burgers were brought out (had to ask twice) but it was good timing b/c when it finally arrived it was a great opportunity to ask if we could have more water since two out of four had been sitting empty for a while. 
So, mixed reviews. The food was great. The service was not. I went down the middle with my stars b/c I do not want to unfairly scale down for an off service day. I can tell that our waitress was running her butt off so guessing it must have been more of a kitchen hold-up but really they should have been better staffed for such a busy day. Over an hour with hungry kids does not a Happy Father&#39;s Day make! 
Would i give it another try? Yes. The food was good."

New super hip and retro feel with great light flowing in and friendly service. I have always felt attended to and the recommendations given were spot on each time. 

Flight of bacon was amazing and featured Paleo, Jalapeño, Garlic, Maple, Habenero and Applewood. 

Coffee is strong and flavorful. 

Eggs Benedict available in many variations. The Tuscany with creamy polenta, speck ham and fig preserves was a show stopper. 

Fried Chicken sandwich looked amazing, taste great but hard to eat as it was super tall!

The burger looked amazing and I will have this next time!

The only negative is that 2 of the 3 times I have been here there was a draft or too much air blowing down on the tables and food got cold very quickly."

I had the watermelon and arugula salad with red onion and feta. Due to the bitterness of the arugula and the intensity of the onion it would have been better with more watermelon. I also tried the bacon and cheddar biscuit. Served with a generous serving if butter, it was very good. The biscuit was a bit oily - skip the butter unless you are really indulging. An excellent biscuit though and it served as a good accompaniment to the salad. 

No cocktail today - they have a nice selection and reasonable prices.

I must admit: I hadn&#39;t even heard of this new spot until all friend&#39;s birthday approached and this was her chosen spot for our squad to assemble...and stuff ourselves full of decadent dishes and quirky cocktails in the name of her birth. It was a perfect selection. We made a reservation for a large group on a weeknight and we were blessed enough to have the upstairs section to ourselves. 

As others have noted, the place is tucked away a bit behind the other businesses. We passed it on our first walk by, but we soon realized that the neon BACON sign should have been a clue. Whoops. 

Our table ordered the gamut of dishes. No one was even remotely upset. Personally, I went with the breakfast-for-dinner route and got the chicken and waffles. The gravy wasn&#39;t overdone, the syrup was a lightly sweet touch, and the waffle was crispy. My hubs got the lamb sliders and was impressed with portion size. Our table split a few bacon flights. Each one was unique, and though I have no clue which was which, all were good!  I heard marvelous reviews of the bacon old fashioned...and we ended with a blondie for the birthday girl.  

Staff was attentive, personable, and they allowed a friend to bring in mini cupcakes and candles so we could add our own flair. I&#39;ll be back, BSH, and hopefully for brunch!"

I truly hope that Denver&#39;s food scene catches up with its population growth and wannabe restaurants like these fall to the wayside instead of surge to the top in yelp for no discernible reason. 

I have not eaten in an actual, sit-down, full service restaurant in weeks. Maybe months. To celebrate some small accomplishments and feel like we were having a real meal, my  husband and I decided to try Bacon Social House and got a reservation for dinner during the tail-end of their &#34;Social Hour&#34;. 

One rare plus was that the service was actually very good; our waitress was attentive and convivial and everything was served quickly and with a fair amount of attention. Unfortunately, none of it was very good. The $5 wine/beer selections were fine but not exactly a particularly good deal for &#34;Happy hour&#34;. We also ordered the kale salad and smoked pork tacos from the happy hour menu, which were absolutely not a deal at $7 each. $7 for two tacos on happy hour? That was overpriced for regular hours, let alone a happy hour. 

The kale salad was huge giant leaves of kale, some with the rib still in, tossed in a completely forgettable lemon vinaigrette. The menu said it came with &#34;roasted sunflower seeds&#34; but ours were absolutely poured directly out of a bag- there was no roasted or nutty flavor to be seen or tasted. It also came with dried currants. So, basically, the salad was like they took a bag of cut kale and tossed it in a bowl with trail mix and grated some cheese on top. It made very little sense. 

The tacos were flavorful and we enjoyed them, but the tortillas completely fell apart and they just made no sense on the menu. Why smoked pork with Latin flavor profiles at a restaurant that centers around comfort food, brunch, and bacon? 

We chose to split the chicken and waffles and a side of bacon tots. The chicken and waffles was terrible. The chicken, although juicy, fell completely apart from the breading. The gravy was very sweet, which, combined with the honey butter made the dish cloying and it didn&#39;t make sense at all with the chunks of sage-heavy sausage. The worst of all, though, was the waffle, which was thin and yet incredibly dense. It desperately needed more leavening and more flavor. The batter on the chicken was crispy but the oil was too hot in the fryer and it was nearly burnt. 

The bacon tots were pretty good and had good bacon flavor, but they are absolutely not tater tots. Tater tots are shredded potato; these were mashed potato. So, fine, they were good, but in no way were they tater tots, they were bacon croquettes. Just call them the right thing or actually make tots. Similar to the chicken, they were overly browned and tasted of smoking oil.

People who know me know I can forgive bad food any day of the week over mediocre food. This was truly mediocre, and it really felt like they sat in a conference room and said &#34;Hey, let&#39;s put bacon in some things on the menu, use large blocky font and mid-century inspired furniture. Done!&#34; Maybe the problem was that we ordered a lot of items that didn&#39;t include bacon? But if that&#39;s the case- that only bacon-centric items will be good- then the onus is on you as a restaurant to either improve those items or remove them. Or better yet, put bacon in them in interesting ways. Kale salad would definitely have been improved by bacon, as would the chicken and waffles. 

TL;DR- Avoid. Make a BLT and eat it in your grandmother&#39;s living room. You&#39;ll have a more satisfying meal in a similarly styled environment."

This hot brunch spot is tucked back behind a brick building filed with boutique shops and will easily be missed if you are looking for a street front restaurant. Despite a modern feel and high ceilings it isn&#39;t too loud in a Sunday morning when local neighbors and their young families are noshing on bacon. 
Yes, bacon is the theme here, but it isn&#39;t overdone and shoved upon you. Order a bacon flight, a bacon bloody Mary or bacon bits on your pancakes. My Love and I ended up ordering the Huevos Rancheros and the frittata then realized there was no bacon to be had, so ordered a flight for dessert. All this to say, if you don&#39;t like bacon it&#39;s easy to avoid. 
My frittata was not sexy to look at, but was definitely fresh and included yummy berries. It would have been lovely save the excessive use of garlic and, according to my self-proclaimed skilled taste buds, garlic powder rather than the fresh clove. One simply does not use garlic powder in upscale dining. 

The Huevos are beautifully presented and mild to the palate, allowing liberal use of three hot sauce options for those who like the spice. Love said he&#39;d happily order them again. 
Our bacon flight included paleo bacon, Applewood smoked and double smoked Applewood. The paleo is thick cut and flavorful, and the Applewoods are appropriately smoky without being overpowering. An overall skilled execution. 
Service is top notch and we are looking forward to returning with friends in tow for another enjoyable experience. Thanks, Bacon Social!"

We were immediately greeted and seated. Decor is lovely mid-mod, in aqua/teal and orange. Tables are spaced far enough apart that you do not feel squished or that your ass might bump someone&#39;s coffee off their table if you need to head to the washroom. My friend and i both ordered scrambles, shared a 3 piece bacon flight (habanero, candied, and garlic), and had coffees.

Coffee was filled regularly. It was smooth and not bitter (of note, I drink my coffee black unless it&#39;s bitter). Bacon flight was pretty good (my gold standard is range... which is not fair to anyone else&#39;s bacon). Above average but not the best I&#39;ve had. The candied and garlic seemed less greasy than the habanero. Scrambles were ok (I chose roasted garlic, poblanos, and cheddar) but seemed heavier than I expected (esp for not choosing a breakfast meat to scramble inside). But the bacon tots are pretty good... can&#39;t go wrong with fried potatoes, though. I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but food just wasn&#39;t quite as flavorful as I thought it should be for the caloric intake.

I&#39;ll probably come again for bloodies and to try the benedicts or pancakes. We&#39;ll see.

Summary:
Pros: service, decor, ease of parking.
Cons: food seemed heavier than it needed to be?"

My two roommates and I went for our holiday &#34;fancy dinner&#34; last night and had a great time. The food was delicious--especially the bacon tots (technically a side but we got it as an appetizer). Fried potato clouds from heaven with a subtle aftertaste of bacon, really, but &#34;tots&#34; is much easier to say. I had the striped bass with scallion spaetzle and mushrooms, and it was divine. No bacon in this dish, but I didn&#39;t miss it. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the broth it was all sitting in was seasoned just right. I would like to eat an entire side of just that spaetzle. Oh, and how can I forget the warm bacon brownie with whiskey bacon ice cream?! Yes. Exactly how the meal needed to end. Split between three of us, we each got about 3 large bites, which was perfect. 

I&#39;m taking away one star for the following:
Our server was subpar. He may have been busy, so I&#39;ll cut him some slack for the very slow service, but he was not very friendly or helpful--and there&#39;s no excuse for that. Also, the minimalist, industrial-chic decor, while very hip, means the restaurant gets VERY loud. 

This is not a cheap spot, but prices are pretty reasonable for this type of establishment. I will definitely return to try more of their dishes (the entire menu looked great) as well as brunch...and hopefully sit in a different server&#39;s section."

We had a reservation for 12:30 but arrived around quarter after - we did not expect to be seated early but were told as soon as we checked in that they were on a wait which I didn&#39;t take as a good sign because I figured our reservation really meant nothing then. We headed to the bar to get drinks - one bartender - who did his best but was clearly buried. It took him about 10 minutes to get us our drinks. We hung out and were finally seated around 10 til 1 - 20 minutes past our reservation.

Starving, we got in an order for the bacon flight and crepes as starters. Our server was great and stayed on top of our drinks but obviously had no control over the kitchen&#39;s expediency and those apps didn&#39;t come out for about a half hour. We did the 6-piece bacon flight - which was delicious and the bacon was cooked perfectly - and the large order of the Blood Orange Crepes which were also very good and very rich. There were 3 of us eating and we had no problems finishing off both of these.

For meals, my brother had the small order of Biscuits and Gravy - he said it was very good and finished all of his (he was battling one hell of a hangover so eating was questionable, normally the small would NOT be satisfying for him as he has quite the appetite, so just FYI). His girlfriend had the Bacon Shrimp and Grits, also said it was good and was not able to finish hers - it was a pretty good portion. I had the Chicken and Waffles and while very good, not really any different than any others I have had around town. Nothing wrong with it at all, just not particularly noteworthy.

Overall, a good experience and while I would go back, it is on the other side of town for me so probably wouldn&#39;t make that trip routinely, especially if I am really hungry lol. Plan on this being a bit of a drawn out ordeal, just due to the wait and what I can only assume is an overwhelmed kitchen. And while they weren&#39;t able to seat us at our reservation time, I highly recommend making one if just to get ahead of the crowd."

Simply go there for this and load up your plate and you will be the happiest person ever. Seriously though, those little cream puffs of goodness are the best things ever! 

I went there last night with my family to celebrate 2 birthdays and was glad to see that it lived up to the hype from others. Ambience is great, there&#39;s lots of tv&#39;s to watch football or other sports on and the service is super friendly and not overbearing.

I was in the mood for some southern cooking, so I opted for the shrimp and grits. My brother got the bbq ribs and my parents got the sea bass. The shrimp and grits were awesome. A subtle spiciness along with the creaminess of the goat cheese melded all perfectly together in one bite. So good! My brother&#39;s bbq ribs were legit too. The blueberry-chipotle sauce on the ribs was to die for &amp; I easily could&#39;ve eaten all of his bacon mac &amp; cheese had he allowed me. My love for collard greens really wavers upon how a chef prepares it and the collard greens were done to perfection. Not too watery and had a nice kick to them. I can&#39;t comment on the sea bass as I don&#39;t eat fish, but my mom said it lacked a little flavor. 

Dessert made up for it though in her eyes. The bacon brownie with your choice of Little Man Ice Cream was amazeballs. Crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside with little chunks of bacon. We opted for the salted Oreo on top. Omg!!

Can&#39;t wait to come back for brunch and try one of their benedicts and of course another heaping plate of bacon tots!"

We walked in and I said I had reservations and the girl at the desk said that I had called in the reservations 30 minutes ago and that I would need to wait for my table. I in fact had not called in and I had made the reservations on OpenTable extremely early that morning.

Shortly after, the hostess corrected her and said that I was not the same Cody she was thinking about and that she should seat us immediately. 

We set on the second level of the place and the vibe was actually pretty cool. The place was busy, packed, and loud. Cool.

What isn&#39;t cool is the service, wait time, and temperature of food. 

We waited 20 minutes before someone took our drink order. The waiter continually reminded us that he was very busy with a rowdy party of ladies next to us. Okay, does that mean you&#39;ll just deal with us when you aren&#39;t helping the women?

Also, we ordered the flight of bacon as an appetizer and they brought it out with our main courses. You could tell the flight had been sitting around for quite some time before it was brought to us because it was EXTREMELY cold. The flavor was nice, but it would have been nice to be able to eat it when it was at least lukewarm. 

Hopefully, this place just has the &#34;we&#39;re new so please give us another chance&#34; blues and things will get better. I definitely see the potential, however, today was not their day."

We accidentally happened to show up for breakfast on the day of their soft opening - meaning they were not planning on having walk-in patrons.  We were greeted warmly and still provided a great experience.  We were given a limited brunch menu that reflected their upcoming options and all entrées were very tasteful.  (My husband said they have the best huevos rancheros ever!)   They have a fully stocked bar and offer plenty of cocktail options, perfect for any time of the day.  Their staff was extremely helpful/wonderful/happy to be a part of this new business venture.  Great décor in a fun and funky building.  

So happy this place is only 3 blocks from our house!  We can&#39;t wait to go back and try dinner."

Here&#39;s what I ordered:

Bacon tots - crispy, crunchy, perfectly fried with little bits of bacon in each bite. 

Bacon flight app - uh-mazingly delicious!! It&#39;s just bacon with different seasoning but the flavors were so good!   

Sausage &amp; gravy over a cheddar bacon biscuit
This dish was a little bit too salty for me, that didn&#39;t stop me from eating all of it! Biscuit and gravy had good textures and didn&#39;t get soggy. I&#39;d come back and give this a second shot. 

Blood orange Crepe
A little too sweet for my sweet tooth with overwhelming citrus flavors. Glad I split this with my friend as opposed to making it the main entrée."

Stopped by Gyroz on my way to an event a few days ago because it was on the way, open late, and not your typical burgers &amp; fries fast-food kinda spot. Worth mentioning is that Gyroz does serve fries, and does have a drive-thru, so it totally fits the &#34;fast-food&#34; category but this place serves quality gyro meat, that tastes delicious and is fairly priced.

last visit, I circled around looking for place to park and no luck.  i even tried to call and order ahead so I can just park on yellow line and rush in and grab to go.  oh..  it was during lunch rush and of course, the drive thru was backed up also.

It looks like a quick and easy fast food greek spot.  I decided to order a GyroZ meal, which is a beef gyro in laffa bread with a side of french fries. They were quick and quite friendly at the cash register. I thought the gyro itself was fine. I&#39;ve had plenty of gryoes and this one rates probably in the middle. The meat had a nice char to it. The laffa bread was somewhat fresh but I can&#39;t ask for too much from a fast food spot. The french fries are seasoned well and skinny style, which I enjoyed. 

Overall, it was decent. Being a fast food spot, the meat felt greasy and the portions weren&#39;t to par compared to the average greek restaurant. Would I go back? I think I would. I heard the chicken here is quite delicious so maybe I will switch it up next time. I am gonna give GyroZ a 3 out of 5. Its A-OK."

I was hoping that it was going to be really good because it was a 20 minute drive from my hotel!!
I was surprised to see that they actually had a drive through... That was a first! Their menu is limited but definitely very precise. I decided that I wanted to be a little bit carb conscious so I ordered the gyro salad. 
Everything was done lickety-split! The salad was delicious,the gyro was delicious, I&#39;m a happy camper!  And thanks to my yelp app, after I checked in, I was given the opportunity for a free baklava!! Dinner and dessert! I definitely will come back!"

While it was a bit of a wait (considering it was a drive-thru), it was well worth it! The combination between the bread, sauce and falafel was exceptional. (Side note: there were lots of falafels! Yes!) The sandwich also consisted of fries (amazing), tomatoes, and onions in the sandwich as well. The sibs and I got fries on the side and found them to be on the saltier side and the baklava was on the cinnamony side. Still, the sandwich was out-of-this-world good. I would even go as far to say that this is the best gyro in town ... for now. Also, I think it took a bit long because the falafels and fries are fried as you order -- that&#39;s good.

I will definitely be back for more!"

They weren&#39;t bad, but weren&#39;t the best, kind of middle of the road. They give you enough meat thought that you definitely get your money&#39;s worth. I did like the fries though, they had a black pepper spice to them, which was different than most places, but pretty addictive once you have one.

While I waited for my order, I was the only indoor customer at the time, I noticed that there were four tables that needed to be bussed and wiped down, but Carla went outside to smoke a cigarette with her boyfriend instead of cleaning up the lobby area &amp; tables. 
The salad, with no meat, was good but not worth the $7.50. If I wanted any type of meat, the salad would have costed $10.00.

I do feel spoiled considering I just had some amazing gyros downtown. They really had very little seating options. Maybe 1 or 2 booths--which seat 6 people. The rest are high tables similar to bar seating. Comparing this place to others --its just ok. The vegetables were virtually tasteless. My falafel was somewhat undercooked--and cold. My french fries were hot but again, they underwhelmed me .I spent more here and really don&#39;t think it was worth it. The tazitki sauce was bland and somewhat runny. This is what I would think the Mcdonalds of greek restaurants would be . Your average chain cutting costs on important things and jacking up prices on others  to average completely boring and lackluster food.  I most likely will not be returning. I&#39;m hardly ever on this side of town anyways."

While the location is a bit of a challenge to get to with the constant flow of traffic on the opposite side and a bit of confusion with the gas station and narrow road, it was nice to see signs specifically guiding one to the drive thru service area and parking area.  The young American gentleman behind the service counter was running the drive thru fare as well, but seemed to be skilled in handling both stations well.  He was very pleasant natured and not having been there before, he showed me how large the sandwiches were, which helped me to determine how much to order.  The wait time was practically non-existent for my to go items.  Once home, i was really impressed as to how my gyro was wrapped to prevent its contents from falling out all over the place.  Even more impressive was the size of the actual gyro! It was loaded...and i mean...LOADED...with delicious beef/lamb gyro meat!  The sandwich had the perfect amount of tzakiki sauce on it and the portion of fries in this combo meal was perfect.  The flavors were spot on with my expectations of a &#34;great gyro&#34; and will certainly be going back again in the future.  The price point of $26 was very reasonable for my three combo meals in regards to portion size, quality, and convenience."

I always get falafel without the tzatziki sauce, which normally results in a very dry falafel. However, no dryness here. I normally find myself using mustard so that the falafel isn&#39;t so dry but it absolutely wasn&#39;t necessary here. It also comes with tomatoes and onions. Not a fan of raw onions so I didn&#39;t get those.

The fries were awesome also. They were seasoned perfectly, some sort of garlic salt mix. But not too heavily garlicked because sometimes I feel like I&#39;ll taste garlic for the rest of the day but that wasn&#39;t the case here.

I got a free baklava for checking in. Not the best baklava I&#39;ve ever had, it was too cinnamony. But it was free so no complaints here.

Customer service was great too. I did drive-through (another awesome perk) and it took probably about 3 minutes total.

All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised. The exterior and location are very unassuming but this place is definitely a gem."

We both got the Original Gyro (no fries or drink) it was the 2 sandwiches for $11. 

They were so good. So good. And they included the fries inside - as they should! That is how they are in Athens! We were impressed by the grilled pita, fresh cucumber dressing - tzatiki, the right amount of onion and tomato, and perfectly thinly sliced meat.

We&#39;re STILL waiting for our food. Apparently they forgot to make it. How do you run a business and forget a customer&#39;s order? The interior is not that big. You can clearly see the entire area standing from the cash register and you just didn&#39;t notice two people standing there waiting for their food? We were literally 10 feet in front of you. When they realized they still hadn&#39;t made our food, you&#39;d think they would&#39;ve stopped and made our food first. Nope. There were customers who ordered after they realized their mistake and got their food first. Maybe if that female employee stopped eating fries, refilling her drink, and started working, we&#39;d have food. The guy who took our order asked if there was anything else we wanted. My wife said extra fries. The guy put in an extra cup of fries. We finally got our food and left at 8:06PM.

Every gyro I&#39;ve tried since returning state side has left me unsatisfied, until I ate at Gyroz. 

Let me start by saying that they use the same processed lamb loaf used by virtually every gyro joint here in the USA, instead of a whole cut of lamb, pork, or beef that is typically used in other countries. They do a great job of seasoning and preparing the lamb, combine this with their excellent tzatziki sauce and you have a very tasty gyro. I always substitute the fries with their greek salad, which is the best salad I&#39;ve had at any fast food restaurant.

I believe they&#39;re a family owned establishment, and the customer service has always been great. Their tasty gyros coupled with fast and friendly service will keep me coming back again and again."

Can you imagine any other restaurant charging half a buck for more of their basic sauce (BBQ, Catsup, Mayo, whatever their basic sauce is) if their sandwich is too dry and needs more sauce to be palatable?
No kidding, in at least 6 visits the sandwich has ALWAYS been too dry, and store policy is to not put on any additional sauce, but they will sell you about a tablespoon (maybe a nickel&#39;s worth of tzatziki sauce) for $.50! CRAZY!!! On some occasions the server has been so embarrassed when I ask for more sauce on the sandwich that they have slipped me a free sauce, but explained its &#34;one time only, because the restaurant is really serious about charging for this&#34;. Seriously! Free self service refills on drinks, catsup and hot sauce, but the sauce that is distinctive to a Gyros is served too light, and costs extra to make the sandwich taste acceptable. Is it only me? I&#39;ve been here with 4 different friends, every one of them wanted more sauce on their sandwich. You might as well put mayo on it and ruin the flavor than to eat it too dry. Why not add a French Dip sandwich to the menu, and leave out the au jus? If you&#39;re going to choke your customers, might as well go all the way. Too bad, this could be the best Gyros in town if it had enough sauce."

The place is on the street end of a tiny strip center with 3 retail locations, with drive through that requires you drive around back. I decided to eat inside.  The place ia clean and not run down on the inside as the outside might lead one to believe.  

The server asked if I had been there before, and upon learning I hadn&#39;t he was super helpful.   He ran through the small menu and made some suggestions,  explaining it&#39;s family owned with family recipies.  I chose the #1, traditional beef and lamb blend gyro sandwich and a side of Falafel.  Came to $8.91 which I thought was super reasonable. 

The gyro sandwich was a good size. Not too big, not to small.  The meat was not too thin, was very moist and very tasty. They put french fries in their gyro.  I&#39;ve eaten at a few greek restaurants and this was the first time I had seen this.  The server said that in a traditional gyro in Greece, that is how they would do it.   Sure, why not. It also includes tomato, onion (chopped small so it&#39;s not overpowering), and Tzatziki sauce.  The pita was soft and overall the sandwich was very tasty.

The Falafel looked weird.  I&#39;m used to traditional semi-round Falafel balls.  These were flat disks. I&#39;ve seen this shape only once before, at a Vegan restaurant. Those vegan Falafel patties were awful, and the sight of these brought me back to those.  I steadied my palette expecting a similar experience.   Far from it.  The had good flavor,  spiced well and not fried to death. I really enjoyed them.

I enjoyed the food so much I decided not to leave without giving the servers recommendation a spin.  He said the chicken sandwich was his favorite.  It&#39;s exactly like the gyro, but with chicken breast flavored with their &#34;original light lemon marinade.&#34;  I can see why he likes it.  The chicken was moist and delicious. Very flavorful and enjoyable.   

I was sitting there thinking I wish I had saved room for Bakalava.  Then I realized I wasn&#39;t fooling anyone and returned to the counter for a third time for baklava. Probably my favorite Bakalava ever.  It wasn&#39;t over sweet, with a great cinnamon flavor. It was served cold, which is rare.  But that&#39;s how I like it.  The filo was crispy not soggy, the honey they used was light and the piece was dense and delicious. Really the perfect pièce de résistance to highlight a fantastic meal. I should have ordered some to go.

Every employee I dealt with was awesome. The food was fantastic and I can&#39;t wait to come back. I highly recommend you skip the food court next time you&#39;re at the Town Center Mall in Aurora and drive 2 exits South on 225 to East Illif Avenue.  The Exit leads you right to GYROZ, and you&#39;ll be happy you went."

GREEK CHECK
Gyro &amp; Galore CHECK

Hubs had not had his lunch and to this GREEK Fast Food Establishment we went on Sunday March 10th 2013.  We decide to dine in.

Is this the FIRST Gyro establishment that has a DRIVE-Thru??...  Double Like...  

SUPER LATE LUNCH for Hubs.  Time : 1510hrs

Spent $17 for Gyroz, Fries and Drinks.

The service was fast.  The Beef/Lamb Gyroz and Fries came out hot.  The establishment was kept clean.  Hubs said the Fries reminds him of a LOCAL Establishment that He likes.  The fries seems to have a special seasoning other than Salt and Pepper.  Reasonable portion for the pricing.  Hubs like his order, and since its near to where we like to go, WE DO NOT Mind Returning.  I had my leftover food to go, since I was stuffed from a previous event.

I have come here in the past with my family often because of the good food and good service, but today the service via drive thru rubbed me the wrong way.  
As soon as i was told &#34;order when you are ready&#34;, i began my order, pretty normal.  What rubbed me the wrong way was after every item i ordered (i had a pretty large order) i was immediately cut off with &#34;is that all&#34;, and not in a smiling nice way... sounded more like the female employee was annoyed that i was even ordering anything!  After about 7 &#34;is that all&#34;s, i finish my order and pulled up to pay.

I really like having an alternative to eating burgers and fries. The gyro is surprisingly good/fresh, while the fries are usually nice and hot.

I noticed that they put french fries in the gyro, which I thought was a nice addition.

I think it&#39;s a solid A-OK at 3 stars.  The food wasn&#39;t bad by any means, but it didn&#39;t seem vastly superior to say, Renzios, either.  The price for a combo meal is pretty steep at $9 and change after tax, and after trying the bland, unsalted fries I think I&#39;ll save some money and just order and sandwich and a drink (fries come on the sandwich anyway so the cup-o-fries is a bit overkill). The sandwich was big and the amount of meat was generous.  The gyros meat was a bit overcooked (lose a point), but the tzatziki sauce was absolutely delicious (gain a point).  WAAAAY to much raw onion though (lose a point).  I&#39;ll be sure to remember to asked them to avoid that next time.  

Service at the drive through was pretty slow and that seemed due to cook/prep time since I was the only car there, though perhaps there was a lot of dine-in traffic that day.  I&#39;d say the wait time was comparable to Fazoli&#39;s when you order a baked item - maybe 5-8 minutes.

The man taking my order was nice but had such a thick accent that it was difficult to understand him through the speaker.  He also apparently had a hard time hearing me since my sweet tea came out as green tea instead (this was cheerfully fixed).

Bottom line: Gyroz is definitely worth going to if you&#39;re hankering for non-standard fast food fare, but don&#39;t go if you&#39;re in a big hurry.  If I had the time, I&#39;d still rather make the trip to Beirut Grill for fresh pita bread and baba ghanouj or Jerusalem&#39;s for a big plate of Gyros on rice with hummus."

I want a GyroZ in every town. This spot on the outskirts of Denver is a gem anyone passing thru shouldn&#39;t miss. I&#39;m sure the locals hit the spot on the regular because the food is full flavored Greek done like American fast food on steroids. My gyro was tasty and on par with my favorite Greek restaurants in Cali. (Athena &amp; Ylassos) The best part is that they have a drive thru and package everything perfectly for a grubber on the go. But the free wifi, flatscreen TV and numerous clean tables inside make eating on location a treat. 

Don&#39;t be a chump and order a side of hummus or two when you visit. It&#39;s delicious and comes in an easy to-go container that makes hitting the grocery store entirely unnecessary. The gyro meat has such solid flavor that an overload of messy sauces isn&#39;t required. Ask for a side of the taztziki sauce because the crispy fries create a perfect marriage when combined.    

Add to all of this a 10pm close time combined with a drive-thru and I&#39;m jealous of everyone in Aurora. Get some Greek in your life!!!"

We were seated promptly on a Saturday night. There were plenty of people in the restaurant, but it wasn&#39;t packed. The waiter explained the craft drinks and the menu. We were a little slow to order. When you&#39;re catching up with old friends, sometimes the menu gets put aside. The waiter politely reminded us that he was here when we were ready but was not pushy to take our order. 

The drinks were great. I&#39;m not a big drinker but I was interested in their creations and classic drinks. They didn&#39;t disappoint.

The meals were good too. Have a look at the menu, it&#39;s self explanatory. 

The service was great. The waiter was skilled in his trade. He made sure we were taken care of, without interfering with our evening with friends.

After paying the bill, the waiter made a point of thanking us for the gratuity we left him. We weren&#39;t overly generous, just appreciative of good service."

If you want an actual cocktail in Olde Towne Arvada, this is the place to come. They have different themed days with matching drinks which is a lot of fun. I love that they take their time in making the drinks. The food is really good too. 

They have an outside patio that looks like a lot of fun, but I wouldn&#39;t know because it has been full every time I have visited :(  The crowd tends to dress more business casual, but you can where just a t-shirt and jeans if you want. 

The speakeasy upstairs is only open for special events (e.g. swing dancing, bands), and I have never seen the bar up there open. It makes it a little inconvenient when you have to go downstairs to get a drink, and then fight your way back through the crowd to go back up. I have been to some legitimate speakeasy&#39;s, and this is not one of them.  It is basically a stage and a dance floor with a non working bar (maybe this has changed). There is a swing dance group that puts on performances occasionally which is kind of cool, but not worth the cover charge. Oh and speaking of a cover charge....the &#34;swing dance head honcho&#34; thinks he is really cool and charges a cover for only males. 

Overall, the main bar and restaurant are amazing! I would recommend going upstairs once just to check it out, so try and find out when they have events."

We&#39;ve eaten here twice and it&#39;s a cute, quaint little neighborhood tavern that you wouldn&#39;t know was there unless you were looking for it. They have a very small patio for the summer and a small inside dining area that&#39;s dimly lit. First time we grabbed a table and had great service and great food. This last time we stopped in we sat at the bar, and though they got my burger wrong, the bartender was great and made sure it was fixed and took it off the bill. The food selection/menu itself is small so for someone picky like me, it limits my options, but I haven&#39;t had a bad dish yet. Their drinks are good, decent selection, but certainly not cheap. Cute little neighborhood spot to stop in for dinner and drinks but if you&#39;re looking for something cheap, this isn&#39;t your place."

My sister lives down the street from here, and we visit her often. So we&#39;ve been to this place a few times. Each time, it&#39;s been super awesome. From the service, the food and the drinks. 
They have such an awesome selection of whisky...and I LOVE whisky. Especially Japense whisky or scotch. *heart*

The things I recommend: any of their specialty cocktails. This is a speakeasy bar, so everything is hand crafted. 
Anything whisky or scotch. Amazing selection. One of my ultimate favorites: Yamazaki or Hibiki. 

Their pretzel. We came here drunk a couple of years ago...a little too late. They were out and my brother in law was raving about it. 
This time: we actually went here twice on this trip. And holy shit balls, that pretzel is insanely good. It&#39;s seriously the best pretzel I&#39;ve ever had. From the filling to the cheese dip. The bread is so perfectly soft and gooey, just like I love my pretzels. HIGHLY recommened. 

We also had: Pork Belly Tacos. These were super great. Their Sriracha is the thing that makes it soooo good. 
The wings. What makes these so good? They&#39;re grilled. And they&#39;re perfectly spiced. 


Seriously. I can&#39;t get enough of this place. We&#39;ve always had amazing service as well. The look, the feel, everything. I really wish we had a place like this in Vegas. Vegas is missing out tremendously."

Went on a Tuesday night which turned out to be Tiki night. it was pretty busy, but not too noisy and decent turnover on seating/bar stools. Atmosphere was very comfortable and approachable, this would be a good place to have down the street.

Mixed green salad - large portion and good fresh vegetables.

Pork Chop - mustard crusted, comes with cabbage and green beans. good flavor and cooked perfectly. 

Drinks - True old fashioned - was skeptical about the wild turkey rye, but turned out to be very good. They did not overs sweeten and it was a good pour."

Our cups were never empty and she always checked on us.

We ordered the pretzel, pierogi, and pork belly tacos.  The tacos were freakin amazing!  Probably the best tacos I ever had.  I&#39;ve never had pierogis before and it was really good!

I&#39;ve been very fortunate recently to walk into wines bars/ bars and come out really pleased with their food offerings as well. 

Well this place touts itself as a prohibition style kind of place. That&#39;s what our server informed me. Specialty  cocktails made as you wait. On yelp it is a regular bar or a lounge. 

For this visit I skipped their libations and made a mental note to actually go back and enjoy their specialities. Why? Because I had to drive. That&#39;s why! Nosy!:)

I turned to their food menu portion and decided to share with my friend C. We ordered the following:

Cider Brined Pork Tenderloin. Roasted heirloom carrots. Mushroom barley and Bourbon chipotle pear butter. $20.

The Olde Town Burger. 1/3 lbs house ground burger, green chile cream cheese, spicy candied bacon, onion ring, over easy fried egg, served with garlic potato wedges.$14

Both I highly recommend. The meat on the Brined Pork Tenderloin was tender and tasty. Easy to cut and therefore very enjoyable to eat. 

The potato wedges were crunchy and salty and freshly made. The burger patty was seasoned just enough and cooked the way I requested. Medium. 

Our male waiter was very professional but pleasant. Present but non obtrusive. Clean place. Mellow vibe. 

Now I have a bar to stop whenever I visit my friend. Thanks C for introducing me to this gem!"

I came in on a Saturday early evening for my mothers birthday. From the moment we walked in the door, I was shocked to be treated the way that we were. We didn&#39;t have a reservation and we were okay with waiting 30 minutes just like the hostesses said. An hour goes by and I&#39;m still waiting and there were four tables open. When I asked the young girls why we haven&#39;t been seated yet, they said that those tables are reserved for reservations. When I asked when are the reservations, they told me they weren&#39;t for another half hour or more. Are you kidding me?! They were planning on leaving those tables open for HALF AN HOUR when there are plenty of people that have been waiting to be seated for an hour?! What a joke! I&#39;ve been a hostess before for six years! I know how to do the damn job and that is simply not okay! 

The only reason I didn&#39;t speak to management was because I felt bad for these high school girls and their lack of common sense. I&#39;m sure they need that job to pay for their gas to get to school. However, I highly suggest the Arvada Tavern hire someone a little smarter and experienced.

Hubs and I split the pork belly tacos and the Grilled Pear Salad. Both were good but the salad was out of this world! The pork belly, though tasty, was a bit too sweet for me. I find this often happens with pork belly- there&#39;s some common glaze that kitchens just love to throw on it. Anyway, I would definitely order either of those again.
There is no happy hour (sad face), but business is good so I don&#39;t think they need it."

Unfortunately it seems the execution of the dishes doesn&#39;t quite live up to the ambition behind the menu. Food has consistently been just okay; never bad, but not particularly good, either. It usually comes down to a combination of cooking technique and seasoning - pork and chicken have been slightly overcooked, veg either under- or overcooked, sauces and seasoning not quite right. It&#39;s always been perfectly edible but just &#34;off&#34; somehow. That said, I like the atmosphere, they have a decent bar, and the service has always been excellent. I really want to like this place and will probably keep trying periodically, as I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have better experiences in the future."

I wanted a nice sit down meal that wouldn&#39;t break the bank, and after perusing their food menu online, I thought TAT would fit the bill. I ordered the trout piccata ($17) and it was SO good. It came with asparagus and potato croquettes which were equally delicious. My husband ordered the chicken schnitzel ($18) which came on a bed of mashed potatoes and a side of asparagus and was smothered in mushroom red wine gravy. His was also very delicious (I kept sneaking bites). We were both members of the clean plate club, which rarely happens. The portions were large enough to be satisfying, but not so large that they felt overly indulgent. 

We opted for beer and wine with our meals since most of the cocktails looked to be on the sweet side, but I definitely want to come back and try some of their creations. The table next to us ordered 5 or 6 different drinks and they all looked really refreshing and were presented beautifully.

Our very sweet server brought over the dessert menu and I knew I had to try the key lime cheesecake ($8). My husband said he was &#34;too full&#34; for dessert, so I was excited to get dessert all to myself, and perhaps be able to take some home with me. WRONG. The moment I said &#34;Yum!&#34; my husband demolished 1/2 the cheesecake in ONE bite. Needless to say, we finished it, and I did not have anything to take home. If you go here, you need to order the cheesecake. I&#39;m trying to convince my husband to go back tonight for another slice."

They have a rotating list of seasonal specialty cocktails created by their bartenders. Be careful because they drink easily so you could easily go overboard!

We thought the food was amazing as well. I had the grilled cheese dish which came with their version of tomato soup. It certainly enticed the senses! My partner had their classic tavern burger and scarfed it down with glee.

The decor is wonderful, giving you an old-time, nostalgic, speak-easy style feel.

Our server was friendly, knowledgable, outgoing and helpful. I look forward to returning!"

Let&#39;s start: the ambiance is amazing especially for something out in the &#39;burbs. I&#39;m a cocktails/speakeasy kind of gal so when a friend invited me, I immediately yelped it &amp; learned I should be here now. 

We stopped by on a Wednesday afternoon just before the happy hour crowd. It never got too busy while we hung around. 

I ordered my French 75 and went in with high expectations. The drink was your classic 75 (gin, champagne) &amp; pretty decent. Full disclosure-The best one I&#39;ve ever had was at Luke - John Besh&#39;s San Antonio restaurant- and my only hope was that this one wouldn&#39;t be subpar. It pretty much achieved that.

My friend&#39;s a big tequila guy so he asked the bartender to get creative. Now, this place sticks to your standard liquors &amp; didn&#39;t have too many tequila options available. Also, the bartender didn&#39;t seem too interested in going off menu (something you don&#39;t see too often).

I can&#39;t drink for...ahem... legal reasons, but Josh had no problem making the best mocktails I&#39;ve ever had in my life! It was good to feel included.

We ordered the hummus which was the #1 reason we went that evening, it was one of our favorites. Sent it back. The Mac and cheese was another favorite. Had shredded cheese unmelted on top and tasted like melted cream cheese on the noodles. Really disappointed in what has happened to their kitchen. Out of the 4 dishes we ordered only 1 was good."

One of my favorite late night/date/night places to go and to recommend. The speak-easy upstairs is what tops it for me. 

So the break down:
The down stairs is Prohibition themed. The bar and the drinks are uniquely designed to give you the old time romantically sophisticated feel. The food is equally rich with a chef the loves to experiment yet stay classy. Great food!

OK the upstairs in which you enter through an old time phone booth. A long stairwell that leads to an and bar/band area.  Jazzy/blue grass bands play up in this bar area, no food orders and a bit small but such a unique place. The kicker is that they do such a good job of &#34;hiding&#34; the sound you would never know the band was there. You can&#39;t here it downstairs when you are eating and even the windows that seeming lead to the outside never reveal the live band playing. Such a cool and fun experience.

I recommend this place as a date night, girls night endeavor. Sooooooo amazing and what a find. I am so happy it is in an area close to where I live."

The inside seating is great with comfortable booths; small tables outside are perfect for summer nights. Staff is nice and courteous- looking professional without being requiring to wear uniforms and look like clones. Food is great - everything from appetizers to basics to main dishes.
Appetizers are usual American style food - wings, dips, vegetables...
Basics, while seem simple, are a great spin on traditional American dishes- I love their Mac and cheese (I recommend adding bacon and mushrooms).
Main dishes are on the pricier side, but still worth the buck if you are hungry - each offer something unique yet not overwhelming. 
This place is a must try if you are in Arvada Olde Town, highly recommended."

I don&#39;t think I can effectively describe this decor, it&#39;s just exactly what I would expect a place in Olde Town Arvada to look like.  It&#39;s old and traditional.  The menu boasts some fantastic cocktails to match every taste.  We tried a couple, the Sazarac and the Tipparary, you should too.  perfectly balanced and very strong.  For dinner I had the the elk sausage and Jess the grilled cheese (with bacon of course!) and split them.  I had a tough time choosing between bites.  The latter came with the best tomato bisque I&#39;ve ever had.  The service was really friendly too.

I live far from these guys, but will make the trek as often as I can.

There is nothing else around even close to what they provide. The service is out of this world and the staff are incredibly patient, professional, and inviting people.

The food is pretty good too. I&#39;ve had short ribs and the green chili Mac and cheese. The short rib dish I had the first time was good minus an over abundance of pink peppercorns. The Mac and cheese was spot on.

We&#39;d never been in before, and my initial impression of the Tavern was good. The atmosphere of the bar is quite lovely, we were greeted by the hostess immediately and we were able to sit at the bar while waiting for a dinner table to open. I enjoyed my cocktail and the bartenders were helpful and friendly. When our table was ready, we received our text and were shown to our table. 

Unfortunately, the dinner table was EXTREMELY small - tall, round, with 2 bar stools, directly behind the hostess station and front door. Like most women, I brought a purse with me and had no area to keep it aside from my lap or the floor. We had more room seated at the bar. 

We were brought waters and menus, but refused the water so as not to crowd the table. (I was still trying to figure out what to do with my purse and coat.) As I reviewed the menu, I couldn&#39;t help shake my discomfort. The food looked great, but I couldn&#39;t imagine trying to enjoy the meal on a table meant for beers and hot dogs - not $20 entrees and $10 cocktails. 

My husband could sense my discomfort and offered to move on to a different restaurant. I JUMPED at the chance, and we told the waiter we&#39;d decided against dinner. We probably could have asked for a different table but the larger ones in view were all occupied and my anxiety was off the charts - I just wanted out. 

We left and probably won&#39;t be back unless we&#39;re forced. Just not our kind of place I guess. Of course, your mileage may vary depending on your seating needs/preferences."

First impressions: dimly lit and candles, exposed brick walls added to the overall ambiance.  Sinatra crooned in the background, which was a nice touch. 

The wait staff was very attentive, answering all our questions about the menu.  

We ordered the white bean &amp; roasted red pepper hummus for an appetizer, which was very tasteful.  

For dinner we ordered the short rib pasta and chicken schnitzel. 

The artichokes that came with the short rib pasta were amazing. Bursting with flavor. The short rib dish overall was flavorful. The sauce was not heavy, but was rather light to medium bodied.  

The chicken schnitzel was pretty good, the chicken was moist and the breading was crisp. 

As the night went on, the place began to fill up.  The bartenders look to be on top of their game. I also ordered a Czech mule, which was as good as any mule I have had prior, maybe a little better.  

Overall, we loved this place. A bit on the expensive side if you&#39;re looking for a nice casual night out.  (63.00 for appetizer, two drinks and two main dishes) but definitely worth it."

The ambience is still nice for a night out with the live music however, the food has gone downhill from the upscale comfort food that it used to be.

The macaroni we ordered didn&#39;t even have melted cheese on it. It used to be creamy but now it is unmelted shredded yellow cheese.

Atmosphere, music, location, drinks &amp; food were great! It&#39;s got a great underground speakeasy type feel and we walked in to jazz playing overhead. The rest &amp; bar are candlelight and could be romantic although it can get loud. They&#39;ve got an impressive and creative cocktail menu and killer sangria. The brie with cranberries &amp; pears...heavenly. My dining companions both enjoyed their food and the pickiest said it was the best burger ever. 

The downside. Initially our waitress was very attentive and prompt, however by the end of the meal she&#39;d cozied up to a table and spent an inordinate amount of time over there. Enough so that we couldn&#39;t get any ketchup to finish fries, nor the bill or even another round of drinks. Additionally, there was a group of drunks that had been over served and were getting vulgar and loud. We finally made a comment to another server who attempted to quiet them down. It was pseudo successful, but when you&#39;re already on guard during your meal that they guy next to you is going to vomit everywhere...kinda kills the mood."

For the record... What she brought me half way through my finished dinner was NOT a Sloe gin fizz. The first one she brought out was a Ramos gin fizz which I couldn&#39;t drink &amp; was not what I ordered.  The second try at what I ordered they put cream in it... kinda like a Ramos, but clearly not a Sloe gin fizz... And then she progressed into arguing with me that it was just the egg white... she points out to me its &#34;not the &#34;traditional&#34; way its supposed to be made.&#34;  I beg to differ I say &#34;Traditionally all &#34;fizz&#34; drinks have egg white... that&#39;s where they got their name...&#34; I&#39;ve had quite a few Sloe gin fizz in my day...

Date of Visit: 4/27/14

We stumbled upon the Arvada Tavern while staying in the area and looking for a casual but quality dining experience. Upon entering, you get a relaxed, but lively vibe. The decor is very cool, the bartenders are slinging old school prohibition-style cocktails, and the dining area is upscale yet cozy.

Our meal consisted of the Rocky Mountain Oysters appetizer, Grilled Ribeye and Colorado Spiced Trout entrees, and an Apple Struddel dessert. We also enjoyed a few house cocktails and draft beers off of the relatively small, but deep, drink list.

Overall this was the best meal I&#39;ve had to date in the area. Not only was the steak one of my all-time top 2/3, but everything else, from the drinks, to the service, to the overall atmosphere was fantastic.

If you want great food, a cool location, unique cocktails, reasonable prices, and exceptional service, The Arvada Tavern delivers in spades."

The drink list is almost too good, I had a hard time choosing just one (they&#39;re pretty pricy) but the one I ended up with was DELISH. Ordered Rocky Mountain oysters (my first time) and a burger.

Everything on the menu is fantastic here; a menu that includes the best burger in Arvada, pierogies, walleye, schnitzel, Kobe beef short rib, and some of the greatest Colorado microbrews.  The 1920s speakeasy theme is pretty cool too, and the bartenders dress the part very well.

If you&#39;ve lived in Arvada for a long time you may remember the Tavern as the frightening dive bar it was in the late-1990s (I was in my twenties then, and coming in here at that time meant you had balls like church-bells, or a death wish).

Once inside, I realized I was safe, since the Repeal of Prohibition was about 80 years ago.  The staff were outfitted in traditional 1930&#39;s garb; they fit the part.  Tip:  Get a reservation, this place fills up fast (and once you dine here, you&#39;ll understand why).  

Our server welcomed us, explained the history of the building, and offered us craft cocktails.  Craft cocktails are my new obsession, and Arvada Tavern does them well.  I had a Red Lady (gin, strawberry, basil) and a Lady of the Pines (vodka, rosemary, lemon, prosecco, I believe).  Both were modern marvels, and I sipped them with glee.  I never imagined the ingredients coming together so harmoniously.  My husband had a beer, only to realize it was on the warm side (he drank it anyway, because after all, it is still beer).  Our server actually brought it up, explained the problem with their tap, and then offered him a can o&#39; beer (all local).  Without any prompting, he took it off our bill.  

The menu is American with German influence, sure to suit just about any taste.  We split a bowl of Colorado Green Chili.  I make a mean green chili, but this one was right up there competing with mine.  Strong green chili notes with a hint of kick (not overwhelming) that kept us coming back for more.  My husband had the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese with green chili.  He nodded his head several times to indicate that it was quite the &#39;bomb&#39; dish.  I selected the rib-eye with natural jus.  It was cooked just right, seared and lightly bathed in perfectly-salty broth.  Grilled asparagus and tomatoes accompanied, along with nicely garlic&#39;d, roasted potatoes.  

We were too full for dessert, but we can&#39;t wait to bring some friends to this gem of a joint."

The bartender did make me an amazing mix drink that wasn&#39;t on the menu, per my taste, and was great. 
The $26 quail was small and the risotto was unimpressive. 
The $10 pork belly tacos were expensive for dryness. 
The pretzel was amazing! And the waiter took off the poor belly tacos off the bill. 
But overall, spending $150 on two people for no buzz and an empty stomach is not worth a couple of good $12 drinks."

The hubs and I ordered their rotating beer option which was a farmhouse style ale. I do not remember the name but it was awesome. Perfectly fruity with hints of sweet and sour. We really enjoyed it. 

For our app we splurged and got the jalepeno cheese stuffed pretzel. The thing was huge and had a delicious little pool of butter hanging in one of the pretzel folds. I was sad that I had to share this amazing concoction of fatty goodness. 

The hubs and realtor got the burger and fries. I helped eat some of the fries and they were wedges with really nice seasoning. 

I ordered the veggie pierogi with brown butter. It could have used a little more salt but overall the flavors were very good.

I&#39;m extremely impressed with the food, drinks, service, atmosphere, and the space itself. They are doing everything right. 

My boyfriend took me here for date night on a snowy February weeknight. We needed something close by because of the weather. We were both glad we made the trek. 

We sat at the bar and I took much too long picking a drink, because everything on their menu called my name. They do classic cocktails and many of them. We had two menus that differed slightly but the bartender assured us she could make any of them. 

I ordered the Chrysanthemum with Dolin Vermouth, Benedictine, Absinthe rinse and orange. Simple, strong, and herbal. It was perfect for a winter night. I especially enjoyed looking at (and yes, playing with) the multi-sided ice cube. Seriously, how do you even make it with that many sides? It nearly stayed at full size during my entire visit. 

For our late dinner we enjoyed the Potato &amp; Cheese Pierogi and Chicken Schnitzel. A few things struck me: 1. the authenticity of the food. These are not easy dishes, but they were prepared traditionally and exquisitely. 2. the vegetables were allowed to shine. Too many times they take a back seat. However, these were fresh, cooked just enough, and played a main role. 3. that brown butter on the pierogi! I loved soaking up the brown bits with my potato and pasta. 

We had great interactions with the staff, who even offered to show us the upstairs space though they had closed it down for the night. Enter through the telephone booth and you&#39;re transported to a dance hall of a much earlier era. Wood floors, stage, small (but well stocked) bar... I can&#39;t wait to come back for an event. 

I&#39;ll be back soon, and soon after that, so they better get used to having me."

This place takes pride in it&#39;s drinks. Talented, qualified bartenders who will never send the server back to ask what&#39;s in a Tom Collins or a Gimlet. They often feature delicious creations of their own too.
Food is generally very good. We always start with the pretzel stuffed with jalapeno cheese. This is a pretzel LOAF and delicious. Comes with cheese to dip in because, . . . cheese. Other menu items rotate but most are great. Anytime we&#39;ve had issues with how something was prepared they&#39;ve always taken care of it.

It don&#39;t think it really fits into the down-to-earth Olde Town Arvada scene. We went in on a Tuesday night around 5:30pm. No happy hour, no Taco Tuesday deals. Just a bunch of over-priced &#34;tiki Tuesday&#34; drinks and 1-2 food items (maybe $1 off?) that did not sound appetizing to me. They were playing some kind of electronic music and basically no one else was in there. My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup. We each got one beer. The total of our bill was pretty outrageous ($50!) for the lack of portion size. I recommend coming here on a Friday or Saturday night (I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s more fun as some of the other reviews mention) and perhaps sit at the bar for a drink or two; or sit at a table if you&#39;re looking to impress your date and order some overpriced food."

I went on Tiki Tuesday and while I will say the drinks are very tasty (although suspiciously weak for the amount of alcohol they claim to contain), the food was just not good.

I ordered the chicken schnitzel, it was very bland. The mashed potatoes and even the gravy that went with it were flavorless and the asparagus was somewhere between raw and very al dente. My companions ordered the pork chop and house burger and were similarly displeased. We also waited a very long time between ordering and getting our food, despite many empty tables around us.

This is not the quality of food I expect for $27 entrees. The restaurant itself is also very cramped, dark, and extremely loud - things I&#39;ll put up with at a pub or dive bar but not a place that everyone insists is a nice restaurant.

I can only assume that all these glowing reviews are coming from people who don&#39;t go out of Arvada to eat much... there are so many places in the larger area and Denver where you can get good, flavorful food for this kind of money."

Will have to report on that next time. But I really hope that is the case.

One of our daughter&#39;s favorite places. Great list of cocktails-- our group really liked the sweater weather, sazerac, amaretto sour. Hand cut ice cubes. Private room for our group of 10 tonight was really nice as we had a 3 year old and a 6 month old among us. Classy old farm table. Mussels were a favorite. Beer list had some interesting items. Live music on certain weekend nights we were told.

Disliked: Entrees in general were disappointing. Took a long time to get the entrees, while the appetizers came out right away. Bison burgers overcooked. Tavern ribs odd. Pork NY strip had 2 pieces of meat, one done perfectly, the other raw.  New chef has been here 2 days we were told.

Overall: great spot to come for cocktails and appetizers. It might be wise to move on for the main course. Some in our group thought prices were high for quality of the food. 4 star effort, but food shortcomings dropped it one star."

Even the bar staff have big, fuzzy beards, wear vests, and look like they walked out of a Prohibition propaganda ad (except they would be the &#39;bad guys&#39; that made the hooch :) 

I was informed immediately after sitting at the bar that the cocktail menu is constantly changing based on the season and since we are officially in the Summer months, I was able to peruse the Summer Cocktail list. I landed a light yet tart &#39;tail with Breckenridge Vodka, rosemary, I believe lemon, and a lingering Pine flavor. Sounds weird, but tasted oh-so-good.

They even have live music on the weekends and so I am told starting in July - swing dance lessons every Wednesday night. How &#39;bout that? Pretty awesome, I say!"

I had the trout which was not only well cooked, and flavorful, it was accompanied by a wonderfully prepared risotto.  Also had the Hemingway Daiquiri... Nice! The daiquiri part is a little misleading as this is not a sweet drink, it is instead a grapefruit and Lome concoction that becomes more addicting with each sip.

Highly recommended!"

We first experienced There in Telluride, as part of a multi-day dinner and a movie date, driving from Phoenix. 

This time we were in Pueblo, then places west, fly-fishing and hanging out, and had to return to Denver, and saw that they&#39;d opened a restaurant there called &#34;There&#34; again. 

The food at the new There is as good as the older sibling There. The drinks, the service , the quirkiness, the joy of service and being served, it&#39;s all there, well translated for a slightly different audience and locale.

If you want staid service with white linen tablecloths in a dimly-lit European-style bistro, well, adjust your sights, &#39;cause There ain&#39;t that. Instead, think of Spanish tapas colliding full-speed with Western new cuisine, with small plates of delicious bites of this and that, well lubricated by a bar staff with evil delight, delivering tasty drinks you haven&#39;t had before but will try to recreate later. The same will occur with each plate, trying to figure out what is in it so you can step up your game at home. 

It&#39;s a wonderful restaurant and we look forward to our next trip to Colorado because we know, one way or another we will go There. 

We&#39;d like to especially thank Silas, Juan and Joey, who manned the bar and recommended different plates and bites and showed us that they get it. Thank you for a wonderful evening. 

And, Silas and Juan, Jedi and padawan, we expect to see the swords out next time in real battle mid-intersection. Just do it."

I read up on yelp and expected a certain amount of eccentric behavior, especially given the holiday. We came in for dinner around 4pm, before the rush. All of the bartenders and waiters were dressed up, and the ambience was inviting. After ordering drinks, it took a very long time to order. As more and more people arrived, we noticed they were seated, got drinks, ordered food and even got their food before we could order... After an hour since arrival and 3 attempts, we finally flagged someone down and he took our behavior for being impatient, when actually we were starving and felt ignored. When asking for recommendations on what to order, he said &#34;well, everything is good,&#34; in an honest tone. That was encouraging and made us anticipate the food more. 

As a group of 4, we ordered the Kobe tartar tostadas, shiitake steamed buns, soft shell crab steamed buns, elk lettuce wraps, sunflower sprouts, and grilled salmon grain bowl. The apps came out staggered. The elk was dry and the Kobe beef just wasn&#39;t good. I didn&#39;t care for the sunflower sprouts. The flavor of them was just of oil. The steamed buns were the best thing on the menu. The shiitake was especially my favorite. After 30 minutes of receiving the app, we started to think they forgot our salmon grain bowl. At that point, we were running late on our plans for the rest of the evening and were about to call it, but then it came out. It was a generous portion, enough for 3 people to share. Unfortunately, the grain bowl was filled with odd flavors that just did not taste good to us. The salmon and quinoa alone were okay. There was a lot of julienned apples and weird dressing/sauce that made the entire bowl inedible to me. To top it off, during our meal, the employee who took our order was behind me and accidentally threw his cocktail shaker into me while trying to impress a couple at another table. I&#39;m not sure if what happened next was as a result of what happened, or if everyone received it, but they gave us a complimentary dessert of chai ice cream with cheese-An odd combination, but the chai ice cream was good. I had high hopes for There. Overall, I would not come here again to eat since the food and service were underwhelming. After a $160 bill, we left hungry and had to eat again on the way home... Maybe I&#39;d come again- just for drinks and the ambience."

We ordered drinks, fried brussels sprouts, pork buns, lamb ribs?, and a GORGEOUS steak salad. Everything was delicious, if a bit salty. The steak on the salad was perfect. I wish I could have it for lunch everyday.
We were also gifted ice cream, apples, honey, and parm for dessert along with a plug for the ice cream made right next door. It was admittedly some of the best vanilla I&#39;ve ever had.

Our group of five stopped in on Saturday night at 5ish and though we didn&#39;t have a reservation, they were able to accommodate us as long as we could be done before 7.  I could tell right away that it was going to be a good experience because our server was so on top of everything -- menus, silverware, water, popcorn, drink orders -- as soon as we sat down.  And I was right -- it ended up being the most fun dinner! Everything was INCREDIBLE.

Drinks were tasty and strong and how cool is it that they pour and garnish everything at the table??  It was so informal but so different and exciting at the same time.  I loved it!  The menu isn&#39;t the most straightforward on paper but the staff did SUCH a good job explaining it to everyone.  And I really mean everyone because no joke, one of the servers stood on the bar and did a little menu explanation presentation for everyone.  I had no idea what was happening, I just knew I was enjoying the heck out of it.  I guess that&#39;s not standard protocol, they were just short-staffed and figured it was easier to explain to everyone at once but I think they should probably do that from now on :) 

We ordered the rib special -- the ribs were huge and perfectly cooked/glazed, the shredded pork grain bowl, a smattering of small bites and I wasn&#39;t disappointed by a single thing I tasted.  Honestly, the food was pretty killer but the highlight of this night was the staff because they were THE BEST WE&#39;VE EVER HAD.  Not even joking.  They were so fun and lively and managed to take the best care of us despite being short-staffed.  My mom said it was the most fun she&#39;s had at a restaurant in a really long time and I couldn&#39;t agree more!"

We ordered Sashimi Tostados, Kobe Tartar, Lettuce Wraps with Crispy Chicken and with Elk, the Kobe, Steamed Buns with Pork+Pickles and with Shiitake, and a Grain Bowl with Salmon adding an egg.

Everything was yummy, but it was too much food :) so the portion sizes were generous! 

A clear stand out was the Kobe. It comes on a huge bed of lettuce. I think this was a special so I hope it makes it to the regular menu! 

This was my husband&#39;s first time trying Elk, and he likes it!

The Grain Bowl was interesting, it reminded me of a high-end BeBimBap. This is probably enough for a meal in itself.

We could have skipped the Sashimi Tostados, but only because everything else was so amazing.

The vibe is high energy, and the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.

Other standouts:  soft shell crab steamed bun, miso glazed eggplant, salmon belly tostada, the crispy brussel sprouts and another drink, &#34;The Jalepano Kiss&#34; - so perfect. I stayed on the side of the menu that had more tapas style offerings but the &#34;shareable&#34; side of the menu offered so much more.

With a standing chef&#39;s table, a community table anchored by two tree branches, and a &#34;secret wall&#34; behind the map of the world, &#34;there&#34; is so incredibly and thoughtfully designed.

It&#39;s definitely a bit quirky but in a fun way. It felt like a hipster sort of place but I was open to something different. There was an extensive and interesting drink list and a decent selection of beers. I think our table - four of us - were put off by the aggressive nature of one of the servers in a high pressure / quick decision sort of way. That was a collective observation. 

The food, which was the chicken bowl, was good with no complaints but as another reviewer mentioned, the bizarre service and environment really overshadowed the food and resulted in a mediocre experience."

Elsewhere.

We were excited for this new opening in our neighborhood, but boy, what a disappointment.

I was conflicted on how to write this review. The food was actually quite good but the entire experience was overshadowed by the bizarre, sometimes rude and totally disappointing service.

Our four top was shuffled between three servers the entire visit and two of them were awful. 

We appreciate a few well timed jokes but serving tables isn&#39;t a standup routine and sometimes when you ask a question (like what&#39;s in my drink) you actually really want an answer not a smartass quip and then walking away.

As the place filled up and got busier the service and delivery was quickly overwhelmed. The final straw was when we asked about what seemed to be a missing plate from our order. We simply asked that if it hadn&#39;t made it to the line yet we would just cancel that plate and take the bill. The server returned, literally threw plates on our table tossed down the plate and walked away. Totally rude, unnecessary and uncalled for.

This would be a one star review but the fact that most of the food was above average brings them up another star."

Another thing I love about There is there&#39;s a fun, eclectic sort of atmosphere that the owners and staff bring to the place. You always leave laughing about something truly memorable that happened throughout the course of the night, because the place really does have an &#34;all are welcome&#34; kind of vibe to it. One night you may go in and see rugged (but friendly) bikers hanging out, another night you may go in and see a wedding party that just rolled in having a great time with the bartenders and staff.

So we set off walking to Stones... closed. Avanti... closed. Root down... too expensive for a snack. I had wanting to try There, so that was it. 

They have a cartoon menu for light eating, and we ordered several soft corn tacos of differing type, some fried Brussels sprouts, and a skewer of pork belly. I had a good albarino (good pour) to drink. 

The sprouts (we dipped them in sriracha) were light and crisp, perfect really. My trout apple and salmon caviar taco was amazing. The obvious fruit for this is mango, but apple was perfect for the smoked trout. The pork belly was nice. Really restrained seasoning, but a little dry. To be fair, it was not particularly fatty and it was grilled, so that could be expected. 

The idea, a restaurant serving small plates till 1 a.m. (some amazing large plates too, like a two pound bison prime rib!) Is good, the food is well executed and well priced,  the décor is appealing, and the energy is high. You can tell the owners are proud of their work."

We discovered There when we were in Telluride a couple of years ago and thought it was right on the edge of 5 stars. Well Oren and his crew of really hard workin&#39; professionals have kicked things up a notch and Denver&#39;s incarnation (by the same guys who worked at Nobu&#39;s in NYC for years) have created a true thing of beauty in a Western post-modern industrial setting at the Lumina building. (Check out the pix below).

Last night things started off with my honey having the same reaction as when she took a sip of her drink in Telluride: &#34;Damn. THIS is the best drink I&#39;ve ever had!&#34; Me? I&#39;m usually a beer or wine guy, but I saw a drink where they serve up your choice of hard liquor and they top it off with the jelly or jam of your choice. I chose tequila &#39;cause I hear it&#39;s really good for you (;-) and topped it off with red pepper jelly &#39;cause I like my drinks on the aggressive side when I do indulge. It was absurdly delicious . . . so I had another. Something I don&#39;t usually do with hard liquor drinks.

Thereafter followed a couldn&#39;t-have-been-better dinner. 

First thing you should do, start with the fried Brussels sprouts leaves. I know. I know. I know. Everyone&#39;s serving them these days. But they&#39;re not serving them like There is. Get them and taste the difference (and just ask for em  &#39;cause they&#39;re not on the menu). Then have one of their buns. We had the soft shelled crab and the shitake and they were both spectacular. We then had the shrimp kushiyakis (skewers) which are grilled and served with a curried (?) cream cheese and pickled ginger finish. Sounds a bit weird, but they were so good they shook our world. Our main that we split was a really unusual and unusually delicious quail dish the likes of which I&#39;ve never seen. Finished off with a savory/sweet dessert of apple slices, honey-drizzled Parmigiano cheese and ice cream (yes you read that right) that served up the perfect ending to a really different and special meal. Every bite was a taste treat. As was the entire night. So if you&#39;re looking for something out on the edge somewhere between WOW and OMFG, go There. Now. And the odds are you&#39;ll be seeing us There too.

The blueberry jam cocktail was delicious, and the popcorn was good too! Didn&#39;t have any food - we left to find somewhere a little more mellow.

We called ahead not sure if it would be busy or not and came to find the place was not very busy at all and we were offered a bar seat, but we declined so that I could catch up with my girlfriend...

My experience:
The waitress we initially had, which I assume she is also a bartender as well was very helpful in explaining the drinks and the menu. The only thing that turned us off was how presumptuous she was when she said, &#34; so let me know which large plates you would like to order first and then we can discuss the small plates you would like as well&#34;. Not a big deal, but just threw us off. We order drinks and also a sampling of the 4 buns and the 4 lettuce wraps they offer.

The initial waiter who took our drink order was also very presumptuous now looking back in stating,   &#34;why don&#39;t you guys look over the drink menus first, pick something out and then we can discuss the food&#34;. Just very odd way of presenting the menus.

The drinks:
I ordered the $11 Diablo that had a nice spice to it and my special lady had the Grapefruit. Both were good tasting drinks, nothing extraordinary, and certainly not $11 worthy.

The food: The wraps were a decent size, nothing too large or too small. Pay attention to the (*) on the menu. It indicates the cost is an extra $2 on top of the listed menu price. Also kind of an odd way to set up a menu.
The buns, which was the main reason for coming were such a let down. Ranked best to worst are the crab, the shiitake, pork, and the duck. For the money I&#39;d rather head to Uncle or Linger right down the road for something more filling and better tasting, despite the cost difference.

The final straw: The waiter brought us over the bill, on a receipt, I noted the upcharge for the crab items. I tossed my card and he swiped it on a tablet and then brought over the tablet for me to sign. As he handed me the tablet he stated, &#34;Just go ahead an put your tip in at the top and then sign at the bottom.&#34; This really threw me off. First of all, who doesn&#39;t know how a tip works, I don&#39;t need to be reminded. Secondly, why are you assuming I want to leave a tip. Tipping is a choice, last time I checked. I also like that it gave suggested tips starting at 17%. I normally leave 20%, but I just think it&#39;s so odd to give a suggested tip amount starting at 17%. I did tip, but just very odd.

I have been lucky enough to visit the original restaurant in Telluride, so when I saw THERE was coming to Denver, I knew I had to go ASAP. Lucky for my, one of my best friends conveniently timed her birthday to basically coincide with the opening. I made reservations lickety-split. 

We knew what kind of night we were in for, and uber-ed our way there. It&#39;s a block or two over from Root Down and has an unassuming entrance. You&#39;re not lost, you&#39;re THERE! We entered and were immediately greeted warmly by Simon. We were offered a seat at a charming wooden high top table (very similar interior to the original restaurant), which has hooks underneath for your coats/handbags. Drink menus, menus, library list (more cocktails), water bottle and glasses,  and a bag of savory delicious popcorn were placed in front of us. We were told upon seating that we would move to the bar as soon as seats opened up. We began snacking on the popcorn and perusing the drink menus. Seats at the bar opened up quickly, so one of the many handsome and friendly servers helped us move over. 

And THERE we sat for the next 4 hours or so. We consumed pisco sours, jam drinks (choice of blueberry, pumpkin, and red pepper), and the bitter mango. These drinks are STRONG and delicious. Jam drinks have been a favorite of mine (simple syrup, lime juice, choice of spirit, and a generous spoonful of your choice of jams). Food: flash fried brussel sprouts (so good! also not on the menu, but always available), miso eggplant served with celery, red cabbage and jicama salad (OMG), the eggplant grain bowl (roasted eggplant, pickled cucumbers and red cabbage, and umm... did you see how many drinks I had? served over fluffy rice with an over easy egg. We also ordered two small bites (the pork and pickle bun, with the soft pillowy chinese style steamed bun and the tender-est pork I&#39;ve ever had) and the roasted beet and mushroom tostada. All of it was delicious and moan-worthy. Service was attentive, friendly, and spot on. Did I mention that all the servers are attractive too? They were all so cheery, helpful, and seemed genuinely interested in whether we were enjoying ourselves.

TL;DR: Go THERE now. Be charmed by the industrial x rustic decor and the friendly service. Get drinks. Get the brussel sprouts. Get whatever catches your eye. You won&#39;t regret it. 

Extra tip: make reservations b/c this place is going to be (if not already) the hot spot in town. Gotta love a spot that takes reservations."

I had the Grapefruit and the New Years Eve cocktail, both were wonderful although the Grapefruit was my favorite. For dinner I had the crab ceviche, the softshell crab and the date and feta. All were just what I was hoping for and between the popcorn, fried brussel sprouts (not on the menu but ask for them anyway), and the three bites I was stuffed.

I popped in by myself around 5:30 on Friday and had no problem getting a seat however, the place was packed by 6:20. If you are a party of one, risk it and try for a seat at the bar. Any more than one, call ahead for a reservation just in case."

The hubs and I hopped in here around 11 last night looking for late night food and booze-long past when other places would have given us the side eye for even thinking we could get nibbles past 10. They sat us at the bar right away with their signature popcorn. 

We were lucky enough to have Owen taking care of us for the night and he is just lovely. From explaining the menu to giving us his reccos, and chatting about our mutual love/hate relationship with NYC, he kept the us not only well fed, but entertained even with a bar full of other guests.

For the bites-get the freaking pork and pickle bun. I know you see all these people saying go soft shell crab-don&#39;t do it. Your going to stuff this delicious bite of savory, briney goodness in your mouth and wish all pork products tasted this perfect. Also-get whatever is the share for the day. We had a fried quail with Mac and cheese and cherries-I meeeaaaaannn.

The kicker was that they do close at 1:00 am, but when I lost track of time and wanted to order a drink at 1:04, Owen practically insisted that we stay for one more round.

I say this knowing it makes me sound like a giant douche but whatevs-after living in NYC for the past 8 years, I would put this against any casual bar in the city and THERE would win every time on service, food and value.

Straight away from entering we were greeted with the friendliest and energetic service throughout the night. The staff seemed happy and enjoyed working there listening to some 90&#39;s hiphop throwbacks! We loved the energy and vibes. It was a quiet late Thursday night but they start you off with some complimentary popcorn in these cute little bags. They have an interesting range of different bites/tapas from asian to mexican to american. Most menu items are meant to be individual bites or shared between 1-2 people, a few of the larger plates can be 3-4 people depending how much you order. I loved the shrimp and pork belly skewers, crispy duck bun, crispy chicken lettuce wrap, and the kobe steak on the bed of greens. The cocktails were tasty and served tableside. The pineapple coconut was delicious! 

Pro-tip ask them what the &#34;Italian Food&#34; for the night is. I know you&#39;re probably confused but it&#39;s basically code for secret happy hour drinks. The first patron of the night that asks what it is gets to pick the drink of choice that will be the &#34;Italian food&#34; and its basically the discounted drink for the evening and when its late night, they do 3 Italian foods (something like that, don&#39;t quote me..just ask them for the italian food!) Since it was just the 4 of us in the restaurant late, 3 of our drinks were Italian foods/discounted! We were visiting from out of town but should we find ourselves in Denver again we will be back. Excellent service, thank you so much for making us feel so welcomed and taking good care of us."

Then, after being there for a half hour and eating munchables leading up to our meal, we sat there for 30 minutes watching our friend eat her main course while we sat with no food.  Our meal never came.  When we were finally able to flag someone to come over, they said they were out of the dish we ordered and would need 25 minutes more to make an alternate meal.  Not only that, we got approached not by the waiter, who took our order . . . we were approached by him, the bartender and the owner separately all asking &#34;naively&#34; how were we enjoying our meal and experience.  The owner proceeded to blame his new wait staff in training for the mix up.  The wait staff wasn&#39;t the problem.  He was.  It was weird since they all spoke before coming to our table, so knew what was up.  I worked at Gramercy Tavern for a short time after culinary school, where they wrote the book on Enlightened Hospitality.  This place (or the owner) needs to read the book.

The Kobe was fine. The quail was battered and deep fried, over cooked. The music was ridiculously loud, we had to ask them to turn it down. And the bill was outrageous- $200 for 4 people. Oh and the popcorn was stale. I wouldn&#39;t have focused so much on the negative, except my experience was SO out of like with expectations for a 5-star place.

Apparently this is the second outpost of a place in Telluride with plans to expand further.  If I were rating this based on the Brussels sprouts alone, this would be 5 out of 5 stars.  Mind blowing.  However, I am not, and I think they have some work to do before going wild expanding all over the globe.

The prices were a bit steep on the food for portion size and the Pineapple Coconut drink I got was super disappointing - it kind of tasted like Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion smells - fakey tasting pineapple and coconut flavored instead of the real deal and the garnish of fresh coconut and cinnamon was pretty miserly, which could have helped the drink out quite a bit in larger quantity. The $4 bites or whatever they called them were literally bites of food, so if you have an appetite like me, it&#39;s going to cost you $16 for a small snack.  My lettuce wrap was the size of a sand dollar and contained maybe 1.25oz of fried chicken.  I&#39;m pretty sure it would cost $50+ to completely feed a normal human at this rate.  My bill was $32 for a drink I could not stomach finishing and four (very small) bites during happy hour time frame, which is pretty darn expensive for being off the beaten path in a semi-gentrified part of Denver.  Also, there were only five other people in here 6-7pm.

Finally, some of he food was inventive in a good way and some of it was inventive in a not so good way.  Having lived in NY, Chicago and now San Francisco with a generous food budget and a checklist of Michelin starred restaurants, I think I&#39;m fairly qualified at identifying truly delicious unique fare vs overly inventive food for the sake of being creative.  Some of the items here missed the mark.  Also, all the cocktails made out of jam are weird - why would I pay for alcohol with jam?  So weird, it&#39;s like some kind of broke college kids drink.

In summary, I think this place has an identity crisis.  I&#39;ll be back for the sprouts as an appetizer then walk to one of the other fabulous restaurants in LoHi.

Also, why no happy hour specials if any sort?!"

Run don&#39;t walk before you can&#39;t get a reservation anymore. We took two out of town guest here after dining at the Telluride location the previous weekend. We were absolutely blown away at the Telluride location but think the Denver spot may be a smidge better!

Our table of 4 was blown away by the delicious flavor profile of each &amp; every dish, all different and stood up on their own. We opted for 3 shareables, 3 buns (Soft shell crab &amp; pork and pickles, just order them don&#39;t ask questions), 1 crab ceviche lettuce wrap (UH-MAZING), half order of brussels, and prawn skewers. We couldn&#39;t figure out which dish was our favorite because they were all phenomenal. The shareables we had were the Wagyu beef with potato strings and carmelized onions (nothing was left on the plate when we were finished), a cod dish with a delicious sauce/broth with perfectly cooked pork belly &amp; potatoes and finally the ribs with the most delicious onion rings, peaches, and base of slaw. Would&#39;ve been happy to post pics of the dishes but we couldn&#39;t control ourselves and devoured every single morsel.

The cocktails were excellent too...check out the New Year&#39;s Eve and this amazing whiskey drink on the black drink list, probably drank too many to remember the name.

I am shocked at some of the reviews about the service. We experienced excellent service by multiple servers who seemed just as excited as we were about the dishes. They were always happy to explain the dishes and help guide us through the menu. Yes, this isn&#39;t going to be your traditional stuffy dining experience. It&#39;s a fun atmosphere with outstanding food and staff that seem to love to be there too. I&#39;m happy to say it was one of the best meals I&#39;ve had since I&#39;ve moved to Denver."

For our main course, we got the Kobe shareable (very healthy portion...more than enough for 2 to share...and most importantly, very tender.) Haha and yes, this was just for me and my fiancé. Everything was delicious! We also complimented our meal with a few of their signature drinks: Red pepper jam jelly with spirit of choice (we chose gin), spiced apple shaken, and pisco sour.

Located in the Highlands it has a unmistakeable hipster vibe with attentive, yet intense service. It was busy on the night we were there so we sat at the bar. Its the kind of place where the bartender tells you not to look at the menu and starts quizzing you as though you were doing math flashcards about what kind of drinks and flavors you like and then decides for you, and let me say the drinks were absolutely delicious. Then as you order food at the bar they literally just yell it back to the kitchen and the kitchen yells back to confirm they heard it. It is an efficient system that you can&#39;t help but watch, though I must admit it makes sustaining a conversation amongst your dining partners a little difficult.

The menu is very interesting and has some small plates, medium plates, and then larger entree bowls - not to mention their delicious popcorn you can snack on while you wait to order. It is a creative menu with rotating items and the servers help walk you through the different sizes, combinations, and ordering process. While the small and medium plates were just that (small sizes) and standard, the bowl was very large and delicious so I would highly recommend ordering a bowl (maybe even to split) and you can add your own protein option based on their selection that day. When we were there we got a free desert plate as well which was tasty and a nice touch. 

Though the prices seem reasonable on the menu, do be aware that as you order more and more small, medium, and large plates it can start to add up and get a little pricey. Also, given the staggered order style it takes quite a while to get all your food - all in all I think we were there for 2+ hours for dinner so just plan on making it an event and call ahead for a reservation if possible so you can get seated at a table."

It doesn&#39;t look very big from the outside it sprawls a little bit once you walk through the door. You will see all kinds of people there depending on what time of day or day of the week you go.
On fight nights it can get pretty packed in there pretty early so if you&#39;re going to watch UFC, get there early or be prepared to stand.
The food is solid bar fare. I&#39;m a fan of the green chili. I order if often with just a tortilla and I&#39;m happy. They have taco Tuesday and daily specials.
As of late Jeff and I have been heading for breakfast on Sunday mornings. I like their breakfast burritos and the breakfast sandwich. They have $2 bloody Mary&#39;s and screwdrivers as well. SWEET! They supply a well stock bloody mary bar too.

And $2 bloody Mary&#39;s and screwdrivers at breakfast.

The patio here is huge, it&#39;s probably my favorite part of the bar.  They offer trivia, kareoke, and dancing at different nights of the week.  Now that I live nearby I come here often again.  It&#39;s really a great bar all around.

Cheers!"

Like most with low ratings we sat for 20 minutes with no service, when I went to the bar to get our drinks it didn&#39;t seem to bother the bartender a bit. When we decided to leave she finally asked if anyone had come to talk to us. 5:00 on a Saturday with the bar half full is a weird time to not get service, especially when 3 servers walked right by us. But talking about how wasted they got last night was definitely more important. I don&#39;t know why we keep trying with this place."

I was meeting clients at Firing Line and we were looking for a place to meet and have lunch before we went shooting. I had never seen the place and passed it a few times trying to locate it. Looked like a dive bar so I played it safe and got a burger. The reviews were not wrong. Great food. The onion rings are hand made and huge. Breaded and fried to perfection. 

Went back this weekend when going back to the range. Range was packed so decided to just hang out at Scooters and called a couple other friends. They had a great Bloody Mary and to boot it was a special and only $2. We shot pool and had the sampler then eventually ordered lunch. Ended up being a 3 hour catch up session with my long term friends. The 4 of us agreed the food was great and we would all go back.

No longer scared that the food is not going to live up to expectations. I am thinking about going today and getting the chicken fried steak and eggs. Good job Scooters!

Ok not thinking about it leaving in a few!"

I was asking what time the kitchen closed, and she was like, um, in four minutes, In a way that clearly meant &#34;I wish I could say it was closed&#34; blink blink. I only wanted chips, but I said never mind
 Fast forward ten minutes. She&#39;s walking around eating chicken wings. Literally came to get our orders, eating a wing. I was so disgusted. As I&#39;m ordering a drink she is licking  the sauce off her fingers . I ask, can you please wash your hands before you make my drink? She rolls her eyes, glares, says no, goes washes her hands, then makes me the smallest &#34;double&#34; I have ever seen, and I work in a bar. Throws it on the table, and says &#34;I hate you guys&#34;.

I avoided her for the rest of the night. Needless to say, I will return but will ask for a different server. And, I will never be able to order food there after watching her luck her fingers. Gross"

8:08 pm. She yelled at the bartender to bring us menus, and he did.

8:44 pm. Back to the bar for another round, waitress still has not come back to take an order.

All their food is 5 STAR pub fare with daily specials and inexpensive single items ($1.50 tacos, burritos, enchiladas etc on TUE) Breakfast all day, order the chicken fried chicken or steak to be blown away!!!

Drinks are averagely priced and they have some pretty good specialty shots and mixed drinks. Bringing a lady who wants a &#34;girlie drink&#34;, but doesn&#39;t know what she wants is NO PROBLEM!! The bartenders know how to please. Recommend their Apricot blonde on tap for the beer drinker and try the Moscow Mule for the cocktail connoisseur.

Always good entertainment in any given night. Free poker, karaoke, live DJ, good pool competition &#34;chalkboard challenge style&#34;. Great patio for smokers with a heater in the winter and live bands in the summer.

Food: Scooters homemade salsa and guacamole is shockingly good. Furthermore, their xtra hot buffalo wings achieved the PERFECT marriage between pain and pleasure, always attempted, rarely attained. This is probably the first place I&#39;ve been to in the Denver metro area that actually means it when they say &#34;extremely spicey&#34;. 

Drinks: Plenty of good beer and drinks. Beers are served in huge glasses. Scooters also specializes in variations on the classic Moscow Mule, replete with copper mug. 

Staff: Staff were extremely friendly, very enjoyable. 

Music: If you like loud and abusive tunes, this is your place. Play Metallica and they will come. 

Other: Flat screens adorn the entire bar and restaurant, every conceivable sporting event is covered. Meal and drink deals make this place criminally cheap! Pool tables, dart boards and arcades kept in very good shape."

You aren&#39;t going to go to Scooter&#39;s to have a white table cloth experience, but if you&#39;re looking for a great sports bar, Scooter&#39;s is the place. I&#39;ve frequented Scooter&#39;s for many big sporting events (Superbowls, Broncos&#39; games, UFC, etc) and have always had a good experience with the crowd and the service. The servers and bartenders are very attentive and quick to grab you another drink--even at the busiest times. The crowd is the typical type you&#39;d expect in an Aurora bar: Bikers, blue collar, sports enthusiasts.

The food is what makes Scooter&#39;s really special. This place goes far beyond your deep fried frozen, pre-cooked fare. The chefs here cook up a mean breakfast (huevos rancheros and breakfast burritos.. yum)and their green chili will absolutely knock your socks off. I&#39;m very picky about my wings and these. are. amazing. Scooter&#39;s wings are saucy and spicy and have that great crispy outside without being dry on the inside. Honey hot and hot buffalo are my personal favorites, but they have several different flavors to choose from.

All in all, a solid sports bar. They have great weekly and annual events--angrybirds jenga, horseshoes, poker, and a classic car show to name a few. It&#39;s worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area and are looking for an unpretentious place to grab a drink and down some grub."

I really dug this place and am looking forward to going back!  When I walked in, I saw poker tables!  I asked a waitress about it and she said poker is every Tuesday and Saturday.  Sign up is at 6:30 and it&#39;s FREE!

The bartender, I think his name was Brian, was AWESOME!  I couldn&#39;t decide what I wanted to drink so I asked him to make me a fu-fu girlie drink and he delivered!  It was called a scorpion tail.  I don&#39;t remember what was in it, but it was freakin&#39; delicious!  Later on, I did the same thing.  This time he made me a key lime martini.  Wow!  If you go to this bar, unsure of what you want to drink, have faith in the bartender!  He knows his stuff!

Scooters also serves food until midnight.  They serve breakfast all day and have breakfast specials with screwdrivers and bloody marys.  Their dinner menu is great!  I had a hard time choosing what I wanted.  My boyfriend and I split a buffalo chicken sandwich.  It was really tasty!  The food here is definitely high quality bar food!

Besides the poker, for entertainment they have multiple flat screen TVs with different spots events going on, there is a shuffle board table, golden tee golf (yay!) and pool.

There was something alluring about it that made me want to stop here for ages.  And tonight was the night!  After a rough night at work, I decided to treat my sister to a few drinks to let off some steam, so we headed over to Scooters.

As we walked in, I was immediately taken aback by the fact that I was stepping into a small town bar:  I could see the amalgam of several home town bars from Wisconsin.  It&#39;s eerily close!  Our first decision, apart from what beer to choose, was where to sit?  As you walk in, you&#39;ve got a choice:  left bar or right bar.  The right bar, clearly the main bar, was hopping, so we chose the smaller left bar.  

After sitting down and ordering a few beers, we were instantly chatted up by another patron.  He was boisterous and friendly, clearly a regular.  And exactly the warm welcome you&#39;d expect from a small town watering hole.  As we had a few beers and tried the deliciously greasy chilly cheese fries, we had a great conversation and slowly got to know Scooters.

Looking forward to going back, playing a game of pool, sampling more of the menu, and experiencing this place again!

I heard it was ghetto, dirty, and a terrible crowd hung around there. So I made it a point to never ever set foot in there.

Then a few of my boyfriends&#39; friends were going there, and invited us to join them. I gave it a shot, comforted in the fact that my boyfriend is military and would be aware of any bad situations.

You know, maybe it was just because it was a Tuesday night, but it wasn&#39;t bad at all. There weren&#39;t a ton of people there, and they were having Taco Tuesday so you could get tacos for a dollar. The beef tacos were surprisingly good. 

I like how there are multiple seating areas, so if it is too crowded in one area, you have other options. 

So overall, I am giving this one a chance. Now, who knows what it is like on a Friday or Saturday night, but I am willing to give it a try."

I&#39;ve been there 4-5 times, now, and the atomsphere has always been friendly and laid back, which goes a long way in my eyes. 

It&#39;s missing something... I&#39;m not sure what, but it rises to the top of selection around the area, that&#39;s for sure."

I love to go in the afternoon when the place is quiet and not so full off drinkers. The food is amazing...Steaks, burgers, burritos. This place has it all. Got a sports game you want to see? Odds are they will be showing it or will be more than happy to put it on one of their many flat screens. They have 2 bars so if one gets crowded, you hit up the other and it is almost like being in a different place. They have a ginormous patio with ample seating and a great cover so you don&#39;t get snowed or rained on. 
I can&#39;t say enough about the yummy food, really, it is delicious! Family owned and operated, great service, great fun. 
Pool tables, shuffleboard, and video games. no darts but who really wants to put pointy projectiles in the hands of drunks? They also have a dance floor for Friday nights and a DJ. You have to try one of their breakfast burritos, they serve them all day, you can get one as long as the kitchen is open. Lunch is excellent and they have a different special every day."

That said this location is my closest Schlotzkys to home so I have eaten here quite a few time over the last 15+ years....

SADLY,  I would strongly suggest driving  anywhere else than this site - it&#39;s TERRIBLE.  If you have never been to a good Schlotzkys.  You have no clue how bad this site is, or how truly good the brand can really be. This site is a joke.

I do not understand how corporate can let a franchiser like this  destroy a great brand.   Their franchise license needs to be stripped. 

1. The site has serious cleanliness deficiencies and has not performed even the basics as far as cleaning or site maintenance. Total sticky worn out train wreck...surprised the county has not shut them down. And don&#39;t use the bathrooms.

2. Their business has diminished to the point (self inflicted) that they never have all of the menu items available.  Obviously they are trying to save money at the customers expense.

3.  They must not be baking their bread as fresh (as often) as they should be.  Over my last three visits I have always received -sort of a chewy stale dry bread.   Not crispy crunchity on the outside and fresh soft on the inside as it should be...   Just basically stale.    I would not be surprised if it was baked the day before. ( or even 2++days before)

4.  The sandwiches don&#39;t taste as fresh as other locations and there is no doubt in my mind that they &#34;stretch&#34; the line dates (expiration dates) on their meats and cheeses.    This happens a lot at low volume locations of many different brands of sandwich shops.  If you want fresh, hit the busy sites as they turn their inventory very fast.   Slow sites like this your basically eating old rotten food.  

5.  They simply skimp on everything. Other sites serve huge mouth watering fresh sandwiches. This site skimps on everything.   The sandwiches are almost an inch shorter than other sites..  Partially because the bread is shrunken and stale, but also less meats, tomatoes, onions, cheeses, spreads. Etc.

6.  Yes Schlotzkys is a bit expensive,  this is easily overlooked at their better sites. There you get a perception of quality and value and a premium experience. ..  Sort In a way, like a luxury item, expensive but worth it.  THIS LOCATION just leaves you feeling like it was all a rip-off. And you just way over spent on something that you likely won&#39;t even want to really eat. 

Schlotzkys corporate really needs to send in a couple secret shoppers to review the food and cleanliness of this location.    I am still (barely) a loyal &#34;fanboy&#34; of Schlotzkys.  But I am starting to find myself torn. If there is another premium sandwich shop in close proximity I am starting to choose them.   Brands such as  Firehouse subs,  or Potbelly subs, or even Quiznos instead... Simply because this one site has ruined the taste and value of Schlotzkys  for me.

FIX IT before it&#39;s too late,  or just simply shut this site down.  (I would prefer it gets fixed , as its close for me."

Sandwich is great.  My son and I cansplit the large original for a meal, it&#39;s huge.   The sides amdgetting smaller and the prices are very high.  $5 for a small side cup of soup, $4 for a partially filled container of potato salad, maybe 3-4 bites,it&#39;s just overpriced.  The guy in front of us in line felt the same and got a refund once he saw the size.  Funny the guy manning the intercom for the drive-thru says when the lady in her car asks for the meal deal combo.  The guys says no deal just meals, same price!  Wow, kinda rude but still.  Sandwich and drinks a good lunch, the sides are really price gouging.  This particular location is fairly neglected as well.  Bathrooms have bags over broken fixtures, trim falling off building etc.  looks to be on it&#39;s way out of business,,sad."

But I&#39;m starting to think this one is ALSO on its way to closing its doors like the other Aurora location. You can see the signs everywhere. The urinal in the bathroom has a sign hanging over it that says &#34;out of order.&#34; The bathroom is also filthy, and neither of the soap dispensers have any soap in them. The lobby is in disarray with dirty tables everywhere - even though there are no other customers in the store. There is a three or four-year-old little girl, obviously one of the employees daughters, wiping the tables and chairs with a dirty rag in order to keep herself occupied while her mother babysits and makes your sandwiches at the same time. The ice dispenser on the soda machine is broken, so the solution is a bucket of ice with a scoop laying IN the ice that has been touched by God knows how many hands! DISGUSTING. The male employee that took my order had the personality of a doorknob. Obviously not interested in serving the customer. I was clearly an inconvenience to him, as I interrupted his conversation with the babysitting mother when I walked in. All of the hot sauce bottles are half empty with crusted hot sauce all over the tops. I will not be back to this Schlotzsky&#39;s, and I am pretty confident that it won&#39;t be open for business much longer anyway. Save yourself the disappointment and go get lunch somewhere else."

There are precious few Schlotzsky&#39;s left in the Denver metro area, I&#39;m unclear on why that is.  Maybe my own experience will be informative.  I ordered the medium sized Original, chips and a drink.  The price was about what one would expect to pay these days for such a meal - less than ten dollars.  Those of you who have never been to a Schlotzsky&#39;s before, the Original is a type of deli sandwich with ham and salami as the base meats then they add all the fixings like tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese and black olives.  The standout feature of Schlotzsky&#39;s to me is the bread.  The sandwich bread is fresh and is designed in rounds with a glazed crust.  They give you a table number and deliver the sandwich when ready.  A pickle is offered as a freebie and they have a special hot sauce made by the brand.  The hot sauce is like a mild version of Cholula and the free pickles are great.  

Where I get derailed with Schlotzsky&#39;s is that I feel like I&#39;m carbo-loading without that being my specific intent.  For years my experience has been the same, the taste is good and the meal appears to be a good value, but several hours later I&#39;m REALLY hungry again, telling me that somehow the presentation is hiding a lack of actual caloric content.  I&#39;ll probably continue to eat at Schlotzsky&#39;s periodically, I just can&#39;t make it a regular thing and perhaps others have discerned what I have, hence the lack of franchise presence when once it was bountiful, much like I wish their sandwiches were.  Sorry, there are just too many other sandwich places with too many options."

This is one of those rare times where the people and the food earned 5 stars.

So we walked in and were greeted by this funny guy (Peter) from New York.  My girlfriend mentioned that we didn&#39;t get pickles last time we were in for a sandwich.  Peter says I will hook you up with pickles... 

The special was the Manhattan which has corned beef, pastrami and melted swiss on rye.  We ordered two medium Manhattans.  Before we even get our drinks filled Peter is coming out with a plate of dill pickle spears just for my girlfriend and I... Awesome!

Our warm sandwiches come out in just a couple minutes and looking o so perfect.  The sandwich was great and Peter even came by and asked if we needed more pickles.  We heard him over in the corner giving out cookies to the table that had some kids.  My girlfriend asked him if he was buying the kids off.  He said he just loves to take care of customers and forced some free cookies on my girl and I also....

We had a nice little conversation about where he was from and got some cool history on New York.  Overall this type of manager / owner makes the business in my opinion.

This Schlotzsky&#39;s has earned a couple loyal customers for sure."

We were out in the nighborhood, and I&#39;d already scouted out this mofo for a &#34;rainy day.&#34;  

I absolutely love the toasted sourdough bread.  The fixings are delicious if you get the works.  The meat is tasty and warm.  The chips are a bit thinner, but seasoned quite well.  The service is excellent.  What more can be said?

Their bread is a little different, so keep that in mind if it&#39;s your first trip in. The drive through is always ridiculous when I have been there; although it moves rather quickly you are almost better off coming inside.

One day they had fresh ricotta, which was phenomenal on my pizza, but I haven&#39;t seen it since :(

Overall, the pizza is just okay - it&#39;s not amazing, but the unlimited toppings for the price are worth it if you ask me. Just don&#39;t go too overboard, or you&#39;ll be clashing some flavors!

Also, their brewed teas are really good. I had a pear flavored one last time that was delicious!"

The concept is like Qudoba, Chipotle, ect. You pick the size of pizza you want and you tell them what you want on it. Unlike Chipotle you can add as much as you want for the same price.   

They do have speciality pizzas but you can see add/edit out ingredients. 

I got a speciality pizza adding mushrooms, black olives, jalapeños, red peppers and roasted garlic. I had to stop adding because I was just pointing to everything. 

Even being busy it took about 10mins for our pizzas to be ready which was faster than I thought would occur.

The key to great pizza is a good crust, fresh ingredients, and tasty sauce. MOD pizza does it right: choose as many ingredients you want at a fixed-price.  You can also build a healthy salad with multiple types of greens and vegetables. And of course, you can chase it all down with a beer or soda.

For a flat price you get to build your own pizza and put whatever you want on it! It&#39;s hard to complain about the food when you choose exactly what to put on it.

MOD stands above the rest who tried to bring the good, the cheap and the fast to this doughy business but failed miserably. 

MOD is KING.

Their crust for me is the reason why I&#39;m a fan. It&#39;s chewy but crunchy. Perfectly holds up those precious cargos of ingredients that you chose. Not only that - it is TASTY.

So I discovered that yes- you can have a really good pizza NOW. There. Two birds with one stone. 1. No more whining and 2. we can stop by any MOD Pizza whenever someone wants."

The pizza came out in about 5-7 minutes, so hot, so fresh -- I couldn&#39;t contain my excitement (and apparently still can&#39;t). I additionally got a side of srirancha. Yum.

The crust was crispy and doughy. There were plenty of veggies on the pizza -- no skimping on the toppings! The MOD size is quite large. I was only able to eat half before I waved my flag to surrender.

So the good things. They do offer three sizes (which Pieology doesn&#39;t for some reason). Given that I like to stay healthy, it allows me to opt for the smaller size at a pretty cheap price. Major points there. The regular size is also a little cheaper than Pieology. The pizza as a whole tasted more fresh to me.

Now the bad things. No whole wheat crust? That&#39;s a little disappointing. I also did like the heat of the Pieology pizza a little more so I don&#39;t know if they should turn up the spice game or not. It might help.

I would opt for MOD though if they were side-by-side (unfortunately both their locations are pretty far away). I think the size options help and I might be a little bias in supporting a Seattle-based chain (MOD) over a California based one (Pieology)."

One of the things that drives me crazy about a lot of pizza places is how much they charge to add ingredients and the price of specialty pizzas. I love them, but a lot of the times it can break the bank. Well, not at Mod Pizza.

They have about 20 &#34;suggestion&#34; pizzas for those that aren&#39;t feeling overly creative. However, the great thing is you can add as many ingredients as you want, and the pizza is always around the same price (around $7) no matter what you put on it. The regular &#34;Mod&#34; size is enough for 2 meals, so I usually go with the small that&#39;s around $4.50.

The best part is the unlimited ingredients, so if you want to recreate that great pizza you had at a specialty shop, that cost you $20, you can for no extra charge. I&#39;ve had all different kinds of combinations, and it&#39;s always tasty.

One piece of advice, don&#39;t overload your pizza. A lot of flavors make fantastic combinations, but if you add too much onto it, you lose the flavor of the individual ingredients. Just remember that when you start trying to build a Mt. Olympus of ingredients on top of your pizza. Well I take that back, it&#39;s worth doing once... just because you can for only $7."

The service was really quick and the staff were really on it. They pushed out pizza orders like you wouldn&#39;t believe. They guys also cleaned up tables really fast. I came during the lunch rush and people were coming and going pretty frequently.

I chose to do a MOD pizza (make your own) because places never quite seem to have exactly what I want. I went for the veggie option and put pesto and garlic down as a base. I added arugula, mozzarella, parmesan, mushroom, red onion, and sun dried tomatoes with a balsamic drizzle on top. The pizza went straight into their wood fired oven and came out delicious. The crust was crunchy and chewy at the same time, a feat very difficult to achieve. All of the toppings stayed on really well and of course all went really well together, at least on my tastebuds.

My boss recommended the place to me, so I made a mental note.  After trudging for what seemed like an eternity in nearby Ikea, I swung by for a pie.  MOD Pizza has much in common with the fast casual pizza places popping up these days.  But, I think they do things a bit better.  The prices seem more than reasonable.  The variety here is really good.  Although I find the crackery crust to be just okay, the toppings are the reason to come here.  You really can get unlimited toppings on your pie.  I do not know any competitors that will really let you go nuts like that .  Indeed, if you indulge too much, it can interfere with how your pie cooks.

I went a touch crazy with red sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, asiago, basil, onions, roasted red bell peppers, whole roasted garlic cloves, pepperoni, italian sausage (mild or spicy), and crumbled meatball.  The spicy sausage seemed a bit gamey to me.  It had the taste pork can get when it has been in the freezer too long.  I asked where they source it from, and they said it is house-made.  It bothered me enough that I will probably leave it off down the road, but that was pretty much my only complaint.

The flavors on the pie were mostly great.  The service was very good.  There was a lot of bang for the buck to be had here."

While Pizzeria Locale already fills the need near my home, I have been waiting years for my pizza related sadness to be quelled. 

Finally, MOD pizza has done it! Eureka! An excellent priced lunch that is delicious and within 600 to 800 calories. Not too effin&#39; bad.

My first recommendation is to come early or go late for a meal. At lunch, the line was long and about a 20 minute wait. Once you leave the line you have very little options for sitting, so plan ahead. Once you do make it through that line, the pizza and the prices will make you smile wide. 

A couple of complaints: 
1) Don&#39;t drink the caramelized pear iced tea. It sounds good, but it&#39;s not.
2) Offer some sort of alternative to that long line. Online ordering? Pre-order? Not sure, but a 20 minute line is not sustainable.
3) The seating is wait too limited; this will need to be addressed

Their concept of unlimited toppings for $7.50 is awesome - and they serve beer/wine! Two salads + breadsticks + carafe of wine was about $30. The staff was also 5 star.

You walk up and choose the size pizza you want and then add all your toppings. They have a list of pizzas you can order or you can create your own. What I absolutely LOVE about this place is that they do not nickel and dime you. Add as many toppings as you would like at NO extra charge! It seems like it&#39;s hard to find that these days, as most places charge .50-$1 per extra topping. Not here. The pizza is thin crust and cooked in a wood burning oven. It was really delicious and I will definitely come back."

Holy cow, what a great deal! Mod Pizza has it right when it comes to toppings on your pizza. I like a ton of stuff on mine, and by a ton, I mean a ton! The options are endless at Mod Pizza and all for the exact same price as a cheese pizza.  You pick your size and add anything you want to it and it doesn&#39;t cost anything extra.  The staff is pretty awesome.  I love the laid back feel of the place and how you get treated from the second you walk in the door. I made my pizza pretty colorful and it tasted amazing.

The restaurant works much like Chipotle or Mongolian BBQ, pick your size of pizza, crust, sauce, and toppings, and in five minutes - hot pizza. One caveat, if you are intent on destroying your pizza with white sauce, peppers, and anchovies - they ain&#39;t gonna stop you. Oregano goes great on pizza, but I asked for it instead of it being suggested, and I got a &#34;right on&#34; for my choice.

They ask whether or not cross contamination is an issue; they&#39;re just on point with everything allergy related.

And they&#39;re rad about it, customer service-wise, another facet that&#39;s pretty cool about this joint.  It&#39;s basically an assembly line that don&#39;t feel like no assembly line. An&#39; it ain&#39;t the [explitive]-eating grins and mindless questions of people goin&#39; through the motions. These guys have nailed a level of authenticity that&#39;s comfortable, genuine, and not overbearing.  Mad kudos.

I love how you can get whatever you want on a pizza; they straight up don&#39;t charge extra for extra ingredients. I wonder if it started as a social experiment, or really what that conversation looked like at the high/executive level.  &#34;You&#39;re going to offer FREE ingredients?!&#34; The pizza makers practically encourage you to go extra, like, &#34;Yo, you sure? You can get anything you want...&#34;

But who&#39;d take advantage of that (meaning take it waaaay too far)? And what consequences would they face from the crowd?  Fascinating. There&#39;s a short story beginning here...

In fact, all their marketing is dope.  They balance between total freedom to choose with this idea of &#34;Classics.&#34; It&#39;s kind of genius in its simplicity.

Love the old school wood paneling mixed with the exposed ceilings. Trash and dish bins are clearly labeled (where at, say, Etai&#39;s you never know if someone will come bus your table, do you do it, do you leave a tip???)

And love the open kitchen, which I typically hate. These fools are movin&#39;, though, and knowin&#39; how safety is a priority-- gloves, cleanliness, and my man mannin&#39; the oven yellin&#39; HOT constantly-- is pretty rad.

Finally, they offer a variety of dipping sauces to go with your pizza, and my girl servin&#39; suggested a wild mix that didn&#39;t appeal to me at all, but I loved that she was thinking of offering up something extra.

On the way out, too, they have pre-made to-go boxes stacked!  What?!  I mean, it puts me in that dilemma I face at work where I always take the top dish/paper plate off, grab one from the middle, then replace the top, but so!

This place gets it."

It&#39;s great to have the flexibility of choosing one of their suggested topping combinations, or to create your own masterpiece. I choose to make my own and I was not let down by my choices. By the time you account for all your toppings, you end up way fuller than you think you&#39;re going to! Also, after you order and they heat up your pizza, you get a second chance to add a few more toppings/sauces, like pesto or parm cheese. The price was great and the people there knew their stuff. It was a quick process and the Line moved quickly. I look forward to going back again and I really hope more franchises pop up everywhere!"

According to my son, &#34;It&#39;s like Subway, but with beer (which he didn&#39;t have) and pizza!&#34;  Frankly, I don&#39;t think I could sum it up any better.

It&#39;s a typical &#34;build your own pizza&#34; place where you pay a flat price for a pie ($7-8ish) and then get unlimited choices of toppings which they put on your pizza right in front of your eyes while you stand at a Subway-like counter.  This particular place had a VERY wide variety of toppings, cheeses, and other good stuff.

Service was fast and our pizzas were ready within less than 5 minutes.  Boy oh boy, were they tasty too!  I think most of this was because we were creating exactly the pizzas we wanted to eat... but they were well cooked and yummy overall.  I will definitely return."

I got the Lucy Sunshine, but instead of red sauce I opted for pesto with the balsamic fig glaze. I also added chicken and red onion.

To find another place I can go and have lunch and back to the office in under and hours is really fantastic.   But finding a place where I can go, have lunch made fresh, be able to sit down and eat and still have time to get back to the office with time to spare is as good as it gets for me!  I don&#39;t like to be rushed during the lunch hour. 

Today we decided to give Mod a try and we are ever so glad we did.  My normal Tuesday lunch date let me talk him in to a new place.  We go to a few places in this same plaza so today it was time to step into Mod.  It&#39;s set up sort of like Chipotle, choose what you want and away you go.   

Normally when I do pizza at any place for the first time it&#39;s always just Cheese.  This is for a few reasons 1: no amount of stuff can cover up for bad pizza and 2: normally to add anything it&#39;s an up charge per item added.  NOT HERE!!!!  I figured I would go all out first time out of the chute. 

I got the Mod Size.  11 inch pie with whatever I wanted on it! Red Sauce, Fresh Basil and  I went with all the meats they had -anchovies (these are not meat but they consider it as such) I was impressed that they had the mind to ask if I wanted them instead of just adding them.   Topped it off with Parmesan, Asiago, Salt, Pepper and Oregano.  I totally missed the ending sauces, but those will be fun next time.  

I liked everything about this experience.  That I could get what I wanted and didn&#39;t have to wait forever to get it or pay 20.00 for a pizza because I wanted a few extra things.  I like that it was thin and crisp.  I like that there are literally dozens of ways to have your pizza.  

Left overs were devoured by the boss and others who wanted to sample or didn&#39;t know it even existed.  I think some additional customers were born today.

This is now firmly in the weekly lunch rotation and on the way home for a quick stop after work as well."

Truth is, it&#39;s a fun place that has great potential. 

Unfortunately, there were just too many mistakes and the food was just so-so.

Issues:
Online ordering system sent the order over, but the staff didn&#39;t get to it until 15mins after the pickup time.

The pizza I ordered was not the pizza I got.  Must have mixed up the order (which is surprising, since they had my name on it and the online order sheet with the details).

I had take-out, and after only a 5min drive, the crust was soggy.

In addition to being the wrong pizza, they also forgot to cut it. 

Also ordered the cinnamon sticks, and they were terrible.  Not sure if it was the recipe, or if the person making it grabbed the wrong ingredient...but instead of cinnamon and sugar on the sticks, it was cinnamon and salt.  Couldn&#39;t eat it.


Where they got it right:
Super friendly.
Web ordering is great, if they can work out the bugs.
Atmosphere was fun and lively.
When the staff realized they were getting to my online order late, they quickly gave me a coupon for a free pizza.  They also gave me a free fountain drink while I waited, and the homemade lemonade was good.


I&#39;m hoping my experience was just an off moment for them, because the concept and friendly staff is A+."

It was my first time here and my friend warned me to not go TOO heavy on the toppings, because sometimes the center of the pizza doesn&#39;t get cooked all the way. Did I listen...definitely not. I piled on the toppings and my mouth was watering. I was ready to dig in on this fabulous creation I&#39;ve made. Unfortunately my fellow pizza eater was right. The center of my pizza was still ever so slightly doughy, I usually like my pizza pretty crispy. That is something I will keep in mind next time I order, but otherwise the pizza was fresh and tasty.

It gets busy packed during lunch so large groups may not find tables. They also serve pitchers of beer and carafe of wines for a not so fancy dinner. The founders started Moding in Seattle and this franchise is taking off all over CA so prepare for the MOD invasion Denver."

MOD Pizza has solved that problem for me!! For $7.27 you get an 11 inch personal pizza with unlimited toppings- UNLIMITED toppings! 

After being warmly greeted upon entering, you proceed to order at a counter where all the toppings are on display Chipotle-style, they take your name, ring you up, and about 5 minutes later your pizza creation is ready! They have a &#34;menu&#34; of suggested topping combos or you can choose to create your own, and I definitely created the best pizza. I was totally that person who had them pile on at least 6 or 7 toppings. Multiple sauce options, tons of meat choices, various cheeses, and lots of good veggies. For the record, I had spicy sausage, crumbled meatball, garlic, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, olives, sliced pepperonchinis, and I know I&#39;m forgetting something...

I thought I was starving when I got there so assumed I would annihilate the 11 inch Mod size, but with all the toppings, I couldn&#39;t get through more than half- so note to self that the mini would be perfect for me. Good news, it tastes ok reheated too. They also have the option to make a salad with all the toppings and serve them atop various greens rather than pizza crust. 

They have a good number of tables, inside and out, and take-out here would be a super easy option too. I will absolutely be back when I need to satisfy a &#34;ton-of-toppings&#34; pizza craving inexpensively and quickly!"

We didn&#39;t actually know it was the Grand Opening until we saw the balloons.  We definitely frequent the area and have kept our eyes on this place since they started putting up signs and it was under construction.

So, first of all, it was a bummer it wasn&#39;t warmer today, because they have a great looking patio area.  I will definitely sit outside the next time it is warm enough.  They had a couple host/hostesses at the front door to greet everyone.  The also had people in line helping explain how it all works.  Check out their website if you want to know all the ins and outs of ordering.  I kind of think of it like a Subway type experience, but with pizza.  Fresh ingredients on your pizza made right in front of you.

The place was SUPER busy and the line was almost out the front door.  Despite that, the line moved fast, and the pizza chefs were busy making pizzas and getting them out to the customers.  I figured we would have to wait quite a while and we almost left.  That would have been an extremely bad idea.  The wait was hardly anything.  We were in, out, all within 45 minutes despite a FULL restaurant.  That&#39;s dining in.  If we took it to go, even with a full line it would have only taken us 20 minutes max with a completely full-out-the-dang-door line. 

Now, the pizza -- I got a number 8, Calexico that was slightly modded.  I put bacon, asiago cheese, and parmesan cheese on it.  I forgot to take a picture of the pizza before chomping half of it.  It was super good.  I really enjoyed it.  This was definitely a pizza I would come back for and have again.  I&#39;m also intrigued by their salads.  I plan to MOD a salad in the future, too.

Overall, I&#39;m super glad we decided to stop in and take part in the Grand Opening.  The service was fantastic, the food was amazing, and I&#39;m glad I have a great new and very trendy pizza place to frequent from now on.

Easy peasy 5-star visit.  Keep it up MOD."

I stopped in after a long day of black Friday shopping and was pleasantly surprised. You pick the size of pizza you want and load it up with as many toppings as you like. There are several different types of sauce and cheese and at least 15 different toppings. If you aren&#39;t in to pizza or want something healthier, there is a salad option. You can complete your meal with a beer or glass of wine."

The line was to the door but moved at a reasonable rate given the volume. I think we waited maybe 10 minutes from the back of the line until ordering.

There&#39;s basically three tiers of prices, $4.27 for the mini pizza and side salads, $7.27 for the mod size pizza and entre-size salads and $10.27 for the largest size pizza and family sized salads. I went with the mod size which was more than plenty of food.

They have a selection of standard pies and seasonal pies to choose from and you can modifiy one of their listed pies or just create one from scratch. They have a lot of fresh ingredients to choose from. If you forget to tell the first person all your modifications, don&#39;t panic. It&#39;s almost certain that the pizza artisan from each station will ask for any additions you&#39;d like.

I ordered the Calexico which is their red sauce, mozzarella, grilled chicken, jalepeños, gorgonzola and buffalo sauce. I modded mine to also have red onion, bell pepper and artichokes. The crust is thin so you can taste all the toppings. It actually tastes like pizza instead of pizza bread with a ton of crust just getting in the way. The toppings they give are proportional to the pizza size which is good. It&#39;s not a messy, overflowing topping-palooza that makes you feel like you need to be taken through a car wash when you&#39;re done.

After you order you&#39;ll go pay and then sit down and wait for someone at the end of the counter to yell your name (which you give them when you start the order). Probably not the most efficient system especially if you&#39;re sitting outside. If anyone is familiar with Pieology up near Colorado Mills in Golden, it&#39;s very similar except they yell your name instead of giving you a number and having someone bring it out to you.

Disclaimer: If you like your personal pizzas cut in 6 or 8 slices, you could ask them to do that. They cut the pizza here into 4 slices which for me was fine since I was hungry enough to eat 4 slices, but not 6. :)

Next time I will try a side salad with mini pizza since the salads looked like a solid option as well."

It really is super fast and a good value. The girl behind the counter shouted hello from across the room when I walked in with a smile. Well hello!

Just come here and you will it be disappointed.  The concept is you can order a pizza and put whatever toppings you want for 7.47. It is a nice size pizza that I usually have leftovers. It is the fast casual style where you order your pizza like you are at Chipolte and there is no limit on toppings.  Another plus is you can just order a salad and use all of those wonderful topping on your salad.  The service is amazing and they never judge you when you load up the pizza with way too many toppings.  Gets pretty busy during lunchtime and you might risk a line, I recommend going around 11 and miss the rush."

The pizza was phenomenal. I usually take a picture before diving in, but I couldn&#39;t wait on this one. I got mozzarella and asiago on red sauce with bacon pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives.

First off, the waitress was slow delivering the drink order, the food order, and was slow with refills. In addition the special that was ordered was not correctly represented on the bill, along with an extra charge for bbq sauce that was suppose to come on the side, and not on the burger, yet it was on both. Waitress never came back after the check was paid, as we waited 20 minutes, as we didn&#39;t notice the mistake until after we paid. Waitress was also too quiet for the loud atmosphere, and seemed to feel awkward at times, not due to us.

Secondly, as mentioned previously, the food took about 30 minutes to reach the table. When it arrived, my coleslaw was warm, which I found odd. And with the chips and queso appetizer, it looked as the plate was half empty with chips when it arrived, and the bowl of queso was not full.

Otherwise, the food was delicious. I&#39;m partial to returning, as the food was good, but service spoiled the experience.."

The most I could get out of him was, &#34;It was good.  It&#39;s a Philly Cheese Steak, it wasn&#39;t mind blowing.&#34;  So, perhaps that means that if you want a Philly Cheese Steak that IS mind blowing go to Philly, but if you&#39;re looking for something to hold you over this will do.

The second time, we ordered out. 
We ordered the fish and fries, the BBQ pork and brisket (came with a choice of two sides), and two 8oz. Cups of green chili soup. 

The brisket was cooked perfectly and the BBQ pulled pork was just perfect with the brisket. We choose Mac and cheese and grilled veggies 
for the two sides. And holy guacamole, the Mac and cheese is to damn die for!!!!!!!!!!! I&#39;ve eaten a lot of Mac and cheese in my life and this has to be the best one, hands down!!!! It just melts in your mouth!!!! Gotta try that! 

The fish and fries were also good. The fish was meaty and perfectly battered. The fries were lightly seasoned with herbs but it&#39;s nothing special. The main focus with a fish and fries dish is the fish anyways. But, isn&#39;t really worth the $16 price tag. I&#39;d say $12, max. Just two pieces of fish and the rest were fries. 

Their green chili is also delicious. Perfect level of spice and perfect if you&#39;re looking for something warm or if you have a cold!

All in all, this place is a hit! Only complaint is their parking. They get so busy that there isn&#39;t enough parking. They&#39;re super packed on Friday evenings and the weekends. 
They have a full bar and a huge beer selection, including local beer too!

The experience in the restaurant is also great. We have taken our toddler in twice and he enjoys the kids&#39; meals. He actually eats the mac and cheese with his hands because he likes it so much...The servers have always been super friendly and enthusiastic; you can tell they enjoy their jobs and know the menu backwards and forwards. 

Give it a shot when you&#39;re in Green Mountain; they always have sports on so if you&#39;re a sports person, I can think of no better place to hang out, relax, have a beer, and watch the game."

The food is pretty straightforward bar food and the beer is your basic Anhieser Busch and Coors products with a few token  craft beers thrown into the mix.

It is convenient and a nice addition to the Simms/Union strip that continues to morph as a result of the Fed Center light rail station, I will likely return."

I was so glad to see a place like this open up so close to home. We go there regularly.

You will be happy with anything you order, but the smoked wings are awesome. I hear their happy hour is decent, as well... Although, I can&#39;t verify this firsthand because we do draw the line at taking the kids to happy hour. Haha."

As I began to frequent the place I have become more and more partial to it. 
The service is always good, the staff always friendly.
As far as the food goes it is one of the best bar and grills in in the metro area! Definitely the best in Lakewood!
So far I have tried the burgers, several sandwiches and perhaps all of the appetizers. Every time they been at the worst good and overall fantastic!
Overall a great place!
The only cons would be the parking lot, and the access depending on which way you&#39;re coming or going. The place also seems to have a weird layout with a back room that would be perfect for parties, but may have been better utilized by expanding the bar and bar area.
I point this out as walking in on a Thursday or Friday the place may appear packed and the bar full even though there is plenty of seating in the back dining room."

Took for-ev-er for someone to even acknowledge us, at 130pm on a weekday.  The place was about 20% full, if that, and it was about 10 minutes before someone even made eye contact.

I ordered the portabella mushroom burger and it was pretty bland in my opinion. Another night, I ordered the chips and onion dip which was pretty good, and I appreciated the fact that it was on special.

And Id neved have known about it were it not for a Facebook ad. First time those were ever useful, &amp; it paid off! Five of us met up on a Wednesday for $16 prime rib dinner. 

To be honest, expectations were low. But Westrail exceeded them and shamed us for doubting them. Service was great--friendly &amp; attentive but not rushed. They have a kids menu so the little one could join us (though he chose to nap instead of eating his cheese pizza).

The green chili is a little non-traditional but is also flavorful and delicious.  The prime rib dinner was a great deal.  A nice steak with homemade mashed potatoes (not instant or prepared last week) and grilled vegetables. The vegetables were great: asparagus, squash, red peppers, all grilled on what appeared to be a real fire. They were delicious.

There is a good beer list, and prices are reasonable.

We&#39;ll definitely be back for prime rib. And after such a good experience, I&#39;m going to check and see what the other daily specials are. All thanks to Facebook. Who would have guessed?"

If you are going to shell out $15-$30 for a meal, there needs to be quality control, but our food came out cold and bland. Most of the entrees here could be made at home or bought from another restaurant for less than you would expect to pay here, and everything, from the interior to the food to the drinks feels uninspired. This restaurant just doesn&#39;t have an inviting feel to it and in my opinion, it&#39;s not worth your precious recourses.

Now, what&#39;s good to eat here? Love the pimento dip and smoked chicken wings appetizers. Broccoli cheese soup is yummy. The spicy brisket sandwich is delicious as well. 

Happy hour specials are great. Impressive beer and liquor selection. Broncos games are fun here. Jesi is the best waitress so ask for her when you stop by...cause you should definitely stop in and check this place out.

The waitress was kind enough to let us know about the happy hour still going on until 6:30 p.m. so we each ordered a beer from the happy hour menu.  The beer was quick to arrive and great tasting.

We also ordered dinner.  I ordered the reuben and my boyfriend ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich.  We both ordered fries with our sandwiches.  I am not kidding you when I say that there were probably at least two russet potatoes on our plates when the food arrived.  There were so many fries!  I think they could honestly cut it by at least half and they&#39;d still be fine.  It&#39;s just a recommendation.  Seriously though, the fries could have been a meal in and of themselves.  My boyfriend said the same thing.  They were seasoned well, too.  My reuben was also pretty good.  My boyfriend did say that his Philly cheese steak was not an authentic sandwich.  He said that an authentic one does not have a toasted bun nor does it have American cheese melted on the top.  There were grilled onions but there were no grilled peppers.  I asked him if the meat was good and he said that it was. 

I&#39;d go back again but maybe just for beers and to try the wings (and because our waitress was super friendly).  There were plenty of televisions around for all the sports fans.  I just thought I&#39;d throw that in there.  Oh, and I saw who I think was the owner working all around the dining room.  Kudos to her for getting in there and showing her pride in her restaurant.  That spoke volumes to me.  I even saw her talking to some guests (who I think may be regulars).  It&#39;s things like that that make a huge difference to me.  It&#39;s all about the customer service."

Went to meet a friend here for HH and was not disappointed.  They have some good deals on tap and some tasty nibbles.  HH runs until 6:30 and select drafts are $1.95 each.

I was a bit hungrier than the HH fare, so I opted for the White Chicken Enchilada.  I was pleased with my choice, delightful goodness dripping off my fork and a portion so large I had enough for lunch the next day.  One big, delicious enchilada flanked by black beans and rice.  Loaded with big chunks of chicken and dripping with some sort of spicy cheese.  It was one heavenly bite after another.

Our server, Kaitlynn, was very attentive but not overly hovering and made sure all we needed was provided.  There are plenty of TV&#39;s here so you won&#39;t strain your neck trying to watch your favorite game.

Cheers, Westrail...."

Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations.  Most of the food was pretty flavorless - the chicken tenders should definitely have more flavor, as should the fries (maybe add some seasoning salt?).  The Sand&#39;wedge&#39; was okay, but wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d come back for.  The adult mac and cheese definitely has potential - it was cheesy enough, but the veggies tasted off.  The garlic isn&#39;t really all that great and the tomatoes seemed sundried - I don&#39;t think it mentioned them being sundried.  However, the flavor there was almost there.  The Queso was also bland - it tasted watered down.  Unfortunately, we wound up throwing out about half (if not more) of the 60-dollar food we got.  The delivery driver, however, was nice.  I have no complaints in the people-department, just the food.  
To the restaurant: I understand this may have been an off night, or maybe the food just isn&#39;t our cup of tea.  I hope this isn&#39;t taken as anything more than some constructive criticism.  
To the people reading this: Just because this may not have been our cup of tea, don&#39;t be discouraged from trying their food.  Though I would recommend not getting the chicken fingers!"

The 1st time we went was not long after they opened. It was great - interesting items on the menu along with the standard bar fare, great service, and local beers on draft.

As they&#39;ve gotten busier, they&#39;ve experienced some growing pains. It seems there&#39;s no method to managing the door. No hostess stand when we&#39;ve been. Just a clump of people waiting in the tiny entrance and lots of confusion.

It was so huge he couldn&#39;t eat all of it.

I really want to like this place, and maybe my mistake is coming at weekend rush, but the food has been bland and poorly cooked.

The menu is boring and there are many others that are doing it better quite frankly. 

Last time I got the BBQ platter and for $16 especially they missed the mark. Pork was over brined or waterlocked, no seasoning. The Brisket was dry and likely warmed up from two days prior. Good smoke on the brisket and the sauce good.

Our servers game was Hamus for starters, instant good vibes. Had a party of 6 on a Saturday in the summer at about 6:30. We were sat in about 5 minutes, which was super fast in anyone&#39;s book! 

Ordered the toffee stout, lovely. I had bangers and mash and my husband ordered the fish n&#39; chips, partly because of the polarized reviews; we can&#39;t resist fish n&#39; chips if it&#39;s on the menu, and we just had to see for ourselves. 

My dish was excellent--a base of homestyle mashed taters and 4 sausages, topped with a wonderful hearty gravy and the perfect amount of crispy onions. The fish and chips stood up to the test, a tad greasy (they are fried after all), but not so much that the fish was soggy. It still flaked away nicely and the taste was great. 

Atmosphere was perfect for a pub, not awkwardly quiet, but not so rowdy that you can&#39;t have conversation. Enough noise to make my vocal self and my vocal friends feel like we weren&#39;t offending anyone if we had a good belly laugh (and there were plenty of those.) I think they had a guy in the back who&#39;s job was to shout &#34;cheers!&#34; or &#34;aye!&#34; every once in a while to keep it lively. 

Service was fast and friendly, we had no problems with anything and aren&#39;t picky in general. Our server timed the meal well, we weren&#39;t rushed but once we were ready our check came promptly. 

A new favorite!"

  They had some nice whiskey my husband had Glenlivet 18 in which the bar tender was rather generous. My Bloody Mary was good nothing to write a novel about. 

  The bar tenders where friendly and attentive probably due to the fact there were not many people there.

Unfortunately the service needs improvement.  The waitress seemed like a bit of an air head.  Within 2 seconds of us sitting down she asked us if we wanted drinks.  I asked to see the drink menu. She hands it to us and the. 2 seconds later asks us what we want to drink.  I barely had a chance to glance at it before she had asked.  The same thing happened with the food menu.

We were able to get our appetizer for half price happy hour is 3-6 pm mon-Fri we were there on Saturday and not sure why but ours was 1/2 price too. The irish nachos were very good with tasty corned beef and great horseradish sauce.  My shepherds pie was very good and mine had beer braised beef it was a large very tasty portion.  My wife had the fish n chips it was probably 2x the portion of Red Robin and probably three times better, overall food and service were very good.  I was very happy with all parts of the meal except we were too full to try dessert."

If it wasn&#39;t for that, we would NEVER come here. The quality of the food is extremely inconsistent and way too expensive.  Staff turnover is really high. Today we got yelled at by the server because we went and sat at the same table we&#39;ve been sitting at every Wednesday for the last year.  Apparently we should have waited for her to tell us where to sit. There was only 2 other tables in the whole place occupied at the time.

Service is beyond pathetic, if that is possible? Zero management and the servers must be smoking grass in the the freezer or something.

I ordered Fish &amp; Chips and the waitress only heard Chips. So, I just got the fries. It took another 20 minutes to get the right meal. 

Once I got my fish it was more batter than fish. I didn&#39;t think they could screw up fish &amp; chips, but they did. Stay away!!!!"

1- I do love the pub decor and atmosphere they have going on.  It&#39;s cozy.  The have a couple more private dinning areas.  I&#39;ve come with just one of my friends (we sat at the bar upstairs)  and with a larger group of six to eight (seated downstairs at a couple tables near the bar) and we didn&#39;t feel like we were in the way. They do have both an upstairs and downstairs patio which I have yet to enjoy; I always seem to be here when the weather forces us to take seats inside. :(
2- The service is alright.  Obviously seated at the bar with just one of my friends we were waited on very quickly and the bartender was eager to ensure that our glasses never go empty.  With a larger group and being seated within arms reach of the bar, but not at it, we did have to wait a bit longer for refills.
3- I have tried several of the appetizers split among those I came with and they were all quite tasty.  Nothing stands out as, &#34;OMG amazing I must have this again and again.&#34;  

I&#39;ll definitely be back at some point to give the patio area a whirl and catch up with some of my friends!"

Went last night to take in the jazz trio playing on the upstairs patio. First, it seemed to really irritate the hostess that we asked to move to a table near the front when it opened up. I think it interrupted her talking with other staff members. Then once we moved, no one so much as asked us if we wanted water. There was a table of partiers at the table next to us. The bride got so drunk she had to be carried out. I&#39;m still worried about her. So, obviously they give no mind to overserving customers (might want to report to the liquor authority). 

Finally, my husband got up and found a wait person who made sure we knew it wasn&#39;t her table. We ordered drinks and by that point we were ready order dinner but evidently she couldn&#39;t remember too many things at once (or write it down) and said she&#39;d be back for that. With our drinks we asked for water. It took two more requests to get it and it was never refilled. When she brought the drinks she spilled my beer all over the table without a word. My husband ordered the Irish Nachos and said they were good. I ordered a hamburger and sweet potato fries. The hamburger was way undercooked and the piece of lettuce on the burger was disgusting--limp (an understatement), brown and old. It would have been impossible to not notice that when putting the burger together. The fries were cold and mushy. I had requested ranch dressing but that was forgotten as well. No one ever asked if we wanted more to drink. 

All in all an extremely disappointing evening except for one thing. The jazz trio was excellent. I would go back for them, but I won&#39;t order anything. Oh...and though there is a law that requires smokers to be 15 feet or more from the opening, nobody bothered to enforce it. It was disgusting. 

This was a Saturday night and the place was nearly empty (though there were crowds outside). Much better Irish pubs in town. Unless this place gets it together it won&#39;t last long."

The first seven years I would&#39;ve rated it 3.5 to 4 stars. It steadily has gone downhill. We hadn&#39;t been back in almost six months due to our last visit, and I remember why. First, a positive, the food is decent. We had the chicken fingers tonight and they were pretty good. The problem, however, is it took 15+ minutes till someone noticed us and finally served us drinks. The staff is mostly new and the restaurant is rumored to be closing. Karaoke on Friday was poorly organized. Sad to see the owners and management let  the quality go down."

I would expect at a minimum of you are a Irish pub that you know how to correctly poor Guiness. 

As far as the food, we went with the fish and chips thinking that would be a safe bet, the fish was super greasy, the coleslaw tasted like eating grass. 

Overall, I definetly would not be back for dinner, maybe if they learned how to poor Guiness I would at least come back for some beer."

However, having come in on a Sunday night when the restaurant was virtually empty- my date and I ordered 2 bloody marys, fish and chips,  and a sandwich. Our drinks came out quickly and were delicious. That was one of the last times we saw our waitress, and after having waited AN HOUR for our food with no explanation, my date flagged down our waitress and asked what was going on and how much longer we should expect to wait. She said that &#34;the kitchen is really crashing right now&#34; and that our food should maybe be out in another 15- 20 minutes.

At this point we had to just ask to be billed for our drinks and leave hungry, as we had a movie to catch. Our waitress did nothing in the way of apologizing for the service or the ridiculously long wait, and there were no managers to be found.

Extremely disappointing, will not be back."

Server gave the impression that her customers were a nuisance.  Didn&#39;t greet us by saying hello or stating who she was -- just &#34;what do you want to drink&#34;.  

I ordered the Bangers/Mash and was told that they were out.  I understand that these things can happen, BUT we should have been informed PRIOR to being seated or a least when we were asked what we wanted to drink.  I was contemplating what I wanted to eat and asked for a few minutes.  Then they came back and said that someone just got back from the store and now they can complete our order.  It was a little odd, I mean, where did they run to - the nearest grocery store?

My sons went to the restroom and came back to state their were no paper towels in the restroom.  My husband walked up to the front and informed the manager.  After a time, my husband went to the restroom and had the same problem.  Who knows what the staff was using to dry their hands?

No complaints about the food.  Just the service.  Ordered coffee with cream/sugar.  However, the sugar bin showed up with 2 sugars.  Had to ask for more sugar.  Then had to ask for a spoon so I could stir in my sugar/cream.  It felt like we had to coordinate our own service if we wanted anything. When the food was delivered, instead of placing in front of us, it was placed on the end of the table and simply &#34;pushed&#34; to the person who ordered it and simply shoved aside all utensils in the process.  Or, if they were on the end, it was handed to them.  The tables next to us were empty so it should have been simple to walk around to that side to place their plate in front of them.   I know this is not an upscale restaurant, but it&#39;s not fast food either.  When you go to any sit down restaurant, you expect a little better service.  

Upon voicing our concerns to the manager, Dave, it seemed like our concerns fell on deaf ears.  We finished our meal and received our bill. On the weekends, kids eat for $1.50 but when we received the bill, it was full price.  And it&#39;s not like we had to bargain hunt for this deal, it was advertised right on a plaque on the wall at the end of our table. So, again, we had to ask for things to be corrected.  There was NO apology or ANY concern that all these issues occurred."

Good beer selection including obligatory Guinness (fresh). I had shepherd&#39;s pie, which arrived piping hot in a cast-iron oven dish - which kept it warm for the duration of our dinner. It was delicious. Colleagues had a salmon dish and bangers/mash, and all said they liked them. A manager (owner?) came by to ask how things were - we said &#34;great!&#34;  The atmosphere is quintessential american Irish bar - all the accoutrements, but a bit more spacious and airy than closed-in.

Since there are limited choices, you tend to try everything.  In 5 years we have been to McCabe&#39;s 3 times.  This should illustrate how sub-standard it is.  With limited choices, it is still on the bottom of our list of places to go.  Why? Service.  

We walked in at 7:30p on a Friday and the hostess told us there were no tables downstairs (there were 3 empty directly behind her) and we needed to go upstairs and just find a seat (it is open seating).  The upstairs is huge and should not be open seating, they need another hostess up there or a competent one downstairs who can handle the entire restaurant.  We find a dirty table and my husband tracks down someone to clean it after we waited awhile (looked like the manager). He complained that everyone comes in and leaves at the same time - so I guess it was our fault we came in at that point. Definitely not a managerial type, just a rude guy in a tie.  

We finally got a waiter to help us.  Then after waiting forever we finally got our beers (they had to change the keg, which is fine, but he could have told us that was why we needed to wait 15m).  Not to mention the table behind us was having some food issue and taking all his attention. We order (burger and prime rib sandwich + potato skins to start).  The food was slow to come out and pretty basic when it did.  The waiter became more attentive as the night went on and the place died down, but it took over 1.5h to eat a pretty substandard meal.  

Oh and they had the windows and doors open to the patio on a night when it was at most 40 degrees!  It was freezing!!!  Nothing like eating with your coat on. 

All around weird place.  Food is forgettable.  Service is horrible.  Beers seem a bit too expensive (unless it is happy hour). It will probably be another 2 years until we come again and see if has changes.  It has been 5 years since I first tried it and it has always been the same, they just don&#39;t pride themselves on quality and attentive service.  All they have going for them is their balcony/patio that overlooks the main strip."

Actually we came here cause it was the only restaurant type place in Southlands without a ridiculous wait time on a Friday night. We were seated in a few minutes and within in a few seconds of sitting (like 2 seconds) we were asked what we wanted to drink. We asked to see the drink menu... Was then handed the drink menu and was the literally asked again what we wanted to drink before we had a chance to even look. Like slow down... You are not one of those restaurants with a huge wait and you have to turn over tables quickly. And for this service I can see why.  The waitress ended up doing the same thing with the food menu. The food was actually pretty good. We shared calamari which was cooked good and I had the fish tacos that were huge and tasty. But I wish I was given the choice of fries. I assumed they came with them cause that&#39;s how I saw it come out to another table, but I got boring tortilla chips. 
Our waitress was seriously in a rush with us. Also, I&#39;ve gone to many Irish pub theme places to eat and drink before... But never have I&#39;ve seen so many families with rowdy kids. Just made the place extra loud and not really an adult feel. Not the restaurant&#39;s fault, just weird. We actually could have been seated immediately instead of waiting the extra few minutes, but it was next to a family with their kids crawling already on our side of the booth, so I declined.

I&#39;ve had almost everything on the menu. The only thing I didn&#39;t care for was the shepherds pie, it was too salty for me. 

I love sitting outside here. Especially in the summer when there is live music in the Main Street square. 

Service is always slow. The waitstaff seems to always be new, and never really know what they&#39;re talking about. But they are usually friendly, sometimes overly so. 

I also hate places that draw you in with kids meals (kids eat for $1.50 Saturday and Sunday) but they don&#39;t have changing tables."

We wanted somewhere that had a good atmosphere, yummy food, great drinks and excellent service. I have been in the service industry for over 13 years. We were not assigned a server, we had two gentlemen in bow ties taking care of us as a team. Happy hour specials were incredible! Food was delicious! I would like to take a moment to appreciate the staff and management that are there. There was a group of people that came in and starting &#34;talking smack&#34; and yelling/ calling names out of no where. Immediately the two servers split up, one was speaking to them and another was speaking to us, apologizing for their behavior. A few minutes later a Manager came over and asked the rude customers to leave. We felt so relieved to find a place that does not tolerate customers that are belligerent and rude. This is now our favorite place. Great food, quick drinks, and excellent service. 
Thank you for letting us enjoy the rest of our meals and drinks with out a group of newly 21 year olds trying to ruin our evening. We appreciate you all going above and beyond even if it meant saying no to potential customers. (Who obviously drank too much and were looking for a fight.) I would recommend this fine establishment to anyone!"

Food was tasty. Adult Mac and Cheese with grilled chicken was my order. Cheesy goodness! I would say that it might be a return trip for that.

Bar serviced by a young woman who was pleasant at first and then smiled at the end. Good service, but she could have checked in sooner. Generous on the tip, but 15% would have been fairer.

I ordered the salad and potato leak soup and my friend ordered the fish and chips. Salad was great &amp; was presented nicely, although I was only given about a tablespoon of dressing on the side. The potato soup was incredible! I tried my friend&#39;s fish &#39;n chips and the fish was great. The &#34;chips&#34; were so-so, but I don&#39;t care for crispy coated fries.  If you like fries that way, you would probably enjoy them. The bottle of their house recipe ketchup that was on our table was empty and we borrowed one from a nearby table, which was also nearly empty. The ketchup was disappointing as it was runny, definitely no Heinz here.

Besides the ketchup, the other complaint I have is that both of us paid with cash and we were both short changed, as in NO coin was given to us, even though the coin for us both was more than enough for them to have bothered with giving back to us. In comparison, another restaurant I recently visited didn&#39;t give me coin back, but rounded up in my favor."

Waited at the hostess stand for at least five minutes before getting any sort of attention from the staff. 
During our visit, the waitress only came to ask for our orders and to drop off our food.. Other than that we received no attention and had to flag her down for drinks and the check. 
Most of our food was pretty good though. However, the Irish nachos were stale and we could tell that the plate had sat for a while before being picked up because the cheese was practically plastic and stuck together.

We situated ourselves on the rooftop patio, which offers all kinds of seating options. No view though due to the high barrier wall. Our table was also where a fireplace used to be and so there was glue all over the floor that questionably looked like vomit. It wasn&#39;t, but sure looked like it.

The menu offers a wide variety of choices, including your staple irish dishes. I had the battered fish tacos and french onion soup and my husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich. The remaining 3 in our party shared the 1lb chocolate cake slice. The soup was delicious and one of the best I&#39;ve had in Denver. The fish in my tacos was all diced up vs being in one whole piece, but all of the toppings were fresh and it was very good. I was served a soup bowl of salsa for my chips which created quite a bit of waste but it was again fresh and good.

Food wise McCabe&#39;s didn&#39;t disappoint, though service did. There were hardly any tables out on the patio and the upper floor of the restaurant was quiet and yet service was very slow. We watched the two servers stand at the door and chat, as we sat with empty glasses and plates. Service wouldn&#39;t bring me back but the orange lounge chairs on the patio might."

We went on Friday night to meet with a few work friends, the service could not have been worse. It took over 15 minutes to get a draft, and honestly at 4 pm it was not that busy. Order a few appetizers thoroughly  disappointing from portion size to presentation versus price. The bowl of chips and salsa which we ordered for 6 people was the size of a small cereal bowl and about 1/4 cup of salsa. Times must be tough and having to cut back.
The Pretzel Bread although a bit pricey did taste great but again 2 pieces was just a bit overprices in my book. 
There was this almost level of expectation, you are here and stuck here, so you will wait for us. I am not usually hard on wait staff because it is a tough job however she was horrid. I did try to get her name, but  she never showed up or stayed long enough to find out. 
There are so many great choices for good bar food and beer, I would pass on this establishment unless you must sit outside on the patio to enjoy the great weather that would be the only reason we would go back. 
I think management should take a hard look at the hospitality training and servers to ensure their future success and longevity"

We walked in and the host informed us that we could seat ourselves at the bar or that we could head up stairs for open seating, he didn&#39;t really offer to seat us in the dining room, which was weird, so we went upstairs. 

I ordered the corned beef hash breakfast and my friends ordered breakfast burritos. About ten minutes after ordering I was informed they didn&#39;t have corned beef, not that they were out, just that they didn&#39;t have it, no other explanation. The corned beef is a regular part of the menu and this is advertised as an &#34;Irish Bistro &amp; Pub&#34;, so the fact they didn&#39;t have a staple such as corned beef was strange. You would think if they didn&#39;t have it that day, the waitress would have known and mentioned it. 

Since I was put on the spot to order something else, and I wasn&#39;t really interested in any else on the menu, I ordered the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was really bland and the biscuits were hard and definitely pre-made, probably from a can. I have had really enjoyable biscuits and gravy from other places (DBC) so I know it&#39;s possible to make a basic dish delicious. 

My friends thought their burritos were ok but nothing spectacular. The service was okay. I won&#39;t go out of my way to come here again."

I&#39;ve been sick for the last few hours with food poisoning from their fish and chips. First off, the fish was flavorless and extremely oily and soggy on the bottom. During dinner, I was already planning on grabbing something else on the way home because of how horrible my meal was. However, if you are still reading this and are considering visiting, I will give you more information regarding my horrible experience. We had a large party for dinner and called and tried to make a reservation. Both times, the person answering the phone was unsure if they took reservations - how is this possible? Our group got there early so that we could claim tables prior to dinner with little to no help from the hostess. When our food came, our table had to ask 4 times for silverware and napkins. 

Needless to say, if you are looking for a night in the bathroom and some extremely bad service - please do not eat here."

Annoyed, we walked upstairs. We found a table, but it needed cleaned. I finally got someone who was willing to clean it and then about 10 minutes later they finally took our drink order.

The left third is the bar area, the right third is the dining area, and in the middle is a giant staircase leading up to the second floor.  Like many staircases, this one goes both up and down.

The result of this layout is a bit of a smaller than expected dining area, which can lead to longish waits for a table during certain times of the day.  On the plus side, there is open seating upstairs, which oftentimes has tables available when there are none on the main floor.  We took advantage of this on one visit and we were quickly enjoying our drinks and dinner.

Our most recent visit was for lunch on a Sunday.  There is a special brunch menu offered until 2:00PM on the weekends, which includes lots of yummy looking Irishy breakfasty options.

My sandwich was really tasty, but a little heavy (don&#39;t order it if you&#39;re not really, really hungry). The regular french fries and the sweet potato fries are both good, and the grilled chicken sandwich was good too (or at least it wasn&#39;t around for long, so I didn&#39;t get to try it myself).

We are here on a Thursday evening while there was some sort of event going on in the mall area. We were sat pretty quick and the hostess was friendly.  The beer selection was lacking.  I hope they quit calling themselves an Irish Pub, this they are not. They have huge wall art with Murphys Irish Beer, just what I was looking for, not on the menu.  I ate the French Dip, the traditional Irish fare lost it&#39;s appeal after I started drinking American beer. The wait staff was friendly, food took a bit longer than it should for the level of business that evening.  Food was good, if you want  a decent bar and grill this place was okay."

I noticed the complaints of the karaoke and bad service, but that was certainly not my experience, mind you, I came on a Friday for lunch.

Myself and my friends sat on the outdoor patio and the weather could not have been better for it. Our waitress came out quickly and took drink orders around the table. Shortly after, the restaurant manager came out and offered us some free tastings of some home infused liquors that he wanted us to try to enhance our drinks. I thought that was amazingly generous of him!

Now I can never pass up fish and chips, so between 3 of us, we shared the Cobb Salad and Fish and Chips. Both were spectacular! The fish was fried to perfection and the breading was very good. A special shout out to the &#34;chips&#34; or french fries. They&#39;re especially tasty!

McCabe&#39;s - a fake Irish pub instantly recognizable as such by anyone who has spent a second in a real Irish pub in Ireland.  Ok, so let&#39;s just &#34;pretend&#34; it&#39;s almost Irish - you&#39;ll see a lot of green here, fake gaelic on the wall, but you will see a lot of Irish classics, like corned beef and cabbage, on the menu.  And that was exactly the dish my wife regretted having.  Big chunks of corned beef on a bed of cabbage and dirty water.  The corned beef had a little something to it, but reality is that this isn&#39;t the melt in the mouth wonder that you expect.  There was way too much cabbage and way too little of &#34;other&#34; stuff.  (Seriously - where are the carrots?)  Overall, a disappointing dish. 

I went for the medallions of beef, medium rare.  It came out a little more medium than I like, but they are small. I loved the small chunks of gorgonzola cheese on the edge, but there was too little of it to make a difference. The mashed potatoes were ok but not special. The fried onion strings were only there to add crunch but they didn&#39;t. And the green beans needed seasoning. Overall, a nice beef dish ruined by mediocrity.

Yes, folks, this is your completely average place, which will leave me wondering why I come back here for St. Paddys day?"

Food came out pretty quickly, about 5 minutes or so.

The dining room was messy and could have used a rag on the tables, an emptying of the trash bins, a sweep, and a good mop.

The prices were fine.

The food was... okay.  Gyro was super greasy and seemed as if they had let it sit in the oil for a minute before sending it out.  Fries were slightly undercooked and soggy in the middle.  It was reasonably tasty as a whole, but nowhere near the best gyro I have had.

The long, dark hair I found near the end of my sandwich was not something I had requested.  My short black hair and my girlfriend&#39;s blonde hair did not come close to matching what I pulled from my mouth.

Bummer.  I like gyros and would kill (not kill-kill but might smack someone around) for a good one here nearby in town."

Nothing complicated here.  A straightforward menu with a few versions of gyro&#39;s, falafel and fries.  The chicken is moist and flavorful and comes in a heaping portion that will for sure fill up even the biggest stomach.  The tzatziki is bland and needs some help with an addition of garlic and spices.

It&#39;s almost something I stray away from because so many are just pricey and not so worth it after the bill and the meal but, Gyroz is where it is at! I had the beef and my brother had the standard charbroiled lamb and beef mixture. The sauce was amazing. The tomato and onion and beef in my sandwich made my mouth scream in enjoyment. The Pita was fresh and had great texture, Literal party in the mouth folks. I will straight up claim this sandwich the best I&#39;ve ever had. And to top it off it was affordable (9 bucks for a combo with fries and drink) the wife and I shared and still left with substance in the belly. And...the staff was flipping awesome. This guy was attentive, charming and on point. Even came out and asked how everything tasted (obviously just being cocky because he knows it&#39;s the shit!)

They offer 4 sandwiches - gyros (of course), souvlaki, falafel &amp; beef.  They also have salads, some sides &amp; desserts on the menu.  

This little place took me by surprise!  I wasn&#39;t expecting much from a fast food Greek restaurant.  I ordered the gyros meal which comes with fries and a drink.  The meal came out hot, fresh and tasty!  Not the substandard, bland, texture-less, psuedo-gyros that I have experienced at some places.  The portion was generous, but next time I will ask for extra tzatziki.

It took me two weeks to get over this place in order to write the review... I&#39;ve eaten here twice.  The first time it was ok and a mediocre gyro at best.  It was decent enough to go for fast food nearby again sometime.  

After the second time I went there, I lost 48 hours of my life through the most painful bout of food poisoning I&#39;ve ever had.  This is not an exaggeration or a joke and no it&#39;s not possible that the food poisoning came from some other food source. I had eaten nothing else apart from my own fresh food at home the same day and day before.  

I went at about 10pm on a Sunday night and it tasted about the same mediocre level of taste that I had the first time I went there.  However, within an hour I felt my stomach gurgling.  I figured, well it is greasy and maybe it&#39;s just a bit unsettling, afterall I don&#39;t mind greasy food from time to time.  Nope, not the grease.  2 hours later my stomach started hurting.  3 hours in I decided just to go to bed and sleep it off.  After about 1.5 hours of sleep I woke up with the sudden urge to puke.  Yeah I puked it all up and then the real fun began.  I kept trying to go back to sleep to stop the pain and suffering but I couldn&#39;t, it hurt so bad that I couldn&#39;t sleep... for the next 10 hours at least.  During that time I was violently puking up nothing.  I couldn&#39;t even keep water down.  I went through a few cycles of cold sweats and tried to make myself feel better by taking frequent showers.  Fast-forward to the next morning after only a few hours of sleep, the violent puking stopped and turned into diarrhea that was like I was peeing out of my butt for the next half of a day.  Yes, I had to take a sick day at work because hey, who wants to go to work when you look like you just finished a 2 day bender and you&#39;re peeing out of your pooper? 

Finally I could keep water down about 24hrs later along with a few crackers.  My pain and suffering didn&#39;t subside until late afternoon the next day.  At it&#39;s peak this was beyond the most painful flu or other sickness I&#39;ve ever had.  A few years ago I went to Ecuador for 2 months and came back with a severe stomach bacteria which had to be killed taking incredibly strong antibiotics.  Not once did the discomfort from that Ecuadorian bacteria even come close to the pain and suffering that I endured from a 15 minute trip to Gyroz.  

I would not ever post this type of scathing review for anyone unless it were 100% true, which it is.  Check my other reviews... None are even close to this harsh, not even the one I wrote for the terrible U-Haul experience.... Eat there at your own risk.  If you need something quick to eat, I recommend one of the many other places nearby.  Anything would be better than what I experienced, even if it tastes like dirty snot rags."

I&#39;ve tried out a bite of a friend&#39;s gyro and it was also tasty.  I&#39;ll probably try that next time I visit. The meats are definitely prepared differently here, though, and that isn&#39;t a bad or good thing. Just different. For instance, I personally prefer my chicken wraps to have the meat sliced super thin as well as the steak.  I was expecting the steak to perhaps be shawerma, but it isn&#39;t that, it&#39;s actually grilled steak. Overall great value and I&#39;ll definitely be returning."

The sandwich wasn&#39;t huge and overwhelming but with french fries and dessert, made for a filling meal. The food tasted delicious and hit the spot. The location can be iffy and during our meal, the order taker did get into a verbal altercation with a customer and ultimately celebrated the customer&#39;s departure by shouting, &#34;bye, Felicia&#34; out the door at her.

The restaurant was clean, very friendly and had great food. I noticed in the pictures the sandwich had fries in it and asked to leave them out, which they did. Found out later that a few fries inside was the authentic way they are usually served. I think next time I am in town I will try it with the fries. By the way the fries I had on the side were hot and cooked just right. They had little packets of hot sauce and a little on the sandwich with the Greek sauce, (not going to try to spell the yogurt sauce) was great."

It IS a fast food place, so maybe the quality I&#39;m looking for isn&#39;t really there because it&#39;s fast food..? However, all the food I ordered wouldn&#39;t take long originally. I feel like the gyro place at the mall is better. The hummus isn&#39;t anything special. It looks  gritty, like raw horseradish, and doesn&#39;t have any flavor that makes me want more like the hummus at Jerusalem&#39;s does. The tzatziki sauce tastes like mayo and lacks that classic tang that most tzatziki sauces I&#39;ve had do. It&#39;s very thick, but overall not the worst thing here. The fries taste like fries and were nice and fresh. As for the gyro, it&#39;s good. It isn&#39;t anything special, again, but gets your craving for a gyro filled if that&#39;s what you&#39;re wanting. It has fries all through out it which I thought was random. Haha, but decent nonetheless. Overall as a whole, I spent about $15.00. Not sure if I&#39;d get a meal again, maybe just the sandwich and possibly one extra tzatziki. I got 3 extra tzatziki sauces because I tend to dip everything in my meal in it. xD This time that was obviously not the case, but I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to that one extra sauce, it can go a pretty long way."

Time was about 12:45hrs ish.  Thankfully, we managed to get a metered parking spot just outside this establishment.

Once we entered inside, the Hostess, lead us to one of the tables on the left wing of DEPARTURE.  We are given the Menu and water as part of our beverages.  From the Menu, they have plenty to choose, though a little limited for my personal taste bud.

Our lovely server, his name is Travis.  He is indeed accommodating and answers all our questions about the menu, the restaurant and about The Culinary Director Chef Gregory Gourdet.

From the simple Menu we opt to share the following items :

*  Big Eye Tuna Poke ($18.00)
*  Shrimp Hargow ($13.00)
*  Vietnamese Noodle Bowl ($18.00)
*  Beef Chow Fun ($17.00)

Remember since this is CHEERY CREEK NORTH, though the PRICING of the Food can be PRICEY to some, does the Quality of the FOOD Deliver to our expectation?

We are surprised by the Flavors of the Big Eye Tuna Poke.  YES, its in smaller portions, but it PACKS with FLAVOR that we least expected.  This is by far my favorite dish for Lunch.

In terms of Shrimp Hargow, once again Pricey for 4 Dim Sum dumplings.  In terms of Flavor it does not WOW me as much.

Next is the Vietnamese Noodle Bowl, it came with all the fixings, but it reminds me more of the Vietnamese Summer Roll, just without the &#34;translucent&#34; wrapper that Vietnamese Summer Roll comes with.  It comes with succulent, juicy Chicken and Shrimp.

Now comes the Beef Chow Fun.  Since both of us cook, this Dish is slightly a letdown.  The noodles, that comes with the Beef Chow Fun was too chewy and hence it disappoints me a bit.  When Travis, came back to ask us, how we feel about the food, we raise the issue about this matter.  YES, they have the Flavor of Chow Fun I was hoping for aka GREASY and FLAVOR-WISE Good, but the Noodles that comes with the Chow Fun did not reflect a good texture experience.

My friend also opt to have Hot Coffee during her Lunch.  Travis comes back periodically and make sure things are OK.  Travis spoke to the Chef about the Beef Chow Fun, and we are surprised that, the dish was Complimentary.  For that alone, with SERVICE, DEPARTURE receives 4 STARs in my books.  In terms of the Food Flavors, and presentation, its more between 3 to 3.5 stars depending on what we ordered.  They have potential to grow and there is definitely room for improvement.  Apart from that, I hope some of the dishes reflect in the Brunch or Dinner Menu can be added to the Lunch Menu for more variety aka the BEEF RENDANG SAMOSAs.

YES, this place is ULTRA MODERN.  YES, it CAN Be Noisy.  But I hope in the future, Departure can entice me to return with Better Menu Offerings that will excite me MORE with Outstanding Flavors that I can only hope.  Above anything else, I wish DEPARTURE many success in their future undertakings, and hope they can prosper many more years in this Neighborhood.

Left DEPARTURE about 14:10hrs.

Right off the bat, when we walked in it smelled like dirty socks. Not sure if they cleaned the floors with dirty water or what but it was pretty gross. 
The ambiance was great tho, very modern place which seemed very social. 
Why the 3 stars? Well obviously the dirty sock smell and our drinks were very weak for $14 a pop. 
Pretty pricey for a weak drink. I felt like I paid $14 for a martini glass filled with blackberry juice. 
Not sure I would ever come back, not really my type of crowd."

I&#39;m Asian so I need to eat some type of rice at least once a week.  So, my co-worker wanted to take me a new &#34;hip&#34; place that just recently opened in CO.

I walked in and saw the line and I was just thinking that I&#39;m going to die just sitting here waiting.  I was so hungry.  However, the hostess was nice enough to offer us seats at the Sushi bar which we gladly took her offer on.

When we sat down, we were greeted by the Sushi chefs and were given some advise on what to order (of course my co-worker didn&#39;t want any of it).  So, we just ordered our own stuff.  We started off with the Bibimbap, lamb shoulder &amp; harm-beef skirt Kushiyaki.  

Wow, I have to say that I&#39;m very impressed with these dishes.  The Bibimbap had a little Asian fusion flare to it but it was tasty.  I WAS MISSING THE EGG! But the two Kushiyakis were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  I do NOT like lamb but the lamb dish was actually my favorite.  It didn&#39;t have the crazy gamey taste like lamb usually does.  Also that beef was super tender and just seasoned well.

The decor was very modern and what you would expect in a new hip Asian-Fusion place.  It&#39;s super busy so I suggest that you make reservations!"

We happen to be there the same night as the Star Wars costume exhibit opening at the art museum so there were a ton of people dressed in Star Wars type of costumes, Pretty neat. We had a couple of drinks each which were well made by a friendly and attentive staff. We did get accosted by some weird middle aged divorced guy asking why married women in Denver go out together and have a good time without their hubs. Umn.. Women are people too?

The GOOD: 
The restaurant itself is very nice - the bar area looks fantastic - perfect for any occasion - date, family, friends etc. 
The food was phenomenal! 
Pork Rib Buns were perfectly balanced with a big chunk of meat and kimchi.
Kani avocado - delicious - the citrus/cilantro flavor really makes it perfect. 
Duck curry - so flavorful. Served with baguette.  
Beef chow fun - prob my favorite. Tender beef and perfect noodles and the most amazing flavor. 

Here&#39;s the BAD: I wasn&#39;t too impressed with the service. They failed to clean our table after we finished eating and it looked so horrible... Server dropped silverware on my boyfriend&#39;s shoe and there was no acknowledgement or apology. 
They finally came cleaned it but left the entire table wet. I really wanted to leave but stayed longer because I really wanted to try the desert. Which the sticky mango rice was pretty dang good.

We came in around 12:30 on Sunday. No one in the restaurant we were the only patrons. 

Our server- 2 stars at best. He had no personality and for the restaurant having no one else in it at least act a little lively. 

Ambiance- 3 stars. Possibly better if there were more people. It was super quiet. Maybe some music ever would be helped?

Food- 3 stars would be a good average.

Edamame- weak. How do you mess edamame up? Just plain and cold. No good.

Chicken wings- the boys loved them. Tender and juicy and a different take on wings.

Harami- decent. Nothing special.

Prawns- quite tasty but should&#39;ve been warm.

Dumplings- we didn&#39;t care for the dumpling skin. A little too rubbery for our liking.

Kobe and kimchi buns- the boys liked them very much.

Cucumber kimchi- awful! No flavor and just not what a Korean kimchi should taste like. However the Napa kimchi on the buns was quite tasty.

Tuna poke- not too bad. Nothing special but not bad either. Definitely not authentic Hawaiian poke. 

Overall, I don&#39;t think we will be coming back anytime soon. Maybe wait a year or so when the kinks get fixed. All of our food was brought out within 10 minutes and we were in and out in 40 minutes? I like fast service but maybe course things out?"

The place was packed!  The design is very mid-mod futuristic, and I definitely didn&#39;t feel quite dressed for the occasion in flip flops.  

The good:  Atmosphere, decorations, service, drinks (my Silver Lining cocktail was beautiful and delicious).

The bad:  The food was sub-par and super overpriced (think $7 for 2 skewers/ 6 mushrooms) and waaaay over spiced (like, I couldn&#39;t eat the sushi roll with too much of the spicy sauce on top or the beef chow fun with way too many super hot peppers in the mix).  The bathroom is impossible to find (through the adjoining hotel lobby and down a floor on elevators that take forever).  The crowd is trying a little too hard and seems like a bit of a cougar pickup joint.

Consensus, I think I&#39;ll stick to Federal for my dim sum in the future rather than pay $150 for food I can&#39;t eat!"

We opted for the chefs counter on the sushi side and I&#39;m glad we did. I like the open kitchen concept, being able to see the chefs at work is always a unique twist!
The restaurant vibe lives up to the name and the terminal presence is very apparent. The menu is minimal, but each dish is crafted elegantly. Our waiter was very friendly, checked in on us often and explained the menu and offered his suggestions. 
We started with the steamed short rib bun and I wish I hadn&#39;t shared them! The short rib melted in my mouth and the sauce complemented it perfectly. Next came the sea bass and I wish I took a picture to post. The dish comes out with the entire fish, but already separated, making it easy to eat. The sauce and noodles were a little much, making it too spivey, but the fish was great! We paired the fish with shiitake mushrooms skewers, it had a great smokey taste. Of course we had to get sushi and I highly suggest the beef roll! Compliments to the sushi chefs because their minimal use of rice is great, allowing more room for the good stuff. 
Departure definitely fits in well with the Cherry Creek theme and I&#39;m glad I branched out to try it!"

If this was a hotel or flight, then this would be unacceptable. Unfortunately some restaurants don&#39;t hold themselves to that standard.

Cool, sleek, modern decor. Very light and white in the middle bar area. We sat in a high backed booth, and it was comfy. The restaurant was packed, so pretty loud, and my husband (who was sitting on one end) had to talk really loudly to talk to our friend on the other end. 

Pricey freaking wine list! I heard my friend saying that she couldn&#39;t even find a glass that was less than $15 or a bottle less than $60. Not a large beer list, but good sake list (if you drink it, which I don&#39;t). I settled for an Odell&#39;s 90 Shilling, always a good choice. 

We ate in pairs, one of which was a gluten free pair, and kudos to Departure - they had a pretty extensive gluten free menu, and the girls were happy. Most everything except the Dim Sum was on the gluten free menu. They also had a Vegan Menu as well. 

From the Dim Sum section:
My husband and I started with the Steamed Short Rib Buns (two per order at $11) . They were pretty good. I didn&#39;t fall in love with them the way that I have with the pork belly buns at Cholon, but they were solid. One other set of friends also got them, as well as the Pork Shumai ($10), which they liked. They also got the Departure Wings ($15), which they really seemed to like. 

From the Sushi section:
One friend got the Big Eye Tuna Poke ($18) - I had a bite, super delicious! Spicy, but delicious. None of the rest of us got anything from the sushi menu.

From the Kushiyaki section:
A friend got the Lamb Shoulder ($13). Two skewers, about 5 chunks on each skewer. I had a bite, and I enjoyed it - I love lamb - it had garam masala on it, so a good familiar Indian flavor. Husband and I got the Harami-Beef Skirt Steak ($13). Again, two skewers, about 5 chunks on each. I had a bite of the steak, and was a little disappointed with the first bite, but when I paired the next bite with one of the scallions that was sandwiched in between each chunk, it was much better. Good flavor combo.

From the Recommendations section:
Husband and I got the Black Pepper Chicken ($25) and a friend got the Vietnamese Duck Curry ($29). Both were delicious but SPICY. Chicken was moist and flavorful - as long as you really like pepper!!! The curry came with taro chips, and they were great for dunking in there.

From the Wok section:
Chili Prawns ($18) - this was DELICIOUS. My husband and I tore our way through this dish. Delicious. Scrumptious. This is what I would order if I came back. The little candied pecans in there were a great extra element.
Both of the other couples order the Beef Chow Fun($17). Both said it was good, very spicy (I think they accidentally ate the peppers), but not as good as the dish they used to love at Cholon (sadly gone). 

ALL their desserts are gluten and dairy free - cool! I wanted the brownie, but sadly, I am allergic to peanuts, and was informed that the brittle was in the brownie. The others enjoyed this, and husband and I got the Guava Mousse plus Coconut Ice ($10). Delicious, but there was not very much mousse :( I wanted more than just a few bites. 

Long story short: For my husband and I (1 beer for me, water for him) it was $115 after tax and tip. It was good, solid, but if I have to choose between this Asian fusion and Cholon&#39;s Asian fusion - I&#39;m going to pick Kaya Cloud Toast and Soup Dumplings every time. If friends were coming back here and asked me to join - I would come back and just order the Chili Prawns."

Please please please order the Departure Wings. You only get 6 in an order but they are INCREDIBLE. We also tried the pork shumai (4 per order) and rib bun (2 per order) - both were good but nothing compares to the wings.

The Thai sausage and rice dice was so good and a nice portion size for one person. We tried the duck curry which was tasty but I wouldn&#39;t order it for myself at $29 a pop. We also ordered the bibimbap ($23) and I gotta say I was a little disappointed. The taste was yummy but the meat was lacking. You only got a few tiny shreds in the entire dish. 

Drinks wise - we tried the piston Honda and the art of shadow boxing. As a bourbon lover it was a bit on the sweet end for me. The art of shadow boxing was nice and refreshing - very spirit forward. The bar was busy but it took them 30+ minutes to pour straight bourbon over ice.

Overall it was a great experience with an awesome ambiance."

The service was great and the food was unbelievable. I don&#39;t know how anyone could have written an off review about this place. Our favorites of the night were the pork dumplings SO good, prawns, duck curry, and of course the rare bibimbop. And for dessert we were in absolute heaven with the passion fruit coconut sticky rice.

I&#39;d give it more like 4.5 stars, if that was an option. I would recommend everything we tried, but skip the strawberry ice cream and green tea ice dessert, which was just ok. I think my favorite was the tuna poke. We also enjoyed the pork dumplings, beef caramel sauce skewers, bibimbop, and tom yum talay. My boyfriend tried the sake in a bamboo box (hawk in the heavens), which I even liked and I don&#39;t typically like sake. Service was good until the end of our meal when the server took far too long to drop our check and take payment, though we had been sitting at a cleared table for a while.

Highlights: Pork Shumai, Departure Wings, Tuna Poke, Crispy Sea Bass

Heads-Up: As a chic restaurant in the new/trendy Halcyon Hotel, it isn&#39;t cheap. About the cost of a nice sushi dinner - and well worth it.

Outstanding service, warm ambience and super hip interior. We were still talking about our meal, this morning.  Can&#39;t recommend Departure enough for really great chef-inspired Southeast Asian cuisine."

Incredibly expansive menu, with dishes that express themselves with bold authentic Asian flavors. The watermelon salad with &#34;salmon floss&#34; balanced sweet, spicy, and savory in perfect harmony. The ishiyaki style wagyu steak literally melts in you mouth. Blown away by the food, and the service was spot on thru the entire experience! 

We finished up at the bar, which dominates the space in the center of the restaurant. Was able to try some Japanese whiskey that I had never seen before, and was impressed with the overall selection. Fun and thoughtful cocktail list with drink names like &#34;Piston Honda&#34; and &#34;Tao of Tenuki&#34;. 

If I could give more stars I would. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Denver!"

Chick who waited on us was not. Slightly hostile attitude.  Lack of follow up.  Asked for coffee and it would have been cool to say no, we don&#39;t have it but we were completely ignored by her for 20 minutes before we asked for our check and just left.  Never know what peeps have going on in their life, but that sucked.   I&#39;d rather eat poor food with happy people.  Kindness is a dish that never goes bad."

They were out of quite a bit of alcohol. My friend ordered a crown and redbull- no energy drinks of any kind. He then opted for crown and ginger ale. He received something was tasted awful. We asked the server-it ended up being a crown and ginger beer because they ran out of ginger ale. So we tried to just order a shot of crown- they ran out. There were about 15 of us. They were out of stoli and belvedere too. They are still working out the kinks. You need to use the elevator to get to the restrooms. I felt like it was a journey to get there. We left after the crown debacle.

Everything was awesome, we got the chicken wings and buns for appetizers. The chicken wings were phenomenal, highly recommended. For the appetizers we got the Bibimbap and the Duck Curry. The bibimbap was good, the duck curry was amazing. 

The only downside was that we made reservations for 7:30 - showed up at 7 and didn&#39;t get seated until about 8 pm.  It was very crowded, so you didn&#39;t get that feeling you were &#34;special&#34; in terms of service, etc. which you&#39;d expect for a more expensive restaurant.  This is probably a side effect of being a new place (3 weeks old).  Also, the person I made the reservation with specifically said she&#39;d &#34;definitely make note of&#34; the fact it was my girlfriends birthday, yet it was never brought up or anything when we were there.  That was a bit disappointing. 

Overall, I would definitely come back for the wings and that curry.  I might consider just doing dinner and appetizers next time as the appetizers were awesome."

I was very impressed with the layout of the restaurant, and the &#39;upscale/casual&#39; vibe.  I made a reservation a few weeks before my trip, which made it really easy when we arrived.

The drinks looked great, and they had a large selection of wine. I decided to have a Colorado brewed beer.  We ordered:

Poke - very good. 9/10
Lamb shoulder skewers - 2 skewers, four pieces on each. It was good, just not very big for sharing. I would suggest 2. 8/10
Bibimbap - really good, good portion size. 9/10
Curry - so good. Has a good spice kick. Be careful if you don&#39;t like spice - also great with some bibimbap rice mixed in - 10/10


Service was ok. A little bumpy, most likely due to the restaurant being new. Also, the restroom is downstairs. You have to take an elevator to get to it. Overall a nice and clean place. Would definitely recommend if you are in the area and want to be adventurous."

When informed that my husband and myself didn&#39;t have a reservation, they offered us a spot at the sushi bar in the farthest, darkest corner possible of the empty sushi bar. Our waitress was alright I guess. We like our privacy, but she never once refilled our water glasses. The kani sushi roll was overly salty and incredibly small. The kampachi ceviche dish was small but at least tastier. The atmosphere in general was pretentious and there are a ton better places to get quality sushi in Denver."

Poke was good, not great, could have used a bit of acid to brighten it. Pork kushiyagi was ok but pieces without fat were dry and it was overcooked. Weirdly bright red glaze, too. Beef shortrib buns were good, but over sauced. Red sauce was present again! Roasted carrot and rhubarb salad was really pretty but when we ordered we were warned that since rhubarb is out of season, the substitution was kale stalks (then why have it on the menu?). Good, but not great and under-seasoned. The gorgeous whole crispy sea bass was artfully presented and a little too crisp (overcooked and dry). The slaw with it was delicious and fish-saucy. Beef chow fun was tasty, but it was ordinary. For $165 plus tip for three people (two of whom drank water only) was a little steep. Overall, good but very sadly underwhelming. Won&#39;t be back."

Wanted to sit up top and have a drink/ food while watching the view. Guess what? Although the view is beautiful from the pool area, the bar area is walled off to the city and mountain view. The opposite side has views if you stand only. Also, they put a paper bracelet on your wrist like Las Vegas. Super tacky. No food. Dim Sum to come. Right now just chips, edamame. And you have to walk by wet people from the pool to get to the bar. Oh well...
So we went downstairs to the main restaurant and sat at the gorgeous bar. Appetizers delicious , especially the wings, a must. Sushi roll mediocre. Drinks delish and very friendly bartenders. HOWEVER, the restrooms are down the elevator on the parking level!!! For me this is a deal breaker. Four drinks and 3 appetizers, $105 before tip. Same style food at Cholon with great service and restrooms right where you need them:)
If you want a great patio with view at these prices, my advice is The Art Hotel&#39;s Fire."

The concept is cool where it&#39;s all about sharing. I do think it would be a little better  if the servers/food runners would put the food in front of the person who ordered it first and then they could decide whether they wanted to share it because none of knew whose food we were eating.

All the servers were nice when you were able to find one, but it was just that, they were never there. When we did order anything it would take forever. The place was also very loud to have dinner that I felt like I had to yell to talk to my friends. For the price, it really fell short for me.

Both Halcyon Hotel and Departure restaurant advertise themselves as high class. Not even close. It&#39;s a hipster bar with rooms attached, overpriced and not a positive image for Cherry Creek. Not attracting a high caliber clientele. Rooftop has a giant red crane that will be swinging overhead for a long time while another hotel is built directly behind Halcyon that will block all views for west facing rooms.

  Parking can be a little tight during rush hours and it can get packed during the lunch rush hour so plan ahead and get there a little early. The seating is adequate and the place is always clean.

Went for lunch with my husband, and I have to say-I was surprised they were so packed. I like German food, but it&#39;s always some rendition of meat and sauerkraut, but I had the italian sandwich and though it was really simple, there was no sauerkraut:) My only problem was that eating a sausage on a sandwich bun leaves a little bit to be desired, there&#39;s more bread than brat. Having said that, I really enjoyed the brat sandwich, and I think I&#39;ll go again-my husband had the &#34;Three Pig&#34;, and he was sucking it down....making love might be a better description of what I saw going on in the very same booth as me....in fact it made me jealous. There, I said it. I&#39;m jealous of a pig.

If I was scoring just on the basis of the food, I&#39;d give Benders three stars.  I appreciate that the brats are made in house and made fresh, but they weren&#39;t that different than other brats I&#39;ve had and I was very disappointed that they offered no variations - seems like if you&#39;re a brat house you should serve at least 4-5 different kinds of brats.  The brat was served in a hamburger bun which was good and fresh but too much bread-to-meat ratio.  The toppings bar offered a decent selection - mustard, ketchup, saurkraut, horseradish - but the latter two tasted strangely watered down.

The reason Bender&#39;s gets scored down to a two star is because of the service and cleanliness.  We tried four tables before we found one that wasn&#39;t covered in crumbs and toppings and the floor was equally disgusting.  The same was true for the topping bar.   We told the guy at the counter we were new but there was no explanation of how this place works, how to order, where to find toppings.  And when we left without our table number he sarcastically told us to take it if we wanted our food.  Which seemed rather unecessary since we were one of two groups in the restaurant at the time.  

The price is decent for the food you get, but if I ever come back to Benders, I&#39;ll definitely stick to take out to avoid the bad service and icky atmosphere as much as possible."

This is not the  Panera &#34;we serve soups that  came out of a bag&#34; cheese sandwich making place or we serve only Continental Brand Sausages or only Johnsonville brats. Look at the menu when you walk in. &#34;Sheboygan style brats&#34; as in Sheboygan Wisconsin. As in a style of brats that has been around since the 1920&#39;s. Friggin&#39; people these days! Gawwwwdammit!      Calm, must remain calm...
Okay, so you see I thought we had lost Bender&#39;s &#39;cause I used to eat their food when they were down on Sable(?) when I used to have band practices out here. Well, my drummer moved and I gotta admit I forgot about them and when I tried to find the spot again it was gone. Well I had to come clear the hell out here to Bum-fuck Aurora for work and low and behold! Not more than a couple blocks from where my drummer used to live... Friggin Bender&#39;s!!! Yay and boo. Could you guys have moved any farther away from the rest of humanity? Sheesh!

Usually I like to try and go a couple of times before I review a place. Went on a Wednesday at peak of lunch time. There were a few people in line and while I wished the line moved a little faster, I&#39;ll trade a bit of speed for friendly customer service, which I received. I ordered the 3 pig sandwich with a drink. Sandwich was very good, and full of flavor. I especially like the buns - they hold up with the grease from the brat and liquid from toppings well. Felt it might be slightly over priced @ $11 for a brat and drink but still within the realm of worth it every now and then if you&#39;re having a craving. Restaurant was pretty clean with two or three tables needing bused when I got there, and were attended to during the 25 minutes I was there. Definitely worth a try, and I&#39;ll definitely be going back to try other stuff and update my review."

It doesn&#39;t say Sausage Haus or Dog Haus.  Brats are in da Haus.  Hundreds of them behind a glass case, made in haus, ready to go either on their grill or to be sold by the pound for you to take home to your grill.  I have to say, I&#39;m not up on my Brat history and had to look up Sheboygan, which is a county in Wisconsin known for their Brats.  I can&#39;t personally vouch for Benders doing their brats exactly how it&#39;s done in Sheboygan, but I would assume that anyone being so specific about their brats, knows exactly what they are doing.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/benders-brat-haus-aurora-2#YveytvH4UzW-dnwg3bt0tg

Apparently in Sheboygan, they only grill their brats over a charcoal grill and while I didn&#39;t check if Bender&#39;s is using charcoal, this was a nice flame grilled brat.  I went with the double as other yelpers have recommended.  It&#39;s a large Kaiser Roll with just the end cut off to let you know which end is up.  It clearly is meant to hold 2 bratwursts, or you&#39;ll have way too much bun.  It was a very fresh roll and held together nicely even topped with kraut, onions, and mustard.  The Brat was very tasty, but actually on the lean side, which I found surprising.  As my eyes scanned around the room, I saw a sign posted next to the display case that bragged how Bender&#39;s Brats are low in fat and only 170 calories per brat.  I&#39;m not sure this is a good thing as you aren&#39;t exactly trying to be healthy when choosing to eat a brat, or in my case 2 of them.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/benders-brat-haus-aurora-2#Shr4shwxsohP37Jk9cNeYA

This is an order at the counter place, take a number, then they bring you your brat plain.  From there you can take it up to their fix ins counter, which I must say is a little too close to the drink area and creates a bit of a log jam as it&#39;s very narrow here.  They have kraut, onions, horseradish, cherry hot peppers, yellow or brown mustard, and ketchup.  The Brat comes with a choice of side, I went with cold potato salad.  I&#39;m just not a big fan of warm German potato salad, but I see other yelpers saying it&#39;s very good.  I wish I tried the baked beans as they looked good too.  Something else that caught my eye, and I will try if I make a return trip, a Kraut Burger.  I&#39;ve never heard of a kraut burger before and I didn&#39;t see anyone order one while I was there, but the yelp descriptions sound good.  They did have a special on the menu that as a yelper, I should have tried.  3 pigs - it was a sliced brat with grilled ham and topped with bacon.  I decided it was best to keep it simple on this visit and leave the specials for the regulars.  But perhaps I missed something awesome!

The menu is fairly simple here, brats, mild italian sausage, beef hot dog, burgers.  That&#39;s about it.  If it works don&#39;t fix it.  Lots of military customers eat here as it&#39;s near a base and they offer military discounts."

Bender&#39;s gets my stamp of approval with a very tasty bratwurst and some great sounding sides. I had the double brat, which was a little awkward on the round bun, but it all worked out in the end. The bun was a great brat-friendly bread, while the warm German potato salad was the perfect side. I just wish they weren&#39;t so far out of the way. However, it&#39;s a fairly easy stop if going to/from the airport from the south side.

Almost docked them a star for having far too many OU and Ohio State pennants up in a single establishment. Let it slide due to the interesting diversity of other pennants. You&#39;re lucky, Bender&#39;s."

Do not go here if you expect to order food and have it at least put together as in a sandwich made into a sandwich instead of a few slices of cheese slapped between two pieces of bread with lettuce and pickles in separate baggies. I honestly do not think I could be more unimpressed. Absolutely awful.

Great for stopping by and for bulk orders for parties!  Simple setup, simple menu, simple sandwiches.

I&#39;m always up for a good workout but not when it comes to my jaw muscles.  Although the single brat was good in flavor, the bread was very chewy and the outer skin of the brat was very tough and the edges too well done and almost hard.

Just under $5 for a single brat and chips which isn&#39;t bad except I was still hungry afterwards.  On my way out for now for lunch #2."

I have lived down the street from this location for many years and never dared to give it a try. After reading a few reviews about this spot I decided to give it a shot. Well worth it and I have already visited twice in one week. 

As a kid I was never a fan of sauerkraut and had never heard of warm potato salad must say I was pleasantly surprised by what was waiting for me once I opened my bag of goodies.

Owners/staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall a wonderful experience."

Had the kraut burger, which isn&#39;t a burger and doesn&#39;t have kraut.  Or sausage either.  It is a stuffed pastry with meat, spices and cheese.  Very good!  Staff was very friendly and food came fast.  Really good condiment station with good mustard and good kraut!  I mean the kraut was really good - not too much vinegar and not too wet.

Only reason that I didn&#39;t give a 5 star is that the prices are about $1 - $1.50 more than what they should be.  Especially given the strip-mall location, rent can&#39;t be that much right?  That is unless the meat is all-natural, but I don&#39;t recall reading that (and so I could be wrong on that), thus it seems pricey."

Overall assessment from group I came with was that the brats and the italian sausages were just okay.  We kept comparing to Johnsonville Brats and some of us preferred the Johnsonville ones.  Ordered the double sandwich with chips (one italian and one brat).  Topping can be found across from the fountain drink dispenser...pickled relish, sauer kraut and onions.  

Brats were nothing to write home about.  I almost don&#39;t want to write about them in this review...they were just okay.  

Place is clean and busy...staff were friendly and the food came out fast!  Fits the need for the 1 hour lunch break, but would recommend going somewhere else.  Taste just wasn&#39;t there."

The German potato salad was DELISH ! Maybe mine was the exception but my braut seemed a little on the overcooked side. Extremely tough skin and dry.

We had to get there EARLY (11 am) or the line would be too long to make it within an hour.  We&#39;d also kid anyone one who ordered anything but a brat (like a krautburger) but everything on the menu is good.

The windows says they are Sheboygan style and I wouldn&#39;t know.  I do know they are good.  They come as singles or doubles (both come on a BIG bun) and usual sides of a sack of potato chips delivered by one of the girls working there (known around our shop as Bender&#39;s Babes).

The Krautburger isn&#39;t a burger.  Its hamburger and veggies in a kind of sealed bread pouch.  Good tasting even if you get made fun of for ordering a burger.

The potato salad is excellent.  Its warm or cold and I can&#39;t tell you what is better.

I took my dad here when he visited Denver.  My older sister asked him about the visit later: &#34;Where did John take you?&#34; &#34;To the hot dog place.&#34; &#34;what did you think?&#34; &#34;It was good.&#34;  Believe me when I say this is a ringing endorsement from someone who still can&#39;t find clam chowder he likes (not enough clams and too many potatoes).

I&#39;d order a pound of brats as Christmas presents for both my dad and my brother-in-law.  Strange to be sure, but its something unique that they can&#39;t get and its good."

The brats are great, very tasty but not overly-greasy like other brats I&#39;ve had. The German potato salad is delicious and very unique.

It&#39;s not that it&#39;s an unusually large portion or anything.  It&#39;s just so down to earth good that I feel the need to curl up in a lil ball and nap in a aura of culinary bliss.

Had the single Brat sandwich with a bit of kraut and some mustard (what else is there for a brat).  Also had the hot german potato salad.  Both were excellent.  The brat had a good solid flavor.  The bun was tasty.  The potato salad was flavorful and satisfying.  It had perfectly cooked red potatoes in a slightly sweet, slightly sour dressing.

The whole meal lacked complexity, and the simplest things done right are the most challenging.  These guys do it right.  On top of that, it&#39;s dirt cheap, driving the value through the roof."

Get specific here owner guy, we know that you don&#39;t like all of those teams and it just comes across as cheesy.

Healthy brats.  That&#39;s right, I said it.  HEALTHY BRATWURST.  I can&#39;t remember the specs on these things but they are like 1/3 the fat of a normal store bought bratwurst, INSANITY.

I got the double brat sandwich with the warm potato salad, pretty much a perfect lunch and not having to bus your own tables is a plus.  We&#39;ve since been back to pick up some more brats just to cook on our own, and let me tell you, cooking them on the grill is even better than eating them at the restaurant."

So far, I have yet to find such a place. Again, if you have really had a krautburger or German potato salad or sausuage, you cannot give this place more that 3 stars. The sausage was overcooked, took a couple of krautburgers home, underseasoned, and the potato salad way way too sweet. It was crowded and people in this neck of the woods swear by it but, definitly not only have I eaten better, have made better. Won&#39;t be back."

The staff is super friendly and it boast a wall of pennants of practically every college team in the country. This is the type of place that Guy Fieri from Food Network would love to visit if he knew about. 
    Not only am I impressed with the food and that the owner keeps telling me that I look like Bruce Willis, he actually calls me, &#34;Brucie&#34; ; but my friend from Wisconsin says that many of the dishes are served there as well and are very good. Near Buckley Air Force Base it may be a little bit out of the way for some folks and they are only open during the day and closed on Sundays,  But, this little gem is well worth the trip, if you love home made cooking with a German/Wisconsin flair.

The only drawback, is that we have a 5 year old...and there isn&#39;t too much on the menu as far as &#34;kids fare&#34; goes. So he has to suffer through a tough skinned &#34;hot dog&#34; or an over-sized burger. Poor kid. LOL I&#39;m sure one day he&#39;ll thank us for it.  :)"

Called and got take out, ordered a double brat and a krautbuger w/ a side of warm german potato salad. I gotta admit, I thought that it would be much better than it actually was. The krautburger was pretty bland and last I checked, you need more than chopped cabbage for kraut (it had zero tang or bite to it). I ate one of the brats out of the double brat and decided to take the other one and the rest of the kraut home to the dog cause I sure wasn&#39;t going to eat it. And the warm potato salad seems like they cut up boiled potatoes and dumped some generic dressing on the top of it.

The food and service is still great - it&#39;s hard to improve on what is close to perfect.

I had many little league post game lunches there with my wife, and now grown, married and moved away son.  I guess my attachment to the old place is as sentimental as practical.

There was a large contingent of law enforcement personnel (plain clothes), Army / Air National Guard (in camouflage), and other All-American, Ford F-150 driving type fellas.

Two friendly women took my order - a cheese burger, baked beens, chips and a coke.  I was given a number and in less than 5 minutes my delicious, perfectly cooked burger was on my table.  

I can&#39;t recommend this place more highly.  It was one of the better burgers I have had and the price was very reasonable.  My meal was about $8.  I imagine it&#39;s a favorite among locals and living in Wash Park, I see it as well worth a 25 minute drive to meet a good friend for an All-American (or German?) meal.

While they claim the recipes are the same, they aren&#39;t. Our &#34;lo mein&#34; was skinny little noodles like spaghetti noodles. Our hot and sour soup had none of the carrots or mushrooms (or flavor) it used to have, and even had small globs of coagulated cornstarch in it.

It also gives you options on the yelp ordering section to pick how spicy you want things.. and whether you want crab cheese wontons or eggrolls etc etc. It was super easy and super fast.

The restaurant is small and run down, doesn&#39;t look too clean. Service is basically non existent,  (although guy who sat behind the register and took our order while we sat at the nearby table,) was nice enough. The food is not good, by any stretch. My family tried the spring rolls, (They were accommodating to our request for beef rather than shrimp.) The beef was scarce so we were left with lots of yellowish lettuce and rice noodles. Entrees came with egg drop soup, (which was pretty standard and tasted ok,) and crab cheese wontons, (The highlight of my meal, sadly.) I ordered Sesame Chicken and my daughter ordered Orange Chicken. I am pretty sure they were the same thing with a different different arrangement of orange peel vs bell peppers and sesame seeds on mine. She loved it. But she also loves school cafeteria orange chicken, nuff said. I found it to be super battered, fried to a rock-like state and very saucy, gross. My husband ordered pad Thai and took two bites and said it was not good, also very saucy, ( An orange sauce of some sort.) Thai tea... Not impressed. Food comes out in plastic to-go containers w plastic silverware and Dixie plates, (If you are sharing, which my kids did.)

I&#39;m a vegetarian and it&#39;s hard to find yummy and healthy veggie dishes, and of course finding those things in delivery are impossible. This place has really really good &#34;chicken&#34; fried rice (the rice is fried with olive oil so it tastes better and less greasy). They use a vegetarian protein for the chicken and it is SOOO good the way they prepare it. I usually get the fried rice and the steamed veggies w/tofu. The prices are reasonable and it only took about 35 minutes to get my food.

The ordering process through their mobile website is pretty handy.  +1 for that

The delivery was prompt, though the delivery guy was not very friendly.  I&#39;m not sure if he even spoke English.  

The food really varied as far as quality and preparation.  We ordered Chicken Lo Mein.  It was very good.  We also got an order of Grilled Pepper Shrimp - medium spice.  It was just too spicy, but not like &#34;heat hot&#34; too spicy.  There was just too much spice on it period for me.  I suppose I just didn&#39;t like what I ordered.  The shrimp were ok, not great tasting.  The vegetables were very fresh and tasted great.   The white rice was average, but not as good as other local take-outs in my opinion.

Now, the worst part of the whole meal were the egg rolls.  They were really freaking bad... I couldn&#39;t believe they were as bad as they were after the rest of the meal was pretty good overall.  WOW, I&#39;m not sure if they just used plain ground beef in them or how they were prepared.  They sucked, plain and simple.  I would never ever ever order them again.  They also might keep me from ordering here again.  That&#39;s how bad they were.  I mean, how do you screw up egg rolls?  Egg rolls are good even from gas stations... for heaven&#39;s sake..."

I&#39;ve received a few menus in the mail since this place changed hands.  The last business gave me burnt wontons and the food was not very good.

Well, since these are new owners and reading some reviews, I stopped by here on twice this week for some Chop Suey.  Not too shabby, I must say.

I got chicken fried rice, General Tso&#39;s chicken, S/S pork, and Kung Pao Chicken.
Fried rice:  very good.  Nice char wok flavor
General Tso&#39;s chicken:  very good.  nice large pieces.  moist chicken unlike some places that seem to &#34;double&#34; fry the orange chicken/General Tso&#39;s Chicken.
Kung Pao:   lacked spice (I asked for extra spicy) and the sauce was watery versus thick.  Otherwise, the dish was okay.
S/S pork:  nice large pieces.  S/S sauce was typical.

Overall, I&#39;d rank this place on par with Cafe Ambrosia and Paradise - at least on these dishes.  Will need to update after trying other dishes."

My husband and I visited Thai Panda based on the strength of the reviews and were horribly disappointed.  Yes, the food is cheap, but you get what you pay for.

First, the young man at the counter barely greeted us and looked like a typical sullen teen who REALLY didn&#39;t want to be there.  We asked for a table, sat down, and he shuffled over and threw two menus on the table without another word.  After waiting a while, thinking he&#39;d be back to take our order, I gave up and placed our order at the counter.  I&#39;m not asking for warm and fuzzy fawning over your clientele, but a smile and upbeat attitude to greet potential customers (as well as a simple explanation regarding the ordering process) is a pretty basic expectation.

We each ordered the Pad Thai and split an order of the Won Ton soup.  The soup was greasy, and lacked the rich flavor and clear broth I&#39;ve enjoyed with so many other Won Ton soups in good Asian restaurants.  The Pad Thai was a small disaster.  It was overly sweet and drenched in a thoroughly unnatural looking red sauce which I feared would dye my tongue.  The only good thing about it was that the shrimp were large, fat and not overcooked.  Too bad they were drenched in the sauce.  After picking out the protein and eating some of the noodles, I pushed it aside.  

To add to this abysmal dinner, one of the fortune cookie packages was partially opened and the cookie had gone icky.  And both of our diet Pepsis that we had grabbed from the fridge at the front of the store were expired.  I noticed this after we had started drinking them.  Granted, expired flavored water is still fine, but these two bottles must have been sitting around for a very long time.

I actually had to apologize profusely to my husband for suggesting this place.  Needless to say, we&#39;ll never, ever be back."

Ordered the chicken coconut soup, the chicken satay, appetizer combo, chicken fried rice, and the spicy butter chicken. The chicken coconut soup tasted fishy but had plenty of chicken and wasn&#39;t as spicy as I like. The peanut sauce that came with the chicken satay was our favorite part of the meal and the chicken was okay but was very dry. Appetizer combo, I liked the cocounut shrimp but couldn&#39;t even eat one hot wing because of how dried out they were. They tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. The egg roll was fine and I did like the wontons. My husband liked his chicken fried rice but still likes Pearl of Siams better as that is more traditional thai fried rice. I got the spicy butter chicken which tasted nothing like I expected. It tasted more like a general tso&#39;s than anything resembling butter. I was severely disappointed as I wanted a creamy sauce and got a sweet syrupy mess. The prices are good and they do have fast delivery. 

I would go here again for the peanut sauce but would be wary of trying anything else. Not worth it in my opinion."

They take orders from 11am-3pm, so if you are out and about, its very convenient!

As for the dishes, everyone, whether its on special or off the regular menu, is full of flavor and superb!  My favorites are:  Thai peanut curry beef, lemongrass chicken, general tso chicken, spicy butter chicken and of course the egg drop soup.

If you have allergies or special requests (no onions in the fried rice) the chef ALWAYS does an excellent job to make the appropriate accomodations.  My husband enjoys things extra spicy and with extra sauce, and they make everything to taste.

Our order usually takes about 10-15 minutes and is always hot and fresh.  They only use white meat chicken and fresh veggies, so for what you get, its an incredible value!!"

We were also sat by the patio doors and had to deal with flies and it was a bit chilly.

With multiple locations, I would suggest the one on Evans. It&#39;s not as crowded as the others, and typically there is no wait! We were seated immediately at 11 am on a Saturday. Perfection! Service was impeccable and friendly, and everything came out hot and quick. We got the beignets (would highly recommend) and lattes to start (they even have decaf espresso!)

For our meals, we got a variety. We would recommend the Creole omelett, the oyster po boy, the Carlin County entree, and the French toast. See pics for reference. We had such a great experience and will be back!!"

Just discovered this on my last trip to Denver.  It&#39;s a big free standing building with a really cute southern decor.  Wonderful service from my waitress, very friendly and helpful.  

As for the food, a great Cajun twist on their breakfast.  I had a piece of local trout that was pan fried with a pouched egg and homemade hollandaise sauce.  It was serviced with fried potatoes and a wonderful homemade biscuit.  It was a great breakfast, I will be back on my next visit."

Especially for brunch when I&#39;m super hungry.  Especially when they know they&#39;ll have a crazy wait for their patrons.  That being said, I love beignets and can&#39;t resist them when they&#39;re so close to me house.  So, we went, and we waited...  And waited.  Luckily, the waiting area is nice and outside with wicker seats.

Once inside, we were transported to the French Quarter.  The beignets and biscuits held up to my yearning, and the blood Mary&#39;s hit the spot.  The service was spotty, though it was so busy that wasn&#39;t a surprise, and the air conditioning could be improved.  But, all and all, a great brunch spot.   Now, if only they can give us the luxury of reservations."

This spot is already quickly becoming just as packed as its sister locations only a month into its opening but when you have a  restaurant that dishes out the worlds most amazing biscuits and bloodies what would you expect? 

I think it&#39;s important to point out that Lucile&#39;s is not where you come when you are watching your calories, how ever if you are ready to get your carb loading gluttony on you&#39;re in the right place my friend. 

If you&#39;re stopping by for weekend brunch your probably going to have to wait and in that case you may as well roll up to the bar and get your self a cocktail to sip by their out door fire pit. Their bloodies are seriously so good. Nice and boozy with just enough of a kick and they come with a lil skewer of scrimp an okra! Mimosa&#39;s are $7 and they give you the mini bottle of champagne. I have yet to try there other brunchtails but i&#39;m sure they are good as well.

Ok lets talk food. First, beignets. Here is the problem with them they are fried and golden pillows of goodness covered in powdered sugar which you can then slather with their homemade jams, one word- blueberry. They are so good that you can&#39;t NOT get them. It&#39;s your duty basically, but then you have no room for your actual breakfast which have no doubt will be a huge proportion. You see my dilemma. So do the right thing and wear your stretchy pants. 

Their stand out dishes are the eggs rockefeller, any of their benedict&#39;s, and sometimes I dig a little cajun or carlin breakfast too. Basically anything with their jalapeño cheese grits, hollandaise or gravy. Seriously I have yet to have a dish that wasn&#39;t totally delicious.  Most of them also come with those biscuits I mentioned earlier. I don&#39;t know how they make these things but I have never had a biscuit&#39;s like these anywhere else. They are massive, buttery, and flakey!"

Service was exceptionally slow even though they weren&#39;t that busy and had plenty of staff on hand.  Eggs Benedicts were delivered cold ...really cold.  (both my order and my friend&#39;s order)  -When the waitress eventually resurfaced I flagged her down to share with her how cold the benedicts were.  Her response:  &#34;yeah, it&#39;s really hard to get all the food to come out hot&#34; .  Seriously.  That was her response -- my friend chimed in that his was also cold...and yet the muffin was burnt.... &#34;yeah, that happens&#34;.   She never circled back to re-fill waters or ask about coffee order --- I finally went and found the water pitcher myself to refill our waters.  Seriously.  $40 for cold food, bad service, and no action when a problem brought to staff attention?   No thanks.  Will be quite awhile before we return --- several great breakfast places that want customers to be satisfied in the same neighborhood."

At first you may want to order something from your tried and true go-to faves, but order something truly creole. I got the omlette with Cajun sausage, ham and creole sauce with grits- my server said &#34;you want to add cheese and jalopenos?&#34; and I did and it was fabulous. Hubs got the ponchatrain trout and grits the same way, he loved it too. They brought out huge warm biscuits that were so tasty with the homemade jam selection on the table. They also make this delicious cinnamon spiced iced tea that just tied the whole meal together.

Honestly, the best biscuits in Denver, and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s even really close.  Amazing beignets(just be sure to have a ton of napkins handy when wiping off the powdered sugar).  I love how everything is made in house too, especially the delicious apple butter and strawberry rhubarb jam.  I always make sure to pick up a jar to take home afterwards.  My personal favorite entree is the Cajun Breakfast, so good and very &#34;food coma&#34; inducing.

The portions were smaller than the other locations, the eggs in my Benedict were over cooked, the check was delivered to the table before the food and my coffee  was never refilled.  

It is obvious that the management is very motivated to save money but it is compromising the quality of the food and the brand.  They just opened so I will try again in a month or so and hopefully the are over their growing pains by then.   Lucile&#39;s is too good a restaurant to let their latest addition be so far off from their usually perfect reputation."

Sweet little place with a decent breakfast, nothing special. if you like cute names for the offerings and the prices that come with the cute names, this is the place. 

I ordered 2 eggs and potatoes. the eggs were cooked perfectly. The potatoes have garlic powder and other spices (i hate that) and close to burned, not burned, but close.

The waitress brought out a biscuit, which i did not order and did not eat. I hear tell that their biscuits are the best ever. I did look light and tasty, just not my thing.

All in all, if you do not mind paying the price, like your potatoes to taste like anything but potatoes, cute names, alcohol with your breakfast, and prefer pretense to substance, you will enjoy eating here."

I&#39;ve never tried anything from the lunch menu; in fact the only thing I&#39;ve ordered for myself is the biscuit with some jam and fresh fruit. I&#39;ve stolen a few bites of other breakfast dishes off the plates of friends. The beignets are a little drier than the ones I&#39;ve had in New Orleans. Really, nothing I&#39;ve had here really jumps out at me. I&#39;m not really into chicory coffee and the regular brew is pretty average. I do enjoy the biscuits, and with jelly they are pretty much to die for, but I&#39;ve found the portions huge and I have trouble getting even halfway through the things without starting to feel a little sick. There&#39;s also a huge lack of menu options for anybody who (like me) is lactose intolerant. This doesn&#39;t actually go into my rating of the restaurant, because I understand that not everyone has to cater to my allergy, but I still like to point it out in case anyone else needs to know. 
Other than that, the wait staff is kind and the atmosphere is kitschy and cute, pretty well decorated."

We have never had a bad breakfast there.  The omelettes, french toast, rice porridge and their biscuits, are our favorites. They serve Silver Canyon coffee which seems hard to find in the city but is really good coffee. And if you like chicory coffee, Lucile&#39;s is the place for you. They have lots of seating so no long, torturous lines like at Snooze. The wait staff there has always been excellent. 

The one downside of Lucile&#39;s is that if one has a dairy intolerance, this is not the place for you. Most every thing they make which is worth coming to Lucile&#39;s to eat, has dairy in it."

The &#34;owner&#34; who happened to be at both locations refuses to hear complaints on the staff at the Evan&#39;s location and would rather grill you, the customer, and take the side of the staff.  The manager at the Evan&#39;s location feels it&#39;s ok to talk down to customers and went so far as to push a customer as he walked out the door on one particular occasion.  What she did was so noticeable that another waiting customer had to tell the manager, &#34;Do not put your hands on him, you are wrong for that!&#34;  Our experience at this location is the worse we ever had and will never go back to any of the other locations."

What I didn&#39;t realize, was that they were going to have to roll me out the front door after I ate all of the food. We started off the meal with the beignets, which are essentially fresh sopapillas with no filling but covered in powdered sugar. They were amazing, I could have these alone for breakfast (and probably should have to save myself from having to run 10 miles to work the meal off). After these disappeared off the table, they brought us the largest cornbread I had ever seen. It was about six inches tall and six inches wide, it was huge. I found some apple butter on the table that ended up going together with the cornbread biscuit quite well, so I slowly munched on that. For the meal I got the Cajun breakfast, which consists of red beans(oh my god their red beans are a-m-a-z-i-n-g) topped with two poached eggs, and covered in hollandaise sauce. It was delicious, and also made me want to figure out the recipe for the red beans. It was a great experience, and next time I go for a morning workout on the weekend, I might come by here for breakfast so I can completely negate any exercise I&#39;ve done."

We found out why this one did not. We practically had to argue with the hostess to not sit us at a table with 3 other strangers (community seating at EVERY table but we have never had this issue at the other locations) so she told us it would be a 10 minute wait despite 4 or 5 open tables.  I get the concept but more training of the very dour hostess would be recommended.  Community when there is a wait makes sense.

Our waitress was great, thus the two stars, but the food was meh at best.  My potatoes were burnt and the Hollandaise had no taste.  None of us finished our meals...

The place has only been open a couple weeks so maybe........"

Both of those issues have been remedied immensely with the DU location.  The staff was nice, and we were seated and served immediately.  I hope this location doesn&#39;t catch on so quick and stays as mellow and high quality as it is now.

The only downfalls from my experience was our toast took 40 minutes to come out and I feel like they weren&#39;t that busy. I also feel like the prices were a touch too high but that won&#39;t hold me back from returning again. Oh... and there was no TP in the restroom (thank goodness there was a box of tissue in there)!

I knew when I stepped foot in here that I would be in love with it. The layout of the restaurant is open, cute, casual, homey, relaxed. I kind of want to marry this place and live in it. The girl at the counter I wanted to be best friends with. Her and her cute little risque cartoon dress. There was even a basket of avocados and the windowsill was lined with pineapples. Hello. Two of my favorite things. Already obsessed and hadn&#39;t even gotten to the counter yet.

And then I got to the counter. TOAST!!!!!!!!!!!! Hell yeah toast. We love toast. My lover and I got the east toast and the jam. Hello toast. East was garlic toast with melted havarti cheese and organic sliced tomatoes. Phenomenal. The toast comes with two HUGE slices of sourdough bread baked from a local bakery. I can eat more than a horse so it was definitely great to split 2 toasts, but I bet a lot of normal people could get away with 3, maybe even 4 people splitting 2 toasts. Not me. I ate the east first and wanted to save the jam as &#34;dessert&#34;. Every bite was perfect and I definitely moaned and grunted a few times. In the mean time, we also enjoyed a lovely greek salad. SCRUM!!!! LOVE greek salad. It was really big and loaded with feta, hard boiled egg, veggies and delicious dressing. Time for jam. HELL YEAH. This was the winner for me. Goat cheese, fig jam, and pear. Goat cheese is the best cheese in the world and jam is really cool. This was maybe one of my favorite things I had all week in Denver. Toast is the bomb. Sure, it&#39;s simple, but my goodness, these things were off the hook. And everything is organic and mostly made in house. Oh and then we had juice. Hi juice. We got a &#34;flight&#34; of juices to split. I feel like they must mostly change every day or a few times a week, so I can&#39;t remember the names of what we got. HOWEVER, they were all so flippin good. The beet one was the best. My boyfriend was also getting a wee sick and we were headed to Phish so I got him an elixir. DANG! Was intense but reallllly good. Super super ginger. All the healthy amazing things.

Best place ever. Might be my favorite land I&#39;ve been to in Denver. And obviously there are a LOT of amazing restaurants in Denver. I so wish I had this place at home."

The kiddos split the &#34;Carrot Cake&#34; juice made with coconut water which was said to be a favorite for the younger ones. I had a delicious, very earthy, perfectly spiced, very flavor packed iced chai which I loved. They also have a matcha chai! I have never seen this combination of my two favorites before! Very nice! 

There are flyers for lots of yoga, health and spiritual retreats as well as music festivals which the owners were at when we came. If you&#39;re a hippie like me, finding out about those things wold be an added bonus to coming here!"

I know, I know, it&#39;s not just &#34;toast.&#34; It&#39;s locally-sourced, bird-friendly, non-GMO, cage-free craft toast cooked on a bed on Tibetian prayer flags. And the juice! Cold-pressed, organic, baby carrot-free blended in a responsibly-sourced aluminum bicycle-powered blender! Hurrah!

Don&#39;t get me wrong. This is good food.  The toast comes with two thick slices that are chewy, substantial, and have a great buttery crispness. The bread that came with the soup however was hard enough to drive nails. It was a dangerous game trying to devour it without ripping out the roof of my mouth. The soup itself? Healthy and bland. Toast toppings are elegant (sparse) but very flavorful and well-balanced. Juice was very good. Tasted of liquified plant matter and spices.

Sorry. I may need to lose weight and eat right but my wallet doesn&#39;t need the purge. I gave it a shot because my wife demanded &#34;real food&#34; on her vacation after suffering innumerable pizzas, burgers, and chicken wings. Good on you beautiful wife! And to be fair, I did receive a luxurious smooch after suggesting we try a place with &#34;beet&#34; in the name. 

Glad I came. Probably an amazing place for the discerning foodie with deep pockets. Good atmosphere and service but I wouldn&#39;t be thrilled to return."

A very laid back environment where you&#39;d expect to see a lot of fit, health conscious, yoga-type people to eat, but not pretentious at all.

My friend and I met here for a lunch date since it&#39;s between our places of work. We shared the greek salad, which includes a hardboiled egg (you could add another) and plenty of yummy black olives. We also ordered &#34;toast&#34; which I had mistakenly expected to be a piece of toast with spread on top... we got the one with goat cheese, figgy jam, and sliced pears. First off, it&#39;s two HUGE thick slices of delicious bread with toppings oozing off of it. Very generous plate! My friend also very much enjoyed her matcha chai (very ginger-y) and we might&#39;ve gotten a peach scone to start (so moist and yummy).

They offer organic vegetarian light bites, cold-pressed juices and pastries.  I had the Farmer toast with garlic, hard-boiled egg and lightly dressed greens.  The greens were the perfect accompaniment to the hearty toast! I loved the crusty toast made by Denver Bread Company.  If you&#39;re health nut like me you&#39;ll feel right at home here!

Note: I did not actually eat any beets here. I guess I ought to disclose that I didn&#39;t drink any beets here, either. I think in the scales of food definition, this place leans a little heavier on the juice side than the food side. I think the juice would probably be the main attraction. You know the drill: cold-pressed and et cetera and probably more money that I feel comfortable spending on juice, but their prices here are right in line with what you might expect to spend elsewhere.

What I like is the space--open, bright, airy, and right there on the corner. I also like the food--I was wanting something healthy because when I travel I want this body to be treated well--and they had it here. I ordered the southwest salad (hold the red onions, please) and it was just what I needed. The dressing was nice and not glopped all over the place, and the portion size as actually quite generous.

Fire up the computer and get the wifi rolling, sit at one of the big tables, and do your work. The staff was super keen, and the nice gal who ran things up front was really on top of trying to help out a few of our odd requests with a very young diner at the table. +1 for the hustle."

Not having lunch the other day I decided that I would come here to try one of their toast options. I went with the farmer which was garlic toast topped with avocado, hard boiled egg and mixed greens. 

The ingredients were simple and fresh. It was a bit surprising that it took over twenty minutes to assemble my lunch. When I was handed the box to go, there were greasy thumbprints all over the outside which did not make for a good presentation. 

Once I was back at the office I opened it to find a huge amount of mixed greens on top. It was easily the size of a dinner salad and perfectly dressed with a mustard vinaigrette. I worked my way down to the other ingredients and got to the toast which wasn&#39;t toast at all but a thick piece of un toasted bread.  It was all super delicious but really an open faced sandwich with a big salad on top. I would come back and try another option as I was impressed by the food."

The Corner Beet is all about healthy juices. They offer some of the tried and true juice mixes, and that&#39;s a good thing. Their juices are organic, cold-pressed. They also offer healthy food, including several toast items from cinnamon and sugar with butter to hummus on toast, as well as a good selection of salads, if you want something more than juice. 

Their overall atmosphere is muted colors and relaxed. More tables and chairs to sit at than comfy chairs, yet these aren&#39;t bad if you decide to work here. Electrical outlets and plugs are a little sparse, but not terrible. You&#39;ll definitely find other places with more outlets than here. But if you want to hang out in a quiet, relaxing space, this really is the place. 

If only they were open later than 4 p.m., that would be ideal. Otherwise this is the perfect place to escape the office in the middle of the day."

Totally friendly, albeit perhaps a touch over-invested, service. The interior is warm and inviting. Menu options are good for vegan/vegetarian soups and salads. Prices are out of control. 

I know organic ingredients and fancy italian juice presses cost and arm and a leg even before mark-up to pay for your overhead and actually make a profit - but I cannot (and even if I could, would not) spend $8-12 on a cup of juice, no matter how nutrient packed. Furthermore, I love me some hippie dippy nutritious foods, but I couldn&#39;t even finish half of one of these juices. So strong and acidic and off-balance. 

The salads are $7-10 depending on the salad and any add-ons/substitutions you make. They are giant so you get bang for your buck. But even with as much as I eat, I couldn&#39;t put away one of these in one sitting and salad doesn&#39;t keep well. The dressing was just so-so and overall I was left with the impression that I could make a comparable salad at home. 

I dunno. Even with capitol hill&#39;s changing demographics, I&#39;m not sure this is the right home for a pricey, specialized place like this. If I could get a small, inventive salad and a juice for just under 10 bucks, I would probably come a few times a week. As it stands, I always have the slight aftertaste of being pick-pocketed when I leave."

Yes, it&#39;s crusty. But not that like the toasted pleasant kind of crusty. The &#34;omg I need my knife and fork to cut this into itty bitty pieces other wise it&#39;s going to tear off the roof of my mouth&#34; kind of crusty. The girls that work here are really nice. The juice is good, but once again overpriced. And warm? I&#39;ve never had warm juice before. I guess my expectations were too high coming from LA.

The juices- Harmony (apple, cucumber, ginger, lemon) and a Carrot/Turmeric were both fantastic! The cold brew was super fresh and the toasts were unbelievable.

This is a GREAT idea for anyone holding a meeting in the morning, trying to do something different than the standard pastry &amp; coffee meeting sustenance. Our client was super impressed and full (but not too full) by the end of the meeting.

The woman acted as if we should know how to order and anything smaller than a 12 ounce juice is not made to go. You have to chug it inside. She should&#39;ve offered the 12 ounce when I asked for a to go cup because I hadn&#39;t even paid yet. The attitude is too cool for school. It&#39;s super expensive and I paid $20 for a salad that is mostly just lettuce and an 8 oz. cold pressed juice. I probably won&#39;t be telling my friends to come here.

Let&#39;s talk about the cold-pressed juice. This is for those of you that are giving The Corner Beet a negative review because of the juice prices... Let me drop a little knowledge. I only do this because I respect their process so much, and the way they make juice is incredibly hard to find. I actually feel like their prices are pretty amazing for what you&#39;re getting. 

A lot of juice cafés sell juice that&#39;s made with a juice extractor, that while quicker and more convenient, it uses a fast-spinning metal blade that generates heat and destroys enzymes in the fruits and veggies you&#39;re juicing. The heat also oxidizes those nutrients, giving you a far less nutritious juice than a cold-press juicer.

The cold-press juicer (The Corner Beet uses a Norwalk juicer... The Lexus of juicers... I would sleep with that juicer) extracts the juice by first masticating the produce, and then pressing the pulp for a super high nutrient juice yield. The process, however, takes a long time. They spend hours making their fresh batches of juice each day. 

So not only are you paying for the organic produce that&#39;s used for your juice, and the max amount of nutrients you&#39;re getting from those fruits and veggies, you&#39;re also paying for the extra time it takes to make such a wonderful juice that I guarantee is made with love and care from the ladies at the Corner Beet.

I highly recommend the Galbi. It&#39;s the beeeeeessssst. Also the West Toast is incredible. I dream about it. Two big pieces of toast (local bread), slathered with delicious goat cheese and topped with some of the best jam of your life. Perfection. 

So go and enjoy - allow yourself to splurge on a juice that your body, mind, and soul will be so incredibly grateful for. Indulge in some killer, healthy, organic food. There needs to be more places out there like the Corner Beet."

But how can you call yourself a juice bar when, upon stepping up to the counter, I was informed that the only two juices that were available were the two (somewhat bizarre) ones that were listed on the chalk board?  Surprised, I asked why, and was informed that they pre-make all of the juices in the morning, so what they have listed is what they have for the day.  

In my experience fresh, raw juice oxidizes as it sits. I suppose it is possible that they have some sort of elaborate system for storing the fresh (as of that morning, at least) juice away from oxygen...but I rather doubt that. Why not have a juicer...and a veg and fruit selection...and...ya know...make juices when the customer orders it?  You can have a menu list...and you don&#39;t have to have every single growing thing available...but some flexibility/variety would be nice.

That said, the chai that they have (that I ordered because I was unimpressed with the juice-situation) was delicious. Not too sweet and had a nice/unique spice.  I might try the food there sometime, now that Earl&#39;s is gone (I work right across the street from this place).

The staff was pleasant, and as I mentioned, the space is nice.  But if they want to build a following they&#39;re going to have to do something about that juice."

Would have been satisfied going to snarfs a couple blocks away for the same type of sandwich for way less money and kind of regret not doing that :(

I need sustenance, which is why I asked for a little bit of juice (that she happily offered samples of earlier). She says she has to charge me. I was quite surprised to be honest. Why do I bother even tipping? I have to grab my own water, silverware, condiments.

I am also not a big café person, but if you are into café culture, Corner Beet probably has the environment you are looking for.

Only three tables, although the space could handle more. Bar seating as well.
Only one person there when I arrived--he had commandeered the only large table for himself, a six-top. Laptop out and cell phone mounted, having a SKYPE conversation that was easily overheard and irritating. Then another customer came in, ordered and started talking very loudly on his cell phone. 
My contemplative pleasure in the surroundings and food took a nosedive. It was kind of heartbreaking.  As I was leaving, I mentioned to the staffer at the counter that I loved everything--too bad the ambiance was shattered by loud cell phone use. Of course she was sympathetic--she understood."

Service was good and a manager came around and checked in with us to see how everything was. 

I will definitely go back."

Throughout our meal, we interacted with the host (owner?), server and chef, and they were each among the kindest people we have probably ever encountered in Denver. The service was near impeccable, and I really just couldn&#39;t get over how nice they all were. 

We were starving (hence the early dinner), and ordered the Banquet Dinner for two for a mere $35. Presentation was lovely and portions generous, I&#39;d say a good 3.5 servings worth for healthy appetites. We took leftovers home and had almost a complete dinner the next night. The combo included chicken and shrimp tandoori, reshmi chicken, lamb curry, vegetable korma, naan and a bowl of ice cream that I agree with another reviewer tasted like mango and cardamom. The korma was the highlight for me, and what I&#39;d order when I return. The ice cream was unique and tasty. Great flavors in all the food, and even some spices that seemed to stand out compared to other Indian/Nepalese food we&#39;ve had. Our shrimp was really salty, which was the only disappointment, and I&#39;d say the naan had a little too much garlic. It did take a bit to get our food, so I&#39;d recommend ordering an appetizer if you go in as starved as we were. But it wasn&#39;t painfully long, and we really got the impression it was because they were back there making a lot of it fresh. Definitely worth the wait to not have dried out food that had been sitting under a heat lamp. Would definitely return, and am anxious to explore more of the menu."

The dish often known simply as Chili Chicken is believed to have originated in the region of central Nepal now known as the Gorkha District, and this melding of chicken, onion, tomato and both bell and chili peppers will present you with a culinary insight into this picturesque Himalayan nation. Pro-tip - order the hearty (and very traditional) wheat bread called Roti alongside to counteract the tasty but nevertheless punchy heat. Due to centuries of cross-cultural exchange, some recipes from neighboring Tibet have been absorbed into Nepalese cuisine as well, like the chicken or veggie dumplings called Momo or the noodle soup known as Thukpa - and these are here for the sampling too. Or, how about one of Namaste&#39;s vegetable curries (Tarkari) like okra, cauliflower, eggplant, tofu... you get the picture. You&#39;ll want to conquer the cliffs of Kathmandu in no time after getting your fill.

But if you&#39;re still not quite taken with any of these suggestions - fear not, because the eatery also has a range of Indian dishes to enthrall you. The pounded, cream-kissed chicken wonder called the Reshmi Kebab does indeed date back to the decadent days of the Mughal Emperors, as you may have guessed from it&#39;s rich flavor and velvety mouthfeel. Or if you&#39;re seeking your daily quota of leafy greens, why not partake of a plate of the lamb-and-spinach concoction known as Boti Saag? And then of course, we can&#39;t forget the always-elegant rice pilaf called Biryani with a helping of plump shrimp mixed in. As if you haven&#39;t guessed already, there is truly something for every palate at Namaste Nepal - a fact that extends to its delectable desserts, such as lightly-sweet carrot pudding (Gajar ka Halwa) or the like-ice-cream-but-even richer offering which usually appears on menus as Kulfi."

We had not had Indian food in awhile and were craving it, but couldn&#39;t narrow down our choices, so this was the best option. The food came hot, flavorful and you get two small (think sauce container sized) ice creams for dessert! I think one is cardamom and the other a mango chutney ice cream. 

It is great that we could order through Yelp!  We will order from here again! I woud also love to try their lunch buffet sometime."

Staff is super sweet and helpful, they will help you find exactly what you want to eat. I got chicken...oh no I forgot...almost sounds like chicken Madrid but it wasn&#39;t quite that spelling. Basically amazing chicken in a coconut sauce with a huge amount of rice, a side of another garbanzo dish, and a spicy salsa to add at my leisure. :) to be brutally honest the outside may look a little sketchy at first but this place is a diamond in the rough :)

I must say that while I was sad to find out that Bengal didn&#39;t make it, these new owners are much better at customer service that the former occupants.

Boy ordered two vegetarian dishes- mutter paneer and aloo gobi.  I ordered the lamb combo plate.  I regretted my order a little as all of the lamb meat was cooked well done (I much prefer a medium rare temperature), but the flavors were quite good.  Both curries that the Boy ordered were yummy.  We were really impressed with the freshness and flavor or the Naan (we ordered Keema Naan and Garlic Naan).  I also found the Kheer (rice pudding) to be richer and more flavorful than at other Indian restaurants I&#39;ve tried.

We&#39;ll definitely be back to try more."

If you have been here before the new management change (April 2016 I believe?) then come on down. This was the first and definitely not the last time we will be here. 

As with most delicious ethnic restaurants this place is in a super sketchy looking shopping plaza with a pawn shop and some other bazaar&#39;s and things. The inside is HUGE. There are a few different levels of seating and two large open sitting areas. 

We came for dinner, but they do have a buffet section and we overheard them tell some other guests it is only for the lunch time. 

We were seated and waited on immediately by a very friendly hostess. We ordered some hot chai (tea) to start as we looked through the rest of the menu. The papadum was delicious according to my wife and she enjoyed all 3 of the chutneys that accompanied it. We had two baskets worth! The chai tea was delicious and tasted just like the chai we had in the Himalayas in India. It is a black tea with spices and dairy. A lot of western and more South-East Asian places (think Malaysian) add a sugar like granulated or condensed milk to sweeten it, but this is not common in India. This is the non-sweet tea. It is a good taste, and I like it both with sugar and without. 

We actually found this place because we were in the mood for some mo-mo&#39;s. Basically Nepalese steamed dumplings with a sauce. We ordered a dinner entree size of chicken momo&#39;s and they were perfectly cooked. The outside wrapping was about 2-3 millimeters thick which made the correct shell-to-filling ratio. It came with lots of them, definitely enough for a full meal. The sauce for dipping was light and tasty.

We also ordered a more Indian dish and had the chicken makhani (a.k.a. &#34;butter chicken&#34;) a little extra spicy. The meat seemed to be a mixture of dark and white meat, tiny pieces. Not my favourite, but it works. The sauce was thick and creamy. We had some garlic naan with it, and the naan was thick and fresh with nice bits of garlic on it. 

Overall, a very tasty place, with very friendly people, and we will be going back again!"

They have only been open for a few weeks, and it was very quiet, but considering it was a Monday not particularly surprising. The owner (?) was so friendly, and even with running out and making deliveries, he made sure that we were getting good service and were happy with our meal. We felt very well taken care of. 

My husband and I ordered the Paneer Pakora as an appetizer, and  A Royal Banquet Spread Dinner For Two for the meal. The paneer pakora was delicious, perfectly spiced, with a really tasty yogurt dipping sauce. As for the royal banquet, I don&#39;t know if just two people could have finished it. Absolutely delicious, and really great portions. The chicken was so tender, once again, perfectly spiced. The vegetable curry was my personal favorite, along with the garlic naan, but everything was superb. The dessert that we had, which I think might have been the &#34;Indian Ice Cream&#34;, was a tender farm cheese with a cream citrus sauce over it. I would have never thought to eat something like this for dessert, but OMG, I would eat this every night if I could. Amazing. I can&#39;t wait to go again. Next time we&#39;ll be bringing friends."

Each of us had different dishes. One person had the vegetable thukpa, one had the chicken kabob and one had chicken korma. All three of us loved our meals. They were plentiful, served nicely and very tasty. The staff were also both helpful and friendly as well as attentive.

I got it to go tonight, completely different experience. The vegetable side which is usually very good was microwaved and burned. Some of the chicken was ok, but half of it was chewy to the point I couldn&#39;t even cut through it. I ordered it extra spicy, and usually it pushes the limits of what I can handle but it was quite mild. They remembered the chutney but forgot the papadam.

We asked if open and they looked around at each other n a guy said no. We aren&#39;t ready after the lady worker asked if they were open. Wtf

Went back. Better service. Greeted when we went in then seated. It was calm and authentic. Decor is dated but affordable. Food was okay. The table chutneys were delicious.

I finally asked her to please take our order. She went off to do something and didn&#39;t bother.

I&#39;m glad I did.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, Namaste is not related to the previous tenant restaurant.  It&#39;s important, because they are different owners and different restaurants.  My benchmark for Indian food in the Denver area is limited to only a few joints.  I&#39;ve tried some of the fast casual places close to downtown, and some of the more established places in the immediate vicinity.  I&#39;ve also enjoyed Indian and Nepalese cuisine in Austin, Houston, and in Great Britain (Wales and Scotland). Namaste was a pleasant surprise because it&#39;s near, I like variety, and I enjoy supporting local businesses.  The food here is somewhat different from other places in the area - and that helps as a differentiator.  Namaste dinner is served thali style. You receive a large plate which is subdivided into sections for different parts of the meal.  They give you a little of a few things along with the entree and rice.  I would have liked to see a little bit more of the sides served (or at least not see visible plate), but the portions of the entree and rice more than made up for that.  We ordered th rogan josh (Kashmiri style preparation of lamb) and a classic chicken tika masala.  Both had excellent flavor.  The pastes used to prepare the curries was very fine and you could not visibly make out any constituent ingredients. For the rogan josh, I kind of like the chunky spices/vegetables (particularly tomato and onions) :D  but the flavor was definitely unique (I think it&#39;s due to the sour cream) - it was a little tangy! The chicken tika masala was great but also different.  Here the chunks of chicken are huge! It&#39;s certainly not a bad thing. The naan was delicious and definitely a must while enjoying curries.  We also tried an appetizer of the vegetable samosas.  These guys were fried to order. They were delicious and paired really well with the accompanying sauces. The sauces (the tamarind based and mint/jalapeño/citrus ones) were the perfect consistency and not watery at all - which is fantastic when applying them to bite of appetizers, papadum, or what-have-you.  

Samir is the owner and is a super likable young guy.  After soliciting our feedback, he gave us a brief run down of the history behind the joint and all that he hopes to build with his new restaurant.  Restaurateurs like Samir are the reason I love trying new joints and supporting local business.  

I have only one complaint.  Since it was my first and only time here it may be just a one-time-issue: the papadum was stale.  No one likes stale papadum. :(...  I hope next time this isn&#39;t a problem because it does form initial impressions (I plan on bringing my family here, next).  I&#39;m glad the rest of the meal negated that experience.  

I can&#39;t wait to try the buffet so that I can get a larger sampling of their preparation of some of my favorite foods.  I also can&#39;t wait to try out some of the deserts. We couldn&#39;t this time because we devoured every morsel of our dinner. Ok, and we had a few 16 oz Tajs to wash down our food.

You should definitely give this joint a try.  If you have any comments or suggestions or critique, make them known. This is how (new) businesses grow and improve."

The owner also chatted with us; he was very nice, and really, everyone should come here. Seems business is a little slow, and it&#39;s probably because this little gem is tucked away. You won&#39;t have to worry about lines...for now, but it&#39;d be nice if they got more business, so come one come all! In any case, can&#39;t wait to try the lunch buffet because this restaurant is truly stunning. Definitely coming back."

The owner was super pleasant, and catering, making my partners and I dining experience that much better! We were huge fans of the table chutney and chips, in addition to the lamb and chicken curries we ordered. I love the plating their food comes in. Looking forward to when they begin serving alcohol (if they haven&#39;t started already) I know at the time of our visit they were in the process of getting a liquor license."

Now this place has been there for a bit but is now under new owners. It is located in a strip mall by Subway off Iliff and Parker Rd. It is not sketchy but rather nice inside. The owner will be remolding soon. With that said the food is out of this world.... Now Indian food is one of my favorites but this is my new favorite place. You just could not go wrong here. The owner Sameer is dynamic and personable and it was great to visit with him as well. If you are looking for a new place to eat or a new Indian restaurant you may want to try this place. Namaste Nepal Restaurant 2648 S. Parker Rd #11 Aurora 80014 YUMMMMYYYYY!

The place is huge with space for around 200, though they only use roughly half of it for the restaurant at the moment with the rest of it opened up for events.   Looks like the perfect place to throw a party!   I ordered the sizzling grilled dinner which was an absolute meat fest.  If you like lamb or tandoori chicken, this has the best of any place I&#39;ve been to in CO.  Every piece of chicken had the spice color down to the bone instead of the thin layer you see at most restaurants.   The closest thing I can compare it to is going to eat at a Nepalese or Indian friend&#39;s house when his mother or father is preparing everything.   I believe the owner&#39;s  father-in-law is the cook so it makes perfect sense!  We will definitely be coming back the next time I get the unmistakable craving for Nepalese or Indian food."

My wife and I had the Royal Banquet for 2.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The prices were extremely reasonable considering the amount of food we received.  In addition to the Royal Banquet, I had a soda and ordered Chicken Madaras to go to eat at work tonight.  Our bill totaled $53.  With the restaurant.com certificate I used, we spent $36 including an $8 tip.  We have enough leftovers to feed my wife and I once more each.  GREAT EXPERIENCE."

It&#39;s typical to have at least one dish in the large, varied spread we ordered fall flat.  Not so at Namaste.  Every dish was delicious, and the flavors varied nicely.

Denver/Aurora native and I&#39;ve been here dozens of times. My kids love it; husband and I always like it. Not your typical chain Italian food, and always like to support a local business. Our experience lately however, I&#39;m not sure we will go back because of numerous really frustrating things: 

-NEVER enough wait staff. In fact tonight when we went, an extremely rude, older waitress practically rolled her eyes at the fact we wanted to sit on the patio. God forbid, it is summer after all. Told us that it would &#34;be awhile&#34; and to be patient. Horribly rude. Weren&#39;t served or even greeted and after 20 mins, we left. Can say I&#39;ve only done that probably 3 times in my entire life. No bartender, no hostess, no manager. Nothing. 
-Smoking and excessive drinking on bar/patio. Sorry. Not a bar, an Italian restaurant. But instead of asking the smoking/drinking patrons to leave, the owners allow it. I guess because it&#39;s a spendy group drinking all sorts of liquor?!? Not a patio I want to eat with my kids on. Twice now. 
Too bad. Our kids do sports in the area and we used to come here once a week. Not anymore."

After I told her I was interested in a Pinot Noir, she flew away and returned with a delicious (&amp; hearty!) pour - buttery soft and smooth. I ordered, naturally, the eggplant parmesan and my gal pal ordered the Gretchen&#39;s pasta which was a ziti with chicken in a vodka sauce. My eggplant was 3 thick slices of fried eggplant covered with cheese &amp; sauce over a bed of spaghetti. I liked how the eggplant was sliced a tad thicker - thin eggplant just doesn&#39;t do it for me. The fresh bread is a focaccia-like loaf, brought hot and fresh out to the table. We shared a small house salad and were able to try both the champagne vinaigrette &amp; the roasted tomato vinaigrette. Both were delicious. 
It has been years since I tried The Bent Noodle and I was surprised at the different menu items. I will definitely be back when I&#39;m craving traditional red sauce (or something a bit more inventive). Jazz on Wednesday nights! Happy Hour Mon-Thurs."

Making it here during happy hour gave us a great price on a caprese salad.  Paired with the warm bread the meal started of great!  On to the main course of a supreme ziti.  It was chocked full of sausage, peperroni, mushrooms, and peppers.  Portions are super big and I ended up only eating about a 1/3 of it.  Since I am an out of towner I didn&#39;t take the leftovers with me but wish I could have!

Others at the table tried the lasagna, chicken parm, and eggplant parm.  No one was disappointed.  

The wat staff was great about refilling water glasses and keeping the wine flowing.  I also appreciated them preparing the leftovers (for those that were taking them) tableside so you could see what was going on.

I will be back in Aurora later this year for work and expect to make another trip to The Bent Noodle!"

Service hasn&#39;t been as stellar as it was the first time we went, but it&#39;s been fine.  Added to the list of items I&#39;ve tried:  

- Eggplant parmesan (good, but nothing special, could have more eggplant and less pasta)
- Shrimp Fra Diavolo, extra spicy.  HELL YEAH!  It won&#39;t kill you the way extra spicy Indian food will, but there was a definite kick to this dish.

I&#39;ve now been back several times and I love their food. I have been back with different people and they have all liked their food as well. The service was great 2 of the 3 times. I got the eggplant parm and thought it was some of the better eggplant I had ever had. It wasn&#39;t oily or over cooked. The pasta was good and the red sauce was fantastic. The third time I came the hostess was on her phone (texting? Facebook? Twitter?) and was consumed. While I waited for the rest of the party to arrive she stayed on her phone. It just looked unprofessional. She was back on it when we left and didn&#39;t even look up when she said to have a good night. For the most party my experiences here have been really great.

Hubs was super hungry.  Since we have been running a lot of errands in this part of neighborhood, we &#34;settled&#34; to go to Bent Noodles.  When we entered this establishment, it was OK.  We are seated all the way back on the extreme Right of this establishment.  The décor looks old, feels old, and so underwhelming at the look of the Menu.

*SIGH*

Our server provide us the Complimentary Bread that is covered with Cheese, that Hubs tends to like it ALOT!

We ordered the following items :

*  Calamari ($8.95)
*  Coffee (Beverage for Hubs) ($2.50)
*  Linguini and Clams($14.50)
*  Roasted Chicken Salad ($11.95)
*  Spaghetti Meatballs ($11.95)

Sorry folks, all the food was indeed bland from the boring menu.  I guess I am NOT used to this kind of cooking let alone the food.  Yes the food came out fast, but it was underwhelming for our tastebuds.

The Calamari was the tiny calamari and it comes with a weird caper mayo blob!  Some of the Calamari is not even battered, and it was uncooked aka UNDER-COOKED including the tentacles and the mantel, aka the &#34;Calamari Rings&#34;.  *DOUBLE SIGH*  Disappointing Calamari Appetizer at $8.95.  The Spicy Sauce that comes with this dish IS NOT SPICY AT ALL!!

As for the Roasted Chicken Salad, it was Doable to Hubs standard.  But I think Hubs is super hungry, so he just ate all of it without a flinch!  Then comes with the Spaghetti Meatballs, the sauce was &#34;SUPER-MEH&#34; to the MAX.  No flavor what so ever, BORING and it DOES NOT WOW Hubs who is indeed craving for Spaghetti Meatballs for ages...  Then the Spaghetti, was perhaps from a BOX, NOT Handmade or Housemade Spaghetti...

As for my order of Linguini and Clams, it seems once again I am underwhelmed with all the food they offer here.  The Clams were those tiny ones.. tasted like it come out from a can kind of Clams..  Not the juicy plum Clams that I was hoping for with the Shell what nots...

Since I cannot finish my order due to the fact of the underwhelming-ness, I decide to bring my food to go.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t like wasting food.  The WHITE TO GO BOXES was NOT meant to be TO GO BOXES with food with sauce, Mind You!  Definitely there are spillage and some of the sauce penetrate thru the box, made the box super soggy from our 20 minutes drive home.  Thank God, I ask for a plastic bag for my to go box...  NO GO to this establishment ever again.  Epic Fai!  My apologies for this rant.

Indeed A VERY DISAPPOINTING DINNER.  Utterly Disappointing Indeed!!

Our server that evening her name is Jody.  Though she is attentive but tends to be &#34;loud&#34; when she speaks...

Left this establishment about 19:10hrs ish.

Went there on a Friday night, and didn&#39;t have a wait which was nice. However, the service wasn&#39;t great. Waitress came and said hi immediately, delivered food promptly, but never came back and checked on us. We were stuck waiting for an offer of a check for way too long, and she was literally just standing at the bar chatting with a coworker. On a positive though, the food was good and my blackberry smash was good, though I would not recommend the Manhattan. I have no idea what that drink was, but it was not anything resembling a good Manhattan. It&#39;s hard to find good food in that area, so I&#39;ll probably be back. But I&#39;ll need to experience better service before recommending it to anyone!"

Great food with very big portions, but be prepared to wait. We&#39;ve been a few times and they just don&#39;t have enough waiters, only two for the entire dining area. The food is well worth the wait though."

Ordered takeout and &#34;they accidentally&#34; put anchovies on the garlic bread. This came to our attention after waiting 3 minutes to be acknowledged and asking for 2 orders to be split. Weird. The food is probably good but no where in the conversation when ordering did anchovies come up. Will probably end up having to try this place on the future due to limited food choices. My friend ended up ordering and they forgot his side of pasta. They also complained of limited sauce on the pasta.

I had the lasagna and at first it looked small but once I started I almost couldn&#39;t finish cause it was packed tight with yummieness!! It was a little pricey but was worth it.

The Food:  The Shrimp Aglio E Olio is my go-to food.  It has the perfect amount of spice, really fresh herbs and vegetables, delicious shrimp, and the pasta is excellent no matter how you ask them to cook it (Al Dente is optional).  The Bruschetta appetizer is delicious as has so many vegetables and herbs piled on the bread that you have to eat it with a fork.  The garlic bread they bring out before the meal is deliciously warm, soft, and savory.  Also, extremely addictive and we tend to chow down on the bread and take most of the rest of the meal home with us.  The prices are not terribly expensive and you get A LOT of food for your dollar.

The Service:  Never had bad service.  Granted, there has been a few minor mistakes, but nothing to write home about.  Most of the staff is extremely professional and well-trained despite the younger age of the servers.  If there is an error with the meal, the server or the manager is quick to correct it and compensate if needed.

The Restaurant:  The building itself is sort of hidden behind a bank within an office park on the corner of Parker and Dartmouth.  Classic modern Italian decor with a nice ambiance.  It&#39;s never once been overly crowded or noisy, even during the weekends.  

The Bent Noodle is definitely a step above most modern American takes on Italian food.  It&#39;s a nice hidden gem in a hidden area of Aurora."

This place was a disaster and the owner was the largest problem. We had a waiter who was not trained properly who spilt a soda on me and broke two glasses doing it and A busser who spilt our water and thirty minutes later spilt another couples water. We had three servers, one who sucked,one who was overly compensating for the ridiculousness happening, and one who mainly kept an eye on us the whole time. We had to move tables because our first server was so awful and just not knowing how to clean up the mess he made. I was looking around for cameras because it was that bad and I am an avid Restaurant Stakeout, Restaurant Impossible, and Mystery Diner watcher. This owner needs to sell before he loses the whole restaurant and the awesome servers who do work there wont have to look for a new job. We did get half of our bill taken off, but the regular returning customer portion (what every restaurant needs) is not happening even though we live so close we could walk there.

The food was amazing. That&#39;s the worst part. Everything else was so bad that we decided we are going to go again just to make sure we were not crazy. We will see then how this place truly is. Too bad this happened to a Yelp Elite. 

I would not suggest this place simply because with management and ownership like that, it&#39;s not going to be a good experience 9 times out of 10. Plus, you could get soaked.

The first time we went we walked in and there was no one waiting to be sat except for us. The host asks us to wait about 5 mins because one of her servers was a little behind so we agreed. 5 mins later she asked to wait an additional 10 minutes to which we told her we would just leave. She ended up sitting us down immediately, but waited 10 more minutes anyway for a server to appear. 

I ordered the ravioli which would have tasted good had it not been swimming in a bowl full of water. It was horrible and completely tasteless. We mutually decided to never come back. My husband ended up calling the manager because he was so displeased about our service and the food, and he gave us a gift card to come back and try it again, so we did.

This time, I made sure to tell them I don&#39;t want my raviolis to be in so much water. They did just that, but both of our meals were still utterly tasteless and needed a lot of salt. Literally tasted like something out of a can. 

People obviously love this restaurant, it just wasn&#39;t for us."

Of course, this review comes with a story. My mother-in-law made a reservation at another restaurant (want to know who... check my next review) for four of us at 7pm on New Year&#39;s Eve. My husband and I showed up to that place at ten till 7. We were prepared to sit at the bar and wait... they weren&#39;t prepared for us. I won&#39;t go into it here (again, see the other review) but basically we left that restaurant at 7:25 looking for a place to eat. I made a reservation at Bent Noodle on Open Table for 7:45. 

We showed up at 7:35. I was greeted nicely and when I told them my last name and that we had just made a reservation the hostess said, &#34;Ah yes, Talia! Table for four. Come with me!&#34; We were seated immediately. 

The service was great. The food was SO. FILLING. and the beers were delish. 

Highlights? 
Cremini mushroom appetizer. AMAZING.
Pasta dishes (everyone got one) were all very very good. 
Caesar salad. Worth the hype. Pretty darn good. You can get anchovies on top (I did) and it made it out of this world! 
Italian beers. Peroni, morretti... very good selection.
Kind wait staff. 
Tiramisu! It was homemade. It had to be. I don&#39;t really dig it but now that I&#39;ve had the Bent Noodle&#39;s... yum! You can taste the lady fingers and the cream... I am not sure but that cream might be homemade too! SOOO good!

One bummer... the lights were too low for my mother-in-law to read the menu but every time I read something to her she said &#34;oooh! I want that!&#34;

Thanks, Bent Noodle, for saving our New Year&#39;s Eve dinner!"

This last time was for Valentine&#39;s Day and it was the same. Good service, good atmosphere, good food. I was a bit disappointed in my dinner, well mainly the sauce.

Décor was pleasant even if it was a little dated and catered fine for a casual or romantic evening out. Our waiter James was very nice, explained the menu when we had questions.

 Fresh bread was on  our table, piping hot &amp; delicious. Calamari was over the top delicious &amp; served with some of the house made tomato sauce which complimented it well. I like the sauces are fresh, it really made a difference. My husband had the lasagna, he enjoyed it. I had fettuccine alfredo and added the breaded chicken. Alas the chicken was very bland but the sauce &amp; noodles were delicious. We let James know the chicken was a dud for us for first time there. We asked he let the chef know to not skip seasoning the chicken next time please. James took half the cost of my plate off the bill which was a complete surprise, appropriate, and appreciated. 

We enjoyed the experience for being a very casual environment &amp; look forward to coming back again. If you are looking for fresh food, decent taste, stop in here. The pricing is a little high for some of the plates but not outrageous at all overall. 

One last side note to the restaurant owners, please check the spelling on your Barq&#39;s root beer on the menu. It&#39;s  not spelled with a G :) We loved our visit &amp; will be back."

Had their delicious minestrone and Gretchen&#39;s with whole wheat pasta.  Whole wheat pasta was a mistake because there original stuff that is made in house is amazing, whole wheat must be barilla.  Sauce was great, chicken was  overcooked. 

Hubs had the supreme ziti which always delivers but a little over done too!  Finished off with some overpriced and sub par espresso (skip it next time) and the phenomenally HUGE and delish Chocolate tower cake. 

A nice meal at a good price with friendly servicel.  Will definitely have to have my fav next time, the Linguine and Clams.  Pork chop special looked incredible but didn&#39;t try it.  Will be back, just maybe not on a Friday because they were much busier and slower than usual which probably resulted in the overcooked chicken and pasta."

Very traditional look and feel as you walk in the door -- not to mention the smell of garlic  so strong you can practically see it rolling throughout the restaurant.   That&#39;s not a bad thing to me.

We happened to be here during Denver Restaurant Week, so we tried that offering.  The calamari appetizer was delicious -- and a large portion.  Not greasy and well cooked.    The bread served with the meal was possibly the highlight of the meal for me.   It was warm, soft inside, chewy outside with a great garlicy/cheesy crust.  I could have eaten an entire loaf of it.  

The Caesar salad was fresh and the dressing was great.   My husband ordered the Bolognese sauce which was made with veal and was good.  I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, which was also good.   Overall the entrees were good .  The pasta was dried and from a box and the sauces were well seasoned, the portions were large and each of us took at least half our pasta dishes home.

For dessert we split a dessert calzone filed with cream cheese and fruit, it was okay.  The calzone part was tasty.  But, the cream cheese was still cold and still shaped like the block it came out of the box in.   The fruit was a syrupy, strawberry sauce that most likely was not homemade and it was drizzled with plain jane watery chocolate sauce.  I was expecting moist, creamy, warm, melty cheese (and if I made this I would have chosen marscapone or ricotta cheese) with fresh sliced strawberries.

However, the highlight of the evening was the service.  Our waitress was a young girl who knew the menu, was able to answer questions about the ingredients and how the dish was prepared.   She checked back on us within 5 minutes of us receiving our entrees.   At no time did we feel rushed through our meal, we sat back chatted, and just enjoyed the Frank Sinatra playing in the background while we finished our wine.

Great, attentive service is what makes me return to a restaurant and we will be back."

Wife really loved the Caprese.  Only thing we didn&#39;t care for was the Spinach Artichoke Fonduta, which our server James ended up taking off of the check, even though we told him that wasn&#39;t necessary.  Great service.

The service was a little too rushed for me, but our server was certainly attentive and friendly. Happy Hours drinks were good, calamari was tasty. It was a little greasy, but I liked it.

The Bent Noodle hits on two out of three: the great service and atmosphere. The food is good, but after several visits I haven&#39;t found it to be much different or more special than many other Italian restaurants. Good, but not great.

I wonder if the place may be going in the wrong direction, judging by the table cloth duct-taped to the wall in the booth on our most recent visit.

Still, the Bent Noodle offers a nice dining experience with decent food and a relaxing atmosphere."

Food came out wrong there were a ton of shells in dinner which the waiter said I should have asked for the dish without shells. Pretty pricey for not so great quality!

However, tonight was just plain bad. It was Sunday night, 6pm, and when we arrived, there was one couple outside, and a party of 8 inside. That was it. We sat down, and the busboy got us waters (more on him later). The waiter came over, and when he left after his intro and us turning down drinks/appe&#39;s, he appeared disapointed and disgruntled we were not going to order the extras. Mind you with are with our 1 yr old in a high chair, and our 3.5 yr old. He finally came back about 10 minutes later to take our order. We didn&#39;t see him again until he brought the bill. It turns out he was the bartender. I also saw him much more interested in a table outside, as well as on the other side of the room (they ordered drinks as I saw him prepare them behind the bar, and serve them, while we were waiting to order). The busboy refilled my water after it sat empty for 5minutes. He also brought our food out. He also brought our to go containers. He also interacted with our 1 yr old. All things a server should do.  It is for those reasons I tipped him directly, and did not leave it for the bartender / server(?)
The food was the saving grace, as always it was excellent. their bread is always fresh and warm and delicious, and the serving portions are worth the price ($15 for chx parm, $16 for big bowl of sausage and pepper ziti). Unfortunately tonight, the service was crap and not up to standards. I hope this is not the norm."

So go here!  It&#39;s sort of tough to get to, near a busy intersection, but they&#39;ve got a big parking lot, which is good because they do get crowded on weekends.  Go on a weeknight for a more relaxed visit.  The pre-meal bread is addictive, and you need to have some.  Entrees are priced about like other Italian places, and you get a good plate of food.  My favorite is the Pasta Di Toscano, though I&#39;ve enjoyed everything I&#39;ve tried over several visits, and the menu is pretty large and diverse.  The wine list isn&#39;t enormous but very reasonably priced, and they have a good mix of reds and whites.  They also do catering and they have a banquet room that can seat up to 65 people, so think of this place for your group of any size and they&#39;ll be able to accommodate you."

It didn&#39;t cover tax or tip - the total lunch bill cost was $6, including the cost of the groupon.  YEAH!!!

I hadn&#39;t been to the Bent Noodle since 2000, when I use to work right around the corner.  I had wondered if the food remained the same as it was very solid ten years ago and a lot can happen in that amount of time.

The service is still friendly and the food is still good.  I feel that you get a good value for you money here.  There lunch menu has a lot of option, but not over the top - it has something for everyone.  I was waffling on what to order and then the waitress told us about the special for the day - She had me at shrimp and angle hair pasta.  It was a delightful sauteed shrimp in white wine, butter, lemon with capers, tomatoes and artichoke hearts served over angel hair pasta.  With a touch of parm and freshly cracked pepper this was definitely a solid dish.  My boss had the Italian Sausage sandwich with a salad and side of marinara dipping sauce.  He liked it alot."

Dining in or take-out, I haven&#39;t really had any major issues. The service is always pretty attentive and the food has always been hot and seems to be fresh.

One nice thing I really enjoy with the Bent Noodle&#39;s take out is their attention to detail. Not only do they individually wrap up and give you an entire loaf of bread, they also include individual to-go containers of oil, vinegar, freshly shredded parmesan cheese, and whatever other accompaniment they think might add to the enjoyment of your meal. 

One appetizer we really enjoy from here is their shrimp fritti, which is battered and fried rock shrimp that comes in a spicy, marinara sauce. I have yet to find another restaurant that reproduces this appetizer, and thusly, have to keep coming back here for more. The entrees are a little more standard across the board for what they offer. I usually go with the chicken parm, the penne alla vodka, or the chicken piccatta - all of which are tasty. My partner almost always orders the lasagna or the supreme ziti. 

Like I previously mentioned, I have never had a bad meal or service at the Bent Noodle. The food has always been very consistent, and continues to meet expectations everytime we order out. To-go usually works out better for us so that we can enjoy some nice wine not on their menu in the comfort of our home. If you&#39;re on this side of town or in the area, the Bent Noodle is a pretty decent place for Italian food."

They have a great wine list, and several other import beers, along with a full bar. Today I had the special, which was linguini with shrimp in a white wine, lemon, garlic, and basil sauce.

It&#39;s hard to know which is warmer - the decor in the spacious dining room, the soothing refrains of &#34;Funiculì, Funiculà&#34; over the loudspeaker, the hospitality of the charming family who runs the show, or the basket of soft bread which will greet you almost as soon as you sit down. And the menu is positively packed with a number of hearty and filling homestyle dishes.

One of my favorite appetizers is the Caprese, where slices of juicy tomato alternate with wedges of soft buffalo mozzarella and leaves of basil and spring greens. The island of Capri is known for its nudist-friendly beaches, and once you try this dish you&#39;ll want to take off your clothes and rejoice too! (But I&#39;d refrain from doing so if I were you). The toothsomely tender fried squid dish known as Calamari Fritti Agliati is another winner.

Pasta lovers really can&#39;t go wrong with the Suprema Ziti (featuring a substantial amount of pepperoni, sausage and crunchy veggies and blanketed in Mozzarella and Parmigiano cheeses), or the rather more waistline-friendly Pasta Mediterra, with its tempting tomatoes and Feta cheese.

And the main courses are equally entertaining, whether you choose the shrimp-and-cheese stuffed fish dish called Salmone Ripiene, or a tender cut of veal in a lemony-capery Piccata sauce. 

Mangia, mangia! Truly, that&#39;s the catchphrase at The Bent Noodle."
the-bent-noodle-aurora,Michael K.,AVMipR-r5alsUi9r33IW0Q,"Centennial, CO",0,1,1,32,243,4asEMeQ3yDaGmVXFmUOPhw,2.0,2012-03-02,"I&#39;m actually not happy about the two star&#39;s I&#39;m giving Luigi&#39;s Bent Noodle. We haven&#39;t been to this place in many years, so  Mrs. K and I decided to dine here once again because we had fond memories from our previous visits so long ago.

The interior is so cozy, with checkered table cloths, lit candles and Frank Sinatra on the overhead. A comfortable place to spend and evening with my lovely wife. The service was wonderful as well. Very attentive and quite personable.

So why am I only awarding two stars to Luigi and his crew? Two factors. The first is related to cleanliness. Our table was dirty and the ledge next to our booth that separates the dinning room from the bar area, which was at eye level for me, had at least a half an inch of dust and dirt as well as debris that other patrons had tossed up there. A dead leaf form the parched plant that was sitting above our table actually fell onto our table as we were eating our dinner. How hard is it to water a plant? There was also a laminated card that listed their desserts clipped into one of those card displays attached to the condiment caddy that was covered in grease, sticky chocolate syrup and hair. I grabbed it to read the fine print, that&#39;s when I discovered its less than appealing condition. I quickly put it back and then regretted grabbing it in the first place. Ewww.

Secondly, the food was just not that good. Extremely overpriced for what you received. Wait, that&#39;s not entirely accurate, actually, it was just the entree that was sub par. The minestrone was really good as was the ice cream sundae I had post meal. The Fettuccine Alfredo was listed at $15.95 and I chose to add four (4) shrimp to it for an additional $4.00 making the total price around $20. The portion was undersized for that price, the fettuccine was under cooked (I love al dente, but this was extreme), the sauce was thin and lacked flavor and the 4 shrimp were boiled and flavorless. I was really disappointed. Also, none of the entrees come with a soup or salad, you have to pay extra for these if you want one.

Also, a suggestion to the wait staff, when people order appetizers, please give them time to finish them prior to bringing the entrees. We literally had maybe 5 minutes with our appetizers when the entrees showed up. We then had to make a choice to let either the appetizer get cold and move on to the entree, or let the entree get cold while finishing the appetizer. I like fast and efficient service, but there has to be a cadence to it, timing is everything.

I know that Luigi&#39;s can do better than this. We used to really enjoy this place. I&#39;m sad to see that it has declined over the years. Nothing that couldn&#39;t be overcome with a little tune up though. =] Take heed Luigi&#39;s Bent Noodle, you can regain your appeal if you just pay a little more attention to the little details. =]

When it arrived, it tasted and smelled funny.  In my opinion, the source of the problem  was either the cream sauce or the fontina cheese. The dish had the distinct and recognizable flavor that dairy has when it&#39;s  going bad. The waiter tasted some and agreed that it was off.  He apologized, took the plate away, and said to order something else on the house.  I ordered fried calamari, which was good, and tiramisu, which was OK.  When my bill came, the server had comped the pasta but not the calamari or the tiramisu. He claimed that manager would&#39;t let him.  Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t have minded paying for the calamari, but the kitchen had prepared and served me spoiled food!  It would have been a nice gesture to comp the dessert.

The atmosphere lends itself to a leisurely dining experience, one of those places where you aren&#39;t rushed and you can make a nice evening out of dinner.

Good choice and I will return."

Fair prices and Large helpings! My wife and I split an entree and ended up taking half of it home! We like their complimentary bread better than Macaroni Grill and Maggianos.
But, anybody can do decent Italian. Just cover it in cheese and garlic and make me fat and happy with free bread and a little crooner&#39;s music. So here&#39;s why I&#39;m giving these guys five stars: they knocked the customer service experience RIGHT OUT OF THE PARK!!! Fewer and fewer businesses are getting that one right. Some can&#39;t even come close. 
My adorable three year old daughter asked our server for their (AMAZING) spumoni ice cream. He brought one out for my wife and I to share, and another one (freebie) for her to enjoy! And hers was covered with whipped cream and cherries. It&#39;s the simple things that count!
Our entire experience from the time we walked through the doors was like a mini vacation from the crazy reality of hectic life. I felt like we were the most important people in the restaurant.
Well done Bent Noodle! We&#39;ll be back very soon!"

So. A catfish meal with fries and coleslaw is 13.50, and all the sides are the same price. But, if you change your sides they add $2.00 to the price. 6 shrimp, 2 sides, is $13.50. But to add 4 shrimp to a meal it $8.00. Lol. 2 bucks a shrimp. That means, for $23.50 you can get 2 pieces of fish, 4 shrimp, and the smallest sides in existence in a hot restaurant(AC didn&#39;t work).  On Iliff and chambers is Que&#39;s Food Truck. I suggest you go there. Better food, prices, and service."

As some of the best BBQ shops go they are small, limited decor, and a wait. This place has those things going for it. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
The food ok. There were a few large pieces of fat in my chopped beef sandwich. I would have preferred a little finer chopped beef. The mac &amp; cheese was standard nothing really unique. But the greens were really good. Large pieces cook well not all shrunk up and over cooked.
The peach cobbler wasnt as sweet as I would have liked, but it was moist and not all dried out.
I would go back so try some of the other menu items."

The sides portions are small everything was good except I didn&#39;t care for their mac and cheese it tasted a little boxy to me however the cobbler was delicious.  They where out of shredded beef  sandwiches,cornbread and I got the last 2 orders of cobbler. When you come for soulfood you want the whole experience of homemade cooking with everything on the menu available to order that was disappointing it wasn&#39;t.

I got a rib &#34;sandwich&#34;, though that consisted of 2 individual beef ribs and a single piece of garlic toast.

So I got 2 ribs, toast, fries, a half cob of corn and a drink for $12 and change. Left hungry.

Only 1 type of sauce on the table, hot, we&#39;ll that and ketchup. I saw some sweet baby rays on a shelf in the back...maybe it&#39;s just for the pulled pork and shredded beef.

Meat was good and the menu is pretty expansive for a small joint, which is the main reason my rating isn&#39;t lower. Honestly, I was most frustrated with the wait. Ribs take forever to cook, I get that, but they should already be premade, so making a plate such as mine shouldn&#39;t take 15+ min.

May give it another shot when I want a fix of chicken and waffles, they certainly smelled good and the waffles are made fresh, not frozen."

I go to yelp to help me decide where I should eat.  I like to visit the Mom and Pop places and avoid the chains.  I can get the chains anytime and anywhere.  I saw the ad for Blaze BBQ and Soul Food.   My appetite was intrigued.  I&#39;m from the South, and really enjoy BBQ and soul food.  What could go wrong?

Unfortunately, I found out.

The place was clean, and the staff friendly, but I wouldn&#39;t say completely knowledgeable, for when I inquired about pepper sauce for the greens, I got a blank stare and a passing reference that there is hot sauce on the table.  What?  A soul food restaurant and you don&#39;t know what pepper sauce is?

I got the chopped brisket sandwich with a side of greens, figuring that would suffice.  Most other BBQ places, it would.  But not here.  I was disappointed with the serving size of the side item.  Instead of served on the plate with the sandwich, it was placed in what I would call a small bathroom sized Dixie cup. Barely enough for two bites.  Coupled with the lack of pepper sauce, I was not a happy camper.  I will say the the greens were good, just not near enough for having paid 3 dollars for this small portion.

The sandwich also fine, but nothing stood out about it.  Had to go to the counter to get any sauce, for none was available at the table or anywhere else in the dining area.

Overall, a bit discouraged after seeing such good reviews on Yelp.  

Overpriced for what you get."

I&#39;ll eat at a gas station and be happy if the food is good, but this was a poor showing on all fronts.

The ribs I had were tough and they don&#39;t even have sauce on them. There is also no sauce on the table, you have to ask for it. The one good thing i can say is that their sauce is good.

They are expensive for what you get. Ribs are three dollars apiece. I had two sides, the baked beans and the coleslaw. The beans were pretty much out of a can with a little sauce cooked into them, and were edible but boring. The slaw was tasteless. I had one bite and chunked the rest. Sides are also three dollars apiece, and are roughly a meager four ounces, the size of a cup for condiments at most places.

Their fryer wasn&#39;t working, so I couldn&#39;t try the fish. Also they serve greens, but have no pepper sauce. I&#39;m from Louisiana and you put pepper sauce on greens down south.

The people are nice, but the food has no soul."

It&#39;s simple....DON&#39;T WASTE YOUR TIME! We anticipated trying this establishment out since it was listed as one of the top Soul Food restuarants in the Denver/Aurora area.

We called to speak with someone to let them know we were in route(it was 7:45) and would be arriving around 8:20 as we realized they closed at 9:00, they said no problem. We eventually find the place and our time of arrival was 8:30.  I failed to mention that we called to inform the worker that we were in the area; however, couldnt find the place and if they could direct us. 

He placed us on hold and never came back to the phone(we could hear them talking in the background, by the way) we hung up, called back and obviously the line was busy! We found the poorly lit establishment at 8:30 only to find a locked door AND the co-workers purposely ignoring us! WHO DOES THAT!

Poor Customer Service, lack of professionalism, AND JUST PLAIN RUDE! If the owner of this establishment happens to read this: FIRE YOUR YOUNG, UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF and start over OR CLOSE at 8:30 if your goal is to be closed by 9:00! Clear and simple!

Side Note: The nerve of the employee to tell us prior to our arrival the first time we called that the only reason Southern Hospitality is listed above them on the top 5 is: &#34;they hating on them&#34; 

Sir, maybe a bit of advise, your eatablishment has NO SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY."

The two ribs were good ane the greens were alright. The prices here are ridiculous for the amount of food you get. All sides are $3.

The Mac and cheese was definitely homemade, full of rich gooey Cheeses..yes cheeses- this isn&#39;t a one hit cheese wonder- there are layers of yum happening. Soft noodles, a sharp cheddar, a gooey smooth cheese that melts all over your tongue, and at the end just a touch of that baked crispy bit from the top crusty potion. If you&#39;ve had your favorite Auntie&#39;s Mac and cheese, you&#39;ll know what I mean. Layers of goodness and not a dry bit in there anywhere. The greens also have that same hand of care caressing them, slightly smokey, somewhat salty and tiny bit tangy. A hit of the hot sauce really makes them pop. I would love to review the catfish, but the one flaky crispy tiny bite I snatched off my husbands plate disappeared in a flash and before I could get any more he had it eaten all every last morsel! It looked really good and since he inhaled it, I&#39;m pretty certain you also won&#39;t be disappointed. Unless you make the mistake of not ordering it, and having a non sharer dining companion ..like me. That being said I wasn&#39;t generous with my Mac &amp; cheese either. ;) so there&#39;s that.
Oh wait, we are talking bout a BBQ place, let me get back on track..they were good, smokey and delicious but I&#39;m no rib expert- so all ya&#39;all BBQ experts will eventually chime in. Go try it and support some local soul food will ya? I need this Mac and cheese in my life."

The ribs and greens made me smile.  The Catfish and mac and cheese were ok but could have been better. Cheese wasn&#39;t creamy and the fish was slightly over cooked and could have used more spice. I&#39;m luck they didn&#39;t have bread pudding because I would have caved for dessert. 

The people working and running the place were very nice and caring.  Service was there! 

They lost one star for serving the people in the dinning room with togo boxes. It&#39;s very unwelcoming.  Most of the people had coats on.  It was plenty warm but the atmosphere didn&#39;t dictate that they should relax.  Not the kind of place to go on a date after the movies.  Americans are to cozy eating out of a box but please serve my dinner on a plate with adult size silverware. Paper is more than fine.  I know i would have bought more food if i had felt more at home. 

The tv&#39;s are fine and so is the radio but please chose one or the other.  It was very overwhelming.  It was noisy.

I actually really liked the food, which is the only reason it is getting 3 stars. When my husband and I stopped here, we ended up waiting nearing an hour and a half for our food to show up. Turns out they forgot us. We realized this after 30 minutes. Took about an hour for them to prepare the food once they realized. Everything had a really great flavor, but the ribs were not as tender as I would have liked. I have a feeling they ran out of food and we&#39;re rushing to give us something.

There are a few things that I was disappointed in. First, we have come here a couple times. If you come earlier in the day the helpings are generous. We came here about an hour before closing and instead of a health rib bone, we got 3 tiny pieces that barely qualify for rib tips at best. The catfish is really good and same with the pulled pork and sides. 

The second thing that i found disappointing is the price. I understand you have to pay for quality but for my pulled pork sandwich it was $7 with no sides or drink. I have to then pay $3 for sides and another $2 for a drink. That makes a really expensive meal for lunch or dinner. The catfish meal comes with one filet, one rib, 2 sides and a drink for $11. 

Lastly, the atmosphere inside can use some improvement. The biggest thing that I cant stand when we are eating there is how loud the music is. I totally like good music and it can really help a dining experience... but it is so loud we cant even have a conversation with the people we are with because we cant hear one another. We have tried to sit in various places inside, thinking maybe the music just echos in one corner or the other but nothing helps. One other suggestion I would try to make is to not provide those who do want to eat inside, to eat out of to-go boxes."

First my disappointment to get it out of the way.  For the size of the sides, the $3 price is too much.  Although I didn&#39;t count them, there were maybe 20 individual fries and the slaw was maybe 2z.  They need to either bring down the price or increase the size.  This is the reason for 4 stars VS 5.

Now, on to the good... This place has been open for just over a month and it seems as if they are still learning which is okay.  My guess is the owner is new to the owning of restaurants.  The service was nice and friendly, even the cook checked in on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal.  Although I don&#39;t drink, a liquor licence to serve simple bottled beer would go nicely with the ribs and the three TVs. 

I tasted a bit of my husband&#39;s rib and was I ever impressed. Again, I don&#39;t really like pork ribs but this was so good I ordered another for myself.   I see myself visiting again in the near future.  $3 for single rib seems like a lot but the taste and size make it worth it to me.  These ribs are a dry rub seasoned and not saucy like Dickey&#39;s or Famous Dave&#39;s which is what is most appealing to me.  The menu is basic which is good.  

I have high hopes for this place because we just don&#39;t have any good bbq places in Aurora.  Eat local!"

You can taste the propane on the ribs and they were very hard and dry like they were sitting out all day, the mac and cheese taste like it came out of a box I could get better at KFC, the greens were ok but they were from out of a can. My husband had the catfish and red beans and rice he took two bites and was ready to go. I don&#39;t see this place lasting very long I have had much better Soul Food around town, but this place is not real Soul food I say save your money."

I will say the food was good and the people that work there very friendly.  What I did not like was the cost.  My husband and I each had two ribs a piece.  Sides are separate.  We figured for the price the sides would be enough for two.  Wrong.  Barely enough for one!  We spent over $25.00 to include key lime pie and left hungry.

The first time I went, I had the brisket sandwich, which was tasty. I ordered it again last night and it was absolutely horrible. The meat was SO tough it was inedible and I threw the whole thing away. If I&#39;d dined in I would have sent it back in a heartbeat. The peach cobbler also varies-my first visit it was yummy but the last time it was hard and crusty. The ribs tasted old too, smoky flavor but way too dried out."

This was my first foray into it and I have to say, I am absolutely blown away! The food was fantastic. As I tend to do when I go to a new place, I order a bunch of small things and sample, at least that&#39;s what I thought I was doing. I ordered the rock and cat combo, I chose red beans and rice as well as the mac and cheese as my sides. As a side note, I have never had catfish before because I&#39;ve often been paranoid of the idea of eating a bottom feeding fish, but for some reason I was adventurous. Sadly my food was cold by the time I got around to eating it (Through no fault of their own!), but that did not make the food bad and for that I was impressed! The catfish was still flaky, somewhat crisp and the breading was seasoned well, the mac and cheese is incredible it has already become a staple for me there. The Rib was not the best I&#39;ve had but not terrible either, very fatty with a good deal of tendon from the &#34;tip&#34; left on and not overly meaty, but still a good smokey flavor with a nice rub, the red beans and rice kind of reminded me of pintos over rice, however, even with that take they were flavorful and delicious. I also got a hot link as they recommended it, if you like spicy then this will tickle your tongue nicely, it&#39;s very, very large, so expect to get full if you order the sandwich. I also got the chili cheese dog and once again was surprised by the portion size, an extra large all beef dog in a grilled bun, with thick meaty chili and covered in shredded cheese, this alone makes a fine meal as well. I ordered cornbread but I did not receive it, ah well better luck next time and the employee&#39;s were friendly, it had an excellent community atmosphere where they make you feel at home. The tables aren&#39;t set up ideally and spacing could use some work, but otherwise, televisions playing, some good music in the background, I could easily stay and eat if I wanted and not feel out of place. four stars as it wasn&#39;t perfect,  but I&#39;d say it definitely has potential and I will be back for seconds!"

The bread was lightly toasted and the meat and cheese was very tasty.  There was also some fresh avocado on there that added a nice flavor.  I did pay about $15 for the sandwich, a coke and tip which was a little pricey, but there are other less expensive options on the menu that looked good too.  I suppose I didn&#39;t have to tip but when you pay with a credit card the card reader suggests a tip.  I think the staff deserved it because they were friendly and they worked hard to get the orders out quickly during the lunch rush."

Great deal though their horchata isn&#39;t my favorite. It&#39;s extra creamy, sweet and milky which I am not used to. I prefer the more watery horchata. 

The worker there was super friendly and helpful as he could tell that it was my first time there. I tried the four ingredient torta for $7.99 called chalinga with steak, onions, chipotle sauce, franks, tomatoes and avocado. I loved the torta bread and how it was wide, flat and rectangular. There&#39;s communal table seating inside with high chairs. Tortas are served on plastic frisbee-like plates. 

My friends also enjoyed their chicken and egg torta called Chiva. You can get jalapeño rather than chipotle sauce if you prefer."

The restaurant is reminiscent of Mexico, but would be considered &#34;divey&#34; by American standards. Don&#39;t let that fool you! This place makes some of the best food I&#39;ve ever had! My boyfriend and I both ordered the Nortena and added queso fresco.  I literally inhaled the sandwich. The bread was nicely crisped on the outside (and slathered in melted butter) and so soft inside. The combination of the chorizo, skirt steak, chipotle sauce, and cheese was delightful. Don&#39;t come here if you want a light meal! The sandwiches are large and filling!"

And being the curious foodie I have been wanting to spread my wings just to see if my attraction to Las Tortas is founded in fact or simply desire.  In a way I feel that I have been unfaithful.. ce&#39; la vie.  

The sitting area at Las Tortugas is clean and utilitarian - you can tell that this place is set up for an onslaught of customers if needed.  Long stainless steel tables, stools and paper towels.  I walked up to the counter and attempted to read the menu on the wall using my rudimentary Spanish skills.  The lady behind the counter sensed my gringoism and handed me a menu in English.  There is definitely a different selection of ingredients to choose from here - pork chops, hot dogs....  I selected the Espanola (pork, ham and 2 different kinds of cheese).  I got it to go and raced home to plunk myself down and enjoy.  It was good - in addition to the meats and cheeses it had the usual fixings plus I had them add the chipotle sauce, this last ingredient gave it a little spicy kick that was a nice addition.

The menu is in Spanish, so once again, my limited knowledge of the language got me by.  Granted I took a fellow reviewer&#39;s recommendation and ordered up the Hawaiana, I could&#39;ve figured out the menu to a degree.  Tons of options, so take your time!

What a great torta!  There just something about the combination of pork and pineapple that I love.  So tasty!  A torta here is a few bucks more than Tortas y Tacos up the street, but also considerably larger.

Las Tortugas was a bit difficult to find:  it&#39;s toward the northeast end in the square-ish strip mall on the east side of Peoria/Del Mar Circle.  Plenty of parking, too.

Tortuga means &#39;turtle&#39;, and just like a real turtle, these sandwiches have a buttery, delectable outer shell and are ramrod-full of hidden hot cheesy-meat flavor.  Also, the sandwiches kind of look like turtle shells; a soft domed top, if you will.  I know I will, again and again.

I had the Tejana, which is chopped pork, ham, and creamy handmade oaxaca cheese, melded with refried beans, fresh tomatoes, onions, avocado, and jalapenos.  If it sounds good on paper, wait till it open-hand-slaps your taste buds.  I&#39;m posting a picture of this, so check it out kids. 

$6.50 a sandwich is a fair price cause you are about to get meat-bombed.  I will honestly be surprised if I am hungry again before tomorrow morning.  

Las Tortugas&#39; Mexico City flavor will always have a place in my heart.  And mouth.

If you&#39;re hungry and brave try the Cubana, otherwise pick and chose your combinations of pork and other delectable meat products. A personal favorite? The Borracaha.

I had the squeezed orange and carrot juice.  i prefer this to aguas frescas as it is all juice, however there are many more flavors available with aguas frescas.  I also ordered the lambada torta.  i believe pork, pork sausage, egg, beans, avocado, tomato, onion, and jalapeno on toasted buns.

My friend wanted to take me out for my b day dinner. I chose here.
Love the changes. They got rid of the weird fish stuff. I know I may be weird. But I hate looking at fish and it&#39;s looking back at me.
They increased the variety and I enjoyed it all.
Only thing the bugged me is seeing the hostess/waitress on her phone texting or whatever. Very unprofessional.  Meanwhile we had dirty plates on the table and drinks that needed refills.
Please use your phone on your time. Not the customers time.
Overall 5 stars and I&#39;ll be back next time I&#39;m in town."

I went to the Guadalajara Buffet at dinnertime on a Friday. The place had only a few patrons. We found chicken bones in the tamales, which were not good. The enchiladas were stuck to the pans and looked and tasted like they&#39;d been sitting there under the heat lamps all day. The ground beef was covered with a dried layer from sitting for so long and was extremely salty. Didn&#39;t find any shredded cheese, guacamole, sour cream or salsa. The salad bar had plenty of iceberg lettuce and diced tomatoes, but little else. Not even dressings. The rice pudding was nothing but a  milky soup.

The food was awesome! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever eaten everything off my plate at a buffet before; there&#39;s always one or two duds, but not this time. The enchiladas with both red and green sauce were my favorites. The ceviche was excellent too. They have horchata to drink, which I love, and a delicious marinated pork.

This place has it all and you get to eat it all.  There are delicious cheap thrills like Jalisco-style taco that come fresh out of the deep fryer and then drenched with a mild salsa.  There are also a fantastic variety of soups from Menudo to Posole.  You can also go the gringo route and assemble yourself a taco salad - a 2,000 calorie heaping of tortilla chips, ground beef, olives, sour cream and nacho cheese - you won&#39;t even know you are eating salad!  But my favorite section is the varieties of stewed meats, which seem to make the most sense at a Mexican buffet.  A rich birria that isn&#39;t at all gamey.  Heavenly carnitas that are so tender and juicy.  Green chili that can compete with the best of them.  Yeah...I enjoyed everything here going down.

I didn&#39;t enjoy this meal coming back.  Maybe it was food poisoning or maybe it was the taco gods punishing me for being too gluttonous.  Regardless, I spent the next 24 hours clutching the bowl of my toilet as if my life depended on it.  Now, I cannot think about going back to this place without the painful memories of a 24-hour long Exorcist movie reenactment and the days of sore abs I encountered after all of the powerful retching that occurred over that period."

They do however offer a great selection of authentic Mexican entrees and almost everything I tried was pretty tasty.  I recommend trying the ceviche, the smothered tamales, the shrimp and cactus spaghetti, and definitely the pork ribs in spicy cactus sauce.  The pork posole and menudo were also very good.  Skip dessert though - nothing but white cake, jello flan, and canned fruit.   Plus, the price for dinner is only $10.99 making this a steal if you&#39;ve got a big appetite but a small budget."

Well... to be honest, high expectations for a buffet mean very little in the long run.  The &#39;best&#39; Mexican buffet in my memory is that of my childhood trips to the long-departed Pancho&#39;s in Lakewood.  

My only disappointment of the night is that the restaurant was not much more busy than it was.  When we first went up to the buffet there were a number of dishes that were either out or on their last leg.  However, very quickly the kitchen replaced all of those with piping hot, and absolutely delicious, food.  I made a valiant effort to try everything, but there was just so much delicious food that I cannot in good conscience say I did justice to all of it.  With so many tasty options from which to choose I cannot say that I decided on a favourite (perhaps I can do so on one of the many future trips which I have planned).  

I was not terribly taken with the dessert options, they seemed little different in kind or quality from what you would find at any generic buffet.  However, I can&#39;t hold that against them, because I would gladly skip dessert for one extra spoonful of posole."

I just don&#39;t understand the over-the-top positive reviews.  I went back, due to the insistence of a friend.

The place is pretty dirty and run down, particularly the bathrooms.  The &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican beverages are watered down mixes dispensed from a soda fountain.  Their idea of flan is white gelatin blocks floating in water.  The other &#34;stars&#34; of the desserts area were overripe melon varieties and stale boxed cookies.  The pork (I sampled 3 varieties) has a rancid taste and veins/arteries (maybe that&#39;s why I had digestive &#34;issues&#34; for the next several hours.

All of the hot food items on the buffet when I was there were held at about room temperature.  They had some beef ribs that were OK.  The enchiladas (2 varieties) had cooled to the point of being hard cheese in the middle and had little flavor.  The rice was pretty good, actually.  They also feature spaghetti floating in congealed margarine...yumm!

I guess the price is reasonable ($9.95 for regular buffet and $15.95 for a seafood buffet option.)  The employees were pleasant and attentive; I&#39;m just scared of the food and won&#39;t be back."

With that said Guadalajara prepares their version of these more authentic dishes but also leave room for the Mexican food fans that don&#39;t stray to far from burritos and fajitas. From what my taste buds gathered, the food was pretty good, not great but good and of course you can eat as much as you&#39;d like. Standouts for me were the barbacoa selections and the seemingly out of place, BBQ ribs.

The price is right too, and the people watching on Colfax is a great added feature.

OK, yes, this is a buffet. Many will let this term alone deter them from checking this place out. Perhaps they are *slightly* justified as &#39;buffet&#39; and &#39;quality&#39; are two notions that don&#39;t overlap that often in reality. But in this case, I would recommend making an exception and giving Guadalajara a chance. The food is surprisingly good for a buffet and some of it is really outstanding - I think their meats are their strong point.

Single best item? Actually, I really think it&#39;s their green chile. I consider myself an outright chile snob and try it pretty much everywhere I go. So far, my top spot has belonged to El Taco de Mexico (though it&#39;s a little thinner than I prefer). But I think it has been beaten, by chile on a buffet no less. Guadalajara just does it right - perfect heat, tons of pork, right consistency, garlic you can actually taste... man it&#39;s good.

The selection has varied dramatically each time I&#39;ve been, so I&#39;m not sure what their standard items are. They had some incredible crispy pork ribs one day, their barbacoa is really good (I&#39;m not even a big beef person), and they have some very decent pozole and crispy tacos (tacos Jaliscos I think they&#39;re called).

The only item that has been consistently disappointing are the tamales. This is a shame, because tamales can be SO good. But theirs tend to be quite dry and crumbly in texture (not enough lard?) and they use chicken, which is fine I guess, but I really prefer my tamales with pork. Oh, also, the flan could definitely use some improvement.

I wanted to provide some negatives for a balanced review, but they are honestly not big deals. There&#39;s so much to try there and the overwhelming majority of it is quite good stuff. For $10 (or like $14 on weekends), it&#39;s a great way to try a lot of different stuff."

Viva el Chef Chivo! There are 4 stations of delectable cold and hot food, and not ONE SINGLE SHRED OF ORANGE CHEESE. The abominable TexMex staple is banned, if only in the minute children section where there was melted goop for nachos. 

I went last night elsewhere and paid $20 for a piece of grilled fish with rice. Guadalajara&#39;s spread has the real deal in fish, meat, chicken, pork, vegetarian. It is all delicious and each dish is differently and wonderfully flavored. $9.99 for all you can eat, at dinnertime. $14 on weekends.  Fantastic.

The nationalistic Mexican chef bitch prevailed in me as I tried morsels of every single thing. And I was really pleased!  Go for food you will never dream of in Sam&#39;s or TacoBell or such horrors. Authentic, with real finds such as: Barbacoa de Chivo (roasted goat in spicy tomato broth), Chicharrón and Costillas en salsa verde (pork rinds and chops in green salsa), ceviche (fish cooked in lime juice, served on tostadas), Caldo de Mariscos (Seafood soup), Camarones a la Diabla (Devil -chipotle- sauce Prawns), Salsa a lo macho de Jalisco (tree chile and oil paste), and -my favorite- nopalitos (cactus paddle) cooked three different ways!! Chef Chivo will heat tortillas to order so you can make tacos or be a true Mexican and tear them in six equivalent triangles to curl into edible spoons.

And finally, the dessert!  Agh, I was so full of good stuff, but, alas, MORE FINDS:  the Postre de Manzana (Apple slaw), Gelatina de Rompope (eggnog jell-o, I think some other reviewer mistook this for flan), and the magnum opus: Capirotada or Torrejas (depending where you are from): magnificent combination of fried baguette slices drenched in molasses and cinammon syrup and topped with plump raisins, shredded coconut  and fresh cheese. Dont miss it, as it is served warm, it was on a hot plate adjacent to enchiladas, not in the dessert section.  

Walk around first, taste it all in tiny bits, and then make your mind of what you like best. It will be really hard."

I wish I had come sooner!  Why It took me so long to try a restaurant literally 15 minutes (walking!) from my front door, I will never know. 

Finally last week after running some errands with my mother, I decided that we should stop and try out the food. 

I sort of had to persuade her, as she didn&#39;t take time to &#39;dress up to go out&#39; as it were, but I assured her that this place would be full of &#39;average joes&#39; and that it was all about the food. 

Turns out I was right, as I saw the gamut of Aurora residents all in their day to day attire.  Did anyone have their &#34;Sunday Best&#34; on? Nope!  I love an unpretentious environment and extremely good food!

The buffet smelled great and I had no idea where to start.  Our server took me around their soup / sauce station (for lack of better term, many different dishes most of them soups or sauces) and pointed out what was spicy as I mentioned that I loved spicy.  

I chose 2 of the soups after being informed they were both spicy.  I am terrible with remembering names, but one was shrimp and the other was mixed shrimp and fish. Both had the hominy and a similar soup base and they were quite tasty.  My mother tried some of each and agreed that the way the hominy was served in such soups put her Dad&#39;s version to shame.  I remember a quote something like &#34;If Dad used to make it this way, I would have loved eating it as a kid!&#34;

I also made sure to try the green chile sauce that others have raved about and I was quite impressed.  The flavor went well with all of the food I could load on my plate and I even had to go back for more.  

The number of dishes they have is well over what any one person could hope to eat in a single sitting, but between the 2 of us, eating bites of each others dishes, we both tried a good chunk of it and everything was excellent!

In all, I think I tried 2 of the chicken preparations, the Pollo Adobado and another which was definitely flavored of chipotle and prepared as a BBQ style; I tried 2 different enchiladas, chile rellenos, tamales, the beans and rice with plenty of green chile on top, some of the chips and salas and more.  I cannot even remember all the small bits and pieces but every single bite tasted of warm home made goodness.  MMMmmmmm!

They had a few different salsas and I made sure to sample them with the apparently house-fried chips.  The green tomatillo salsa was wonderful as was the dark brown one, again I forget its name.  As far as I could tell, no pre-packaged bagged chips were in use, as they were all sorts of random sizes and tasted quite fresh.  

The desserts were reasonable, although I do not entirely consider dessert at a buffet the main attraction.  One reviewer mentioned Flan, while another mentioned an eggnog jello.. I am uncertain as to what it was, other than tasty.  The rice pudding was decent as well. 

We both left stuffed well beyond what our stomachs could reasonably handle and loved all of it!

I will definitely be coming back in the future and I hope my mother will also.  While she enjoyed her meal immensely, she doesn&#39;t like going out nearly as much as I do. 

Bottom line: If you want excellent Mexican food and have a big appetite, Guadalajara will fill you up and you will love every last bite!"

I came here with my coworker, party of two on a Saturday  night without reservation. It is located on the east Colfax. Once we stepped in, my instinct told me we were at the right place. Full of people on weekday night! 
We chose to sit at the bar, watching the chef crafting his culinary work as we ate. The menu is not overly extensive but has some highlight specialties. We got some sashimi : salmon, tuna, yellowtail, white tuna, abaco tune and red snapper . The fish was fresh, the presentation was beautiful and the flavor was absolutely on point. 
Service is responsive and friendly, takes reservations and a really great vibe.  Go there!"

Came here for the first time last week . We really enjoyed the fresh sushi. Our favorite was the Haku roll although all the rolls we tried were good. Great deal for $8-$10 bento box lunch choices.  

Only thing I did not enjoy was the veggie tempura... a bit overcooked and tough to bite.

We just ordered the Love Boat (I know, I know) and the sushi/nigiri were great, but the rolls were horrific. I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised to find out both were vegetarian. 
One was deep fried and slathered in two sweet sauces, with what appeared to be diced krab stick. The other was basically straight avocado with teriyaki sauce, no trace whatsoever of fish.

I know, these choices are clearly Americanized non-authentic  dishes, but they tasted delish nonetheless. Also, the salmon teriyaki is so good and a large portion.

That said, we&#39;re quite knowledgeable with what&#39;s what and what&#39;s not. Izu Sushi isn&#39;t the place, maybe not yet, but they&#39;re for sure trying and we appreciate that. 
 
Izu Sushi was rather disappointing, considering the 4 stars on Yelp. The immediate feel of the place that it&#39;s not authentic Japanese, and the only reason for caring that it&#39;s not authentic is that each dish only has a spin on actual Japanese dishes, and not the real deal. We tried to order 3 popular dishes - both appetizers and entrees, to which their answer was &#34;sorry we&#39;re out of that.&#34; We then resorted to ordering other dishes and not surprisingly, were left disappointed. 

Some dishes were made incorrectly, and I&#39;m using the term very loosely, some dishes weren&#39;t made the traditional way - ingredients, preparation, even temperature, but when we told the servers about it, they promptly took it off the bill after speaking to the manager. Other dishes were skimped out and we felt cheated. For example, when you order something as simple and popular as en &#34;eel roll,&#34; you expect to get a decent amount of, well EEL, because that&#39;s the roll that you ordered. The roll we ordered was fine, but the amount of eel was hilarious to say the least. Each piece of eel was literally the size of a child&#39;s pinky nail. 

Overall, this place was decent. If you&#39;re in the neighborhood, sure, check this place out, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend going out of your way to come here because you may leave disappointed, just as we did. We went on a slower night but the service was great, the staff was friendly, and the food was good for what it was. But if you&#39;re looking for authentic sushi, I&#39;d suggest you skip Izu Sushi."

We ordered Spicy Hamachi, Chicken Curry, Teriyaki Salmon &amp; Chicken Kara-age. The sushi came out 1st which was ok, then both the curry &amp; salmon. Waited another 30min or more and seems they forgot the Kara-age. We were the only ones there and can&#39;t seem to understand how they forgot it. Finally when we got it, it looked like orange chicken like Panda Express. We ask the waitress if this was Kara-age and was told sesame chicken. I then asked again and was told Kara-age. I just gave up since I was hungry and ate it anyway. Seems this place is in a identity crisis and definitely not a Japanese restaurant. Whoever is posting this place with 5 stars probably does not know Japanese food.

Suggestion, if you are true Japanese restaurant, please send out the actual food that is mentioned on the menu and not something else. If your menu mentions Kara-age, please send out a Kara-age and not orange chicken."

This place was quite dead when we went for a late lunch. We ordered 4 dishes. We ordered chicken curry, grilled teriyaki salmon,  kaarage chicken, and a spicy yellowtail sushi last. The sushi came out first. It was ok. The entrees took forever. The curry was definitely not Japanese curry. It looked more like a Thai curry. My friend who ordered it wasn&#39;t pleased. It didn&#39;t look appetizing either. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t take a photo of it. 
I ordered the teriyaki grilled salmon which was decent. The portion for the salmon was good. Don&#39;t order their &#34;karaage.&#34; It was NOT karaage, but orange chicken. When we asked the waitress if it was karate, she said, &#34;yes, sesame chicken. Then, said yes, karaage.&#34; 

Umm, no. You can&#39;t fool us because we know what kaarage. We grew up eating it and making it.

If you want panda express orange chicken then that is the &#34;karaage&#34; you will get at this place.

Good for lunch and will probably repeat. For dinner it was alright but probably won&#39;t go back.

&#34;Izu&#34; is the name of a volcanic island chain a little more than 50 miles south of Tokyo. I&#39;ll explain why that was a bit ironic below . . . but last night we had salads and spicy edamame along with the sashimi special followed by several sushi nigiri orders, including an uni special and pricey tuna amezy roll. My honey drank Japanese beer. I had my own neatly chilled carafe of organic sake.

I said the order was &#34;ironic&#34; because part of the chef&#39;s sashimi choices included what they called &#34;white tuna.&#34;  So here&#39;s the deal: There is nothing properly named &#34;white tuna.&#34; Most frequently what American sushi places call &#34;white tuna&#34; is escolar. Escolar&#39;s common name is &#34;snake mackerel&#34; (but who would eat it if it was called that?). In chi-chi U.S. restaurants and fish markets escolar is also sometimes called &#34;butterfish&#34; and that&#39;s because the flesh is so oily and a bit waxy that it has a very fulsome buttery feel in your mouth. While it tastes good there&#39;s a downside. The problem--and the reason why the Japanese refuse to serve it in traditional sushi houses--is that many people&#39;s digestive tracts can&#39;t process the waxy oils and it passes right through you, sometimes in a &#34;volcanic&#34; fashion--depending on how much you have. (Maybe &#34;ironic&#34; is the wrong word, huh?).

In addition to the white tuna issue that had its (un)desired effect, the nice server lost our order thereby delaying our being able to get to a movie on time that was next on the date night list, and the salad dressing tasted a bit off. The uni (the insides of a sea urchin) was passable, but not commensurate with the premium they charged.

All in all, the server and the sushi chefs were kind as could be but for a bit over $100 I didn&#39;t think the dinner was worth it.

Tonight as by far the worst experience I&#39;ve had at a restaurant in Denver in quite some time.  Our server was unprepared and was preoccupied watching the Eagles / Cowboys game to focus on his responsibility of even basic table care. 

They first were slow with just 8 tables filled to take our order ( 15 mins), missed half our our sushi order and left us drinkless for more than half of the meal.  When getting the bill, they dismissed the fact that they missed part of our order, wanted us to pay for sushi we did not get and did not once apologize nor did anything to make it right. 

While I understand they were distracted with football and another upset takeout order customer which got the wrong order... the service is lacking.   If you are in the Captiol hill area, pick Sushi Bay 17 or Okinawa over Izu.  Don&#39;t risk the poor service and distracted staff."

My friend and I meet for sushi every couple of months for lunch and catch up. We decided to try somewhere different this time and ended up at Izu Sushi. 

The lunch specials were okay.Our meal started with our salads. Oh wait. That&#39;s not right. My meal started with my salad because my friends salad did not come out until later. She got to watch me eat while waiting for her own. The salad was served with the traditional dressing but it just wasn&#39;t very good. Too thin maybe? I can&#39;t quite figure it out but something was missing.

My friend ordered the sashimi lunch and I ordered the two roll special.  I was disappointed to not have crunch rolls options but I won&#39;t mark down for that. After I ate my salad, my friend&#39;s salad appeared along with her sashimi lunch. The presentation was very nice. I&#39;ll give them that. My friend proceeded to eat her salad. Very slowly as she was doing most of the talking. And her lunch sat there waiting. Unfortunately her lunch sat there waiting for at least 15 minutes before I finally went to check on my own. By that time enough time had passed that I needed to get back to work and because nobody was visiting our table I had to walk up to the sushi bar (embarrassed) and ask if my meal was anywhere near ready which I was told it was getting close. 

A couple of minutes later my meal arrived and I was told it took so long because they were still making the sushi rice. For real? You&#39;ve been open for an hour and you don&#39;t have any sushi rice ready? But whatever, stuff happens, and I am totally okay with that. But man, you need to proactively tell someone why they are still sitting there waiting 15 min after their friend&#39;s food has arrived. Or maybe just let them know so they can change their order if needed to get back to work on time. The shrimp tempura roll was delicious. The tuna in the tuna rolls was a deep brown color which was a bit off-putting but they tasted fine. They could stand to spare a little more wasabi but now I&#39;m nit-picking. 

So, the kicker when the bill came out was the $1 up-charge because of my request to have the seaweed on the inside of the roll instead of the outside (I know, wimpy sushi girl here doesn&#39;t really like seaweed). My favorite restaurant already does it that way. And I have only requested it at one other restaurant where there was not an up-charge. Maybe it&#39;s the norm but I was a little surprised as it shouldn&#39;t make a difference if they are making their sushi rolls fresh (makes me wonder though...rice wasn&#39;t ready..tuna was brown). 

I&#39;m happy to see so many positive reviews. So maybe it was just truly an off-day (thus the extra star that assumes the best because it really should have been a one star review). Either way, I don&#39;t really have a reason to revisit this restaurant. Ever."

We came here when the summer weather was suddenly rainy and gloomy and all you could think of was soup. The first thing I did was look to yelp for the nearest ramen fix, and this was just a jaunt away. 

Lunch seemed fairly steady.  The place had a weird cleaning product scent that is a little strong at first but you get used to it. The wait staff was excellent and very attentive.  The atmosphere is super clean and fresh looking. There is lots of light in here and there is cute decor.  

My friends had shrimp udon noodles, spring rolls, and the sweet and sour soup. All of which looked amazing.  I was high maintenance and switched out the tempura udon with ramen noodles instead.  Usually they only have a pork belly ramen, but I wasn&#39;t in the mood for pork so they had no problem switching it out. 

The presentation was beautiful.  I got a big wooden spoon to twirl my noodles on.  The broth was not too heavy and the tempura was awesome.  This is a great spot for a rainy day.  I am also interested in trying some of their sushi rolls... they looked pretty good.  The ramen however, is a must!"

Soggy gyoza, sauces smeared everywhere and spilling out of the containers. The sushi was essentially crushed in some boxes.

The fusion roll may have been my favorite but honestly all three tasted amazing and fresh. They didn&#39;t give too much rice (which is a good thing) and there was plenty of fish. Presentation was lovely. My only complaint was that the server wasn&#39;t particularly friendly or inviting and he didn&#39;t refill our water and prices are steep for how small the rolls are. The ambience in here is modern and club-like. The chairs are a red pleather, there&#39;s a faux fireplace along the bar area, the lights have crystals in them and they play some cool 90s music. They have a TV inside that makes the atmosphere a little more casual. The restaurant was dead when I came in so I didn&#39;t think the food would be as good as it was.

Living in this area I was excited to have a sushi place within walking distance! (Okinawa is decidedly NOT worth it).

The service was a little confusing.... they were very nice and hospitable, just appeared to not really have any idea what they were doing. Well, it IS a brand new restaurant, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll figure it out and get better with time. 

The sushi itself was very good, neither of us realized just how much we had ordered until a giant boat arrived! They had some unique things on the menu, everything was very tasty."

In our part of California, good sushi is easy to come by, but we were really impressed with this restaurant.  The chefs are so creative, presentation is beautiful, the seafood is absolutely fresh, service is friendly, welcoming and efficient, prices are beyond reasonable, and above all, everything is delicious.

I thought the folks at the table next to ours were pretty obnoxious to the server. The server put a smile on his face and resisted the impulse retaliate or even respond with a snarky comment.

We came for lunch late on a Monday afternoon, and were one of 3 tables total in the restaurant. My boyfriend ordered a salmon teriyaki lunch box and I ordered one of their sushi lunch plates with Yellowtail and Salmon Skin rolls. I also ordered the edamame, because I am beyond obsessed since the first time I tried it (spoiler alert: it was amazing).

The miso soup that came with our lunches could possibly have been some of the best I&#39;ve had. The tofu was appropriate proportioned (no huge gross chunks) and it was salty (a plus for me) but not pucker your mouth salty the way some of them can get.
Our lunches also came with a salad that had one of the most interesting and delicious dressings I&#39;ve ever tried! I seriously want to find out if i can get a bottle of that stuff. It was some sort of citrusy peanut dressing, I think maybe mango was a prominent flavor. It was light and flavorful and tasted very summery.

The edamame was definitely the best I&#39;ve had yet. It came to our table visibly steaming and coated in just the right amount of salt. Nothing is more disappointing than cold edamame, so this made me extremely happy. It was also a large portion, so double happy points on that!

The sushi rolls were delicious! Decent proportions, well-rolled and tasty. I can&#39;t speak for my boyfriend&#39;s dish, but he seemed to like it. It was pretty heavy on vegetables, and they were primarily onions, so that&#39;s something to watch out for if you&#39;re not big on onions.

The restaurant itself seemed clean and the waitstaff was attentive. Seems like it might be a cool place to go for dinner, they have some colored lights in the ceiling that I bet would give a cool atmosphere at night.

Overall, I was extremely pleased with our lunch and will definitely be coming back!"

A quick yelp look showed this place had 4.5 stars with over 80+ reviews. 
Well, I asked my wife if she wanted to try this place out for her belated birthday dinner and she said yes. She also yelped and found a bad review from 6 days ago that the fish was NOT fresh. I got a little nervous and suggested that maybe we&#39;ll go to our go-to restaurant, Okinawa. She said no and it was just one bad review, maybe the restaurant had an off night. It happens. 

We parked on the street (the restaurant says they have parking in the rear, we just didn&#39;t know that...) and walked inside. Everything was nice and clean, overall, a great atmosphere. We ordered a couple of sushi rolls based on our server&#39;s recommendations and had a chirashi dish. First off, the chirashi dish was awesome!  So fresh and tasty, the super white was the best, followed by tender, delicious salmon. Then, our rolls came and let me tell you, awesome presentation DOES EQUAL awesome taste!  Holy cow, eating those rolls invoked memories of our old favorite sushi place, Japon (R.I.P.).  Not as good, but it came close!  I don&#39;t remember the names of the rolls, but they are numbered 23 and 24 on the paper menu. 

Definitely give this restaurant a try, you&#39;ll regret it if you don&#39;t!"

Infinitely higher quality should be expected from a 3-starred restaurant, much less one with a legendary 4.5 rating. Driving downtown specifically for this place was possibly the worst food-decision I have made in Colorado. 

For being the only two customers in the restaurant, service was remarkably inattentive. The server, while friendly enough, disappeared for long bouts of time and did not refill water. (By disappeared, this actually means he was at the far side of the room doing other tasks, socializing, and not making eye contact during my repeated attempts to politely get his attention.) Poor service can be forgiven if the food is to par, however in this case it was even worse...

Mediocre is barely sufficient to describe the sushi that we tried this wretched Wednesday afternoon. On order was an assortment of nigiri and sashimi: salmon, striped bass, snapper, scallop, eel, and two &#34;specials&#34;, blue fin tuna and madai. A majority of the cuts were dry and tasted old. The few that escaped the realm of desert-wasteland-fish were just reasonably palatable for what is to be expected from high reviews. (Also, if they had managed to make raw salmon dry, it would truly have been a miracle.) Call me biased, but higher expectations will be had at an establishment with 4.5 stars. Yes, I&#39;m bitter about the rating, as it&#39;s the reason I chose Izu Sushi for one of my rare, beloved sushi outings...
The bf tuna in particular was so utterly far from fresh that it could soon be cousins with the grey grub from aluminum cans. (Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love a good canned tuna fish salad - I&#39;m just not going to pay $7 for a pair of sad, shriveled pieces, which are better suited to be chopped up for spicy tuna filler.) 
Unagi, one of my very favorites, was distinctly uneven in size; for a moment I considered a fight to the death for the larger piece, though it would have been an unfortunate duel for food that was just...fine. I ate it. It was eel. Life moved on, my palate was sad, and my wallet was even sadder. 
Lastly of note, when ordering scallop I hope to receive a juicy, sweet, and tender slice of delicious mollusk. Chopping said mollusk into tiny pieces and drowning it in a noticeably fatty concoction of mayonnaise implies that the chef knew that quality was lacking. Props to the chef, maybe, and shame on whoever bought/kept the fish.

Deplorable fish quality aside [for the ratings/price], the rice was dry and lacked flavor - always a letdown on its own, even without the fish being a stone&#39;s throw from food poisoning. 

Bottom line: Never again. Back to a certain other downtown sushi restaurant for me, where I will omakase my way to delicious, fishy bliss."

It&#39;s tastefully decorated, but in that all too familiar sushi bar look. It has the same polished black countertops, and slightly uncomfortable chairs as every other sushi place. The booths up front are a nice comfortable change at least.

The service is fantastic. It can take a second before a hostess will demurely offer you a table, but from then on things go really well. The wait staff is friendly, the sushi chefs are the right amount of chatty, and overall it&#39;s a pleasant place to be.

They have cocktails, wine, and the usual rice beers. None of the offerings are particularly special or interesting.

The sushi, however, is where this place shines. The rolls are creative and well executed. The fusion roll is one of the best rolls I&#39;ve had in Denver. Perfectly spicy, with a pleasant texture, and a nice creamy citrusy sauce on top. It&#39;s just an excellent roll.

Everything else we&#39;ve tried in our 4 visits has all ranged from pretty good to great. The nigiri is fresh and the sashimi is perfectly cut. This place wants to do well, and it deserves to be rewarded for it.

This is a great addition to Colfax.. better than Okinawa down the street (which I also actually really like)."

I ordered a scallop roll and was told it&#39;s pre-made but was told it&#39;s very good by the waiter. It was one of the worst I ever had. It was almost pasty inside. The teriyaki steak was very good and would have this again. It&#39;s served wit soup OR salad. Most places serve you both. For the price I was surprised I had to choose.  The place was almost empty and it took over 20 min for the sushi to get to the table. In Denver the best sushi I have found is SUSHI SA SA or Sushi Den.

I&#39;d first like to point out how ridiculously small the portions are. I didn&#39;t expect a giant salad but I also didn&#39;t expect about 1/4 cup of greens? Not to mention they were DRENCHED in sauce, soggy and WARM, yuck. That&#39;s not even the worst part, the fish in both dishes was not nearly as cold as it should be. It also had a very odd texture that did not taste fresh. I notified the restaurant (mostly out of possible food safety concern) to say the fish was not cold and did not seem fresh. I was told that because I ordered brown rice, they had to make the rice fresh so it was hot when they rolled it. I sort of understand but if you can&#39;t offer brown rice rolls safely (with cooled rice) then don&#39;t offer it! The rice didn&#39;t even seem warm though, it was crunchy and stale. Sadly, I had to throw away all this food. What a shame. They offered me 10% off next time but I don&#39;t want to come back :( Just wish I could have had my money back to order fresh food from somewhere else."

I&#39;m very picky with New American food; in my opinion, it tends to be the same thing everywhere you go or overly contrived and complicated. The Populist strikes the perfect balance of combining familiar flavors with new and exciting concepts. Not only that, but our server was incredibly friendly and helpful, putting up with my boyfriend&#39;s cringe worthy jokes and our numerous questions about the cocktail and food menus.

The highlights for me were the jackfruit arepa and the bacon &amp; egg. I don&#39;t like bacon. I don&#39;t like how often bacon is used as a crutch to sell an underwhelming dish. As such, I didn&#39;t want to like the bacon &amp; egg simply because I&#39;m stubborn. After one bite, I was sold. I wanted the dish to last forever. In fact, I caved and ended up ordering another bacon &amp; egg. Populist, you win.

To top it all off, the kitchen was incredibly accommodating to my nut allergy. They put the nuts on the side for every dish so my boyfriend could still experience the full intended flavors and textures, while preventing me from ending up in the hospital."

Common foods done in uncommon ways. Portioned right, timing was spot on. The only weak point, if there was one, was the flank steak, the second to last course. A bit chewy and it didn&#39;t meet the level of quality of the other courses. For $80/couple for 7 courses, not only a great meal, but one of the better deals in Denver dining. 

Small, but very good wine list. I like that our server actually had tasting notes on the wines. Way too rare in Denver. Nice touch. 

Top 3 meal we&#39;ve had this year. Deserves being on the top 25 lists. Highly recommend."

I was eavesdropping but had to chime in, &#34;Ah.. I have a reservation at 7:15.&#34; That, I suppose, is not my doing, but rather, my girlfriend&#39;s. 

We have known each other since the mid 90s. I remembered her hopping in the car, and introduced herself on the corner of Van Ness and Union, and I remembered thinking, &#34;OMG, she looked just like Ally McBeal. Except she was prettier.&#34; She was the hot and classy one. One that every boy drooled over. And we went out for years and hang out whenever we could. She was finally married, and they had settled in Inner Sunset, bought a cute house and hosted a bunch of parties.. and then came the big move. Like many of my friends, they had finally moved out of the town, but one thing remained.. the sophisticated taste for good food one always acquires by occupying San Francisco. Denver, like Portland and Seattle, is filled with good eats. 

LoDo and RiNo are two areas that I liked the most, often only eating there besides the Union Station for quick bites. This particular restaurant is clearly extremely popular. It&#39;s meant to be American food but really, it&#39;s very much like the American food you&#39;d find in Seattle and Portland, it&#39;s filled with Asian influences.

Obviously, you should get the steak, the pastas, the salads, and the popcorn and the bacon and egg.. But boy oh boy, have you ever had jack fruit as a dish? I don&#39;t think so. Let me say it again.. Jack Fruit. Jack Fruit is wonderful here. It is served in a spicy curry sauce that can set your mouth on fire, in a good way.

The cocktails and wine selection are comparable to Trick Dog. And this is a hipster joint. So expect large crowd. Interesting renditions of dishes. And efficient services. Don&#39;t skip the desserts. It&#39;s all very delicious. 

And make sure don&#39;t give up even if you don&#39;t get a reservation. Just put your name on the list. This is worth the wait."

The Populist is located in Northwest, High Points and is near a sort-of run down street, so it was a little out of the way, but we had time to explore so we drove out there. Although I don&#39;t regret going, I wasn&#39;t blown away by the food, and I feel like there could be improvements...

We got there on Friday in time for their Happy Hour, which consisted of small plates and drink specials. I got the &#34;rosé of the day&#34; which was $6/glass. It was actually the same price, or similar to how much wine per glass usually is (as I later noticed on their regular menu... sadly I thought I was getting a really good deal. oh well). My drink was a darker wine, but I enjoyed sipping on it outside on their cute, outdoor garden (very hip and aesthetic for all you instagrammers out there). 

We also ordered the salt and vinegar popcorn. I enjoyed munching on it, but I do agree with other reviewers that it could have been executed better if it were served warm. In addition, stay away from the &#34;bibimbap croquettes&#34; because it did not resemble bibimbap to the slightest. It was just a ball of plain rice and egg served alongside a sauce that had no flavor.

Unfortunately, the food (happy hour food) just didn&#39;t do it for me but it was still a cool place to check out for a bit."

We decided to show up on a Saturday night. Wait was about 40min for a table on the patio (definitely worth the wait. Patio is very cute, with large common table and lanterns). The salary thing is that there is a winery right across the street, so put your name down and go wait for your table with a glass of wine in your hands. 
We started with the croquettes to share then had the chicken tendori and the beaf steak. Everything was very good and extremely flavorful. Effort was put in plate presentation, flavor combo. 
Service was perfect and very smooth. Our waitress was very helpful describing the menu, food came pretty fast.

Good for an intimate happy hour with close friends, especially if you sit outside with all the lights hanging above you. The menu this time around was not too stellar, 2 dollars for a genessee is hardly a deal and the rosé of the day is about the same price as the regular drink menu. We ended up getting the bibimbap croquette and the salt and vinegar popcorn. The croquettes were simply rice, egg, and black sesame rolled up and deep fried served with a side of pickled radish (they called it kimchi) and korean bbq sauce. If you&#39;ve ever had bibimbap before, there are no reminiscent flavors in this small plate so I was confused by the name. 

The salt and vinegar popcorn was just that- with a little bit of cilantro on top. Wish they would&#39;ve served it hot and fresh to make it a little more special.

Food and beverage did not impress me, but the service was friendly and the ambience was on point. I think I would definitely come back to try their constantly changing menu because I know the chef is creative and innovative, and getting to try some of his creations during happy hour is part of the fun."

The size of the place contributes to the above feeling. The two tops that line the wall to the right as you walk in should be your option if you have the forethought of reserving a table for that special night.

The food. She will thank you. This is a wine bar but the food was excellent. Beautifully plated and excellently prepared and seasoned. We had the following: 
- Sweetbread and liver, Popcorn, Mussels, Brussels sprouts, Flank steak , Pork shoulder, Bacon and egg and for dessert cream Fraiche cheesecake.  

Everything was so good. Some of our orders fell under the happy hour price. I will enjoy all of the dishes again EXCEPT for one. The Bacon n Egg. This was the weakest link to me. It wasn&#39;t as memorable as the rest. In fact it was sweet. I detest sweet anything if it&#39;s not a dessert. 

We had a glass of Roše, Breezy(rum) and Gold Rush. Good pick. 

If you&#39;re pressed for time the bar is a sweet spot for a first date. The chance to sit close to your intended target of affection is mandatory:) so do this and don&#39;t do the communal table. 

The staff are awesome. The male host that welcomed us was very warm and friendly. Our server had the same quality. I admire that a lot.

Everything else was just a &#39;if we have time&#39; or &#39;maybe.&#39; I found this place and thought that the food looked pretty good and the price fixe was going to be a food value. I figured at worst it would be a pretty decent meal for a fairly decent price.

I was wrong in the best possible way.

We walked in and were seated outside. They used their space to the best possible effect. We were seated underneath a billboard, but it didn&#39;t seem like it, they used it as a trellis and I didn&#39;t notice it until I looked up.

The price fixe menu is literally a terrific deal, it says 7 course meal but really it&#39;s 8 with the shaved ice palate cleanser which made me wish I had more of it. Repeat that 7 more times and you had the dinner. The seemingly simple dishes like the baby lettuce salad was delicious, I honestly thought there would be a couple of throw away dishes but they were all well made and delicious. I could go into how each of the dishes were delicious, well crafted and balanced but it would stretch out into a novel. Fortunately, there are plenty of photos from my visit and you&#39;ll have to trust that my raving for this place is enough."

I don&#39;t think she quite understood what we were saying since she kept repeating it.

Anyway, I dropped in for a quick bite before a show based solely off the Yelp reviews, and fell in love, which is weird. First off, I very quickly learned this isn&#39;t a &#34;quick bite&#34; sort of place. I&#39;ve become so accustomed to sports bars and the low-key places, that I was caught off-guard. You go here for an experience. So, my review would probably be even more glowing if I&#39;d spent more than 30 minutes there.

I started at the bar during happy hour; the bartenders were artists, plain and simple. I had a drink off their HH menu called The Breezy, which I sucked down like it was water. I wound up getting the mussels as my pseudo-meal, and they were RIDICULOUS. Great spot to eavesdrop, by the way. First date conversations are hysterical.

My friend then showed up and we moved to one of their community tables, and had a blast talking with the women sharing our space, learning about how they felt about their dishes and drinks. I had brought my mussels aftermath with me because I couldn&#39;t separate myself from it. The broth was so good, that after sopping up as much as I could with the bread, I actually drank the remainder directly from the bowl on a dare. I&#39;m classy. 

Can&#39;t wait to go back."

The appetizers we chose were delicious, the Brussels sprouts, the bacon &amp; egg, and the Korean croquettes.

As this was my first time being to the Populist we called in advance and asked if we needed a reservation and said there is no wait but it fills up fast. Boy were they right!!! In 15 minutes it took to get there was a 25 minute wait when we showed up. However, decided to have a happy hour drink at the bar, which has very good bar tenders. They were packed though as was the end of happy hour. We sat out side under the patio lights and enjoyed a nice night before our table opened up. Should point out that they do have communal tables but wanted a little privacy so waited. But the outside is perfect for a drink and some conversation prior to dinner. 

Was sat in the small dinning area and Marcus treated to a great meal! I hope that the owner sees this as i tried to stop by to give my compliments on how well his staff is. Anyhow got two appetizers the confit rabbit rillettes (which is a very delicious patte with mustard, raspberry and almond spread) and the Bi Bim bap Croquets (which are like lightly fired dough balls with a great dipping sauce). My only issue with this meal was that the main dish cavatelli Verde  &amp; Bison sausage (although amazing) was equal size if not smaller than the appetizer. The arctic char that my wife got was a decent portion and definitely what i was expecting. So if you a &#34;normal&#34; size guy or hungry the cavatelli is not the choice I would go with. 

Again to summarize the ambiance is great, good bar with awesome happy hour, and the service was amazing not just from main server but all the way around. Again only dock is the size of some of the main dishes. I will defintiely be going back to try out the chef&#39;s choice 7 course tasting meal with some friends."

We started rather early at 4:30p, and the place was quiet... but HIGHLY enjoyed a couple craft cocktails but especially the &#34;Happy Hour Bruschetta of the Day&#34;... Chicken Liver Mousse, Apple Butter, Pickled Onion.... may be the best I&#39;ve ever had! Definitely a cool joint and I plan to return... Contemplating dinner at Bar Fausto, they recommended simply walking across the street to Populist for dinner, since we had not been there yet either.

First impressions of Populist -- comfy and intimate, felt immediately trendy / New York City, &#34;Am I in Denver / Totally Denver!&#34; -- all good... cool seating arrangements, bar in the background.... then greeted kindly, despite fear of not getting a table, but was able to be seated immediately at one of their two community high-top tables -- was just after 5pm, so I trust that helped. 

Since we were both new, and it was Happy Hour timing, we decided to try 4 of the 5 items featured: Bi Bim Bap croquettes, sweetbread &amp; duck liver mousse, Prince Edward Island Mussels and &#34;Bacon and Egg&#34; -- mine of which paired nicely with their Rosé. The waiter was awesome and &#34;coursed&#34; out each dish and timed them perfectly.... We left quite full and highly impressed the culinary offerings and service! 

Next time I need to try their $80 7-course meal for two.... :) Well done. Definitely a new Denver mainstay. Recommend the one-two-punch of starting at Bar Fausto across the street."

But overpriced. Coming from a foodie&#39;s opinion. VERY incorrect pricing estimates by the company. Not $$. To feel full on the tapas-style portions, it&#39;s definitely a $$$. For example a steak entree that left me (a female) feeling hungry was $25. I needed an appetizer to go along with it. To feel full, I&#39;d have spend $35 on food not including tax, tip or drinks."

Rounds of small plates with varying, innovative ingredients to suit a large array of palettes await you at this small but charming eatery. Though the menu is small, don&#39;t be overwhelmed with the delectable options. It&#39;s a quality over quantity thing; a wide range of regional cuisines attributing to that fact. Likewise, the wine and cocktail list is just as rich with choices.

The Grilled Leek Pesto Bucatini was by far my favorite dish of the evening. What I think was house made bucatini was perfectly tossed in a savory leek pesto that really left me wanting more. The grilled shishito peppers are always a hit, and the flank steak was tender and tasty. This is a high recommendation in my book. Perfect for an intimate evening for two or a close group of buds sharing stories over shared plates."

My girlfriend and I decided to try the chefs 7 course dinner. $80 for two people? It was a deal. We decided to add the wine tasting for both of us. You should know that the wine was not 7 small glasses, but rather we got 4 large servings of wine to go along with our food. Simply delicious. 

Our favorite food was the flank steak, but the steelhead was a close second."

A hip farm-to-table establishment, The Populist offers a varied assortment of tapas and larger entrees. Being famished when I walked in, I ordered the Smoked Jack Fruit Arepas for the main course. My server, who highly recommended it, described it as a vegan dish that features the less-well known flavors and characteristics of Jack Fruit when simmered in spicy, tomato-based sauce for several hours. It had the texture and flavor of pulled pork. The jack fruit, together with the arepas, mango relish, and avocado sauce, was an unforgettably amazing combination of flavor and textures. To finish my meal, I ordered the cheesecake. Although I don&#39;t usually gravitate toward cheesecake, I found it to be delicate and with a good balance of flavor. My experience here was further elevated by the cool vibe and attentive wait staff. 

Overall, HIGHLY recommended!!"

The. $25 per person for a 4 glass wine tasting. The food was awesome. Service good. I think my food runner was better than my server! Atmosphere cool. Can be a little loud. But overall aesthetics very hip. Relaxing. Reminds me of down house in Houston. Courses came perfectly timed. Explained in detail. Removed from table with grace. I probably have not had such a good dinning experience as this, since moving to Denver. Also came on a Saturday at 7:30. Had no reservations (they don&#39;t take after 6pm) were seated inside immediately. Wait for outside patio was 45min."

It was still happy hour. Delicious drinks! The servers were really able to speak to the menu. We shared an appetizer of the salt and vinegar popcorn; I found it a little over rated. My friend had the cavatelli and lamb ragout; it tasted akin to hamburger helper (though good hamburger helper!). I had what was recommended, the snake river flank steak; incredible! So tasty! Overall I really liked this place. I would just recommend sticking to what the server suggests as they know what&#39;s truly delicious on the menu."

This charming tiny restaurant is nestled in RiNo in a spit-polished clean and neat and well designed space. Walking into the bar area, you are met with the most pleasing array of shelved spirits in a colorful display.  Wait until you place your drink order!  The very spiffy and attractive mixologists are chiseling ice, coaxing orange aromatics with flames for your drink, mixing, and stirring.  The results are fantastic!  I had a negrino, the standard Italian aperitif with compari and a giant ice cube.  Friends tried the Corpse Revivers and were thrilled.  A great start to a great meal!

We settled into the community table and well, we basically tried EVERYTHING on the menu.  The small plates were amazing, but by far- the Brussells Sprouts with Bacon and Bourbon was the clear winner!  Really- you must try this. Sweet, salty, cunchy- Amazing.  Not your mom&#39;s brussels sprouts...

From the entree selections, some of the notable dishes included the Hangar steak in a green peppercorn sauce (that was mine, and I did not share, and it was AMAZING!), the tandoori chicken, and the lamb meatballs.  I would go back for that steak again and again.  It was a meal that set a new bar for me, actually.

Then dessert.  How Brilliant!  &#34;Ritual Chocolate Disks&#34; are the perfect ending for those that want something sweet but not another meal...  The ants on a log interpretation was met with rave reviews, as was the key lime pie ensemble and the chocolate pot, served in a glass pot!

What a nice evening.  This little restaurant would be great anywhere int he world- aren&#39;t we lucky to have it in Denver?  I think so!"

Every time we go something fun and interesting happens to make the night special. Little did I know that when we came in and the hosting person told my wife how much she liked her blouse that that would be the beginning of it . . .

Well we started out at one of the communal tables on the patio. But when a storm arrived we moved inside near both the greeting area and Ms. Blouse-Admirer. We were celebrating the recent sale of our condo so splurged and got the 7 course chef&#39;s tasting menu. Really enjoyed the duck pate, the incredible zucchini soup, the simple but elegant salad, and most of all, the bucatini with wild mushrooms. In fact, loved almost all the selections except for the dessert. We&#39;d ordered the chocolate pot de crème but the server (a ringer for a hot Adam Levine (a point made by my honey :)) said that the chef wanted us to taste the passion fruit tart. Turned out passion fruit tart wasn&#39;t our thing. Wasn&#39;t bad. Just would have rather finished with something chocolate. You know; like normal people.

As we were discussing the relative merits of the different desserts my wife looked at the sweet host-ette, and from out of the blue exclaimed, &#34;I&#39;m going to give her this blouse.&#34; 

&#34;Whoa . . . what!?! You&#39;re going to give her your blouse?&#34; Now, I&#39;ve never gone into some place and ever exchanged an article of clothing with someone who admired what I was wearing, but apparently this is not unknown amongst women . . . (?). I&#39;d just never seen it before.

So off she goes. Talks to the host woman who&#39;s tickled pink and they disappear into the bathroom. Damn! They are both hotties and I was thinkin&#39; they might just put on a Shotgun Willie&#39;s amateurs&#39; night  style show. But no such luck. They demurely came back wearing each other&#39;s blouse . . .. And that&#39;s how we left it. A complete dining and couture success.

Obviously, due to the above star rating you can see it lived up to the hoopla! Read on for hoopla details.

We dropped in on a Friday evening around 6:30 without reservations and asked to be seated outside. We were promptly seated at a community table on the back patio, which is SO charming, and informed we could still order off the happy hour menu until 7! Winning! I enjoyed a vodka tonic which was made with their house made tonic. House made tonic made all the difference. It was a great drink and so simple! The new cocktail scene in Denver sometimes overwhelms me with tons of ingredients many of which I&#39;ve never heard of but if you can improve upon a two ingredient drink and make me order another one at dinner, you&#39;ve done something special in my book.

We tried the sweet bread and liver pate first. It comes served with some grilled toast and is so smooth with a great taste that we gobbled it down. Even my boyfriend who isn&#39;t totally crazy about the idea of pate really enjoyed it, requesting more toast to spread it on. 
Next we enjoyed the albacore tuna. Clearly, the fish is fresh and was easy to eat and flaked right off.

For our entrees we tried the summer ragout as well as the sweet corn agnolotti. The portions aren&#39;t huge on the pasta so make sure you&#39;ve ordered an app to start with or you won&#39;t leave full. These portions are designed to ensure you order other things which we had done so we left full but not stuffed. In my book that&#39;s a better way to go anyway. 

And lastly, the dessert we enjoyed the mango tartlet. HOLY MOLY that was awesome. It was clear the dessert wasn&#39;t an afterthought on the menu like it tends to be at so many other restaurants. It was tart and rich and creamy and the crust was perfect and crumbled in your mouth but not on the plate. That was the best ending to that meal we could&#39;ve asked for.

We had such a lovely meal and enjoyed the community table and even struck up conversation with our neighbors. Was a great summer evening. We will be back!"

I can get there right at opening, 5, 5:30...
I can go with a girl friend - so not wasting fru fru yummies on the hubby!
I can get the heck out before the hipsters arrive!

We had a lovely meal! 

Yummies:
eggs and bacon - omg, don&#39;t share, each get your own!
scallops - woah - mmmm - again, small, you only get 3, so think before you agree to share!
deconstructed cheese cake - neat and tasty!

Not so yummy:
truffle popcorn... nah

Wine - excellent happy hour specials

Staff - super sweet and helpful

Seating - we sat outside at a hi-top. i&#39;m a shortie, so it was high for me, and a bummer when i dropped my napkin! But uncomfortable enough to enjoy the meal and then want to shuffle out they could turn the table!

Price: if you can make happy hour its affordable, otherwise it&#39;s a pretty penny, excellently prepared food, but small portions...

They also have a nice rosé on happy hour.  I would have given this place 5 stars, but the service was just a little lacking.

We were there early enough to enjoy happy hour which comes with a couple discounted wines and cocktails and bites. We opted for the popcorn for $2. I do love salt and vinegar so it was tasty but I think it would have been better warm and some of the kernals remained unpopped. At $2, it&#39;s not much of an investment and a fun little snack.

We decided to do the tasting menu for 2 for $70. Since plates are meant to be shared here, you only receive 1 plate for each of the 7 courses. I was concerned it might not be enough food but I think it would be for most people. We are whorfers and ended up ordering another bacon and egg dish in between but it was on happy hour and it was really yummy!

Since I&#39;m gluten free, we did the whole tasting this way. It eliminated the pasta dish but then allowed us to have both the scallops and the beef! Everything was pretty delicious.

We started with an excellent salmon crudo (which could have used a few more chilies in my opinion, but I love spicy food) then followed with some watermelon soup. It had some caraway seed in it that I did not love, but it was certainly refreshing for a hot summer day. We loved the bacon and egg dish. (As stated previously, we ordered another!) It was divine. My other favorite was the scallops. The avocado crema was absolutely fantastic. The beef was cooked perfectly and a generous portion. For dessert, we had the pot de creme. I was expecting the typical pudding in a ceramic dish- but this it was not. It was definitely the most amazing pot de creme I have ever had! I highly recommend it.

After happy hour finished, I also had an additional glass of wine - the Mountain Cuvee- and it was terrific. Smoky and well balanced. I took a picture so that I could find it in the store!"

We started at the bar for a few happy hour cocktails and moseyed on over to a table to partake in the seven course tasting menu and wine pairing. Prior to getting into the food, the ambiance was great and interior décor had a lot of character. As the evening progressed, it got rather busy, which made having the large, beautiful have you, outdoor patio open for seating essential.

The tasting menu is the way to go. It provided the best way to get a feel for the restaurant and the chefs&#39; abilities. Each course was substantial and had we got them a la carte off the menu, we would have paid well over the bargain price tag of $75. Each dish although simple sounding on the menu was far more intricate as each dish from the country ham plate, asparagus salad, and bacon &amp; egg had its main ingredient only to be enhanced by some clever alterations in accoutrements whether it be carrot purees or caviar mustard dollops. The sweet potato &amp; ginger soup, rockfish donburi, and key lime semifreddo were just what you&#39;d expect - satisfying and delicious. We were both blown away by the fava &amp; chevre agnolotti, which I think we both would agree was the best dish of the bunch - which is saying a lot considering the quality ingredients, taste, and originality of each plate. 

If there is one thing that we would gripe about the experience, it would be somewhat in line with the consensus of other reviews towards the service and the pretentious nature and feel of the establishment and staff. The servers were far from rude, mind you, rather they came across as not caring or attempting to relate but more so just doing the motions. Plates would be dropped off with a quick description which continued as they were practically turning around and walking away. Wine paired with courses came with no description as to why they were paired with a particular course, and in some courses, we were not informed that the wine paired with two courses rather than just the one - thus leaving us with a couple courses without wine in our glasses. Had we known, we would have conserved through the two courses. 

This food, ambiance, and tasting menu were so exceptional that they were hardly hampered by the only gripe of lackluster service. If only the servers, management, and bar staff showed a little more passion and desire to connect or even socialize with patrons rather than one another, this establishment would have connected on all levels of excellence."

When we got back we were waved right away toward empty spots at a communal table. The hostess hadn&#39;t mentioned the first time around that we could have been seated right away at one of those communal tables... not that she wasn&#39;t friendly and professional--she just assumed we *knew* which were communal and which were private, and were choosing a private table. Considering the RiNo setting, it was an apt miscommunication, since diners here project the overconfident air of knowing more than they actually do.  

We ordered the seven-course meal. The dishes were generally excellent. I wont go deep on them since many are described elsewhere, but our 7-course included an albacore tuna app, zucchini soup, the bacon/egg, sweet corn agnolotti, flank steak, some cheesecake in lemongrass-infused syrup. It cost $80 for the 2 of us--since I see others quoting this at $65 or $70 a year or two back, they seem to be escalating their prices quickly: other menu item price increases confirm this. They&#39;ve really gotta work on the pacing of the 7-course dishes. At first the service was quite attentive, we got narrative presentations of each dish (one included pickled blueberries), some of which struck us as a little too self-proud. (I half expected the waiter to say &#39;Ta-daaaah!&#39; after one of them.) The first 4 dishes came out in very rapid succession, which was great: we were hungry and it was late. Then there was a loooooooong gap during which we very nearly walked out of the restaurant. After nearly a half hour, the next dish came out, but it was pretty clear the waitress had moved on to other concerns at that stage of our meal. Waitstaff socializing with patrons is fine to a point, but first do your work. It seemed sometimes like a neighborhood party, and maybe it was: I&#39;m not from that neighborhood. I felt good after the meal, but even after 7 courses I can&#39;t honestly say we were full: some were quite skimpy for two.

I&#39;m probably between 3 and 4 stars, they&#39;ve definitely got some mojo but they&#39;re on the fence between a truly excellent restaurant and an overpriced hipster haunt that could be interchangeable with something else in two years. I would definitely like to eat here again, but given the above there&#39;s room for upside if they deal with the issues above."

It goes until 7pm, when others shut down at 6.  They have a really pretty patio with long picnic benches and strung lights, and an inexpensive and unique Happy Hour menu, between $2 for popcorn, to about $6 for a yummy bacon and egg dish, chicken liver mousse, etc. 

But  DON&#39;T GO.  Why?  Because they don&#39;t want you there for happy hour.  They want you to eat dinner.  When we said we had about 10 people that wanted to order drinks and apps, they had to ask a manager .  After at least 10 minutes of waiting, they said we could order at the bar, and then our drinks would be brought out to us.  Duh!  They were overly anxious about giving us a table outside, fretting about how long we would be there, even when there was absolutely no one outside at all. 

Overall, I know the food is good here, but drop the Happy Hour if you aren&#39;t going to support it!"

I met a friend here for happy-hour and ended up staying for dinner. I love the aesthetic, the restaurant is open and industrial with a modernized vintage feel. The staff is very attentive and notably fit the ambiance well. I had an old fashioned and a house-tonic, which was the best tonic I&#39;ve ever had- very tart and delicious. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the brussel sprouts, which were perfectly sweet and rich with the additional of pork-belly. I ordered the Tandoori Chicken for my dinner plate, which was tender and perfectly spiced. The lentils provided an interesting textural variation in conjunction with the indian-style flatbread which was crunchy and speckled with cumin seeds. The sauce that accompanied the chicken put the dish over the top. It was distinctly Indian-influenced but rich and decadent. Beautifully composed and balanced on a whole.

My friend ordered the Lamb Meatballs and enjoyed them very much as well.

I will definitly be back- and hopefully in spring when their patio is open, which happens to be covered in lush green vines!"

I will not, however, be a returning here as a customer. Let me explain why.

I happen to believe that, other than quality of food served, the most important characteristic that  a food service establishment can have is value. What am I getting for my money. This place fails the value test by leaps and bounds. It&#39;s pricing is preposterous. Take for example, the Cavatelli &amp; Summer Ragout (which is what I ordered for my entree). It&#39;s literally pasta with vegetables and a very very small portion at that. I&#39;d go so far as to say it&#39;s a half portion when compared to other restaurants, so effectively they are serving a $32 pasta with veggies dish.

The most egregious thing with ordered though was the Broccoli Waldorf Salad. I went to dinner with four other people and the five of us planned on sharing a few of the small plates/appetizers. This thing comes out, it&#39;s literally broccoli with some sauce and garnish, again delicious, but it cost $10, ten freakin&#39; dollars for six pieces of broccoli is straight highway robbery.

It&#39;s never a satisfying dining experience when you drop $45 on a meal with one drink and then afterwards have to get a burrito because you&#39;re still hungry.

You can get way better bang for your buck elsewhere."

I got a   $150 gift card for Christmas so my boyfriend and I went for our anniversary. When we got there we had to wait a bit for our table so we both got a delicious premium specially cocktail at the bar. Before we finished our drinks our table was ready. We ordered 2 drinks,3 shared plates, a $40 bottle of wine and split an entree all for $150!!! All we had to do was leave a tip. With all of the be foodie restaurants popping up in Denver it&#39;s sometimes uncommon to get this much for that price point.

Both decoratively delicious! The best end to a great dinner? Cheese plate staring the most delicious triple cream Brie and appropro accoutrements.

Mostly because I read they were on the communal table train. Sharing a table with strangers isn&#39;t my thing because I feel I have to watch what I&#39;m saying, how loud I&#39;m saying it, etc. Good thing to know about the tables: they have 2 tops and 6 tops. So if you come with one of those party sizes it&#39;s not communal. On to the food...We didn&#39;t have one thing to eat that wasn&#39;t interesting or flavorful. That&#39;s really hard to do. Here is what we ordered and shared as a group of 4: Hawaiian Cured Albacore, Cavatelli Verde &amp; Sausage, Smoked Jackfruit Arepas, Tandoori Chicken. Sadily, we were too full for dessert. On the cocktail side, the old fashioned variation was good and strong. I selected the bartender&#39;s choice, which was really a &#34;make up your own cocktail.&#34; I said I liked bourbon, ginger and some sort of fruit. The result was a terrific drink. So take a chance and let the bartender create. Our server was able to explain everything that was unfamiliar, and recommend plates based on quantities, likes/dislikes, etc. As for the communal experience? The diner next to me had on some strong cologne and it was a relief when he left and we had the table to ourselves. Next time it&#39;ll be 2 or 6 of us. BTW, the patio was closed due to an earlier rainstorm. Bummer because being out there felt like being under an arbor in a backyard. Looking forward to sitting out there before the summer is gone."

I ordered a Pimm&#39;s cup to start with and finished with an Old Fashioned. The Old Fashioned was amazing. Smooth and delicious. Could have done with the Pimm&#39;s cup. Orders the popcorn, brussel sprouts with pork belly, and beet and cauliflower salad. All were amazing. We then shared the Rockfish. It was made to perfection. Perfectly seasoned and cooked.

Watch your step if you&#39;re clumsy like I am, tripped on that shit both in and out. Intimate space and decor, low lighting, rustic wood fixtures, your quintessential date spot. 

Date and I ordered salt and vinegar popcorn to start, split the brussel sprouts, cheese platter, duck sausage, and smoked jackfruit. Popcorn to whet the appetite, I like to think of this as a healthier alternate to my fave chip snack. Brussel sprouts balanced sweet and savory perfectly with the pork belly and maple glaze combo. Honey, fig spread, and cheese (I forget if it was camembert or brie) came with crusty and thick slices of bread, made me nostalgic for picnics in Paris. The duck sausage was flavorful and gamey, although the beans were under cooked. Jackfruit was too salty, too much soy sauce soak/douse? The sweet potato gratin was the highlight of that dish. Shared the caramel tart for dessert. Loved the nutella ice cream and passion fruit sauce, presentation could definitely use work, looked messy and the tart shoddily assembled. 

Save for the couple of hiccups, I had a lovely evening soaking in the ambiance of the place and sharing a couple of platters. Bring your lady friend here for an enjoyable evening."

We split a bottle of their red wine from Lebanon, wish I could recall the name because it was delicious and only $36!! We then split their cheese board which was excellent. Followed that up with the Bibb lettuce salad, which was the perfect size to share. 

My friend ordered the Tandoori Chicken which I HIGHLY recommend. It was so tender and full of flavor!!! I ordered the Coffee Rubbed Pork which was decent; sadly the pork was a bit over cooked. The gnocchi that accompanied was great! Just wish the pork hadn&#39;t been so overdone and chewy.

Food is inventive and typically quite good 
Cocktails are fresh and unusual.  Try the limeade/pear caparinha (sp?)
The portion sizes are modest so you get just the right amount to eat but not too much
the price point is reasonable especially for the entrees
patio space is pleasant
if you get there early enough you can generally get decent and sometimes &#34;private seating&#34;

-
They love to sneak pork products in to dishes...shoshito peppers with pork!  brussels sprouts with..pork! totally get the bacon/pork thing, but please give us a heads up
I just don&#39;t like the community seating thing
am partial to places where I can easily make a reservation
the seating is super uncomfortable and a big turnoff
slightly off-putting service at times

I&#39;d been looking forward to dinner here for a long time; unfortunately this put me completely off the idea of having a meal. 

Hoping a drink would cure my woes, we do sit at the bar. It takes the bartender far too long to get around to taking our drink order (think about 8 minutes, which isn&#39;t that long in the scheme of things, but the bar had three other people at it, all with drinks already, and the bartender was clearly not doing anything). We ordered drinks, and asked to see a menu. 

The prix-fixe looked interesting, and it&#39;s usually something I like to try when I&#39;m at a place for the first time, but since Husband is kosher we asked whether one or two of the items on the menu could be substituted (everyone in your party must get prix-fixe if one of you does) for items without pork and/or shellfish. 

No substitutions on the prix-fixe menu. 

Honestly, I was floored. I&#39;ve never experienced this before - every other place has been able to substitute their prix-fixe menu to accommodate Husband&#39;s dietary restrictions. That was the last straw, so we paid for our drinks and left. We probably won&#39;t be back."

I worried the atmosphere might be too hipster-ish for me (since I&#39;m not a hipster) -- should not have worried.

Worried that I wouldn&#39;t like the community tables -- should not have worried -- plenty of non-community tables.

I loved the atmosphere.  It&#39;s a bit hard to describe, but I&#39;d say comfortable, upscale rustic -- maybe a bit country French, but American if that makes any sense.

The service (Jessica) was perfect.

And the food, wow; it was terrific.  You must get the salt &amp; vinegar popcorn.  I&#39;ll be looking for vinegar powder online as soon as I finish this review.

The smoked fish rillettes, which is a spread, was superb.  The saffron mussels were excellent, and I particularly liked that the broth was light and filled with veggies.  The waitress described it as paella in liquid form.  The sweet chili Brussels sprouts were wonderful.

You must try this place.  It&#39;s fabulous without being fussy.  And they offered me the happy hour menu even though I wasn&#39;t at the bar.  Bonus points!"
the-populist-denver,Carly B.,KAojuVhowyK7OpZnuBzxzQ,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,400,4,1pKeTNngeEaolxbX4cszOw,5.0,2013-02-06,"Nicer dining that feels like it was made for me.

As a huge Crema fan, I almost went through the roof when I learned that the guys behind it were opening a restaurant in the defunct Garden Spot Cafe space with it&#39;s oh-so-alluring looking patio.  I can&#39;t say why I didn&#39;t make it out sooner (I live six blocks away), but the wait to have The Populist as my birthday dinner was worth it.

As I mentioned, it&#39;s nicer dining but it didn&#39;t feel stuffy to me in any way or like the see-and-be-seen-rooftop-bar-get-soused restaurants opening closer to the ballpark area on Larimer.  It fits in perfectly with what is now being referred to as Upper Larimer and all of the artisan makers (OMF, Denver Seitan Co, Ritual Chocolate, Huckleberry Roasters, IMT, etc) that make this part of Larimer so great.

The menu is designed for sharing and is one of the few places with such a menu that feels truly shareable.  They also list dishes in ascending order based on price and size.  The menu is on the smaller side, but has a nice variety of vegetable dishes ranging from light and small to substantial.  

Mom and I started with the apple and parsnip soup.  It was smooth, slightly sweet, and rich, poured into two bowls with a dollop of jalapeno jelly in each.  Our next course was the curried chickpea salad.  This is a dish I could gladly eat every day for lunch.  It had a bright green yogurt curry sauce and a very clean taste.  This was followed by carrots three ways: charred/pureed, sweet and roasted, and raw, marinated ribbons.  A little scoop of chive mascarpone accompanied the dish and served as a nice, creamy contrast to the sweetness of the carrots.  At mom&#39;s request, we also got the bacon and egg.  As a non-bacon eater, I was still able to dip pieces of grilled bread into the (as advertised) perfectly poached egg (and rightly so).  The egg was served atop a bacon jam for those who&#39;re into that.

Our main was the huitlacoche agnolotti.  The huitlacoche (billed as &#34;Mexican truffle&#34; but is just corn fungus) is blended into a creamy puree and served with beurre blanc, corn, and shavings of cheese.  It was a perfect main course, enough to finish between the two of us (me comfortably, and mom not-so-comfortably).

Despite being full, we couldn&#39;t turn down dessert as we were both drawn to the honey and thyme custard.  Luckily, the dessert was just the right size so as not to feel like a complete glutton and it came with orange fennel sorbet and a salty, crunchy almond brittle.

I think what I enjoyed most were the punches of herbs and spices in each dish.  Not overpowering, but appropriate and different.  From the cardamom roasted carrots, to custard with thyme and sorbet with fennel, to a bright curry sauce, this was like a dream menu to me.

They have a happy hour (5-7), and it&#39;s mainly selected smaller portions (the bar type foods on the menu) at smaller prices and a few specially priced cocktails.  The wine list is short, but eclectic.  I had an HH priced glass of white wine from Macedonia, very similar to a Sauv Blanc.  Mom had an HH vodka tonic (tonic is housemade).

While not an every weekday type of dinner place, the prices were not terrible at all.  We shared five dishes and dessert, each enjoyed a drink, and mom had an espresso and it was just shy of $70, pre-tip.

Our server was fantastic and personable, offering great advice on dishes and drinks and managing to be present but not intrusive.

Beyond a fitting birthday dinner.  This place is a keeper."

My husband and I are here at least once every two months. I recommend the tasting menu for two along with the wine pairing. It&#39;s a fantastic value, and is always delicious. The service is always top notch. It&#39;s a small place so reservations are always good, and don&#39;t miss the patio in the summer/fall."

The drink choices are plentiful and between wine, beer, and cocktails there&#39;s something for everyone.

All of the plates we had were delicious, albeit a bit smaller than small plates, but carefully crafted and unique.  We felt like the ratio of food quality to plate size/price combination was slightly disproportionate.
For instance, if it was cheaper, if we got more food, or if the food was better, there would be little to complain about.  

The service was a bit sub-par.  As it approached 10 pm (closing time) our server became a bit pushy about deciding how much more food we needed.  Specifically, prior to having any of the plate we ordered, &#34;I know you haven&#39;t had any of that yet, but do you think you&#39;ll need more food?&#34; (It should be noted that we were seated around 8:45 pm). At $100 for two people, the 7 out of 10 (what we perceived) service makes it a little difficult to stomach coming back.

On a positive note, the pot de creme was fantastic and worth every penny.  We&#39;d go back- but probably just to sit at the bar for a plate or two and a drink."

Unique flavors and creative combinations are provided. We had the albacore tuna with the lemongrass gel and the carrots 5 ways. The carrots were awesome and spicy. Surprisingly spicy. 

Happy Hour Atmosphere- 0 stars
I made a mistake in choosing this place for my birthday happy hour. This restaurant is small and classy. The staff was frustrated that we were such a large group ordering things left and right. As much as I want to be nice and take all of the blame for having a bad experience, I can&#39;t do this. The behavior of the staff was cold and unwelcoming even given us breaking their mold. At the end the server gave me two free drink coupons and apologized. Unfortunately, by that time I had spent most of the meal anxious about making them mad and possibly getting spit in our food. I would suggest they don&#39;t offer a happy hour given the reception of it by the wait staff. It was busy enough that it likely  would not drive away business (although I wish this is what the hostess would have done when I arrived- told me to go somewhere else with my big, unreserved group).

So lesson learned. I&#39;ll go back to Old Major for these types of nights."

The space itself is.. strange. It&#39;s a bit outside of Downtown (on the very eastern edge of River North), but is in a tiny little building. Inside it feels like a trendy narrow restaurant in the heart of the city. This means everything is close together and the wait staff is always kind of close to your shoulders. Yet the whole thing works somehow. They do have a really fun patio with big giant community tables that I absolutely love when the weather is warm.

The bar is great. They do classic cocktails very well. Their house specialities are generally modern twists on those classics and they almost always hit the mark. You&#39;re not going to find sweet Tiki drinks here, think lots of brown liquors, gingers, and more aromatic styles. For my palette they are fantastic.

The real star of course is the food. At first it&#39;s tempting to pigeon hole this place as yet another farm to table new American restaurant. For the most part it probably is. Yet they often break out with dishes like Tandoori Chicken or aromatic chilled soups. The food is savory but playful. Lots of gels and sweet compliments help to balance the very well executed rustic dishes that the populist excels at.

The tasting menu is our preferred way of dining. For $115 my wife and I can enjoy all the food we could ever want, along with very thoughtful wine pairings (4 wines with 8 courses). Every time we leave thrilled at our experience. For my money this is one of the very best restaurants in Denver.r"

But that would not be fair to this establishment, which has become one of my favorite places to eat in Denver.  The sad thing is it is getting harder and harder to get a seat there.

On top of that, they have a fantastic bar with dudes who know how to make a wicked tasty whiskey cocktail.  The ambience is cozy and friendly with quirky little details and the people who work there are fast and very nice.

Exactly... Awesome.  Comically enough, I don&#39;t even remember what I had here.  Maybe they put something in the food to make that happen... I don&#39;t know.  But I do know I&#39;ll be going back, mouth watering and eager for more."

I had high expectations because everyone I know who had been there was raving about it. I would say we had a really good experience but maybe not as good as our friends. 

The interior is lovely and comfortable, the sort of upscale casual look that is becoming so common. In spite of having a reservation and a special event to celebrate (which was mentioned), we were seated right next to the servers&#39; station so we had constant company with servers refilling pitchers and grabbing silverware. A little annoying considering how many other tables were open. But again, not terrible and we did not ask to be moved. 

The server was great, knowledgeable, friendly, gave great suggestions, showed up when we needed him, didn&#39;t pester as we conversed, etc. 

We ordered cocktails from the happy hour and regular menus. My old fashioned was just OK. It&#39;s such a trendy drink, I know, but one of my favorites so I&#39;ve had them all over town. This one was a little weak, somehow, and slightly bland. The giant ice cube looked like it had freezer burn (?), not the clear ice I expect when a drink costs $12 but overall, just fine. 

We had a couple of small plates and a couple of entrees. portions were more generous than I was expecting, so that was a pleasant surprise. Green curry rockfish was delicious. Kind of wish the slat and vinegar popcorn was more fresh, it tasted exactly like popcorn that&#39;s been sitting out for a while. But it&#39;s popcorn so it served its purpose. 

For dessert, we had ice cream and macarons, lovely and delicious. 

Overall, we were happy but for the price tag, I wish I had been more....wowed. I can recommend it though I don&#39;t know if we will go back unless we go with others. There are so many other great places to try in Denver right now so unless it&#39;s just spectacular, it&#39;s hard to want to make this a regular dinner spot. Maybe for happy hour, though!"

I went here valentines week..expecting a long wait since that is usually a very busy week. Waited less than five minutes to be seated. They dont really do reservations so thats impressive. Tables are community style. I love this concept but I felt that they were a bit tight (sat at one of the high tables). There almost wasnt enough room for food/drinks and bumping the people next to you was easy if you weren&#39;t careful. My reason for 4/5 instead of 5. The lower height community tables looked to have a bit more room so maybe Ill request that next time.

Great beer selection - both on tap and in bottles. I had a really great belgian I havent seen before. They also had a nice menu of mixed drinks. Food is a shared plate concept  so for two people I would say two bigger plates and one smaller plate at the least. We started off with the sweet chili brussels sprouts. Probably the best Ive ever had next to my aunts homemade garlic sprouts. Next up was the Thai sausage - another great dish..actually more of a soup. The broth was amazing. Last out was the lamb (a new dish apparently). Its funny because I had lamb like 2 or 3 times in the past two weeks and was hesitant to get it again since I like variety..but it was heavily recommended so we went for it...and I am glad we did. It was awesome.

Service was good especially plate timing. As soon as one plate was done the next came out with zero/minimal waiting. I am definitely interested in going back to try out new things as the menu evolves!"

We arrived around 3 or 4 and were the only people there. The man working, who I assume was the owner, was friendly and helpful deciding on what to get. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options for us! My mom and I shared the veggie plate that comes with 3 falafels, baba ghanoush, choice of spicy or regular hummus, tabouleh, pita, and pickled turnips. We chose the regular hummus, which was really smooth and tasty. I haven&#39;t had many, but this baba ghanoush was the best I&#39;ve ever had. We added an additional 2 falafels, but they weren&#39;t as good as all the other reviews led me to hope. They had a nice, light airy texture, but not much taste. They were a pale tan color rather than the green I am used to. The plate was 10 dollars and enough for us to share and feel satisfied. My brother enjoyed his beef plate. 

I will be back to try the falafel pita with spicy hummus!!

The falafel is the best I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s so soft and fluffy! They&#39;re usually so dense. I feel like this is how a falafel should taste. The bottled sauces they put on the tables are amazing. We picked some up from the supermarket and my boyfriend puts them on our eggs in the morning. Can&#39;t wait to come back.

They have three flavors of hummus to choose from, regular, spicy and then there&#39;s like a middle-of-the-road. I really prefer the middle of the road hummus, it&#39;s delicious, I can&#39;t even describe the flavor...it&#39;s really good.  They always have fresh lettuce and salads as your sides. The meat is smoked and delicious. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch any day of the week They do have an Entertainment Book coupon that they honor. This place is the bomb!"

Ordered a chicken kabob wrap because the other entrees have potatoes which really sounds authentic Mediterranean (/sarcasm). When we asked for something to be fixed on the wrap, we were made to feel dumb &amp; they didn&#39;t apologize or recognize the error, only &#34;we make it how you want&#34;... Well you should have made it right first time, that&#39;s why we&#39;re asking for those ingredients, but thanks for making it how I want the 2nd time. Frustrating interaction... 

Didn&#39;t expect it to taste good &amp; it didn&#39;t. But we did expect it to be safe &amp; cooked properly to at least eat. The chicken was undercooked to the point it was raw inside. See pics attached to review. 

We&#39;re going back tomorrow to show them the undercooked meat &amp; hopefully get a refund. 

DON&#39;T WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME OR RISK YOUR FAMILY&#39;S HEALTH HERE. 

We regret our decision to try this place. 
Poor food, poor service &amp; a health risk."

This is a great family owned place.   Good quantity of food.   Shawarma plate for between 10 and 12 dollar.   Good food that will leave you full.   Get a side if falafel.

The lamb chop platter came with a wonderful Greek salad with feta cheese, homemade hummus, warm pita bread, wonderfully flavored rice and homemade potatoes -- we also added one falafel with tahini sauce and for dessert we got the amazing baklava with homemade pistachio ice cream.  This is truly a gourmet meal for a very reasonable price -- the value and taste of our food certainly deserves  more than five stars and the brothers who run the restaurant are so kind and take great pride in their food.

Thanks Yelpers for pointing me to this amazing restaurant. I would have missed out if I didn&#39;t Yelp while I was in the area. 

I ordered the combo plate with the spicy hummus.The flavors were perfect. They add a spicy sauce to the chicken and the tzatziki sauce to the beef, it included the hummus, roasted potatoes, rice, salad, and pita. All for around $9. The burritos looked huge and were only around $6. 

I love the fast casual dining, it seemed like Chipotle only Mediterranean. Service was friendly, helpful and fast. I proudly told the owner it was my first time and I heard about them on Yelp. 

When school is in session be mindful that they break for lunch between 10:30-11 and 11:30-12. When we arrived it was 11:40 and the place was packed, not an empty table or seat, and the line was out the door. We left and went back after 12 and it was still busy but there was plenty of seating. 

I appreciate a family owned business that uses fresh ingredients and makes everything homemade. Thumbs up!"

A nice touch also is that their pita bread is wrapped individually in foil, so it is kept nice and warm for when you&#39;re ready to eat it.

The falafels are very light and fluffy despite being deep fried. My wife always gets the veggie plate. My 5 year old loves the chicken/rice kids plate. I rotate between a plate and a sandwich. The guys are always friendly. The food is fast, fresh, and delicious. Chicken is plain which is a good thing in my book...it&#39;s also shaved very thinly so kinda falls apart in your mouth = GREAT!

They have a cheap $5 meal deal for students....Arapahoe HS is across the street. They&#39;re closed on Sundays.

This is our favorite strip mall due to Udom Thai, this place, Yogurtland, and Anthony&#39;s for a slice of pizza for the kiddo when we go Thai. Go and support these guys!"

The food is quite good, but this is definitely the Americanized experience of Mediterranean food. The flavors are authentic, but you order the food from a buffet (think Chipotle) and choose from selections such as &#34;spicy&#34; or &#34;regular&#34; hummus. 

I had the lamb platter with rice, potatoes, salad, spicy hummus, heated pita and a drink for $14.  That was a bit steep in light of the portion size, but I&#39;d go back for a lunch special.  Next time I&#39;ll go with the regular hummus. The place was packed with students at 11:30."

All of these are gluten free when without the pita.  When ordering the plates, one can choose brown rice instead of the white rice in order to avoid the semolina vermicelli which are part of the were 

The falafel here are perfect, lightly crisp on the outside, hot and fluffy on the inside with a bright and balanced seasoning profile.

Turns out that they make their own pickled turnips which are coloured using beet juice, just like grand parents used to do.  That&#39;s why some days the turnips are a little more or a little less pickled and their lentil soup is delicious.

My kids love eating here too.   

Also a good treat if you like a strong coffee, is their Turkish coffee."

We had always overlooked it because it&#39;s just a bit further away than another Mediterranean restaurant of much the same style. But we stopped in one evening on a whim, just to check it out. We&#39;ve been back an average of once every couple weeks ever since. The food is delicious (kabobs, shawarma, veggie platter)!!! Their falafel are fabulous - the perfect combination of crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. I&#39;ve never had a problem with the food quality. And I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s crack in their potatoes, because I crave them regularly! :) The service is fabulous, and incredibly friendly, even when there&#39;s a teeny bit of a language barrier.

Pretty simple and I can&#39;t say it was great, it was ok, didn&#39;t get a lot of flavor from any of the ingredients, other than the garlic sauce, maybe I should have asked for more sauce?  Also, had the chicken shawarma plate with salad, spicy hummus, potatoes, and white rice. The only stand out was the spicy hummus.

Since my Dad is hungry and Dinner is approaching to Shawarma Mediterranean Grill we went.  This latest visit was on Saturday June 8th 2013.  Time was about 18:10hrs ish.  

Right when we enter this establishment, I make sure, my parents and Hubs get the paper menu so they can decide on what they intend to eat.  From what I could recall, that evening, their SPECIALS OF THE DAY were Trout and Lamb Curry.

So here were the items we opt for :

*  Chicken Shawarma Plate ($8.29) each 2 orders hence ($16.58)
*  Lamb Curry ($10.99)
*  Lamb Shawarma Plate ($11.49)
*  Falafel (6 pieces) ($4.99)
*  Add Feta Cheese ($0.75)
*  Add Tabbouleh in 2 of the dishes @ $0.75 each hence ($1.50)
*  4 LARGE Fountain Drink @ $1.89 each hence ($7.56)

All main entrée comes with Pita Bread which are already wrapped in Aluminium foil.  My Dad and Hubs each had the Chicken Shawarma Plate.  My Mum had the Lamb Shawarma Plate while I opt for Lamb Curry.

Hubs opt for the Chicken Shawarma Plate.  For his order, he opt for Brown Rice, Spiced Potatoes, Spicy Hummus, Chicken Shawarma, Feta Cheese, and all the trimmings such as Pickled Onions, Shredded Cheese, Tomatoes and Pickles.  Hubs is A-OK for his Dinner, though he feels the portion should be more and the pricing could be cheaper to the pockets.  Furthermore, that evening, Hubs was slightly under the weather.  Therefore his tastebud was a little off.

For My Dad&#39;s order, he opt to have, Brown Rice, Spiced Potatoes, Spicy Hummus, Chicken Shawarma, Corn, Tabbouleh, a light drizzle of SPICY Sauce and Tahini Sauce.  My Dad does not fancy the Tabbouleh as much coz he said it was too sour for his liking.

For My Mum&#39;s order she opt to have, Brown Rice, Spiced Potatoes, Spicy Hummus, Lamb Shawarma, Lettuce, Corn, Red Onions, Tahini Sauce, Tomatoes and a light drizzle on the &#34;Spicy Sauce&#34;.  My Mum was A-OK for what she had.  

Both my parents raved about the Falafel they had.  They like the Falafel THE BEST!  Yes the Falafel came out hot, was crispy outside, soft inside, very flavorful and cook properly for my parents liking.  As for my order of Lamb Curry, it was tenderly cooked and SPICY as I want to, coz I specifically ask for the &#34;SPICY&#34; sauce to be drizzled on top of my plate.

That evening our server his name was Pierre.  Just take note additional cost are reflected if you order Feta Cheese and Tabbouleh respectively.  From my previous visits, I forgot about the &#34;stamped-card&#34; that Shawarma Mediterranean Grill had.  So Note To Self, next time Bring the &#34;stamped-card&#34; so once all &#34;8&#34; stamped-tags, I had, my 9thh Lunch/Dinner is &#34;FREE&#34; aka &#34;Free Sandwich&#34; OR $5.00 OFF from ANY PLATE.  All in all a satisfying Dinner we had at Shawarma Mediterranean Grill.

I have no complaints whatsoever about that.  My &#34;Chicken Shawarma sandwich&#34; (Tender marinated chicken breast filet. Includes creamy garlic sauce, spiced potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles) was really more of a &#34;wrap&#34;.  It came in a thin burrito-like wrap that crisped up a bit in the warming process.  This warm and somewhat crunchy delivery mechanism was okay, but was not what I really wanted.  

The subtitle of Shawarma Mediterranean Grill is &#34;Fresh Ingredients . . . Healthy Eating&#34;, and perhaps that is why there was a disconnect between my expectations and what they were serving.  I really prefer my Shawarma in a pita, but I know that a wrap is an acceptable variant, even if not what I want.  The concept here seemed less like traditional Shawarma, and more like a healthy, Shawarma-esque, Chipotle-like product.  If that is your thing (fast, casual, and relatively healthy) you may love the food here.  I would have preferred more strongly flavored and substantial fare.  The price was reasonable."

It looks like this is a family-owned establishment. I was disappointed at how &#39;Americanized&#39; the restaurant was, which will unfortunately probably prevent me from coming back. I can really appreciate an authentic Mediterranean/Lebanese restaurant that serves larger portion sizes and is not assembly line style. I also waited in line for my food for 10-15 minutes with only 3-4 people in front of me. With only a limited amount of time for lunch, this was a bit inconvenient.

My teenagers cannot thank the owner(s) enough for having a Student Discount if they show school ID. It&#39;s a great deal for a yummy, filling, wonderful meal. Ok so the plates vs the wrap? For the money get the wrap. Get the potatoes and rice (same as what you get in the plate) then go from there. We LOVE the garlic sauce but have stopped adding it to our orders because our breath stinks for days despite our maniacal focus on mouthwash/breath mints for days afterward. Hate to give up the garlic sauce but the tahini is a fantastic substitute. Yum. We ALWAYS get the hot sauce because it adds a tasteful kick and isn&#39;t just hot for the sake of being hot. Great flavor and not too hot. What could possibly be wrong with those tasty marinated onions, the creamy hummus, the warm potatoes. You can&#39;t go wrong eating here. If you&#39;re not too full, spoil yourself with the pistachio ice cream. Or get an order of falafel because they are so light and tasty that you&#39;ll swear of eating them elsewhere."

I had the lamb shank (as usual). It was melt in my mouth delicious. Kind of weird eating it with white or brown rice though. Still their spicy hummus and baba ghanouj were the right consistence. It was creamy, but with some chuckiness to them so they are more like a side dish and less like a spread.  Their salad was fresh, the red onions were potent and their pickled turnips had a kick to them. I didn&#39;t really need the potatoes, but they were tasty too."

That&#39;s how good this place is. It&#39;s in a strip mall next to Chipotle. As I walked in I was greeted by friendly staff. The menu is simple to read and TONS of great choices. The food behind the counter looked fresh. 

First Visit: I got the Chicken Shwarma Plate. Yummy! I passed on the potatoes, and got the hummus, babaganoush, pickles. The Chicken was really tender and tasted really good. Garlic lovers rejoice as this place has a killer garlic sauce. I finished all of the plate. 

Second Visit: Chicken Sharma Sandwich. Again great selection, Chicken was tasty! You get to pick your ingredients you want in your sandwich. I picked garlic, tahini sauce, tomatoes, pickles, olives and onion. They warm it all up and it tasted really good. 

Third Visit: Beef Sharma Sandwich. Once again the beef was tender and tasted great. I picked my ingredients and thanks the 2 men behind the counter. 

All the staff I&#39;ve encountered were friendly, explained each item, and gave me what I wanted from behind the counter in terms of ingredients. They didn&#39;t hold back or give me a hard time. 

A MUST visit next time. Plenty of parking here."

Spit roasted lamb,beef, and chicken cut order.. I have dined on everything on this menu and not a bad item!!! My favorite is the beef and lamb combo shwarmma sandwich with extra garlic sauce! You can dress your shwarmma sandwich the way you like with a great selection of ingredient, marinated onions, tabbouleh, hummus 3 ways, baba ghanouj,tomatoes, pickeled turnips!(wow) feta cheese! If your love for garlic is like mine you can&#39;t get enough of the garlic sauce, creamy fresh garlic and it has the garlic heat, If heat is your thing the house  made hot sauce will put sweat on the brow and hair on the chest!! But it is a good flavor full heat..tou don&#39;t want to stop eating it!!The Tabbouleh is well balanced and it a great top to your meats or sandwich!!
Let&#39;s talk Falafels made to order!!! Served with tahini sauce... The Falafels have crisp and crunchy outside with the lightest soft and airy center.. You really don&#39;t even need the sauce! my kids (12&amp;8)  will eat a order a piece with their sandwiches I usually get a side of hot sauce and garlic sauce!! The garlic sauce is addictive!!! No one in the area is serving food like this!!! 

Kabobs are made to order!! My sons favorite is the combo kabob plate!!!  My 12 year old rips that dish apart!! 

If your lucky you might catch the Curry Special they run every once in a while!! 
Creamy buttery lamby heaven served of Jasmine rice BOMB!! At 11$ bucks you will not be displeased!!

For Lent they have been running Rainbow Trout special!! Which I had to try!! And they nailed it!!!

Desserts I have a huge sweet tooth..  The baklava is sticky an nutty heaven.. Topped with pistachio ice cream!!!! 

Some time I will just stop in for a Malbie this pudding with rose water and strawberry glaze!! Oh WOW!!! My first experience and ow was hooked!! Malbie and a cup of coffee!! It&#39;s a nice night cap for a chef!! 

They do have a kids meal for small ones 3$-6$

This place is not a chain and you can tell!!!
The behind the counter are the family who&#39;s the place!! They are passionate about the food and family life!!!! This place is a diamond In the burbs!!!! I feed a family of 4 for under $35 with drinks!!

If your kids have an event at arapahoe high school.. (Across the street) Coming down to park meadows or Ikea it worth the extra 2 mins in the car to spoil your taste buds and senses to real authentic shwarmma!! 

The avengers would approve!!!

Shwarmma is closed on Sundays!! Which I can respect.. It is their family day!! And when you work as hard as they do!! Ya need a day for family!!

It&#39;s located in a small strip, but the owners make good use of the space.  It&#39;s actually very open and comfortable in the dining area.  It&#39;s not much different than other grills of this type.  I walked in, saw a pretty simple menu, and ordered some lunch.  (I should say that I much prefer a simple menu, even when it&#39;s at a fast-food spot like this.)

I ordered a beef kabob platter and a side of falafel.  The falafel was presented first and I tried that while waiting for the rest.  The presentation was very nice, and it had good flavor, but it seemed to be lacking in texture.  The kabob also had an unpleasant texture, but the flavor and taste was good, mildly but noticeably spiced.  I liked their hummus, and both the spiced potatoes and rice lent a good balance to the platter.

The service was nothing less than impressive, however.  The gentleman behind the counter obviously took pride in the daily fare, and genuinely seemed interested in pleasing his customers.  

Overall, it wasn&#39;t bad at all, and I&#39;m interested in coming back to try another dish, and I must say that the service is what sways me in that direction."

THe falafel is PERFECT here. None of that mass market crispy fried outside and dry inside - tender, tender, tender, all the way through. Fluffy! When I die, I want 72 plates of falafel to greet me in heaven."

Can&#39;t get too overboard on this review since it was a simple affair and American Food is what it is.  Though a bit of a personal touch when they returned our check the kids got a animal balloon, which was pretty cool.

Definitely a good spot to stop at, and apparently they have a classic car show every Wednesday."

The waitress was rude, pushy and asked from 20+ feet away if you were ready to order. The coffee is the worst coffee I have ever had, I like the traditional diner coffee that you can stand a spoon up in, this was not that, it was burnt so bad it tasted like burnt toast through and through I couldn&#39;t even finish a cup. Then the staff begins making mass amounts of balloon animals in the area that all the diners are located (they pushed everyone to one side of the restaurant while it was slow), you think they could have done that elsewhere where people don&#39;t have to listen to the horrible screech that it makes.

After all of the reviews I can only assume that all of the people here have never been to a good mom and pop diner and lived in the Denver area or other large cities their whole lives.

The only good thing about this place was the decor, but even the cool nostalgia isn&#39;t enough to get me to go above a 1 star."

I have to say I was not impressed by this resturant.  I loved the decor but that&#39;s about where the gratitudes end.  The greeter just stared at us when we walked in.  He didn&#39;t greet us, just walked us to our seats.  Our waitress was nice but I really have nothing more to say.  My cup of water was not refilled once while I was there.  

Word from the wise... The turkey dinner is very bad.  The gravy was canned, the cranberries were canned, the turkey was microwaved and rubbery, the stuffing was stiff and flavorless.  It did look good but it was lacking on any real turkey flavor.  Very disappointing."

We were passing through Aurora and the clerk at motel told us to go there.  She said that the food was good, which it was.  The atmosphere was great; it was like stepping back into the 60&#39;s.  

My wife had a Monte Cristo and I had Southern Fried Catfish, both were very good.

I always, I mean always, get their pancakes! I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m having a burger, or something else that normally doesn&#39;t go with breakfast foods, I always get an order of pancakes. They are fluffy and moist in the center with a bit of a crust on the outer edges, it is pure bliss. Because this is a diner all their foods are served 24/7. And I can get their pancakes anytime I stop in.
  My family loves this place too and the burgers are great and the gyro sandwich is great as well. We have always had a great experience with any meal we&#39;ve ordered. 
  The staff is excellent and always hustling. They even remember me since I&#39;ve been there so often. They can get busy at times with Sunday&#39;s being the busiest.
  I will be back soon. Did I mention their pancakes?!"

Customer Service:
They we&#39;re on it, very attentive and fast and the food didn&#39;t take long at all to come out. Very nice staff, great attitudes and very respectful.

FOOD:
Again I had another  horrible mouth surgery so I had to eat soft foods again. I had the hotcakes, and scrambled eggs, I know pretty plain right but it was good!!! But the egg and I was better, both are awesome though. My gf had the shrimp platter and of course I was jealous cause it looked really good.

I ordered the steak omelette which wasn&#39;t fancy or expensive, but had a decent flavor to it. Each bite had a nice chunk of steak but I feel like they could have added some more complementary fillings. Is fillings even the right term? I need more stuff in my omelette for flavor!

Our server Sunny, was exceptional! So friendly and efficient. Started off with an order of the fried pickles that came with a side of ranch--just freakingly delicious!!

The milkshakes are the best, thick, creamy and Yummy! We had the chocolate banana, the strawberry banana and the caramel butterscotch milkshakes. Just fabulous.

My dad ordered the Double-Decker hamburger, my sister the American Classic and I ordered the Kraut Dog!! All of them were huge and were made exactly how we wanted them.

Upon entry the hostess just starred at us then finely said its busy it&#39;s going to be awhile. Luckily a girl behind the counter said you can sit at the bar/counter if you like it&#39;s no wait. So thus is were I grabbed a stool. 

After looking over the menu I ordered a simple bacon sausage eggs and hash brown breakfast plate. Once my food arrived a dove right in to the the most bland warm not hot food I may have ever tasted. I honestly think McDonald&#39;s mcmuffins have more flavor than everything that was on my plate. FYI I despise the Golden Arches and avoid it at all cost hence what brought me here. After chocking down my food that I smothered in salt pepper and hot sauce cause I was starving we quickly paid and left. 

Do yourself a favor and skip the hype train on this one. The atmosphere doesn&#39;t even compensate for the awful food. There are far better local eateries in the surrounding 2-5mi area."

MONTHS after I posted my 4 star review I began getting harassed on Yelp by an employee whom I had never met. After calling management I found that this girl only started working AFTER my visit so it was impossible to have met this girl. This disgruntled employee decided to attack a 4 star review by saying nasty things that I don&#39;t appreciate.

We came for brunch so we had a bit of breakfast ( served all day) and a bit of lunch.

The Gouda Omelet was just very heavy. I ordered it with egg whites which they substituted for 89 cents. I couldn&#39;t finish it! The oil is actually still lingering in my belly! 
The America Classic burger was really the star of the meal! Cooked well and SUPER TASTY!
The fries were perfect...hot and fat and crispy!

The service was super fast and friendly!"

I also had the desperado fries which were awesome. The green chili has a great kick to it.

Service: not really efficient. We were just starting on our appetizer when our food came out so our dining experience wasn&#39;t as good as I thought it would be. Our waitress was really nice But she wasn&#39;t very observant on our needs. We needed refills on our drinks and those never came.

They all wolfed down four various sizes and styles of burgers with fries, while theMrs. had a open faced turkey sandwich with mashed, veggies and cranberry sauce and said it was ok and while I chose chicken-fried steak with country gravy mashed spuds with a salad. Mine was pretty dang good.

Fast-forward to the am. We have tired of hotel breakfast after five days on the road came here for breakfast. Wifey went for the Mexican Scramble, and said it was blah, while I went for the Mexican Benedict which had chorizo, Not!, more like breakfast sausage, but with a splash or two of Tabasco it was fine.

Yes my precious I did spell that right.  You see &#34;Hangry&#34;.... that&#39;s when you are so hungry you get a little grumpy and angry about it so you now are not just hungry suga..you are downright HANGRY.   There is one in our party (he who shall not be named) who must eat to be a pleasant individual so everyone else is concerned about their empty stomachs but we ALL KNOW that he who shall not be named MUST eat and I do mean soon. 

So somehow with three peoiople telling one driver where they should go, we stumble across Rosie&#39;s Diner. . Clearly we are all lost but feel eating might help us all think with clear minds, (honestly I know my family and doubt it will make a dang bit of difference but you know how you say these things to sound like a rational sane person? yep that&#39;s us).  

Rosie&#39;s reminded me of one of those Jerzey diners I loved where the food it amazing, and the service is exceptional and the people are so friendly and happy to see you. Rosie&#39;s however comma (pause)..was not that diner.  It had the look and the feel, but was just really short on service and good food. No pleasant greeting, I mean we couldn&#39;t even get a smile, good morning..nothing.  Just follow me to your seat.  Then service was slow and when the women did get to our table she treated us like she was annoyed we were one more table she had to wait on.   But we stayed and we ordered.  All around we had steak and eggs, breakfast burrito, typical breakfast omlettes, sausage, potatoes, toast, coffee, juice.  Well I will say this...not sure where they got the steak, but it was hands down the toughest and most fat filled steak I have ever eaten in my life.  I rarely order red met but then I go through this wave of craving it and this was just a disappointment.

I rarely eat potatoes or bread but it appears I did not miss much as all my peeps said the potatoes tasted like wax, the burittos were dry and the eggs were overcooked.  So to sum it up slow service, angry waitress, horrible food...I mean...I really do try to be fair and so let me see if I can find something nice to say....Nope.  Can&#39;t."

As a Jersey girl, the first thing I noticed when walking in was a large New Jersey map/poster on the wall.  When I asked the waitress about it, she informed me that the physical diner, which used to be rooted in Little Ferry, NJ, was loaded on a truck and moved to Denver-awesome! 

Just like a Jersey diner, there is an extensive menu with sandwiches, salads, breakfast etc. My sister ordered the cobb salad and I ordered the southwest salad.  Both were pretty big and very fresh.  The southwest salad comes in one of those fried tortilla bowls with refried beans on the bottom- very tasty.  Our waitress was very friendly and quick, which was a big plus because service is usually slower out West, I&#39;ve found.

The sandwich was sweet, salty, savory, crunchy, gooey, and that&#39;s all before I added the heavenly strawberry jam! Seriously if you are looking for a delicious masterpiece to sink your teeth into, look no further!
The Shake...Oh my, where do I start?! First off, they brought me the leftover that didn&#39;t fit in my glass?!!!! This proved a win for me and my hubby who was able to enjoy my excess - a mistake I may not make in the future ;-)
I ordered the peanut butter shake and had honestly braced myself for some fake peanut butter knock-off. Wow, was I wrong! I was brought a real-milk milkshake with little chunks of peanut butter still dispersed throughout it! Can we all say &#39;HEAVEN&#39;!! Order this only if you have a love of peanut butter!
My hubby ordered the fish and chips which was also yummy. We both agreed that the fish had a nice buttery and crunchy flavor. The &#39;chips&#39; or fries on the other hand were not the greatest. 
Overall, this place is wonderful and worth the visit! I really enjoyed the old 50&#39;s Diner feel complete with working juke box (it&#39;s only $0.25 to play 2 songs!!) and candy counter.

As nice as the hotel is, like most hotels it&#39;s food is something to be desired; ESPECIALLY the breakfast.  I decided to pull up the good ol&#39; Yelp app and find a breakfast spot.  The one that looked most delicious (what does that look like?  Hell, I don&#39;t even know.  Its like porn....you know it when you see it) and started walking.  Rosie&#39;s is only a little over half a mile walk from the hotel.  Its even closer to a Super 6 and some other hotel I can&#39;t remember.  

When I walked in, I was greeted by a hostess/server who moved so fast I didn&#39;t even get her name.  She sat me down, dropped a menu on the table, and **pweew!!** she was gone.   Even though the menu wasn&#39;t huge, she could tell I was struggling with it.  I only saw maybe 8 options for breakfast which seemed odd for a diner.  She asked &#34;did you see these?&#34;  There right in front of  me was 2 pages of additional specialty breakfast items.  I chose the Mexican skillet: hash browns, scrambled eggs, Texas style chili, and cheese.  All through this decision making, I never saw the bottom of my cup because after about 3 or for sips of coffee, my server was topping me off.  Like I said before....**pweew!!!**

10 minutes later (or less actually) she dropped the bomb on me like the Gap Band.  The portions were huge!   I&#39;m a big man and couldn&#39;t eat the whole thing.  I was able to walk to and from Rosie&#39;s, eat a huge breakfast, not get hit by a car crossing Illiff, and wave to the countless bunny rabbits on the hotel lawn all in about 50 minutes.

Thanks, Rosie&#39;s.  I enjoyed it."

The food was good, but as another reviewer mentioned I found a hair in my food, as well. :(  Didn&#39;t happen till the end of my meal though, fortunately.

I had two over-easy eggs, hash browns, and pancakes.  Pancakes were really good!  I am a vegetarian so, they let me substitute a breakfast meat for a bowl of fruit, which was nice.

Overall, great service and great atmosphere.  Food was good, but I wouldn&#39;t say it was anything extraordinary.  Only gave them 4 stars before of the whole hair thing."

This morning my boyfriend took me out to Rosie&#39;s for breakfast.  I had the &#34;handyman build your own breakfast&#34; with bacon, sausage and french toast.  The coffee was nice and strong, the french toast melted in my mouth, the bacon was perfectly chewy and the hash browns were a nice mix of crispy and soft, just the way I like it.

I&#39;ve only ever had lunch here once and had a gyro sandwich.  Pretty darn tasty!  I&#39;d definitely have it again.  I haven&#39;t made it in for dinner yet or sampled any of the other non-breakfast items, but from experience and sampling multiple different breakfast items, I have to say that Rosie&#39;s is the BEST place to grab breakfast!

I ordered a Ruben sandwich, it was soggy, the cheese I believe must have been cheese wiz. It tasted nothing like a Ruben. I ordered onion rings with it that were more oil then onion. Just a terrible experience. It must be the nearby hotels keeping them in business because there food is defiantly not worth returning for. I did try them a year ago and had a similar experience, knowing that there sister restaurant went bust most likely for the same reason, I thought the owners would have enough common sense to improve there product and put some kind of quality into it, but it seems greed is more important. Save your money so many other places to chose from I kick myself for even trying to give them another chance. My son ordered the breakfast tacos that were just as bad. What a complete waste.

When they first opened a while back (some years ago), most prevalently when they shut down the one closer to my house off of Peoria St. I&#39;ve been involved in a love hate type relationship for a while with this line of restaurants. I go and they either really please me, or they fall completely short of the goal line. I visited the Aurora location on Evans this evening and they were awesome. Probably some of the best service I have received at this or any location in years. The food was stellar, the attentiveness of the waitress was on point, and we received multiple visits from a gentleman I assume was the manager, and he even offered our group of 7 sopes for the children.  I&#39;m not sure if they are under new management, or just trying to turn &#34;things&#34; around, but they made for an awesome dining experience this evening for my family and I. So thank you very much! We will be back... 

Side Note: Our favorite dishes would have to be the rellenos, soft and crispy, do you research if you&#39;re unsure what that means. Also, the Real de Minas special. **** fried bacon wrapped shrimp, Carne Asada Steak, bean and rice combo, so good!!! I usually will order the combos which allow you to pick and choose your items. You really cannot go wrong here. 

If I had one this this evening to complain about it would be that the beans seemed a little watery and not very flavorful, but in comparison to everything else we&#39;re great!"

Now for the food, you come here to eat, incredibly expensive in my opinion for the food itself, easily 1/3 more than it should be, I ordered nachos, they came and they were COLD,I asked the wait staff are these supposed to be cold? , she promptly took my plate and as far as I could tell simply reheated  the entire plate , the inside was still cold but now the chips were soggy, i was irritated, i ate few chips and realized this place was  a disaster, i pushed the plate away thinking this is the worst plate of Nachos I have ever eater and it was $11.00 dollars for nachos !!!!! My wife ordered fish tacos, asked for grilled they came fried, waitress was too stupid to even notice although she wrote the order, no sauce at all just tacos and a bunch fried cubes of fish ,, wow that is something ... huh??11 dollars, had to ask for sauce for tacos, waitress could not understand that sauce should come with a dish like that , had to ask twice, sauce came and  it sucked , flavorless, but  to be fair my daughter ate her Torta and was happy with it.. 

Service: for some reason the waitress figured we do not need napkins or silverware, had to ask...Loud echo y noise filled place, booth was too small, felt like i was on airplane seat, not enough room for two people to sit facing each other with getting feet in the way of each other.
to make it all more improbable it was packed with people , what the fook were they eating.???.. all In  all a crappy place..

 oh yeah waitress saw i was not eating the food and solicitously asked if it was alright.. Like she cared, I was embarrassed to tell her it was so bad, but being a sport i told her these were the worst nachos I had ever eaten (or tried to eat), she whisked  them right off my table saying i should come back and try something else, oh yeah that will happen... there was not even a suggestion i order another dish or comp my totally inedible uneaten meal.

i did not leave a tip although the receipt was crazy enough to suggest i should leave 22 % as Propina!!

crappy food lousy stupid service and oh yeah  don&#39;t forget my tip.."

Waiters are always great. Food is on point. If you feel like having a fast food meal order tacos, they are delicious and made to order. A problem is there is a big disconnect with management. Waiters sometimes are doing things themselves and the manager goes missing. Another issue is during weekends, they have live music that is way too loud. The music literally stops the conversations around the tables, instead of enhancing the good conversations. Rigo the manager says everyone likes that but I&#39;m not everybody and some of my friends hates this as well as I&#39;ve seen patrons literally walking out the door without ordering anything due the loud noise. One night A friend and I were having dinner and a group of people came in, about 12 customers. Two minutes after the loud music started and all went to the door and left. Music is to enhance not to replace. There are bars and clubs for that."

We got here around 6 and the parking lot was empty and was bit concerned.  Joe&#39;s crab shack  or....

We got seated immediately and waitress came immediately and took our drink order.  Chips and salsas and bean dip came out very quickly also.  Very good.  Loved fresh taste of chips and salsa.  

When the drinks came, she took the order and everthing was going ok.   When we ate most of the chips and salsa, another waitress brought out 2nd batch.  Very very good. 

Our food was taking lot longer than anticipated.  When the table behind us (sat after us) got their food 1st, we are like... &#34;what the ...&#34; and thats when our food arrived.  Apparently, our waitress was busy somewhere else and our food was sitting around.
It was still hot and tasty and no complaints .  One of the order was missing one item.  Should pointed out but we were already quite full from eating all that chips.

We also ordered sopapias but it  was kinda like flat bread... not the kind that had center all raised up.  Tasted quite doughy and flavorless.  Actually, dough flavor.  Haha 

Tried to fix our bill with the waitress and noticed that other table had to return two plates due to some type of problem...  ours was good..no complaint..just short of one item.  After few minutes of back and forth, management was able to take off $ missing item.

Food..  ok.   
Service...  ok..  could have checked on us more often but she was too busy..

I will definetely prefer the cornerstar location for future Mexcian food craving."

The mango margarita had a distinct syrup flavor so I&#39;m hazarding that the flavoring is a cheap brand.  Don&#39;t expect the best margarita here, either in strength or taste.

When we arrived they said it was about a 40 min wait. Ended up waiting close to an hour and a half. We had to let them know a table was empty and only needed to be cleaned for them to go and cleaned it for us. After seating us down it took a good 40 min for them to even recognize we were there. My husbands drink it self took another good 30 min. Very disorganized and crowded place. Could even be dangerous on how close the chairs and tables are to eachother. They could barely walk through with the hot food and by hot i mean boiling hot. Busy restaurant yes, more staff maybe? 
We ordered fries on the side and the waitress brought us more rice instead because they ran out of fries without even asking us, she just assumed rice was ok. Idk...would definitely think twice before coming here!"

It frustrates me so much to have to give them only 3 stars because I want to love this place like I used to when I first started coming here!! Here is the skinny, The food flavor, quality and quantity is WAY better at this location, than the Corner stone location.  We are regulars at both!! The food consistently is HORRIBLE at Cornerstone.  Burnt asada, dry beans, stale rice... but the service is 150% better at cornerstone.  So pick your poison.?
 We went in to the Evans location again tonight, because we wanted good food and knowing we will get crappy service, we went anyway..  the place is constantly dead here and there were 6 servers (FOH girls ) standing around.  Singing &#34;La Puerta Negra&#34; but not taking care of their tables at all. I had to get up to refill our own salsa, chips, teas,.. Emma was our server. No bueno. 
The iced tea tastes like dirty water tonight, the asada was good, one Sope was dry and stale, one was fresh and good. But all that can be looked over if we had great service on such a slow night!!?? It pained me to only leave her 15% max.  I generally always tip 25-30% even if they suck, as long as they are trying hard... but  no effort from these servers to want to be there to do a good job at all! It&#39;s sad,  because I really want to love this place again! I feel as if the Mom and dad need to go in there and whip this staff into place? Maybe move some of the better servers ftom cornerstone to this location?  
I&#39;m in the business,  so I understand how hard it is.  But when there is just flat out lack of effort and neglect. Not sure I want to spend my hard earned money there.

I have to say, with all the good Mexican restaurants in town to choose from, RDM holds up pretty well!  It&#39;s got a very cozy southwestern interior, but also has TVs at every conceivable angle, so it can double as a sports bar.  

Boy and I both enjoyed the fact that the chips and salsa also came with a spicy black bean dip.  We both ordered combo plates and a queso fundido with chorizo to share.  The food was good, standard Tex-Mex fare.  It was all tasty, though most of it didn&#39;t stand out from other Mexican restaurants.  The exception was the queso fundido, which was perfectly flavored with the chorizo without being overwhelmingly spicy, and the tamales we both ordered, with were the perfect mix of meat to corn meal and were not at all dry.

We will definitely be back, though I think we&#39;re more inclined to come for queso and beer during a game than to come for dinner."

Maybe it was the sorta detached feeling we got from the hostess stand but we went for it and I&#39;m glad we did. It&#39;s truly authentic-feeling. The TV&#39;s all play Latino and Spanish channels and it was fun to watch them while eating chips and not have a clue what they were saying! The chips and salsa that they bring out was good. At one point I almost had to curdle some ice cubes in a napkin and marinate my burning lips but I survived. I had the 3 ground beef tacos and they were hands down excellent. Probably some of the best tacos I&#39;ve had. The only reason I&#39;m not 5-starring this experience is because I noticed a couple times the waitress sat down at a booth and would text or do something on her phone right next to our booth where customers can see. That&#39;s weird to me. I just feel like this whole phone thing at work cheapens any situation especially when twice we needed her for a refill and a napkin and then looking over and seeing that I wasn&#39;t overly impressed.

This is a long one, but you should read it!I have never ever written a review, good or bad, but our experience here was one in my 56 years I have never had. We were kicked out!!!!  First, with the salsa and chips they give you a crab dip, which sounds lovely, and is pretty good, but if you&#39;re allergic to seafood and they don&#39;t tell you it&#39;s seafood, that&#39;s bad. But when you let them know they really should tell people what they are eating, you get a response of, well, if you have a reaction we can call someone for you.  Ok. We let that slide. One of us order a tostada and a chili relleno, the other the enchilada plate with eggs on it. Sounds yummy and different. The waitress brings an enchilada plate, with no eggs,  a tostada and a chili relleno PLATE.  Long story short, we don&#39;t see the waitress again to tell there&#39;s been a mistake.  So we decide to just eat.  The food is horrible. I&#39;m mean horrible!  Mexican food is Mexican food. You pretty much know what you&#39;re gonna get. But never have we had Mexican food that has no taste, soggy enchiladas, oh, the tomatoes on the top were good. That&#39;s what we ate.  So we waited and waited and waited for our waitress to return, you may be thinking, well, they were very busy. Not the case. Maybe 6 other tables of people. Finally flagged down a different waitress to get ours. She came, we told her the problem, she said she&#39;d have to talk to her manager. So, we waited, waited , waited, she never came back. So we went to the front, she was there, her manager was outside on personal call, he saw us, she went out, he kept talking, then all he&#39;ll broke loose!! He storms in, we try to first tell him he just can&#39;t serve seafood without telling people what it is. His response? Well you didn&#39;t have a reaction right? What am I suppose to do? Tell you our salsa has salsa in it?! You don&#39;t know who you&#39;re dealing with. I&#39;m not just the manager here!! You wanna cause a problem! Just get out, just get out!!  So we left!"

Bean dips, cabbage dips...just a few we have had here. 

The service here is really where it falls short, I almost gave it 3 stars but the food makes up for it. I had the sopapilla relena with combo chicken and beef which was delicious. It was almost a fajita type meal but with a sopapilla instead of tortillas, delicious.

There were what seemed to be a combo of 3 waitresses assigned to our table but it somehow took almost 5 minutes just to get our drinks and refills were quite slow also. The food is what you come for and to be honest, anything we have ordered has been extremely tasty and flavorful"

I went in on Friday, 1/9/15 for a family birthday dinner. We were a very large party once everyone showed up, about 35-40 total. I was amongst the first 5 to arrive. Once I arrived and found my seat, I ordered a basic house margarita with salt. The waitress took the other 4 drink orders and took about 15 minutes to return with them (3 were waters, one was beer) but my margarita didn&#39;t come. I waited patiently because I have managed, bartended, and was a waitress at restaurants for years, so I know first-hand how stressful and hard big parties are. Ten more minutes went by and more family showed up and still no margarita. I had to ask another waitress for one, thinking I&#39;d for sure get it. Nope, wrong again. 30 minutes later, still no margarita. We then had to ask ANOTHER man who was walking around (who I thought was the manager, but was not. The manager I later found out was sitting by the front door on his phone texting this whole time) to please bring me a margarita. 45 minutes later I finally had my drink order. It was a giant red flag for things to come. 

The food was good, I ordered green enchiladas and rice and beans and my boyfriend ordered tacos. My aunt who was sitting across from me ordered shrimp rolled in bacon because another relative ordered it and she wanted a plate of her own. However, it never came. When she flagged down the waitress about it, the waitress did not even apologize for forgetting it. Her words instead were, &#34;Yeahhhh...I forgot to put those in.&#34; (I&#39;m not even joking, I wish I was) Unbelievable. 

Here was the kicker. We got our bill dropped off and right there on the top, BAM! $8.00 for a margarita. She gave the bill to my boyfriend and told him to just not tip her...Like that would make it okay. I grabbed the bill and I asked our waitress why I was being charged $8.00 for something I waited over 45 minutes for and had to ask 3 people for? She took the bill and said she&#39;d handle it. She brought it back and said, &#34;Okay, I took off half.&#34; To say I was infuriated is an understatement. I am not a cheapskate by any means, but the least they could do for my ridiculous wait for ONE drink is comp the dang thing. I went to look for the manager who to my amazement was on his phone texting. When I told him my situation he gave me a gift card to return to the restaurant and gave me a completely un-genuine apology. I asked him, &#34;Are you guys short staffed or something? It&#39;s a Friday night.&#34; And he told me, &#34;Yeah we actually are and one of our bussers didn&#39;t show up.&#34; He KNEW his staff was short-handed, and instead of getting off his behind to help out his team and make sure this BIG party in the back was taken care of, this joke of a &#34;manager&#34; was on his phone. When we left, he watched us leave (again, he was sitting by the front door) and did not say anything. Not, &#34;Sorry again about that&#34; or &#34;Thanks guys, come see us again soon&#34;, nothing. 

I will NEVER visit nor do I recommend this restaurant to anyone. The owner should be embarrassed at who is &#34;running&#34; this facility."

My family went in on Friday night (1/9/15) for a cousins birthday party. It was an extremely large party (35 people). Let me say this, I completely understand that difficulty comes with a large party and service will never be perfect having to please so many people. I am an assistant manager at a family owned restaurant and have been a server for 4 years. However, my girlfriend and I showed up at 7pm and we ordered 2 waters and 1 fat tire. The table was split up between 2 waitresses. One waitress (not serving us) was doing well. Meanwhile our waitress, who was mediocre as an overstatement, was absolutely terrible.  After finally having to address the other waitress (the one who knew what she was doing), I received my glass of water after waiting 50 minutes. After an hour of waiting I finally received my fat tire and was able to order food. I ordered a fajita burrito which tastes very good, I recommend it. My girlfriend ordered a bean and cheese burrito with no chili on it, with a side of sour cream and guacamole. Easy enough? Not for our waitress. Her burrito showed up WITH chili on it, with no sour cream and guacamole. I asked the waitress for a side of sour cream and guacamole onced she dropped the food off, she acknowledged and said she&#39;d go grab it. 30 minutes later, no sour cream, no guacamole. Our food is finished, we are pretty upset. Now, as a manager, usually you walk around the restaurant to make sure tables are pleased, help run food, make drinks at the bar, help kitchen if food is backed up, etc. Was this the case? Absolutely not. To make this experience truly magical the manager was sitting by the front door on his phone the entire duration we were there. Didn&#39;t see him move since we walked in. I understand that some days are bad, but this is the second time I&#39;ve had an issue with slow service here. On a Friday night? You are going to be more than likely short staffed but even better not even help your staff out to make sure a large party had a decent experience? Unacceptable. I will never spend another dime at this place and I will make sure to tell everyone I know to eat somewhere else."

Had to get up to get our Ketchup. Second time was Sat down by bar area. Hostess screwed up and forgot a huge party was coming in. We were already sitting with our drinks. Had to move super mad. Lastly yesterday we went to celebrate my Hubbys bday. Lady gave my Son a corn dog asked for hot dog. My girls ordered fries and got rice. To top it off wonderful waitress NOT put our tab on two receipts. Called the management there. Clearly doesn&#39;t care says sorry every time and nothing changes.

My first time here, we came for a holiday party and apparently there were two other large (15+ people) parties. A few of our orders got messed up (ground beef instead of shredded beef on one, one order missing, two overcooked catfish, and some other things), but we just attributed it to the multiple large parties.

So my fiance and I came back a second time since her burrito had been good during the holiday party. This time, I ordered the paella since I did not want another overcooked catfish. On the menu and in every basic paella recipe that I know, it says yellow rice (rice+saffron). When the paella came, it was mexican rice (red rice/rice+tomatoes+spices) and it smelled like dishwater. I was starving though, so I tried it anyways and it tasted alright enough to stomach down a few bites to stave off my hunger. I normally take all my leftovers because I hate to waste food, but that was not food and I did not take it home. I hate confrontations and fear getting food back with spit in it or something like that, so I sadly almost never complain about my food... And to top it all off, it took 10 minutes from the time the waitress saw our empty glasses of water to when she brought us more water.

Poor service and poor cooking means I will not be returning here."

Can&#39;t even tell his employees if they are charging or not for the fight and we had to argue with him to take off the soup.HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.Let me add this all happen before the fight even started and in front of other customers.The management needs to be professional in handling situations like this and first KNOW HOW TO MANAGE.We paid our bill but will never return due to the Manager Ociel being so rude and front of our kids.

My wife and I went here to watch the early NFL games last weekend. There are enough TVs so that everybody gets to watch their game on at least one, and the staff was very considerate of everybody&#39;s desired game. It is a Midwestern place (duh), so the sound was on the Vikings game. The crowd there to watch that game gave the place a good vibe.

The beer list was good. Nothing amazing and not overpriced. Just a good list of Colorado beers to choose from.

Food was delicious. I got the beef and cheddar sandwich. The roast beef tasted great and was sliced just thin enough. My wife got the juicy lucy burger. I didn&#39;t taste it, but she mirrored many of the other reviews about it on yelp. We split the cheese curds, which can come with buffalo sauce, and we can&#39;t say enough good things about those.

If you&#39;re looking for a vegetable, you&#39;ve come to the wrong place. I had cheese curds, fried pickles, pretzel with cheese and mac and cheese for dinner and it was glorious. I saw brussel sprouts but they were breaded and fried so that&#39;s about the extent of veggies besides a few salad. Their ranch is a little spiced/seasoned and it was so good, I would order that just on it&#39;s own!

For example I got a Not Your Fathers Rootbeer for $7 and a six pack is $12. They made some good money off me on that one. As far as the food, that is really the downfall of this place. The cheese curds were good but that was the only thing I really liked. My party ended up getting some burgers, pork loin and a hot dog. No one left feeling impressed with the food.

+ Excellent, friendly, knowledgeable service.
+ Tasty beers including a chile beer.
- The Chicago Italian Beef is meh. There is not enough meat. The meat is sliced too thickly. The giardiniera had all the correct ingredients except for one: flavor. It was tasteless. Boring beyond belief.

12MAR2016

++ Pork sandwich! Delicious. Huge. Everything expected and desired. Lots of jalapeños.
+ Tater Tots. Yes, they are frozen Sysco from the big bag, but they were cooked properly and were tasty.
+ German burger. Over the top in flavors.

+ Excellent service from our waitress.
+ Window wall for all those clement Denver days.
+ Cloth napkins. White cotton.
+ Hefty flatware.
+ Overall ambiance. Subtle changes make it so much warmer than its predecessors.
+ Wi-Fi.

-  Fries were soggy. Homemade, but not fried correctly. Some work needed here.
- Beer prices are a tad high.

Great burgers - my Juicy Lucy was very large, perfectly cooked, gooey and even had popcorn on top - I know that this sounds weird, but trust me, it&#39;s good. Other &#34;midwestern&#34; comfort food dishes include the Iowa Pork Tenderloin (massive), Minnesota Walleye and Candied BLT sandwiches. The tater-tots are nothing special but they do come hot from the fryer. Next time I&#39;m going for the fries. Don&#39;t even think about not starting without the cheese curds, which come with two different dipping sauces. Again, just trust me here.

Dan and Andrea obviously take their responsibilities as owners seriously. Dan came to our table to chat and make recommendations - this is clearly a labor of love.

The restaurant itself has (thankfully) been cleaned up (since it&#39;s predecessor, Tennyson BBQ). It&#39;s now clean, shiny and welcoming.

Beer list is good although prices are a bit high. Food prices however are very reasonable - hopefully they will stay that way.

I probably don&#39;t need to mention that this is not a good place to go if you&#39;re on Weight Watchers - BUT, if you are on WW, just save up all your extra food points and use them all at Midwestern Saloon - it will be worth it...again, trust me."

I have never received any lash back because I&#39;ve also always posted specifics. 
My last post must of hurt a nerv of someone associated with the saloon. 

Here&#39;s what they sent me:
One: don&#39;t eat shit that is listed on the menu as fried. Two: do not ever sit at a bar and order soda, you douche bag, those seats are reserved for &#34;real&#34; paying customers. Three: read up on nitrous taps... They foam... Four: stop using &#34;really???...&#34; Or no one will ever take you seriously. Five: stop calling yourself a chef. We don&#39;t review shit on Yelp, we only look out for our friends. 

My suggestions to those that read these posts is be careful because they might act like an unprofessional cry baby.  

Instead of working on their shortcomings they will call you names and try to insult you. 
1: I admitted I didn&#39;t notice the sprouts were fried.  STAFF IS NOT TRAINED TO FULLY ASSIST CUSTOMER.  
2:Bartender didn&#39;t know how to make a &#34;Brooklyn&#34; and I had a tequila also. Shaken, poorer neat without lemon or lime because it was top shelf. STAFF IS NOT TRAINED TO FULLY ASSIST CUSTOMER.  
3: No customer wants to pay for 8oz of foam in a pint glass. 
4:  Really!  JUST FOR YOU
5: I am a chef and probably forgot more than you will ever know. MY STAFF IS TRAINED PROPERLY AND AWARD WINNING. RATED IN THE TOP 1.4% OF CALIFORNIA KITCHENS. 

FINALLY:  YELP IS ALL ABOUT REVIEWING. 

TAG TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE. You&#39;re welcome.  Next time I&#39;ll put it on Facebook also. Life with it and fix it. I&#39;m not the only bad review on Yelp for your place.

Classy, subtle and modern, while reminding you they are the real thing with a &#34;DeKalb&#34; Genetics sign hidden in the back. They did a great job capturing the spirit, and several flavors of the Midwest, while keeping on eye on modern ingredients, health, flavor, freshness and variety. I don&#39;t go for a set item like a Chicago dog, I go for the overall experience. If you visit for a set menu item, just remember that &#34;dog&#34; places and &#34;beef&#34; places only focus on that, just like your favorite burrito cart or green chili dive hole in the wall in Denver. This is about being Midwestern throughout. 

The BEST part.....the &#34;attitude&#34;. The remind us all to be who we were raised to be, and not the vanilla transient Denver-ite. 

Thanks Midwestern!! Great neighbors, even better hosts!"

Have already had three disappointing experiences and we just can&#39;t go back... We live right around the corner, and eat out a lot with our kids.  I was really hoping to have another standby on Tennyson (one can only eat at Hops and Pie so much) but this isn&#39;t it.

Between my husband and me, we&#39;ve had the burgers, brat, steak sandwich and one other entree... all passable but completely meh, especially for the money.  Beer cheese soup was the tiniest bowl of soup I&#39;ve ever seen. Tater tots... yep, they are certainly tater tots.. that&#39;s about all you can say about them.   Brussel sprouts are battered and fried, which may sound yummy, but the batter has no flavor... more like dried paste.   They were out of curds when we went the first time, and out of something else the second time (I can&#39;t remember what).

The beer is expensive, the service is inattentive and unfriendly, and the same barflies from the last 2-3 proprieters are still sitting at the bar, making the nice big booths in the bar unwelcoming to families Then they go out smoke by the front door, making the tables by the front garage window uninhabitable. (and we&#39;re no prudes).. 

They&#39;ll need to step it up big time or they will die a slow death like everything else in that spot before them. (hopefully not toooo slow... so we can get a better option in there FAST!). But I&#39;ll let everyone else experiment there, because we&#39;re done."

When we placed our order, the server said we&#39;d be charged a&#34; couple dollars&#34; for the salad substitutions (not $5), and she never mentioned a charge for the side salad. Not exactly up front with charges, that in my opinion were a little over the top. (My Cobb salad was definitely not worth $17.)"

We ordered the Nortena which was filled with seared and smokey carne asada and topped with &#34;the works&#34; or slices of avocado, lettuce, cheese, onions and tomatoes. The Torta Loca came with grilled pork and sliced hot dogs! Both were very good and super filling.

I&#39;ve passed by Las Tortas for about four years and have had it bookmarked for almost that long. I&#39;ve driven by and thought &#34;One of these days I&#39;m gonna pop in&#34; but it never happened until yesterday. My friend and I wanted to grab a quick bite and she is pretty adventurous and trusting of my recommendations so we stopped by for lunch. It was noon and only one table was open so that was a positive sign that we chose right.

You walk up to the counter, order then they call out your number. Even though I grew up in South Florida and took four years of spanish, I&#39;m still not too confident of my spanish tongue so I tried to stick with a sandwich name that I could say without sounding like too much of a gringa, Lorena Herrera, you&#39;re easy to say so why not?

Lorena kicks ass, thats it. 

The torta was absolutely delicious, packed with meat, cheese, tomato, avocado and onion. I added a little hot sauce and pickled jalapeños and those took it to a whole other level.

I ate the whole thing, loved it and kinda wanted seconds. I almost went back for seconds......but the line was six people deep and now I know why, Las Tortas is the bomb! Do yourself a favor and come to Las Tortas....and grab a donut next-door afterwards!"

We walked in on a Saturday night. The place was full. But not packed. We were confused about what to order so we pulled out yelp again and started reading the reviews. Everybody said get the La Macha. I mean, every single person. So we did. OMG! Thee BEST sandwich I&#39;ve had. I was ripped it reluctant when ordering after I read the description and saw that it had hotdogs. Who would put hotdogs on a sandwich? But I ordered it anyway and oh boy, am I glad that I did. I want to fly back to Denver just to eat that sandwich. 

The sandwich is huge. There is no way one person should eat the whole thing by themselves. Me and my boyfriend split a half and ordered a side of fries. They gave me more fries then any restaurant has ever given me. It was literally a whole basket full of fries. I mean the whole plate! Our food cost may be $15 total. But it definitely tasted as if it cost more than that. The sandwich alone tasted at least like $12 worth of sandwich. It&#39;s humongous! And oh so delicious.

For drinks I really like the horchata (cinnamon rice milk) or fresh squeezed carrot orange juice. They do have other Mexican sodas and fountain drinks as well.

So what exactly is a Torta? It is a Mexican sandwich served on a warm toasted roll. My friend and I got a Torta de Jalisco that had Steak and Chicken with Mayo, Avocado, and Tomato. Now you&#39;re thinking.. What a basic sandwich but OH MY GOD. Talk about a mouthgasm!!!!!! The portion was huge enough for us to share one. I got full from eating just half of the Torta. 

Thinking we could eat more, we actually ordered two Tortas. The next one was called the Las Macha had Pork Carnitas, Chicken, Chorizo, Hot Dog, Fried Egg, Onion, Avocado and Tomato. Lord Jesus this one was also a winner!! 

I gave it 5 stars because these sandwiches were simple yet amazingly good."

So wanted to share some wisdom with you all, now that I have been here a few more times. There are only tortas at Las Tortas. Go figure! Everything on the menu is different variations of tortas, Mexican-style sandwiches. This may seem obvious, as in the name. But I was confused and took it upon myself to ask the employee if there were any other items on the menu, in which he replied &#34;no, only tortas.&#34; Haha! So to save you the embarrassment, do not ask such silly things.

So, a whole menu of tortas! How fantastic! Super juicy meats! But greasy, so if you are going to eat here, plan accordingly. Not a good day to wear skinny jeans or have any productivity after your meal. Food coma begins shortly after eating your first half of the sandwich (they cut them in half). So you either scarf down the second half quickly before falling into a deep slumber or you wrap it up and save it for tomorrow (which is probably the best bet, but too delicious to do)."

So after a long wait at the Consulado de Mexico I searched nearby places and this place popped up.  My mom was a little hesitant, but I was like &#34;Mom they have really good yelp reviews&#34; So we made our way across the street! 

When I came in I asked what the MOST POPULAR TORTA was and they guy told me the NORTENA which has Steak, Milanesa, and Mexican Cheese ...so we proceeded to ordering one each ($8.32) and aguas de horchata ($2.50). So I was expecting plain jane tortas, but what I got was santa maria purisima tortas...I mean this ish was good, even my mom (who always cooks Mexican food) was impressed! And their horchata was also delicious, not watery, but just savory.

Other Pluses:
-Guys working here were supper nice and helpful. 
-The bathroom was nice and well kept.  
-TV screens
-Good music
-Nice decor

The atmosphere is good.  It gets a little smoky at times since they have the panini presses outside of the ventilation system.  But the overall restaurant is clean.  Just be prepared to leave smelling like a bakery after your lunch.

I gotta say, i had the Notena the first time I went about a month ago and was blown away by the quality and the taste.  Crispy bread on the outside, with a warm, tender and delicious inside.  I was blown away that a sandwich could taste so good.

I had it about a week ago and it was just blehhh.  The bread was merely lightly toasted on the panini press, tomato and avocado seemed a bit old, and the meat wasn&#39;t as tender as last time.

The traditional is straight-up delicious: carnitas, refried beans, and pickled onions on a hearty French roll and drenched in sauce. The second sauce on the side will make you burn, but that&#39;s part of the experience, right? Make sure you get a large horchata or jamaica to cool you off.

The gema is mild but good in its own way. I likened the sauce to a Mexican equivalent of vodka sauce: tomato, cream and a lot of flavor.

Las Tortas has truly perfected... you guessed it... tortas. Tortas are basically Mexican sandwiches, and the Las Tortas variety can only be explained as the greatest panini you will ever eat. 

These Las Tortas&#39; sandwiches come in a variety of meats, perfectly pressed and topped with cheese, onions, lettuce, avocado, a hint of beans, and an incredible chipotle sauce. A jalapeño is included on the side for those looking for a kick. 

The bread has beautiful markings from the press, which adds just the slightest perfect crunch before you get to the pillow soft, airy white bread inside. The meat is juicy and each bite sends the mixture of toppings running over the meat for yet even more tenderness and flavor. Im telling you, these things really are perfection. 

I go with the Norteña, but I&#39;m pretty sure you could throw darts at a board here and be fine. 

In conclusion, go to Las Tortas, have one of the best sandwiches you&#39;ve ever tasted, and join the club who can&#39;t stop thinking about these."

Ambience: paintings adorn the walls, and there are 5 flatscreens playing Exitos Tres (latin music videos).  My girlfriend wanted to make sure that I added that it is really cold inside - they must have the A/C cranked high.

Food: we decided to split a Pechuga y Asada and a chocolate flan, since the the sandwiches are so big and we each do not need two dessert&#39;s-worth of calories.  Total cost: $11.50.  The sandwich tasted delicious and it filled us both up.

Prior this visit, I made a phone call to Las Tortas saying that I am bringing a Party of 10.  Sunday November 17th 2013 brought like 9 other friends for our Meetup group.  Thankfully we managed to get some seats before the Lunch crowd came in.  Managed to be there before 12 noon.  The lovely staffs rearranged the chairs and tables for our group.

Yes, you order from the Counter.  Yes, this establishment which I refer as a Mom &amp; Pop shop is PORK Central.  So I choose to opt for the A La Carte.  For 3 items you pay $7.99.  From the list of items to be added if I could recall correctly were, Mayonaise, Cheese, Tomatoes, Onions, Avocado, Chipotle and Beans.

As for me I opt to have Mayonnaise, Cheese, Tomatoes, Onions and Chipotle.  Don&#39;t fancy Avocado and Beans as much, so I ask the staff not to put those on my order of Tortas.

So after waiting for like about 5 minutes or so, the staff told me they ran out of Beef Barbacoa.  What at NOON, you already ran out of Beef Barbacoa???  *Sad Face*  Man.... *SIGH*

So since I already order and paid for 3 items, I ask for more Asada since the barbacoa was no longer available and Grilled Chicken and Fountain Soda ($2.31).  The Grilled Chicken was a little dry, hence my Tortas order was slightly disappointing.  Sorry Las Tortas, though you used to shine in my books, but this time around, it tends to be slightly gloomy in my sunshine books.  I am a little confused, maybe my order does not comes with Drinks.  Maybe I order comes with Drinks..  Hmmm..

All in all it was A-Okay.  I missed the Beef Barbacoa though.  *Another Sad Face*  Some of my friends said the establishment is A-OKAY, some of my friends like what they ordered.  It was a success gathering, though I cannot deny I have to leave early from our group.  I was a little bumped to introduce Las Tortas to my friends, coz my friends who live in Loveland or even the one who live in Golden, went all their way to Las Tortas but Las Tortas expectation did not shine through..  *ANOTHER BIG SIGH*

Do take note, when you order at the Counter OR before you leave the establishment, in case you want the list of items or the MENU, you can find it in both English and Spanish languages, that little YELLOW booklet for your references.

Our first visit was awesome, ordered to go and food was lights out wonderful.   I went back again a few days later and ordered to go - however this time it was not as good.

I would caution that consistency is needed, but it&#39;s worth trying."

I gave him the honor of choosing our lunch destination and Las Tortas was his choice, a place that&#39;s been on my list for while and is also being mentioned on the talk threads.  I was down, just call me the Sandwich Queen.

A friend of mine told me that Mexican Tortas in CO are very hard to find.  We can stop holding our breath because I&#39;m pretty sure I found one.  I&#39;ve never been to Mexico but looking forward to crossing it off my list one day soon but I imagine the Torta is similar to the one I ate from Las Tortas.

Here are all the ingredients in no particular order:

Bread - Mexican Bread 
Mayo
Beans
Tomato
Onion
Fresh Avocado
Cheese
Chipotle sauce
Meat or meats of choice
All grilled Panini style and served with a side of pickled jalapenos

I opted for the one with grilled chicken and pork and the BF ordered the pork and milanesa (breaded steak).  These sandwiches are the size of my head and definitely more than I can eat in one sitting without having a heart attack.  The BF thought I was joking when I was showing him the pictures on Yelp so he wanted to order two - I was right, when will he learn that I&#39;m always right (LOL).  

Both sandwiches were out of this word delicious and scrumptious.  The bread is perfect and you must order your sandwich with all the fillings or your not getting the full experience.  I would order some more jalapenos on the side, I like some spice in my life.

The place is cute and in an unassuming strip mall.  Counter service here is very friendly and willing to work with you especially if you say it&#39;s your first time.  I love that I can watch the experts cooking and assembling my sandwich behind the counter.  Torta making is an art form.  

Come on by and get a Torta to share, and wash it down with a Mexican soda and then if you have the energy go for a walk so you don&#39;t grow a torta tree in your stomach."

My dining partners, however, did. Due to some bad carnitas earlier this month at work, I ordered carne asada and pollo. I also omitted the beans, cheese, and mayonnaise--dummy move. The choice of meats and omissions made my torta a little dry. The meat was flavorful, and the bread was toasted perfectly.

Unassuming location in the corner of a small strip mall. Friendly service. Nice art. Inside seating, but not very big. If I return to the area, definitely going all in with meat and additions."

I haven&#39;t really tried a lot of authentic Mexican food before so I can&#39;t speak to that, but in terms of yumminess this is incredible. 

I got the norteña, which they recommended. Bread was perfect combo of toasted and soft in the inside, it came loaded with lots of meat and veggies and was packed with flavor. 

Boyfriend got the cubana and it was packed to the brim. I think I liked his a little better just because it came with so much meat (haha). 

We both also got the horchata drink, which I was really looking forward to, but it was a little watery. That was the only somewhat disappointing part.

Will definitely come back often."

I love Las Tortas! I first came here with Tyler and then again with Dale Z. and had an amazing meal both times. My particular favorite is a wet sandwich called the Ahogada Tradicional. It&#39;s large, so be prepared to dig in or ask for a box. I love the tangy sauce they pour over it and the marinated onions on top. YUM! 

Now, I don&#39;t ever buy chips myself, but I have been known to steal them from my fellow dining companions. I have tried three different non-english labeled varieties and all were unbelievably tasty. It was a total mouth fiesta!

That&#39;s really a shame but probably best they&#39;re not too close to me or I&#39;d be there more often than I should be.  There is nothing that could be considered &#34;healthy&#34; or &#34;low cal&#34; about the food here.  I figure 1 per week = 10 lbs. per year.  But, tortas are a staple among the Mexican working class folk and they work hard so a good, filling torta keeps them going all day.  Today was a bit of a splurge but I savored every morsel spread over two meals.

My favorite is still La Norteña - steak, milanesa, and Mexican cheese PLUS all of their regular garnishes of refried beans, mayo, tomatoes, grilled onion, avocados, melted jack and chipotle sauce served warm grilled panini style - $7.49 (price hasn&#39;t changed like every place else in town).  Get a side of the pickled jalapeños (free) to spice things up although the chipotle sauce packs a decent punch already.  Delish but there are many other house &#34;specialty&#34; tortas or build your own.  I recommend letting them build your torta though because they clearly understand which ingredients play well with others.

Place is simple, staff is friendly, there&#39;s decent parking, easy to find on Leetsdale, why aren&#39;t you there?"

Soup was very good but needed a breadstick or chips or crackers as it was more like a salsa.  Scallops were good and not chewy. Beet risotto was interesting color but had good taste. Dish was delivered with Parmesan cheese sprinkled heavily on top despite it not being on the menu. Ruined the meal. When asked the server replied we put that on for flavor.  Well...if you need that on there to give the dish flavor you have a pretty bad plate. 

Will not be back. Very disappointing meal."

The place is small so arrive early or make sure you have reservations.  The atmosphere is great, low lighting, fireplace, good selection of table varieties.  They even have a great selection of wines and beer in their small side store.

You can&#39;t go wrong with their wine flights, they have a huge selection of pairings.  They also have cheese flights that are very nice however crackers cost extra, which is a little odd.  Food selections aren&#39;t huge but what they do have they do it great.  Haven&#39;t had a bad meal here yet.  My favorite is the seafood cioppino which has a great variety of calamari, mussels, shrimp and fish.  

Entrée orders can be a little slow to come out so order early and enjoy an appetizer.

We made reservations and were sat quickly. It was a Wednesday night and we had a nice table by the fireplace with very comfortable chairs that felt like couches. The ambiance is nice. We ordered wine flights and those were delicious. I liked the large selection of wine.

There seemed to be one waiter and one hostess, but it wasn&#39;t understaffed because there were only three tables sat and maybe four people at the bar. After we ordered our food, it took 35 minutes before our food made it to the table. A family walked in after us and they got their meals and were already done paying their bill while we were still waiting for our food. 

The salad was fresh and delicious. The menu is restricted to maybe 20 dishes and they&#39;re all very pricey. We ordered the seared scallops (those were good) and some clam and mussel appetizer. It was too spicy for what was advertised but still delicious. We couldn&#39;t open 6 mussels so that was a waste of money. 

Our server was very absent and we had to keep flagging him down for attention. Again, there were THREE tables sat and the rest of the restaurant was empty and we still had to flag him down. The staff members were socializing and one of the staff members was wearing a backwards black baseball hat. VERY unprofessional for a fine dining restaurant, ESPECIALLY if you work there. 

I liked that the dishes were healthy and delicious. But for the price, the mediocre service, and the wait time, your money and special event is better spent elsewhere."

After we received our drinks, we had to flag him down to give him our food order. The (minimal) cheese plate and salads were brought out after a long wait. We asked the ?manager to check on our entrees and watched him walk half way to the kitchen and come back to our table and tell us &#34;It will be a few more minutes&#34;. Meanwhile, we watched as people all around us, who had arrived after we did, were served their entrees. At 7:30, when we still did not have our food, we asked for our bill and to forget about the entrees. The bill (for $70+) was delivered and as we were leaving, half of our entrees came out.

Classy, warm ambiance. We started off with the Calamari, which was pretty darn good. One of the best. Something different was that it was included with fried green beans and fried jalapeños. Very heavy on the stomach, so if u are planning on having an entree, I definitely would not recommend it, its a meal In itself! I had the fettucine carbarna. It was pretty darn good! A little salty but delicious. My significant other had the steak frites, which was pretty tender, and good meat! Fries kinda sucked, but the fry sauce served with them made them ok. Lol. 
Unfortunately, the desserts were not tasty at all. The cheesecake / brownie was not fresh. The apple/cherry pie of some sort was pretty disgusting as well.

Upon arriving, we decided to eat dinner instead and the hostess seated us. I asked about the wine specials in the shop and was told they would send the owner over. He never came. Not even sure they told him. Wondered into wine shop and noticed bottles were marked with different colored stickers. Asked about it and once again was told they would send owner over as they had no idea what it meant. Owner never came. We did see him frequenting other tables, chatting with customers but he never dropped by the table that was ready to drop some bucks on wine in the shop. Maybe even pick up a Brunello or two for our own consumption. 

Meal arrived. I ordered the steak frites. Waitress came by to ask us how our meal was. I told her my steak was somewhat cold and she said &#39;noted.&#39; What does that mean? 

Enjoyed the olive oil served with  the bread. Asked the waitress to find out what brand and asked if we could purchase it from them. Yes but was never told what brand. Asked again to not forget the name of the olive oil. By the end of the meal, we left with no wine and no name of the olive oil which I asked twice about and would have liked to buy. 

I have been in the service industry for many years. I would highly suggest better training  your waitstaff. Nice restaurant and would really like to support local business owners but 19.00 for a cold steak and no response to the questions we asked."

But you walk in first to a nicely laid out retail area of all the wines they have for sale and the prices aren&#39;t bad.

It was kind of slow for 3pm but I still made a reservation for two. We were greeted than the executive chef greeted us and seems like he comes out to greet most of the patrons as time permits.

The server was well knowledged in the wines and the cheese to go with it. 
I&#39;ve had wine and cheese plates and this was far better. The bread came out the oven piping hot though a little butter would of been good. 
I preferred the lighter wine, red is a little to heavy for my palate.
I checked out the menu prices aren&#39;t bad for a nice meal with that special someone.

The dessert menu rotates every 3-4 mos but they serve bread pudding so I was sold.
It must of been the best by far. Pictures don&#39;t do it justice. 
Bread pudding with dried cranberries with a bourbon reduction.

And even tried a hybrid cheese that tasted like a light bleu cheese that would make a great grilled cheese sandwich.

We recently got the groupon for the wine and cheese tasting so figured we&#39;d give them a chance. We thought about eating regular food here (they have burgers and such), but a bacon cheeseburger was $20 and it was a big no way. 

The service was excellent and they were really quiet on the night we went in. I wasn&#39;t too impressed by the tastings. We had 3 different types of wine and each one was little more than a swallow. If you add all 3 together it might have totalled one glass. And the cheese was 3 tiny one ounce servings with a half an apple and a handful of grapes.

It was also nice to be visited by the chef a few times during our visit.  

The atmosphere is a little more upscale/white table cloth place, as is the menu.   They do a very nice wine flight.  Grapes, fresh bread, crackers, apples and assorted cheeses, it was a meal in itself.   So what do you do after a great meal??   You have DESERT!!!

They had Demetris at Bread pudding.  I was more in the mood for cheesecake, but it was not on their menu at the moment.  So at the recommendation of Chef Jason I went with the Brownie Tower.  

Good Lord have MERCY!  Lovely Chocolate Brownies, alternated with Blondie&#39;s.  I was considerably happy with this decision.  Definitely a desert for sharing as it was 2 of each.  2 wound up coming home with me, which made for a great second day treat.  

I didn&#39;t really peruse the wine section much, just didn&#39;t seem to be much I was interested in at the moment.  We did see some neat things though.  Might be worth a stop back again. 

My only complaint.... I could not see the person sitting across the table from me. No I had not drank that much wine I could not see.   There is an enormous wall of windows I was facing.  At that time of the day it was just a little hard to see.  At night I am sure they are lovely!"

While semi inconsistent with quality, risotto was in the mushy side m lasts time, it is always on the better end of dining. The thing that brings it down is the huge price increase on the wines offered. Routinely the bottles are 3 times or more than you could buy them at a regular liquor store and more than twice as much as the store connected to the restaurant. Make the wines more reasonably priced and we would dine there far more often."

The restaurant was very busy as we were seated. We made our choices ordered a glass of wine. The cheese plate was 2 tiny cubes of cheese with a marmolade in the middle. Within seconds of finishing it the pork belly arrived. It was so dry and cold we thought it must have been cooked an hour before. Within 5 minutes the waitress said our main course was ready. We had barely started the appetizer so she said she&#39;d hold it. 50 minutes later still no main course even though we asked 3 times for it. The two tables next to us were sat at the same time and had already finished their entire meals. We wound up paying cash and leaving without receiving a main course."

The chef came out at the end of the meal and it was great to meet the man behind the food ;).

However, in looking over their menu it always seemed a bit more high class and big money than I ever really wanted to spend.  Not to mention I am just not a wine person, so the whole allure of a wine bar is lost on me.  

Still I kept seeing some of their special events that paired  food and wine (and sometimes beer) and I was intrigued.  So when a Groupon came up for a wine and cheese tasting we snapped it up as a perfect way to try out the café.  

We made reservations, but it was really quiet on the weeknight we went (probably didn&#39;t need them).  You enter through the wine store and walk towards the back to the café.  There are lots of tables, an open kitchen and a fireplace, along with big windows that let in the light.  It is a nice space.  Our sever was friendly, knowledgeable and didn&#39;t pressure us to get anything beyond our Groupon - which is always nice!  The wine and cheese pairing was pretty small.  I would say about 3  1 oz pieces of cheese, a half an apple sliced, a ramekin of melon jelly and a tiny bundle of grapes (+ they brought us bread, although other people showed crackers which would have been much nicer) + 3 3oz wine samples (a white and 2 reds).  For $19, it wasn&#39;t a bad little starter, but for the normal $40 price tag I would have been annoyed.  Honestly, the plate was light for one person to sample.  Plus the tiny table was hard to maneuver with the 6 glasses of wine, 2 glasses of water, bread plate, cheese plate and serving plates.  At any moment I felt like it was going to be spilled!  

At any rate, we considered eating dinner there, but honestly the prices were too high for us.  Entrees average $25 and up and everything has additional prices for proteins to be added.  So once you add everything up I would image a couple would spend at least $100 on dinner.  Fine for a once in a while place, but not just your average Tuesday night.  

It was a nice environment and good service, but all else was lost on me!  If you like wine, maybe it is the bomb!  If not, it might not be worth your time."

Pros
=====
 * Wine and cheese flights looked nice.
 * Creme brulee was decent.

Cons
=====
 * Raw batter in the deep fried tempura calamari
 * The mussels. Dead mussels (did not open during cooking) and mussels that had been cracked so they had a jagged edge (and half the shell was missing)
 * Chicken salad. Vinaigrette was tasty, but the chicken was overcooked and dry.
 * Cheesecake brownie seemed like it was bought from a store


Overall, this place charges high prices for below average food. The wine and cheese seemed decent enough, but there are much better places to get food at these prices. I will not be going back."

The food is very good, service is good, but the prices are just ridiculous for what you get. Probably the best bet is to sit at the bar and have a cheese flight with a bottle of wine.

It&#39;s great for date night without the kids.  Creative and sumptuous menu. Huge wine list, of course.  Yes, it costs more than the big chains, but it is good, and the chains are yucky.
You enter through the wine shop which is great to keep in ac or heat.  It&#39;s a small intimate place with a large fireplace and a lovely view of the parking lot. :) 
We&#39;ve had great service every time. Portions are generous; we&#39;re both stuffed every time we go. 
Only both to pick, due to CO law, can&#39;t bring your own wine and pay corkage. As a displaced Californian this was a big bummer."

This place offers great selections by the glass, but it&#39;s priced so high I&#39;m not sure the value is commiserate to the cost.
I ordered an $17 pasta and the portion was huge. It was good without being exceptional. 

Their costs have to cover a large, lovely space -which includes a wine shop connected to the restaurant. It&#39;s open, with views of the kitchen and a fireplace to sit by. 

The menu with prices is listed on their website under &#34;The Cafe&#34;, but not their wines by the glass with prices, which range upwards of $15 for a glass. They also offer wine flights. 

The point of going here to enjoy wine not accessible by the glass at other restaurants, but the mark-up is so high (compared to just buying the bottle at a store which I can look up on my smartphone) that I couldn&#39;t justify the cost-to-value ratio."

Overall, the food was decent. It&#39;s way overpriced for quality and presentation. We had the mussels, duck confit, and bruschetta. Each appetizer was $14-$18.

My husband worked in a Michelin star restaurant, is an introductory sommelier, and hand sells wine. Wine Experience is selling one of their glasses of wine for $15. You can buy the full bottle for $16 at Costco. In my opinion, the owner is ripping off his customers by charging that price. 

Our waiter was nice, but young. Again, paying these prices for food/beverage, I would expect more experience and professionalism from the staff. I was not happy when one of the employees was folding napkins behind my table while singing. Also, the kitchen was playing music which interfered with the ambiance of the restaurant. 

I will not be returning to this restaurant nor would I recommend it. Don&#39;t waste your money."

We wandered through the wine shop which seems have a good selection but when I asked how it was organized and where the French Reds were located,  the answer I got was &#34;well, it&#39;s kind of random...&#34;    And random it was.  Honestly, I don&#39;t want to have to wander around randomly to find something.

And on to the dinner.   The atmosphere in the dining area is very nice.  It&#39;s quiet, it&#39;s dim, there is a fireplace and wait staff was very attentive and friendly.

Remember the random feeling in the wine shop? ....I felt a sense of deja vu about the wine list as well.  The type was in all lowercase and laid out kind of randomly.

We were offered a print out of a prix fixe meal and told that it was $70/pp or we could just order a la carte -- however, the menu had no prices listed so unless I wanted to be socked with a huge bill at the end, I would have had to ask the waiter to tell us the price of each item and that just seemed tacky.  Instead, we ordered an overpriced $16.00 cheese &#34;flight&#34;, a decently priced bottle of wine and split a HUGE (and very inexpensive at $7.00) order of calamari along with two desserts.

Overall, we had a nice evening out.  Did I think it was worth the $$ we dropped there?  Probably not.  

Will we return?   Definitely...I have one more Groupon to use and I&#39;ll be curious to see if they have a regular menu."

We started out with a wine, had a superb appetizer (duck legs), had a cheese sampler, and finished with an entree.  Being that this place is fancy and I&#39;m not, I can&#39;t remember the name of the wine or all the cheeses we sampled.  I do know it was a Malbec wine, the cheese platter was called Italy, and my entree was the 6oz steak.

My biggest complaint would be the chair cushions are very stained. They desperately need to be changed.

We&#39;ve been coming to this hidden gem in Southlands since we moved to Colorado from California back in 2007--and the very first day we walked in we felt like we were back in California at one of many wine bistros that provide Chefs with a great opportunity to test their creativity and continuously improve their culinary skills. I think that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened with Chef Jason. For those who frequent this restaurant often (especially their wine dinners), you know that you can always count on great food, an amazing wine selection, and friendly service. Chef Jason has truly elevated the culinary sophistication in our side of town and to truly experience his creativity and skills you HAVE to attend one of the many wine dinners Elden (the owner) hosts where he prepares a special tasting menu that highlights both the quality of the wines but equally important his own culinary skills."

We have been there many times, and the service has always been above adequate.  There is one regular server that comes off a bit annoyed at those of us that aren&#39;t wine experts, but even he delivers great information and offers suggestions for pairing.  

The restaurant is a bit over-priced for what it is-  if the servers were as friendly as the owner, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d make that comment because the wine selection and food are great.  However, considering they are in a mall, I would expect the service to more friendly.  I suggest checking for a Groupon or Restaurant.com certificate to help offset the prices if you&#39;re like us and enjoy going to a &#34;grown-up&#34; restaurant but still have little ones draining the wallet.  

Overall, it is the coziest grown-up restaurant in SE Aurora, and it&#39;s not a chain- YAY!  I would recommend this restaurant for date night- the wine flights and olive oil trio are a must!  Just be sure to plan on dropping at least a buck fifty for the night."

Very poor service, bad food and not for vegetarians. Even my husband who eats meat did not care for the food.

We (me and my husband) ordered the 3 wine combination each.  The server brought all the 6 glasses, laid them all on the table (in no order what so ever) and left before he blabbered some names of the wines. The food was not only bad but way way overpriced.

Mr. Mixer took me there last night for my birthday.  We&#39;d been here a couple of times before.

The service is fantastic.  We&#39;ve never been disappointed.  Mr. Mixer had a special bottle of wine waiting for us and it was served perfectly.  The server was friendly and personable.

The food:  

The charcuterie plate was awesome.  Mr. Mixer loved the scallops.  And dessert, oh my goodness!  The white chocolate mousse was airy and delicious.  The homemade truffles- amazing!  

My filet mignon, although cooked perfectly, was served with a balsamic reduction that was too strong.  There was just too much of it there.

We got some wine in the store after dinner, and the recommendation were great.

All in all, I really like this place.  I think the cooking could use a bit of practice, but it&#39;s nothing that will keep me away. 

I want to come back and have just wine and cheese flights together!"

Since this is located in Southlands Mall we didn&#39;t expect much.
Ordered a pizza to share, Margarita with sausage and spinach WOW so yummy and perfect for 2, the crust was thin, light and delicate, real Italian slices of sausage, huge tomato slices and so much more spinach that I have ever had on a pizza it was delightful. Three glasses of really good wine between the 2 of us, and sorbet after dinner that was super.

The risotto I had there was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  I do believe they change the menu from time to time. 

If you want to step outside the box or perhaps impress a date, the Wine Experience would be the perfect place to take them.  Afterward you can stroll along the shopping center and maybe grab desert at the chocolatier, cookie shop, or the ice cream shop.  BUT I would also recommend the dessert there.  It is to die for!

It was very busy and the service was a bit slow. The owner stopped by our tables a few times checking in to see how our evening was. He told us that two of his wait staff called in sick last minute, hey it happens. Our wine glasses were never empty the entire evening.

I had the Bison and my wife had the Duck Breast. They were both outstanding. I highly reccomend the calamari appetizer, my wife and I were fighting over the last one.

For desert we got the chocolate mousse to go, we were both to full to eat it after dinner. The kids got a treat when we go home."

Before our food was set down we received VERY dirty roll-ups.... Covered in dust. 
There was also no music playing whatsoever and it threw off the ambiance. We asked for new silverware and were politely supplied with fresh ones. They were winning us back until when the bill came , we were charged tax and were charged for crackers. Ive never been charged an additional fee for crackers with a cheese plate! why would a cheese plate not already come with crackers?! We were also disappointed that no one suggested any pairings to us. at such a nice-looking place we were disappointed no one bothered to make suggestions when we had a wine and cheese flight. When we asked our server about it she blew us off. I&#39;d never come back and especially would never pay full price to dine here. So disappointing ...."

I have never had bad food or bad service, and the servers/bar staff are super knowledgeable. They change their menu seasonally, as any good restaurant should, and I have yet to be disappointed! The cheese and wine flights are simply amazing, and the owner has always made it a point to take an active role in the dining experience overall. 

Occasionally they have tasting events, and I would highly recommend them for anyone who would like to expand their palate. 
I gave this place 5/5 stars because there is absolutely nothing even remotely comparable nearby. I like that it&#39;s close to where I live, I like that the food and wine are fantastic, and I like the ambiance of the dining room. 

One thing that boggles my mind is that I have yet to see this place packed. Perhaps I&#39;m going at odd times, but on a Saturday night at peak time they were fairly empty. I believe this could be due in part to location. They are located on the back side of the building and unless you are specifically looking for them, it&#39;s very easy to miss. Pricing may be a bit higher than what a standard customer is willing to pay, however, it is well worth every penny!! This is a fine dining establishment, so don&#39;t walk in and expect to get served a dried out $7 cheeseburger and fries."

I thought it was cool to have the actual wines for sale too, so the concept is nice. But no you didn&#39;t walk into the wrong place when you thought you came to a wine/liquor store....keep going...almost there...ok you&#39;re in a lil restaurant:) 

My husband really enjoyed it and its surely a date worthy experience. 

My only issues:  Its pretty high priced once you add everything up...you really probably can&#39;t get out of there on a date under $150.  Assuming you each have a few tasters and a meal. I highly recommend sharing a meal because after all that cheese and amazing charcuterie plates you will be almost beyond full. 
I also really want to petition the chef to change the mashed potatoes...no one should ever really mash and whip red potatoes...too starchy and then end up with a slightly too sweet gooey texture...ya gotta go russet.  Steak awesome, dessert a bit tooooo sweet for my palate. Also just because the staff is knoweldgeable on wine doesn&#39;t mean they should camp out at your table all night chatting and over checking on your meal...Give us some smoochy talky alone without you time ok? :)  This place could really bump up regular business if it had some kindof great coursed meal at a decent price for people to go to more often than once in a while.

So far, it seems, this is the only upscale, review-worthy restaurant in Aurora for my husband and I who like to think of ourselves as foodies and wine connoisseurs!  We have been here about a handful of times and each time we leave, we always agree, you cannot have a bad meal here! 

After failing miserably with selecting wines from highly touted wine shops for our wedding, we went to see, the owner/sommelier, Eldon, letting him know off the bat he would likely be too expensive for us.  Just the contrary, he asked our budget and went to work on selecting the wines paired with our wedding menu.  They delivered all the alcohol to our property in the front range and were such a pleasure to work with.  Our guests were so pleased with the selections of wine - we heard many comments after the fact and have not stopped visiting the restaurant for date night or spreading the word about letting them price out the alcohol for your next event!!"

The first is they have a great selection of wines in their wine shop although more on the pricey side. It is a great place to get a specialty wine if you are looking though. The second and possibly more important reason this place is cool is the cafe. My husband and I came here one night after a light and early dinner to indulge in a wine flight and cheese board followed by dessert. The wine flight was outstanding and you wouldn&#39;t believe how much wine you really get. The cheeses were perfectly paired with our wine and also outstanding. Not your typical cheese plate! I have seen deals on living social or groupon for a wine flight and if you see one I would suggest snagging it. This place is not cheap but they know their stuff. Also if you happen to be into Grappa they have a nice selection and I have to say the service was outstanding.

We had reservations for our large party.  Food took forever, I&#39;m talking 90 minutes.  When our food did arrive my 36.00 filet wasn&#39;t even hot.  My husband&#39;s food was hot but as he began to eat it he realized that his chicken was RAW.  This is a serious safety issue, they could have easily sent one or more of our party to the hospital.

When I brought the issue up with the manager he told me that they were sorry and although they replaced our food they wouldn&#39;t comp our dinner.  We were offered a free dessert and a 25.00 gift card for future use.  $25.00 didn&#39;t even cover my dinner.  Our bill came to $85.00 for a flight of wine, one appetizer, and two entrees.   

I&#39;d use the gift card if I was able to use it in the store but sadly the gift card is only for the cafe.  We don&#39;t go out often and to spend this kind of money on food that isn&#39;t cooked correctly is disappointing to say the least.

I did not like how you have to enter the restaurant through the wine store. Is it that hard to put another door in?? The food is way overpriced for the portions you get.

Minutes from my house, beautiful decor in a comfortable space, a to die for sounding menu, and my favorite wines by the glass, with an attached retail wine shop,

So much potential.....Yet, they miss the mark by a mile. 

I&#39;m probably wasting my breath, as we were the ONLY paying customers the last 2 times ( yes, we keep giving them another chance). 
Like rats scurrying in the light; the owner and 2 Back of House employees run to the back upon our arrival, so obvious that they don&#39;t care about our opinion. 

If I owned a restaurant, I would personally greet the customer, acknowledging the fact that we&#39;re frequent diners, not just leave it to the College age server, but that&#39;s just me. 

To sum up: 
Bread is $6 if you want it 
Salads are so salty, they&#39;re inedible 
Dinners are way too salty and not properly executed.

My wine was $13 a glass --(4th time, I spent $26 for 2 6oz pours; they measure it in those tiny carafes)
The same wine sold by the bottle at their attached on-site &#34;store&#34; is $19, 
 
That&#39;s right....$19 a bottle retail, sitting in plain view, however when you order the bottle a few steps away it&#39;s $52

Total Tab = $100 plus tip 

MasterCard called, and said cut your losses, and give it up --- it&#39;s never getting any better --

Don&#39;t mind paying for good food, but this wasn&#39;t. The cheese was 1 oz or brie, 1 oz manchengo and 1 oz stilton, how much more boring can you get. The bread tasted like two day old King Soopers and was refrigerator cold. 

The service was deplorable and everything was overpriced. On the way out the door we noticed the loaf of bread being cut up and used, straight out of a plastic wrapper from the grocery store. You would think for the prices they could at least bake their own bread."

The last owners were great, so I really didn&#39;t think the new ones would be able to live up to the previous owners, I was wrong.

I honestly don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called, but they&#39;re delicious.

They have several varieties of Banh Mi, but I usually get the one with all the meats. If you buy 5 sandwiches, you get 1 free. The baguettes that they use for the sandwiches is what makes Baker&#39;s Palace stand out over other establishments.

Of course, I buy more than just sandwiches because they have your typical Vietnamese desserts and also boba drinks. Because I don&#39;t always go to Federal Blvd, I see visiting Baker&#39;s Palace as a treat and usually overindulge  (oh well ). 

The family who owns Baker&#39;s Palace are always super sweet and nice when taking and getting you your order. 

One thing is that the store is small and despite coming here for almost 2 decades, I still miss it when I drive north on Federal and usually have to make a u-turn to get back to it, but it&#39;s so worth it."

The sandwich wasn&#39;t as filled as another I like to frequently get. Very light on the fillings. I got a chicken sandwich- the chicken was dry, dry dry. Not flavorful and actually rather bland.

The bread is perfect:  Crusty yet yeasty goodness, with just enough give for a proper bite.  

The toppings:  Well.  I don&#39;t know.  Definitely some porkish stuffs in there.  There was a ham-type.  Definitely a roasted or boiled then sliced pork with a hint of 5-Spice seasoning.  There was a Pate-esque spread.  It all melded together with the lightly pickled vegetables:  Carrots, Radish, and Cucumbers.  Oh, yeah, and who could forget the jalapenos?

Yeah, this is a good sandwich.

The Vietnamese Waffle they brought along, also my de-virginizing experience, was pretty spiffy, too.  I&#39;d like to taste it warm, but the flavor and color (green!) were spot-on.

Bakers Palace (&#34;BP&#34;) also sells very tasty glutinous rice dishes and steamed buns. They offer one steamed bun in particular that is filled with a hard boiled quail egg and a delicious spicy sweet pork meatball.

If you are not feeling the sandwich you should consider the glutinous rice topped with chicken, Chinese sausage, and green onion. Add a little soy sauce and Siracha and you will have a delicious, filling, and inexpensive meal.

For something sweet, try the glutinous rice balls with coconut cream sauce.  Over two bites of chewy, not overly sweet, refreshing taste sensation.

Two sizable sandwiches, two steam buns, two Vietnamese summer rolls, one rice chicken and sausage, and one order of the coconut rice.  All under $20.00.

I&#39;ve learned that when you are in Italy, ask the locals.  In this case I was on Federal Blvd eating Vietnamese eating @ my favorite place in Denver, New Saigon, when I had the idea to ask our waiter where he liked to get &#34;Bánh mì&#34; which are Vietnamese sandwiches made on French Baguettes.  I had watched a recent episode of Anthony Bourdain&#39;s &#34;No Reservations&#34; where he revisits Vietnam and on that episode, he pigs out on Bánh mì.

So the waiter pointed me to a place only one block up, Bakers Palace.  Had it not been recommended, I would never had stopped.

Am I glad that I did.  They were out of the Pork Bánh mì so I got the #1, the combo which was basically ham and cold cuts type sliced meat.  Wow, it was delicious!  And only $2.75!

I must confess my loyalties to the place that busted my banh mi cherry over 15 years ago which is the Vinh Xuong bakery up the street but after consulting with a couple of my favorite Vietnamese foodie/waiter friends at our favorite pho joints, I knew I had to try Palace (as it was called by them).

Rating: 5.5 (out of 10)

The Skinny: For the uninitiated, Bahn Mi is a Vietnamese sandwich made with a small baguette.  There are usually a host of varieties available, and at Bakers Palace, I think there were about 10 options to choose from. When I make a &#34;best value&#34; list, these Vietnamese sandwiches will be on it.  At $2.75 per sandwich, you feel as though you&#39;re buying it in Saigon with American dollars.  The bread was great - crusty yet soft - I could hear the crackle when I squeezed the sandwich in my hands.  The filling (on the #9) was decent: Pork, cucumber, carrots, cilantro, onions, etc.  It all tasted fresh and crisp.  Nothing earth shattering I&#39;d say, but slightly above average.

One word of caution:  Choose wisely.  At that price, I tried 2 sandwiches: the #9, and the #1.  The #9 was pretty decent.  The #1...inedible.

Numerous times I&#39;ve tried it and it&#39;s still the same overly salty taste. I am a fan of salt, believe me, but this thing has a high cholesterol sign right above it. 

I also refrain from docking another star for it&#39;s location only because I fit the stereotype of horrible Asian Women drivers and it&#39;s location is very hard to get into when coming from the north. Getting out is also very messy as well.

Really cute decor inside. Really great patio seating. Wind chimes were going and a bunch of deer walked by as we were eating. 

This is great after hiking at Mount Falcon but it would also be great to pick up a picnic to take to Mount Falcon.

We also had strawberry cake which was a perfect ending to the meal. 

We will go back and we will also get takeout when my husband mountain bikes at Mount Falcon!"

Honestly, I wished it was just a bowl of pulled pork with the chili! The chili and pulled pork is that good! The mac and cheese portion? I think the hubby makes a better one from Annie&#39;s boxes at home. 

Also had a piece of strawberry shortcake. I think it was a little old...it still tastes fine but just a little dried up. They told me that it&#39;s from some bakery in Denver. This place is kind of a long place from Denver so many it&#39;s not a daily fresh baked type of situation. No biggie in my book cause the COFFEE IS DANG GOOD!

The drip coffee in this place is BOMB. I mean, it&#39;s like coffee but it&#39;s just really fragrant and mild while not being kick in your face Starbucks coffee. Just a really enjoyable cuppa. 

Next hike, a good chance we will return. Lots of places for us to explore but this is a contender for a return visit."

Especially if the man himself is manning the grill in front of the building. The unmistakeable smokey BBQ smell will stop you on your tracks. 

Very cute inside. The mix match of chairs and tables and just a bunch of cute clutters makes this place so adorable. 

What&#39;s unique for me is their take on their specialty. It&#39;s Mac n Cheese with tons of choices to go with it as it&#39;s toppings. Meaning it could either be a baby back ribs or sausages. 

I chose the St. Louis BBQ Pork and Ribs. Applewood smoked. About four ribs and sauce requested on the side later I was full. The mac n cheese filled me up but the BBQ was tasty. Almost everything is in the $10 range. They offer sandwiches as well and I spied a happy hour pricing somewhere on the board behind the counter. 

So far so good. Manned by a sweet couple. I want them to stay. I want them to flourish. So drop by and check this place out. Indian Hills is a sleepy community but this is definitely not a boring joint."

For almost a year I thought this place was a computer repair shop. It wasn&#39;t until I moved to the area and Yelped myself some food around me. Wait... Wait. Photos of sumptuous mac n chee? Nestled in Indian Hills??

Yep.

The place is super cozy. Somebody obviously knows how to make a small space feel delightfully welcoming and homey. And guess what? They have gluten free mac n cheese!! Their cheese sauce is GF, the green chile, which they make themselves is GF, and they have GF pasta. Put all three of those together, and you get a big bowl of GF green chile mac n cheese--or the Colorado, if you will. Dudes. Ladies. 

Get up the hill.

Get into this.

Oddly enough, this is probably the best place for a long way around to get coffee. Their drip was fascinatingly well-brewed. Seriously. Worlds better than Muddy Buck or EverBean. Mac Nation has it all. 

I will be back. I&#39;m super intrigued by Fish Fridays. I love fish, I love mac n chee, I love the mountains, and I love this place. Put it all together, why the hell not??

I obviously need to get their hours saved somewhere because every time I go lately they&#39;re closed (on Monday?), but that&#39;s my fault. I crave their green chili anytime I have it elsewhere.

The mac and cheese is sooo creamy inside, then baked with shredded cheddar and your choice of toppings. I got the Iowa(blue cheese and bacon). SOOO frickin good with generous portions. And it was only like 8 bucks! We also got a side of tots, but could barely finish our mac and cheese let alone the tots.

There are a few shaded tables outside so the wait for the food to be made fresh is quite nice when the weather is good. This little spot has a lot of personality.

Wow. Never had an experience like this. However, I think people should know about this restaurant and avoid it until they get a new cook.

At noon, we were the only people there (3 of us), with one employee, a delightful, proud Ethiopian woman who spoke very little English. She was unable to explain the menu, which had photos, and this became a problem when an extra order of lamb and a salad came with our meal that we didn&#39;t order. She was very confused. 

 Looking around, I realized that there was a lot of gum on the floor, no toilet paper in the bathroom, and greasy looking tables. Fingerprints were on the windows.

A half hour later, the food arrived. The lamb was black and crunchy, burnt to a crisp in balls that rolled around the injera, and the onions that came with it were so burnt they looked like dried worms. The food was inedible and when we explained that the lamb was way overcooked, she apologized that she hadn&#39;t asked how we liked it. 

However, she did give us wonderful coffee and when we asked for the bill, I presented a restaurant.com coupon for $15 off $30.

The woman said she didn&#39;t know what it was, that the owner hadn&#39;t explained this to her. She went out of the restaurant and brought back another Ethiopian woman who explained that there was new ownership, the woman was &#34;renting the kitchen&#34; and the new owners didn&#39;t take coupons. More confusion.

We again asked for the bill and she produced the total on a calculator. There was no itemized piece of paper. It was frustrating because she didn&#39;t understand. $46 later, we just wanted to get the heck out and forget this experience. 

As we were working out our share of the pay, the employee presented us with &#34;movie&#34; popcorn in an ethnic basket. All we could do was laugh. It was such a bizarre ending to a pretty bad meal."

The sambusa were super fresh and hot, as was my husband&#39;s lamb stew. I had the vegetarian special, which is served cold, and everything on it was great. Moderately spicy, but not too much for a semi-wuss like me. The service was a bit slow, despite our being the only patrons there, but very friendly - the waitress even picked up our 14 month old and carried him around the restaurant, showing him things. Very sweet! We also had several people come out from the kitchen to ask us how we liked everything. 

Don&#39;t expect fancy - we got paper plates and napkins - but the food totally makes up for it. 

Parking sucks, but it&#39;s not their fault - the plaza has too few parking spaces for the number of businesses, and Sushi Katsu patrons probably take up most of them. There&#39;s usually plenty of parking on the side streets.

It was quiet inside, but we were greeted by very friendly people. The menu consisted of several traditional beef and lamb dishes, and a platter of vegetable options. Judging from the picture it looked like a plated variety of spiced corn, peas, lentils, etc. we ordered that and a spicy chicken stew, thinking we would split each, and get to try both.  The &#34;plate&#34; of vegetables turned out to be a huge tray, heaped with delicious traditional spiced Ethiopian dishes, and a large basket of warm injera, to dip into all of that aromatic goodness. Wow. We ate until we couldn&#39;t eat any more, and still brought home about two more meals worth, each. I think one of my favorite parts of this place was the relaxed atmosphere, I felt like we could have sat there for ever, taking our time, and there were others doing the same. When we were about halfway through our meal, the woman behind the magic came out, and asked how we enjoyed it. When we proclaimed her food to be amazing, her face lit up, and she thanked us, and I suddenly understood why the food is so good, because of the love and pride that goes into each dish. She then offered us coffee, which we gladly accepted, and I am glad we did, because &#34;coffee&#34; turned out to be extremely fresh Ethiopian beans, which she roasted, personally, on the spot, and even brought the little roasting tray out, and around to the tables, allowing the smoke from the roasting beans to waft up among us, adding even more magic to the already delicious smells. She brewed this amazing concoction and then brought it out and served it, in a beautiful little kettle that she told us her family has brought with them from Ethiopia. She stayed for a minute and chatted, while making sure we were enjoying her amazing coffee, and then headed back to the kitchen, leaving us to finish at our leisure. The overall physical restaurant looks like any other family restaurant/bar, it looks like they have a great bar set up, and I spotted some Johnny blue label on the shelf, but what makes it special is the authenticity, and the love that goes into each dish. I have no doubt that this place will be &#34;discovered&#34; by Denver&#39;s hipster culture, and I usually dread that day, but this restaurant deserves all the business that can swagger in in skinny jeans, and I hope they get it.

&#34;Great place to dance while you are waiting for your food .&#34;

Food/Drink: the food was ok. I had a chicken stew with Injela and my other half had the vegetarian platter. The chicken was quite spicy but the vegetables were somewhat bland. They have a full service bar here along with Ethiopian beer that you can order. Portions not as large as some other places but I have been. Injela was a LITTLE on the sour side. But Overall ok.

Service: waitress was quiet for the most part and I can forgive a language barrier ( especially if I am going to an ethnic restaurant for ethnic food) the manager there was are really nice guy and continued to check on us to make sure we were okay. They even turned up the music for us to dance on the dancefloor while waiting for our food.

Atmosphere: pretty ethnic small and quaint place. Only thing is you notice a big hole on the ceiling what it looks like the Air conditioner or some metal piece sticking out which looks like its going to drop on the floor.

Price: ok. We paid about $21 for two entree dishes.

Parking: Parking can be hard to find especially with the fact that Sushi Katsu is in the same building and the line is out the door.

MY THOUGHTS? 
I think that the service from the manager was great.  I may give this place another chance being that I&#39;ve only been here once.

I just can&#39;t handle it on a frequent basis because I feel full for two days afterwards. But we decided to try out Addis Ababa, which is conveniently located for me.

The restaurant was on the empty side, but the service was slow, but really good. We asked for some recommendations, and got a pastry appetizer ($1 for each flaky crispy meaty goodness?!) each and shared two meals between the three of us (and had way too much leftover). We got one of the combination dishes which gave us 2 meats and a lot of veggies, and one of the Tibs which was so deliciously and perfectly flavored."

Alright, I didn&#39;t like the food.  At all.  But I promise, I am only basing this one star review on the service, since I don&#39;t have any other Ethiopian food to compare it to.

We arrived about 10pm on a Friday night and were seated.  There was about 10 of us in the group and I relied solely on their recommendations when it came to ordering.

We didn&#39;t get our food until 11:30pm.  An hour and a half we waited for the food.  And the place really wasn&#39;t busy at all at this time of night.  There was only another table of four in the restaurant aside from us.

I don&#39;t intend to go back at this point, I think I am more inclined to try another Ethiopian restaurant and give the food another shot, because I can&#39;t see myself waiting an hour and a half for food anywhere ever again."

The delightful and charming staff fully intend to &#34;wow&#34; you with a number of seldom-seen (in Denver, anyway) dishes.

The Suff Fitfit takes firm. juicy chopped tomatoes and spicy pepper chunks and mixes them with bits of springy Injera bread, then douses the whole thing in a hearty sauce made from ground sunflower seeds. A healthy salad comes alongside with more of those tomatoes and peppers as well as red onions and lettuce.

The Qurt, by contrast, takes the usually-served-raw beef dish called Kitfo and brings it to a whole new level by using even-yummier prime cuts. Served with the incendiary spice mixture called Awaze, this one is sure to stick in your subconscious - but remember to give the restaurant advance notice!

And if you really can&#39;t decide - why not mull over the Mahberawy? This combination treats you to huge portions of two meat dishes and even more vegetable ones. Believe me, you will not be hungry after this.

There is also quite an extensive breakfast menu (please note that the eatery opens at 11 am), with offerings ranging from the porridge called Bula Genfo, made with enset (false banana plant) starch, to the Oromo specialty Chechebsa, tossing chunks of Kita (toothsome wheat bread) with clarified butter and zesty Berbere seasoning.

Truly, a gastronomic odyssey awaits you at Addis Ababa."

We went for a group lunch, about 12 people, at 1pm.

There&#39;s 2 other groups in the restaurant, I&#39;m not sure if they were in before the group got there or not, since I got there a few minutes late.

My friend and I sat down just as the waitress was taking orders from the rest of the group. I quickly find something that sounds yummy to me, and help him (not an adventurous eater) pick something that won&#39;t freak him out. The label on his item indicates it&#39;s a beef dish, prepared anywhere from Raw to well done.

He tells the waitress the number on the menu, and points, she asks (I think. Sadly English wasn&#39;t her second or third language) what meat, and he and I point out that it says beef. A few exchanges that I&#39;m certain neither party actually understood take place, and then he points out he wants it well done... She doesn&#39;t get it. Finally &#34;Extra cook&#34; seems to register.

An hour and twenty minutes pass before our meal arrives. Yeah over an hour. We suspect maybe they ordered the food from another Ethiopian place, and had it delivered. During that time we had to ask her to refill our water as all of us were bone dry and just sitting there talking around empty glasses.

The food itself was pretty good. Mine was far oily-er than I&#39;ve ever experienced at an Ethiopian place before. To the point where I would strain it as best I could with the spoon before putting it on my Enjira, and oil still seeped out almost immediately, soaking my fingers. Kinda gross.

Oh and she was supposed to split the bill for my friend and I. She misplaced my credit card, and charged both our meals to his, then I had to have her look for my card, lost somewhere in the 15 feet between our table and the register.

Taste wise, I enjoyed my meal. My digestive system on the other hand, not as thrilled.

I won&#39;t be going back after that type of experience. I&#39;m usually pretty forgiving, trying at least twice before deciding I hate a place, but that kind of service, when not during a rush... absolutely unacceptable.

Thank goodness there was a Carl&#39;s Jr. Across the street."

They also have a small menu which my brother and SIL decided to order off of. I didn&#39;t try the food but they didn&#39;t complain. In addition,  there&#39;s a cool outdoor patio.  The staff was friendly. The regulars mostly kept to themselves but would chat if you initiated the conversation.

The pho is a generous portion. The regular size, I would consider a large, while the large was almost too big to finish. The bun bo hue was flavorful, but we did not have room to pack it in. The only thing that was slightly different was that their spring roll came with seasoned beef, not sure if I was a fan.

The 1 @ Pho 888 has grilled shrimp which was the drawback to this combo plate.

Despite this, the dish was super enjoyable &amp; was more than enough to keep me full for most of the day. I couldn&#39;t finish my portion &amp; had to take some home. I also tried their green tea sinh to (smoothie) with pearls. The pearls didn&#39;t have a great texture to them but the smoothie was great.

Perhaps we did ordered the wrong items from their Menu.  Last week we went here and had an enjoyable feast of Pho!  But this recent visit with TO GO Orders, things are not as stellar as I was hoping for.

We ordered the following items :

*  #11.  Pho Do Bien (LARGE) ($9.50)
*  15F.  Sesame Chicken ($8.95)

Just a reminder, each TO GO ORDER, there is an additional cost of ($0.35), hence our TO GO orders is ($0.70)

When we reached home, and open what we had order, all are OK.

For one, as for the Sesame Chicken, err.. aren&#39;t sure if it tasted like Chicken or something else.  But for Hubs, he said it was OK.  If its Sesame Chicken, where is the Sesame Seeds, I ponder and wonder..  Maybe they used Sesame Oil instead for &#34;added&#34; flavor.  In that Sesame Chicken TO GO Order, there is just a small Broccoli florets..  Hmmm..  still wondering why an Asian Vietnamese establishment put Broccoli florets, perhaps it was just for &#34;garnish&#34;.

Now with the Pho Do Bien.  YES, it comes with Shrimp, Shrimp Ball, Squid, Crab Claw, Imitation Crab and Rice Noodle with the fixings of Bean Sprouts, Basil, Lime and Jalapenos.  All these are OK.  I am NOT WOW with my order.  Furthermore, with the Shrimp Ball, and other &#34;seafood&#34; items they put, its not really of good quality, that I wish Pho establishments in town would offer.  Furthermore, we don&#39;t mind paying extra for good quality items from their Menu,

In conclusion, we will stick to the &#34;MEAT&#34; options such as Steak or Brisket, when ordering Pho from this establishment.  This recent TO GO ORDER is on Friday January 23rd 2015.  Time was about 18:50hrs ish.

As others have said, it&#39;s kind of hard to mess up pho, but I&#39;ve had bad pho and this was not bad at all.  The lychee boba smoothie was just ok, but I was impressed by the quick and friendly service so overall I&#39;d say I&#39;m a fan and will be back soon."

We ordered to go and They sent us home with a box full of food!! I kid you not, I never felt like I ordered so much food in my life. 

Ordered: 
crab Rangoon was really good, and gave us about 6 pieces.

Two types of soup, can&#39;t remember the exact types but we had leftovers for days. Was really good, fresh and they separated everything for us so we could add it in the soup ourselves. I loved it and would come back.  We orderd a small and it was huge!

We also got a main dish, chicken and rice. Which was good, but nothing rememberable and the sause that came with it, I did not like at all. Would not order this again.

Plus a mango bubble tea that was good, but very sweet.

All in all pretty good especially the soup and I would come back if I lived in Denver."

right size and portion for the price, nice big place with great ventilation. no smell of fish sauces or sticky tables, parking is plenty and it was cozy spacious place.

only gripe can be the dirty carpet.  you can see the dark spots around the table and walkways.

can you spend some $ and get that carpet cleaning guy some business?"

When I walked in, at about 3 pm for a late lunch, I wasn&#39;t asked anything.  I was told, &#34;Sit over there.&#34;  Okay...  I was then asked, &#34;What do you want?&#34;  To which I replied that I&#39;d have a medium-sized rare steak pho.  My server actually rolled his eyes (??) and walked away without even asking if I wanted a drink.  I&#39;d have ordered a Coke, but I guess it was water only for me.
The service was very fast, the food was hot and tasty. - This is not a bad review on the restaurant or the food...
I was in a bit of a hurry, finished quickly and waited for a bit, but no bill was brought to my table.  Nor was I asked how things were, anything else, etc., despite being one of only two customers in the restaurant.  My meal was priced at about $9 including tax. So, I left $2 on the table in cash (a completely undeserved 23% tip), and walked to the front counter to pay my bill. 
The server rang my meal, which I paid with my debit card.  Because I&#39;d left $2 cash on the table, I wrote a line through the tip section, totaled, and signed.
My server looked at the charge slip, and I was then asked - now get this - &#34; Did you leave a tip on the table?&#34;  Seriously??  I said that I had, and he simply said, &#34;Okay.&#34;  With that, I walked out.

Yeah, I won&#39;t be back.  Sorry to inconvenience you into taking my money for your service."

This does not rival the pho at Pho 888, not even in the same ballpark. The spring rolls however are better. I&#39;ll start with the fact that I called for a carryout order and was asked to hold on.... I waited like 20 min. (I did have it on speaker phone in the background while I was working but really!?!) So I hung up and tried to call back... Busy for another 15 min. Someone in the office volunteered to go there to place the order... When they got there the phone was still off the hook. The guy apologized. Anyway, we were excited to try what the reviews were saying was better than Pho 888, our favorite in Aurora. So you kmow if you get carry out pho you must have your own bowl to assemble your soup in when you get it because one is not provided to you here, just a full tub of broth and a box of veggies. We had bowls but didn&#39;t expect that. The broth is ok, goodish flavor but not rich and seemed a bit watered down. We had to add a lot of hoisen and siracha to get it right. (More than what was provided BTW) veggies were fresh and the meat was good portion size. The spring rolls were really good, grilled seasoned meat rather than the plain meats usually inside. The nouc mam had canned chili paste rather than fresh. Also had a side of the cheese wontons and although pretty oily they were good. If it wasn&#39;t for the high expectations of other yelpers and the phone incident I may have given 3 stars but this truly was a 1-2 star experience compared to what I have come to expect from a competitor not too far away."

Order a grill pork rice dish and the rice were dried on the bottom layer. Dried as in the rice was left outside for days and they put that on the bottom of he bowl then flip it up side down, hiding on the bottom. Took a bite and gives you that feel like eating dirt. Completely threw me off.  The pork also had a spoiled taste and was not quite seasoned well, though the pork portion was generous.  I definitely had better. 
Did order the grilled pork spring rolls and that was much better.
Such disappointing experience for wanting to try my food and satisfying my craving."

Well I&#39;ll wonder no more.
Had the pho dac biet here and thought it was pretty good and there was a decent amount of toppings but not overly generous either. There was a LOT of noodles in the bowl though which may be them being generous but I think it was a bit too much. I may ask for less noodles if I visit them again. I liked that their was culantro on the garden plate as well as the other usual veggies and the limes had some of the rind peeled off which shows attention to detail to me. The service was good so that helped to turn this 3 1/2 star review into a 4 star."

Lots of meat. Not enough noodles. And that&#39;s strange in a large usually there is way too much!!! The broth was average. I didn&#39;t drink it so that says something. 

Pick up was fast and easy. Customer service was really great. (We accidentally called the castle rock location. Oops.) And they gladly helped. 

Vietnamese egg rolls were small for the price.

Being new to the area, I simply yelped and came across this as my closest option. I called and specifically asked before ordering if they could do spring rolls withOUT rice noodles. They assured me that yes, of course they could, and would add more lettuce. I ordered spring spring rolls and pork and shrimp. As I walk in to the slightly run down restaurant, I stood there for about 30 seconds before the only person in there acknowledged my presence (there were no customers dining) and handed me my order. Payed and left. Halfway home, I think to check my rolls and to my surprise, they are ONLY rice noodles. Only rice noodles!!!! I call and the man on the phone hardly apologizes and says the kitchen must have read the order wrong. He did not even offer me a refund and proceeded to hang up the phone on me after I calmly and respectfully told him I was not happy and would not be able to eat the $12 spring rolls I just paid for. He hung up on me! Did not even bother to call back because it was only going to make me more upset. Needless to say, I will never be returning here and highly recommend readers to avoid this place."

As for the food, I ordered a Seafood Pho and my wife ordered a Beef Pho. The soup in both of ours was amazing. Probably the best I&#39;ve had in CO so far. 

Now for the downs. While my wife&#39;s pho had a significant amount of meat, my seafood had very little seafood. 3 pieces of imitation crab meat. A crab claw. And maybe 4-5 other pieces. I understand seafood costs more, but I also paid more for my dish. The one other downside is while my waiter was polite and helpful, once we got our food he was MIA. We have been finished with our food since I started writing this review and still no check, which is a pet peeve of mine. 

The manager, Andy sent me a very polite email to help us meet a resolution. I am increasing my rating due to loving when a manager takes the time to respond to a customer. My wife and I will be going again, and I will re-review after we go. Thank you Andy!!!

We plan on trying it again and seeing if maybe I was shorted by accident. All and all not bad. But the competition for pho places is pretty fierce, so I hope they step it up a bit."

The spring rolls were very fresh, and really tasty. 
I had the vegetarian pho, and my dinner companion had the rare steak and well done brisket pho. As far as I know, this is the only pho restaurant in the area that has a truly vegetarian broth. I know it&#39;s not traditional, but it&#39;s incredibly flavorful and a great meatless option. 
According to dinner companion, the beef broth was amazing. Tons of flavor, and a lot more meat than he had expected.

They had a really good price too, me and my girl ordered egg rolls and shrimp spring rolls for the appetizer, the peanut sauce for the spring rolls is by far not watered down like most places so the quality for their peanut sauce is amazing..she had the number 6 small and i had the medium number 2 with meatballs.... Only problem i really had was they couldve giving us 2 more lettuce pieces for the egg rolls but its okay ill just ask for extra pieces next time.... Service was alriight i found nothing wrong with the server... In all everything came down to 28 dollars what a deal!!!! Cant wait ro visit them next time.... Hopfully they stay consistent with the proportions... They have been open for a couple of month so we&#39;ll see"

Little did I know that they had stores in Colorado! I was super happy with my food. It really hit the spot. I also appreciate that they allowed me to have extra vegetables instead of rice at no extra charge. It was super fresh, affordable, and exactly what I wanted. I now know where I can go when the teriyaki tugs at my heartstrings."

I chose Chick Fil A instead.
They got my busine$$ today. They were ready to serve customers. 5 STAR performance!

The quality of the fish is fantastic. And you have to try their Salmon and Toro, by far the best I&#39;ve had. And they also have King Crab sushi or sashimi. I&#39;ve never had that anywhere before and its amazing.  Not to mention the Salmon Carpaccio. The sauce that comes with it would be great salad dressing and the mango, tomato and salmon combination is amazing.

We used to frequent sushi places often but having 3 kids now it&#39;s a bit more difficult so instead of going to John Holly&#39;s we decided to try something local. We were pleasantly surprised. 

Food was great, we even order another 5 rolls after devouring our 1st set. The service was great. Our waitress was extremely attentive but not enough to be annoying. The prices are a bit higher than I&#39;d like and no lunch menu on the weekends but I can deal since sushi isn&#39;t a every weekend occurrence for us."

We were in between the crab wontons and the crispy duck roll for the app, asked the server and he said the crispy duck roll was better so we ordered it.  It not only arrived stone cold and didn&#39;t look anything like the picture on the menu, but there was NOTHING crispy about it, the tortilla was room temp and chewy at best.  Not to mention my wife almost cracked her tooth on a duck bone.

The mamamiya roll had no flavor and such large chunks of fish that it was difficult to stomach.  The menu advertises that it comes with a cilantro sauce, but there was such a small amount of sauce on the top that not a trace of cilantro could be detected.  It looked like it had been placed on the roll with a micro pipette. The sexy roll was basically rice and strawberries and we couldn&#39;t taste the shrimp or the Kani at all.  

We complained to the server that the crispy duck roll was subpar (it was $9!!!) so he offered to bring us an order of the crab wontons on the house.  He arrived a few minutes later with 2 wontons (an order comes with 4 on the menu).  It would have been more appropriate to comp the $9 menu item that *he* recommended instead of bringing a pitiful half order of another appetizer.  I&#39;ve had better sushi from the counter at King Sooper&#39;s.  That&#39;s $60 bucks gone and nothing about this meal was enjoyable.  I will never waste my money here again."

The sashimi tasted like it was cut with a clumsy knife.  The pieces were chunky and the cuts were inconsistent.  The way that it was preserved also raises a flag.  No, the sashimi was fresh by all means but many restaurants will use salt and vinegar to preserve the fish.  They also need to use more vinegar in their sushi rice.  I picked up my nigiri with my chopsticks and the rice fell apart almost as fast as long grain rice.

Let&#39;s continue with the rest of the review.  Amazing service and seat selection.  Our drinks were constantly refilled and the entire staff (waitress included) joked around with us.  They made recommendations even though we already knew what we wanted to order.  We ordered the crispy duck egg rolls and the Loveboat for 2.  Crispy duck egg rolls were not crispy by any means and the taste was A-OK.  However, after seeing this dish, I bet I could make it at home and elevate some of the flavors.  A rainbow roll and Yama roll accompanied our Loveboat for 2.  Their rolls are EXCELLENT and now I know this is what I need to come for next time.  Yes, there will be next time sans sashimi/nigiri.  Even their miso soup and salad was top notch as well.  I&#39;ll drive the distance for service and quality any day!

These are the most quiet sushi chefs I have come across.  No greeting and a quiet thank you when we left.  However, they were super busy!  The restaurant has a modern chic feel to it but they keep the customer in focus which is important.  The restaurant is in a strip mall next door to Little Ceasar&#39;s and a nail salon.  Don&#39;t let this fool you.  Definitely off the beaten path when it comes to sushi restaurants.  I would still highly recommend this place.  They do a great job.  I&#39;ll be looking forward to my next visit!"

We opt to be seated at one of the booth.  The décor inside this establishment is modern and everything is clean and tidy.  If I am NOT mistaken the time was about 12 NOON.

Once again, another Sushi establishment which do not have UNI on a Monday!  *Sigh*

In terms of sushi its small portion, err NOT to my liking **DOUBLE SIGH**...

The service was good, fast and prompt...   If I am NOT mistaken, our server her name is May.

From their extensive Menu, I ordered the following Sushi/Nigiri Items :

*  UNAGI ($5.00)
*  Tamago ($4.00)
*  Ama Ebi ($7.50)
*  Spicy Scallop ($7.00)

The Lunch is doable BUT NOTHING WOW me as much...  maybe I will return next time and order the sashimi and perhaps from there my review might differ...  there are other sushi items I can order or even other dishes from the Menu that might call my name the next time...

My friend opt to have the Sexy Roll and the Maya Roll or something, too bad I cannot recall what is what... then she also ordered the Steak Habachi stir fry etc.  Overall, my friend likes what she ordered for the Lunch she had.  She also offer some of the Sushi Rolls and the Steak Habachi Stir Fry.  YES, I cannot deny the Steak is super juicy.. but I AM HERE To Eat Sushi..  Oh well..

Its more like an underwhelmed experience...  coz I don&#39;t fancy the rice from the Sushi/Nigiri itself, something wrong with the rice in terms of &#34;texture&#34; and &#34;flavor&#34;...  Maybe I went to Kurosawa on a &#34;bad&#34; day.  Coz I heard raving reviews from my friends who live around this area.  Oh well, another Sushi establishment that is just OK in my books.  Though personally its more like a 2.5 star Review.  *Sad Face* 

This recent visit was on Monday November 17th 2014.  I wanted to order some desserts.  The desserts are those of &#34;Restaurant&#34; quality aka PREMADE.. from another Company..  Oh well...

Left Kurosawa at about 12:55hrs ish.

Portions are large.  Service was only OK experience.   We had to wait a long time for the food and rolls came out at different times.  It seemed the sushi chefs got confused on which tables ordered what and when they were seated.   

Sashimi portions are large cuts - almost too big or because sushi chefs are amateurs.  Hot food was only luke warm.   Miso soup should be popping hot.  We order sushi, sashimi, Edamame, chicken teriyaki, yaki soba noodles.   Water is heavy on the chlorine tasting side so better to order tea, beer, sake, soda."

― Akira Kurosawa

That statement seems to be quite reflective of the philosophy of this restaurant.  Our food on this visit was as beautiful as it was delicious.  My friends went with a variety of sushi.  We saw the platter being constructed at the sushi bar, but assumed that it was for a different table, as it seemed too elegant for us.  But, indeed, it was ours.  My friends really enjoyed the sushi.

I split the tempura appetizer with them.  It was very nice.  It came out piping hot (a big ouch to impatient us), and was very crunchy and tasty.  It also had two large shrimp, instead of just one, which was a nice touch.  I was not really in a sushi mood, so I asked the waitress what was popular among the other entrees.  She indicated the hibachi steak, so I went with that.  The meat was very tender and flavorful, with grilled veggies on the side, and I upgraded to a solid scoop of friend rice.  The meal also came with soup and salad.  The soup was a mild miso.  The salad was some nice greens coated with an excellent ginger dressing.  In some ways (good ways) this was not unlike a solid Teppanyaki meal.  I washed it all down with a cold Asahi beer.
 
The unfinished &#34;Tavern&#34; location in Parker never quite opened.  There were rumors of not properly securing building permits and thus incurring the everlasting wrath of the town officials, but nothing concrete.  For a couple years, I could literally walk out the front door and see this empty storefront peaking across the street from behind two houses at the end of the block.  Sadly, our suburban dream of a bar within walking distance was never quite achieved.  And although I no longer live near here, my friends still do.  The good news is that Kurosawa Asian Bistro opened in this location that had been vacant for too long.  I am glad that there is an Asian restaurant of this caliber in plain old Parker."

This place is the cleanest restaurant in town from the seating, tables and dinnerware.  The presentation is extremely crisp and the staff is very nice and accommodating and you get a nice semi full size cloth towel to wash up with beforehand.

I really like their peppered tuna sashimi as well as their specialty rolls.  I think you get more value here than you do at Junz actually, especially when you factor in their $10 coupons and there&#39;s no minimum purchase.  They&#39;re okay my book!"

We were surprised that the restaurant was almost empty despite little to no parking available at the strip mall.  To our surprise, the crowd was huddled inside and outside the Little Caesar&#39;s next door.

Kurosawa is at the end of the strip mall and presents as a dark interior with some modern touches.  The ambience was pretty decent.  From a food perspective our orders were somewhat limited.  I ordered a California Roll which was the best part of the meal.  My wife and I both had Hibachi.  She wanted chicken and I wanted prawns.  We were not impressed with the dinner salad, soup or the Hibachi.  Our meals were flavorless and unfortunately could not be saved by a large dose of soy sauce.

We live close by so we will give it another shot.  I bet this place is great if you stick to sushi."

All the rolls in the lunch special were great, really high in fish.  The dragon roll was more disappointing by comparison - low eel content - though still worth the price.  The soup that came with my lunch special also was low in tofu, but tasted great.  Great service and friendly staff, though there weren&#39;t many people in there, so difficult to know what it would be like when very busy.  I&#39;d definitely recommend you try it, especially if you are in the area.  It was better than above average and the lunch special was a great deal for the quantity and quality."

I had been here once for dinner and thought the sushi was quite good, but a bit expensive. We liked the ambiance. I looked forward to returning.

Because I had a good experience, my friend and I went for lunch. The prices and selections were good. The server was unfriendly and seemed to really want to be anywhere else but there, but she wasn&#39;t rude so we didn&#39;t fret about it.

My diet sodapop tasted a bit like saltwater, clearly not enough syrup. But it was the right color, my friend and I were enjoying our conversation so I said nothing about that.

When we received our order, they had my friend&#39;s order wrong. But they set it down quickly and disappeared. We had to wait for them to return so she could point out that was not what she ordered. They didn&#39;t apologize for the mix up but they did replace her roll very quickly.

Halfway into my meal, I was eating my tuna roll which was tasty and I bit down and my molars hit something really hard. I think it was more than a bone. It didn&#39;t yield at all. I spit it out onto the plate. Even though I was still hungry, I was scared to eat more. My teeth weren&#39;t cracked although I bit hard enough that they hurt mildly for a few hours after that.

I didn&#39;t want to make waves at the restaurant but I figured they&#39;d want to know there was something hard in my soft fish. I told the waitress and showed her the chewed up piece I&#39;d spit back out. She seemed shocked, took the plate away but didn&#39;t apologize on behalf of the restaurant.

The waitress returned with our bill and asked us if we would like to take the leftovers home. I would have liked to have eaten them there but I just couldn&#39;t convince myself to after nearly cracking a tooth so we both passed on the leftovers.

I just wasn&#39;t impressed with the service. I left feeling like they thought I was a huge inconvenience and they didn&#39;t want me there at all."

We arrived around 5pm on a Sunday so it was not busy at the store at all. Our waitress was very attentive. 

Now for the reason of my low star review. After ordering our food my group waited 33 minutes for our sushi rolls, understand that these orders were standard rolls. While we are waiting I noticed to go orders were rolling out in front of us. If I were the owner would u not assist your in store before to go orders!!

The quality of the rolls are not good! The groups gyoza was from a box, not hand made!! And the prices for rolls at 16 dollars- I really don&#39;t think this place deserves four stars for the prices 

And last the wine pour, if I am going to pay an arm and a leg for alcohol less than half a glass of house wine is being pretty cheap

The decor is pretty, I believe that previous Parker residents may have nothing to compare this establishment to, which is why it gets four star. Save your time and money and eat elsewhere."

The fish was fresh but the variety was limited. If you don&#39;t want to eat rolls, there are only so many kind of sushi you can choose from. I like that they don&#39;t stuff a bunch of rice in my roll and my sushi. We ordered a pineapple fry rice and it just ruined the night for us. The whole dish was bland.

     -- decent sushi
     -- yucky steak

In the spirit of trying different categories of food, we ordered:
 -- Tri Crunch appetizer ($8.00). Highlight of the meal. A Pringles chip with assorted mulched fish topped with avocado and roe. Only wished all the goodness was atop a Lays Stax chip for more sturdiness, but we can&#39;t win them all.
-- Avocado Roll ($4.50). Fresh.
-- Spicy Tuna Roll ($5.50). Mulched. I don&#39;t mind it, but I know some of you do.
-- Volcano Roll ($13.00). Spicy shrimp and scallops with crab concoction. It came with a shot jig lit afire. Really cute. 
-- Steak Hibachi ($14.00). Great veggies (mushrooms, zucchini, broccoli, carrots). Steak was frozen and quite dry and chewy. It really could be done better.

I wish this place had a decent happy hour. If so, I would stop by more often for sushi."

I&#39;ll start with what we started with--the impressive yellowtail &amp; jalepeno sashimi appetizer. This was darn good, as rumored.  The sauce (eel sauce, maybe?) each piece of fish rested in (with the not-too-spicy pepper perched on top) was excellent and the presentation also cool.  The combo taste of simple ingredients worked very well.    

That being said, we tried two of the &#34;highly reviewed&#34; special rolls (the Phoenix and the Keystone) and I hafta be straight up--they were just okay. Not bad, but nothing to rush back for.  Pretty sure they used canned mango as an ingredient on one of them. It sorta tasted like a canned peach and when sushi uses fruit, I tend to lean towards a preference for fresh.  In fact, the mango was supposed to be &#34;crunchy&#34; but the roll had no crunch.  When I read crunchy, I expect a little tempura swerve inside!  Again, not terrible, but for the price, I&#39;ll prioritize somewhere else for a speciality roll.  

We also tried some of their Thai seafood soup, and the broth was decent, but the rest of the ingredients so-so.  It didn&#39;t really mesh well.  

Lastly, we had nigiri style yellowfish and toro.  Both melt in your mouth good.  Then again, nigiri is well, basic.  But the fish was good, and buttery fresh.    

I&#34;ll throw up 3 stars since the service was decent and nothing tasted bad, but certainly not groundbreaking.  If I get a coupon and am in the area, I might consider trying another roll or two.  Maybe."

Showed up and they didn&#39;t have my reservation.  That was OK, because luckily, they had a table for us.  The restaurant was freezing cold, and there was a small space heater in the middle of the floor which I found odd.  We ordered the &#34;Love boat&#34; for 2, a glass of wine and a sake.  We got our drinks about 15 minutes in, then our salad and miso soup came about 1/2 hour after we sat down.  At this point I thought to myself that the service was going to be slow, but it was a holiday and they were busy.  After waiting for an HOUR and a HALF, that&#39;s right, 90 minutes, we still had NO DINNER!  At this point we cancelled our order.  One of the waitresses said &#34;oh no, it&#39;s coming soon, the chefs will make you a special roll&#34;, and I thought why the heck can&#39;t they just make me the rolls I ordered???  
The entire situation was handled very poorly by our waitress, whose name I can&#39;t remember.  She was a crab from the moment we sat down, then proceeded to avoid us at all costs because she new we were becoming impatient.  She stopped by our table 1 time in the hour and a half to see if I wanted another glass of wine.  That&#39;s it.  No apologies, no &#34;hey, can I get you some edamame because it&#39;s taking so long&#34;...she did give us the excuse of the sushi chefs being so busy because everyone was ordering sushi and no one was ordering anything from the kitchen.  It&#39;s a sushi restaurant, right?  We will never return, which is really too bad because I really wanted to like this place."

After reading the reviews we gave Kurosawa a shot, and give them a hearty &#34;meh&#34;

First, let me say the quality and freshness of the seafood was excellent, so no issue there.  Menu is mostly modified California rolls and &#34;spicy&#34; this or that. Oddly, the wait staff made a mistake on our order and then argued with us when we pointed it out. Telling me that a bland tuna and scallion roll is actually a spicy tuna roll doesn&#39;t work very well when: (1) it isn&#39;t spicy at all and (2) I&#39;m pointing at the pieces of scallion in the roll as I&#39;m asking for the spicy tuna roll I actually ordered.

My wife and I both described this place as a great &#34;white people sushi place.&#34; So, if you&#39;re a casual sushi eater that enjoys dunking your California roll into a full bowl of soy sauce until it&#39;s saturated and washing it down with a glass of red wine then I suspect you&#39;ll enjoy your meal here. If you&#39;re looking for a more authentic sushi experience, you may want to consider other places."

Did we go at a bad time and they didn&#39;t have any sushi rice prepared?  We ordered a fairly good size of sushi, if you know anything about sushi you know it is about the rice...not the fish or any other topping you might put on it.  The rice was few and far between...not much at all.  Large piece of fish with the smallest bed of rice i have EVER experienced.  The rolls hardly had any rice on them...it was weird.

Since it was a cold night (it was 5°F), we were served some green tea. Unfortunately, the green tea was lukewarm (about room temperature), so that was a bit disappointing.

For starters, we ordered the Tokyo roll, which was outstanding. It was basically three to four different fish wrapped in a (thin) soy wrapper, topped with some crab (so essentially sashimi in a roll form). 

Included in the dinner order was miso soup and a salad with a sweet orange ginger dressing. Like the green tea, the miso soup was lukewarm at best. Did this place run out of natural gas for cooking? Perhaps they used all of it to heat the interior of the restaurant...

For my dinner, I ordered the salmon hibachi. Everything comes separately in its own little pile, so there was the grilled salmon, the grilled vegetables, and plain white short-grain rice. The salmon was cooked well, coated in a sweet soy sauce based glaze. I then mixed the grilled vegetables into the rice.

I took off half a star for the cold tea and soup. Another half a star gets dinged for the so-so service. It took forever to get things like chopsticks, a spoon for the soup, or the check, and there were about 4 waiters standing around chatting by the sushi bar while we were waiting for various things (recall that the place was empty and we were the only diners present). However, I&#39;d be willing to come back here again, and perhaps during standard dining hours, the service will be more prompt and attentative."

But that doesn&#39;t quite matter the food is what&#39;s important. My main concern is that this place is way overpriced. Their plain rolls are priced well but their specialty rolls are ridiculous. They  are $12+. They sounded good but not for the price. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and Tuna avocado roll. The tuna tasted cold and fresh which was nice. The rolls were really small and seemed to have no rice on it. It took about 35 minutes to get our food even though there was about 2 other parties. They dis happen to roll out about 3-4 to go orders in the time it took our food to come out. I wouldn&#39;t come here again.

They said they have hibachi, but that they cook it in the back rather than in front of you like traditional hibachi places, due to their space. I didn&#39;t mind that so I ordered it. Unfortunately, I took one bite of my chicken &#34;hibachi&#34;, gagged, and sent it back. The chicken definitely was not grilled - it was rubbery and had zero flavor - it tasted like it had been boiled and microwaved. Ick! My husband will eat just about anything and I gave him a bite just to test my sanity and he spit it out.  They were kind enough to take it away and not charge me for it so that was good - as was the fact that my second order (sushi) was fine. I just don&#39;t understand why they bother trying to say they have hibachi when they don&#39;t - and then it&#39;s not even edible. Kurosawa, start grilling it or take it off the menu..."

I&#39;m quite sure the &#39;crab&#39; was actually krab, so I would avoid that. It was a pretty expensive outing for some not so fantastic sushi. I&#39;d give another star if it wasn&#39;t so expensive. We&#39;ll probably try again in the future, but not anytime soon. With the great reviews, it was quite a disappointment.

Service - very good. It&#39;s rare these days that we go out to dinner and don&#39;t feel like we&#39;re  competing in some dinner race. Courses were brought out properly - one at a time - and the wait staff didn&#39;t seem flustered.

Food - excellent! Gives Junz and John Hollies a run for their money (in the food and service department). We started with a seaweed salad, followed by the dumplings (gyoza) and split four rolls - the kurosawa, the 007, the spicy tuna, and the spicy yellowtail. Presentation was beautiful and the fish was unbelievably fresh.

Ambiance - definitely classy for Parker. If you&#39;re thinking of stopping in after the gym (as a few customers decided to do), at least change into some jeans. This definitely seems like a place that could be a dressier place for dinner, but I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t happen in its location.  

Looking forward to going back! This definitely seems like it will be our new go-to sushi place!"

The happy hour on the delightful front patio (weather permitting) is a great deal, and is less crowded than later at night. Love the Antipasti: Bruschetta, Britto Misto and Pepata di Cozze. Have all three with wine and you have a delicious meal.

Insalate: Cesare salad is ordinary. I suggest skipping it and going with something more interesting like the Gorgonzola e Pere.

Primi: On two separate visits, hubby and I shared the Pappardelle All Bolognese (great tomato flavor - enough left over that I took some home), Linguine Frutti di Mare (lots of seafood - great deal). 

Secundi: Hubby and I split the Pollo al Marsala - very good (the chicken was a bit dry). Some reviews complain that the sauce is to sweet...but, Marsala is sweet - so don&#39;t order it if you don&#39;t like Marsala.

First of all, the menu was very diverse and interesting. However, the food did not live up to the expectations generated from first glance coupled with Yelp reviews.

My party started with the Frito misto and mussels.
The Frito misto was over breaded and served with insipid, flavorless tomato sauce. The mussels were average and accompanied with a heavy tomato sauce.

Our salad course had a bright star: the tricolore. The lettuce was fresh and the dressing was light. The pear salad had overly sweet dressing and unripened pears.

Our entree choices included the swordfish salmoroglio, bolognese, and the rigatoni Norma. 
The fish was swimming in olive oil and overly cooked. The caponata it was served with was flavorful and tasty. The bolognese was pretty bland, but I will say the pasta was cooked well. We all agreed the rigatoni sucked. We actually had to dump the dipping on top to make it edible.

Sorry, but not a great restaurant if you enjoy quality Italian."

First, the atmosphere is pretty lacking and WAY too bright - like cafeteria bright - and dead, dead tonight while Trattoria Stella was slammed next door - should have been our first clue.

The real downer here is that nothing tastes homemade because it isn&#39;t - long list of pastas, gnocchi, risotto.  Asked which pastas were made in house - answer - none.  

The only thing we had that was worth eating all night was the frito misto - pretty good starter so we were hopeful.  All down hill after that.  The baked pasta &#34;al forno&#34; was a blown out mess of mushy pasta and bland sauce baked into a block that you could build the cheap condos in the neighborhood with.  The chicken marsala tasted like the cornstarch heavy sauce was out of an envelope and the fresh asparagus on the side was inedible.  How do you screw up fresh asparagus?  Over cooked olive green - no sauce no seasoning - ick.  Both mains were just awful.

Worst &#34;Italian&#34; I&#39;ve had in Denver in a very long time.  The menu reads like a wonderful old rendition of North Denver American/Italian favorites but turned out to be nothing even close and with a couple of cocktails, 2 glasses of wine was $100 with tip.

Such huge disappointment.  We need an old school Italian pasta joint so badly but this ain&#39;t it.  Read the recent reviews - lots of questionable early reviews that smell like fakes to me."

Happy Hour is a great deal.

Happy Hour.
1500-1800, M-F. 1/2-price appetizers. We had the Pepata di Cozze and they perfectly cooked and swimming in a fresh, tomato sauce. We each also had a glass of Zardetto Prosecco ($5) and a glass of Regaleali Rose ($5). You could easily make an entire dinner out of apps and wine.
On second visit, we also had the delicious Bruschetta and the Fritto Misto.

Food.
+ My Linguine Frutti di Mare ($18) loaded with clams, mussels, quid (tentacles and rings) and shrimp. All with a fresh tomato sauce.
0 The chicken Marsala was well made (tasty Marsala sauce) except that the chicken was overcooked (a failing of many restaurants).
+ Washed down with a Zenato Valpolicella Superiore ($34).
- No fresh pepper. I asked for a grinder and received a shaker. I prefer freshly ground and only use that at home.
- Asked for some grated Parmigiano and received grated &#34;parmesan&#34;.
± The food prices are very reasonable while the wine price are a bit high.

Service.
++ Nothing but positives here. Seated and served with a friendly attitude. Served with skill. Our waiter, Carlos, recommended the Valpolicella and he was spot on.
+ Very good service from Miguel on our second visit.

Atmosphere.
+ Large, quiet patio. Semi-open kitchen.
+ Cloth napkins.
+ Hefty Winco flatware.

I had the eggplant parm over penne and it was very good. The wine recommendation was helpful and delicious as well. Loved the patio seating too. Pups were on the patio, which was a plus too. Will definitely be back."

Yes to ramen, innovative tacos, fast casual concepts, brewpubs. But sometimes what a neighborhood needs most is classic Italian food on a gorgeous patio. Thanks, Spatola, for scratching that itch. 

Had lunch today - eggplant parmigiana sandwich was delicious, as was the farfalle al salmone (smokey, spicy, creamy) and the pasta al forno (tender meat). 

Looking forward to returning for negronis on a warm evening, and exploring the extensive wine list. Thanks for bringing classic Italian food with great service to the neighborhood. Fantastic addition. And I look forward to becoming a regular."

I usually avoid restaurants that have just opened, but I decided to give this place a try on their third day of business. I could not be more pleased!!  I&#39;m a huge fan of authentic Italian, and this place is it. I had the chicken parm and it was lights out!! My wife had the chicken Marsala and it was awesome too. The Mediterranean salad was really fresh and perfect as well. I can easily say this is the best Italian restaurant on this side of town, and it&#39;s up there with the best in Denver. 10/10 from me. I highly recommend this place. I signed up for Yelp just to leave a 5 star review. It was that good. I got my food to go because I live nearby, but the inside of the restaurant was very nice and romantic. 

If you like authentic Italian, do yourself a favor!!!"

Pros: wine was tasty, bread &amp; garlic olive oil delicious, and the patio is killer.

Cons: salad could have come from a salad kit bag from Safeway (and we&#39;ve had better bagged salad).  We had the chicken piccata and the pasta al forno.  Both seemed pre-made and heated up, the pasta was cold in the center.  The noodles were also over cooked and mushy.  The piccata was a pretty heavy cream,  decent flavor.  Our meal (2 salads, 1 glass of wine, and 2 entrees) was over $75 w tip...grossly overpriced. 

Unfortunately we won&#39;t be back.  :/"

We started with the fritto mitso and it was delicious! Their fresh bread is served with oil, peppers and some garlic- seriously the most flavorful dip to use with bread. 

For dinner, we shared two entrees- the linguine frutti del marre and the swordfish.  Both were great presentations and good size servings. They were full of flavor. The linguine has a great kick to it, but definitely not too spicy and overpowering. 

The swordfish was served with some vegetables in a red sauce- amazing. So much flavor In each bite!

If you&#39;re looking for a place that has great service and is full of flavor- this place is a must. Finally- an Italian restaurant that isn&#39;t afraid to put seasonings and spice to everything on the menu!!!! 

We will definitely be coming back again. They have half price appetizers for happy hour as well as cheaper wine and drinks 3-6pm. Highly recommend checking this place out!!"

Don&#39;t really understand all the 5 star reviews. The pasta was good, but nothing special. Had the bolognese and carbonara and burrata, the bolognese was sweet tasting and the carbonara didn&#39;t taste like much other than cream, and the pancetta was not very flavorful or crispy. Service was okay, not impressive, certainly some better places around. If you like basic and cheap, this might be your place."

When we first walked by I was a bit skeptical about another pasta place so close to Trattoria Stella but after trying to the food I&#39;m convinced that Spatola will be around for the long haul. The menu is more traditional Italian than it&#39;s neighbor and it&#39;s pretty f&#39;n fantastic. We tried the Pasta al Forno and the Farfalle al Salmone - Both rocked. Most places only open for a week are still working the kinks out but these guys had it down. Service was solid, food came out quickly and flavors were great."

Went to Spatola tonight for happy hour and it was great! Good selection of wines by the glass - for five dollars each at happy hour - and all appetizers are half price. The food was delicious - we had the burrata and tomatoes which was amazing, also had the meatballs and Frito Misto which included lightly breaded and fried shrimp, calamari, and artichoke hearts. The food was fabulous and the service was great as well. Highly recommend this place! Cannot wait to go back and sample some of the entrée pastas!

I have had dinner here twice and it has been outstanding both times. My Italian food cred is from living in the north Bronx and in Howard Beach in Queens for most of my formative years. Both big time Italian neighborhoods. This is not a just a red sauce house but their piccata and gnocchi  are subtle but full of flavor. The mussels were cooked perfectly and tender. Nice wine list to round out the meal. One of the owners owns an Italian bakery and the desserts are something special. End the meal with an espresso and something sweet and you&#39;ll have a meal to remember. I can&#39;t wait to go back. Chicken Marsala next time. Oh and the service is friendly and efficient.  It also has a really nice patio not right on the street but tucked in the back.

The arincini risotto balls are still good however the pasta Al forno (which I order every time I eat here) had definitely changed and not for the better. I agree with another reviewer who said the Al forno now comes in a block and I feel as if they have added some ingredient that makes It worse along with too much parsley on top. My mom ordered the chicken marsala which was decent. And the service this time was slow. We waited just outside the front door for a few minutes with the hostess standing just a few feet away at the podium without ever greeting us or asking if we needed a table. I finally had to walk over and ask if we could be seated. The drinks took longer to get to us this time around as well. Just little things I noticed that added up to a not so great experience like previously. Not sure I&#39;ll be running back. I&#39;d rather try some different Italian in the area. Taking away a star. 

Previous review : Love love love! Dined here this evening and the food and service were absolutely amazing! We had the risotto balls to start with and the pasta al forno with bolognese sauce was delicious! A family owned Italian place that just opened a couple of months ago. We will definitely be back..... Maybe even this week! Charming patio seating as well."

The olive oil served with bread was a decent grade, not cheap oil masked with tons of garlic.  You can actually taste the green note in the oil along with some garlic and herbs.  

The arancini were lovely and the veal piccata was good.  My only pet-peeve is they put cheese in the linguini frutti di mare.  It was drilled into me while working in one of &#34;the islands&#34; in Italy that cheese and seafood don&#39;t mix ...

Overall it is still a very nice, relaxed place for a meal."

Spatola just kicked that up a few notches with outstanding service, phenomenal food and one of the best patios on the block. Growing up in the NYC metro area, I have been overly spoiled with great Italian food. Finally I have found something in Denver that lives up to that standard. I had the gnocci with crispy pancetta and saffron a.nd enjoyed every last bite. I couldn&#39;t get my fiance&#39;s fork out of my plate! The calamari was outstanding as well as the swordfish.

You guys have rehabbed that location, turned it into a great patio. And then the food and drink selection is excellent.

Food is straight forward at Spatola, good and predictable. The ambiance is delightful if you can somehow escape the blaring Italian rock (90s Italian rock, didn&#39;t know such a thing existed) or turn your eye so as to avoid the bus tub being dragged from table to table (yeah, as in, set on top of tables so as to clear - if you&#39;re charging $15-$20 per plate, all dishes should be taken from the table by hand as they are finished, not dumped into tubs after the table is empty). I hope y&#39;all can get it together - a few training sessions with your staff (including educating them on the wine selection, because it&#39;s decent) is a must and a change of the music channel would be prudent (may I suggest a Sinatra genre). Given Highlands Square doesn&#39;t have a lot of spots where you can really unwind with a nice glass of vino and a good meal, I&#39;d suggest upping your game ever so slightly and you&#39;ll have a winner!"

Homegrown is one of the taphouse and &#39;za trends that are sweeping the Denver area.  It&#39;s a little cramped inside, I find the bar to me comfortable than the dining room seating.  They also have a decent patio.  The rotating taps offer a good wide range of brews, with an emphasis on locals.  They also boast a buy a friend a pint board which is a cute idea.

The food is darn fine as well.  Toppings are of good quality, and the sauce is absolutely delicious.  Get some on the side.  Pizza&#39;s are all 14&#34;, so you aren&#39;t overstuffed or leaving with tons of leftovers.

The service has been great both times we came here.  The bartenders and managers are friendly, engaging, and did a great job helping guide us and the other folks at the bar in food  and beverage choices.

I really like this place, and will probably be coming here more often.

I love kids but when you can hardly find a place to take a step without smooshing one, and all you can hear are high pitched screams, you start to question how your dining experience will turn out. I got here around 6:30 on a Friday, and their is an attached mini arcade and a huge patio out front. It pretty much acts as the wash park parents play place after their busy Friday work days. So if you have kids and want to have a beer while your kids swarm around with other children, this is the place. 

If you are childless, make your way past the small blockade and you will be greeted by an extremely friendly staff. The hostess sat me at a high-top right away. I got lucky because this place isn&#39;t too big and they were on a wait for most of the evening. They also have a huge patio that extends, catering to people who are still trying to catch that last little bit of sunshine on these fall evenings. The white lights that surround the patio make it quite romantic and an added bit of classiness. I would love to sit out there next time. There is also a huge bar if you like to gab with friends and meet some strangers.  

We I enjoyed a couple Great Divide Pale Ales while my partner had the Dry Dock Apricot Ale. Great beer selection featuring plenty of my favorite local brews. We then enjoyed the chicken wings. These were interesting. They come sauce-less and covered in Parmesan, diced pepperoni and peppers. They seemed a bit under-cooked, but the concept was a good one. The pizza here might actually be one of my favorite pies in Denver. Being a big fan of a regular cheese (the fancier version also known as the Margarita) I immediately knew what I would order. The basic Marg was so good, I am not sure I have had a better here in Denver. The Funguy was also top on my list, with everyone&#39;s favorite toppings including mushrooms, olive oil, arugula, and TRUFFLE OIL. Delicious!!!!

The kids and the under-cooked wings make it a four star, but it is easily one of my favorite new places to grab a slice! If you have not tried it, I would definitely go. (*Disclaimer* Try and make it in on a night during the week. The parking around Gaylord has gotten quite intolerable and if you park in the neighborhood you will be ticketed unless you are a resident with the proper pass)"

When we have guests that like plain old American food we take them here because there are also some creative pizzas, yummy salads, and a diverse selection of appetizers. 

The funguy pizza is hands down my favorite of the pizzas- fontina, a white garlic sauce, shrooms, and arugula.  We also love the scarpone. If you have a hungry man in the group I recommend they get the calzone, it is HUGE!!!

The beet salad and kale salad are both delicious for your salad lovers.

We recently moved to the neighborhood and have been trying to check things out on both Pearl and Gaylord. 

The food was great it was the service that killed us. Our server looked like she wasn&#39;t even in high school yet and was just rude. I know I can be a little tough when judging servers but in my mind it isn&#39;t that hard to be nice to customers and have a positive attitude. Plus I think she forgot to put our food in as three tables in our area arrived after us and got their food before us - seemed a little odd - and she never mentioned it or apologized.

Now that I&#39;ve ranted, onto the food. We definitely ordered family style and were a bit eclectic in our choices. The brussel sprouts were to die for - please do yourself a favor and order them if you like brussel sprouts. Additionally, we ordered the garlic cheese bread - also fabulous. We also ordered the beet salad. I loved the combo of the beets, hazelnuts and goat cheese. For pizza we ordered the Pete Za - which was amazing. The candied bacon was a great touch that neither of us had tried before.

Just a quick tip - if you are looking for a quiet intimate dinner, this is not the place. If you don&#39;t like kids either, you probably should not come during the normal (5-8) dinner hour. Homegrown is very family friendly with games and such on the patio. Be ready for some high voices and maybe kid screaming. 

We will definitely be back - especially since its within biking distance of our place. Thanks for the good food!"

Pizza seemed the perfect antidote to what ailed us.

Good news: At dinner time on a Saturday they sat 5 with no issue and the place has a very cute chic - including ski lifts as benches. The food also came out quick despite a packed restaurant, and the flavor combination on the Funguy was very nice indeed.

Bad news: Our server may or may not have been a robot, with all the personality of a voicemail message. The topping to pizza ratio was less than ideal, and compounding this issue the crust just didn&#39;t have enough flavor to keep you eating. Only a strongly held belief in eating crust got it down.

This spot has all the ingredients to work in Denver, maybe they were just having a bad day when we stopped in."

This place has a cool vibe...outdoor patio, free game room, bags, craft beers. We&#39;ve been here once before and it was decent enough, so we decided to take my wife&#39;s parents here. So why the 2 stars?  For our family it began and ended at the bar.

We were there on a Friday. Good crowd but not crazy crowded. There&#39;s gonna be a wait without rezos, so we decide to grab a drink. There were a few spots open at their small bar (like I said, not crazy crowded), so my wife and I bellied up.

The bartender was in a word...atrocious. Rolling of the eyes, no personality, would not respond to polite calls for attention, but would happily chat up his friends who sat next to us. It was as if he couldn&#39;t be bothered. I don&#39;t know if he was having a bad day or he is just poor at his job. 

Once we grabbed his attention we asked, &#34;Do you have Stella?&#34; A curt &#34;No&#34; was his reply. No suggestion of an alternative. &#34;Could you suggest something similar?&#34; We asked.  Eye roll. He was annoyed.

An empty beer glass usually signals a bartender to ask you if you could use another. Not with this staff. Our empty glasses and looks for further service went unnoticed for a good 10-15 min. Both bartenders were aloof, but the guy was just plain awful. He acted more like a bar back with as much time as he spent on the glassware.

Food is respectable. Our stuffed mushrooms were a little cold. 

My wife says she can&#39;t remember a time when she has been treated so rudely at a restaurant.  The manager knew they perhaps could have done better and to his credit came by to apologize for the long wait, but unfortunately you can&#39;t make up for your lackluster bartender during that time."

It&#39;s become our favorite neighborhood bar - and the bar is usually where we sit to eat too. Craig and Athena are friendly, attentive and make great drinks. The food is good too. The Brussel sprouts, Pete-Za and Spicy Spaghetti and meet balls are fantastic. My only wish was that they had a few additional entrees with protein as the star - like steak or chicken.

Even though this is a pizza and beer joint, it&#39;s super family friendly. Everywhere we looked there were babies and children. I was really impressed by how many families came here to enjoy an evening out.

We made it for happy hour and took advantage of the delicious Chicken Parm Sliders ($2) and ordered individual 8&#39; pizzas ($8). I got the Spicy Italian Sausage pizza and it was spectacular!  The short peppers on the pizza provided a tangy spice that was a great pairing with the ricotta and sausage.

If I&#39;m in the area again, I&#39;d definitely come back to try more!"

Pizzas have a nice crispiness to them, and they have a variety of different combinations to choose from.

The first time Jeff and I stopped in for a quick drink. The bartender was really friendly and knowledgeable when it came to beers. We had just had brunch but that didn&#39;t stop our mouths form watering when the folks next to us had their pizza delivered to them. Right then we decided we would be back with our appetites in tow. 
We finally made it back after about a month and we were hungry. We stopped in on a Saturday and the place was PACKED! I think that speaks volumes of not only the food but also the service. 
We met a friend there and we all hunkered down at the bar. Fiorst I have to say that between our two visits the tap list had changed quite a bit. I love that they keep their beer list fresh. And there were some pretty good beers on there, local and out of state. 
Since we were so hungry we decided to order 2 pizzas and an appetizer. We had the three cheese garlic bread to start. Now I have a serious cheese addiciton that really needs to be addressed at every meal and this garlic bread took care of that. It was warm and cheesy, perfect!
For the pizzas we ordered Spicy Italian Sausage and the Scarpone. The Spicy ITalian was good and lived up to its name. The short peppers gave it just enough heat but didn&#39;t melt my face off. 
The Scarpone was my favorite. I probably could have eaten the entire pizza by myself but alas, I had to share. The white sauce was delicious and the giardiniera was a very unique addition that I loved.
There are so many more pizzas to try so we&#39;ll have to go back soon."

It was our first time here. He wanted pizza his birthday, just like he wants everyday. I wanted to go somewhere classier than our typical pizza spot (atomic cowboy!) and Homegrown absolutely met the description.

We were greeted by a very helpful friendly brunette hostess. We were seated in the row of tables, fortunately during most of the meal the table next to us was empty. We each got our pizzas of choice from our super charming waitress Felicity. 

Brian&#39;s pizza was so spicy because the jalapeños on it were raw, but the candied bacon got me excited! My pizza was also awesome, although not much chicken on it and maybe too much garlic for a romantic night haha.

We ended the night with a brownie sundae and Brian blew out the candle, wishing for a new jeep suspension.

For dinner on a Wednesday night around 7 we were seated right away! The space doesn&#39;t have a ton of seating but they fit a lot of people in AND they have a huge patio with heaters and bags (Cornhole). The decor is very rustic with lots of what seems like reclaimed wood and even a couple of old ski chairs for seats!

The service and food was great! Our server was very attentive yet not hovering which is never good. We order the Pete-Za and be ready for some amazing bacon! It&#39;s got ham, candied bacon, pineapple and jalapenos - so yummy! We also ordered some bruschetta (which incidentally came out after our pizza) and that was delicious! I recommend both

The little redheaded bartender is a buzzkill. I&#39;ve given him and this place the benefit of the doubt on several occasions, figuring perhaps he was just having a bad day. 

Today was the last straw. We ordered 5 beers and 5 shots, all incredibly warm. He was too angry to chill the shots even after we asked for them to be chilled #service. The group sitting next to us wound up being gifted the BFF zero dollar bar tab while the group on the other side of us said, yea, this is typically about the beer temperature here. 

Honestly little guy, if you want a job that doesn&#39;t require people skills, go be a mechanic! Its pitiful that we voiced our opinions with multiple members of your staff and no one came over to remedy the situation. Party of five wanting to drink and buy shots and food. 

Wake up call, ownership. We will take our business elsewhere, where the beer is cold and the staff smiles on a beautiful day.

I get that you guys are focused on expanding but the things/idiots that negatively affect the revenue of your existing locations is just as important."

The craft beer selection is ok, but it doesn&#39;t change much. The food in general has gone down hill since they first opened, as has the staff. If you sit at the bar don&#39;t expect better service. The bartenders are more concerned with chatting amongst themselves. Last time we were there it seemed the entire staff was doing shots. 

Overall the food is ok, nothing special but not awful. The ingredients are far from fresh or local.  The pasta dishes seem to be a bit on the heavy side - too much oil and salt. The pizza is bland and not really fresh. 

The atmosphere is best suited for young parents with little kids - think Chucky Cheese meets Old South Gaylord!"

We brought our dog because the large patio seems accommodating to our furry friends. It&#39;s not. Fortunately we were able to snag a table where our pup could hang out outside the rails. We&#39;re happy they made it work for us, but that big patio seems perfect for those of us who bring our dogs out. 

Would be a four star review, but the first time I came and just sat at the bar with a buddy, there were two employees at the bar counting tips (-1 star, always) and the bartender was too enamored with chatting them up to get to us in a prompt manner. The bartender had her back to us, but the one server posting up at the bar made eye contact with us several times and made no effort to call the bartenders attention away.  

Lastly the price we were charged for our wine was more than what was on the menu. I pointed it out to our server who said she would tell the manager. She only sort of offered to fix it since our card had already been rung up. I didn&#39;t really care about the $1 or whatever it was but the response to the issue seemed lukewarm.

The manager was incredibly rude to our group who waited an hour for a table while he seated other groups and eventually he told us &#34;if you don&#39;t like it you can leave&#34;. Nice.

We came in around 3ish and luckily they weren&#39;t busy at all. Maybe its just me but let me start off my saying that the ambience and decor of the restaurant is just wow. Our server was a very nice gentleman named Dorian. He was very knowledgable (since it was my first time there) &amp; had great hair haha. We started of with the Spinach Artichoke Dip as an appetizer.... It was simple yet amazing with the ciabatta. As for the main course, bae ordered the Braised Short Rib Raviolis. It only came with 6 pieces and the bacon garnish was a bit salty but the bae liked it. Dorian recommended for me to order the Sausage and Mushroom Fusilli. It was sooooo GOOD. Sausage had a nice spicy kick to it. Bae kept eating off of my plate!

Good...pizza.

Bad...overcooked luke warm burger...luke warm fries...

Room for improvement...SERVICE! Service was indifferent and slow. Had to ask multiple times for simple things like ketchup and mustard. Our server rarely checked back with us to see if everything was OK. Simply dropped off our food and ran off.

Service in the restaurant business is huge. There are lots and lots of places with good food and funky, comfortable environs. But great service is what will keep me coming back. I want to feel welcomed and appreciated. I can&#39;t stand servers who are arrogant, ignore you and act indifferent.

First-rate customer service is really a very simple thing. I have owned businesses and managed large enterprises. Making the customer feel special and well taken care of is the key to success. It&#39;s simple stuff. I will patronize a divy joint with food that is just OK if the service is friendly and welcoming."

The meatballs were EXCELLENT. Lots of flavor, perfect consistency, and nice size and texture. The tomato sauce was also sooooo delicious. I was completely blown away and satisfied just eating this dish alone. Never thought I could love meatballs and tomato sauce so much!

I would have enjoyed the bruschetta if I had asked for no olives in it (if that is possible). I didn&#39;t realize it came with olives mixed in with the tomatoes, peppers, and balsamic vinegar reduction sauce.

We came here last night because we were pretty excited to find a place that has a lot of good beers on draft right by our house AND pizza. Because who doesn&#39;t want pizza on Friday night. You&#39;ve worked hard all week you deserve it! Was pretty poppin as expected. Ambiance and decor was really cool. Very Coloradoesqe, some tables had ski lifts as chairs. Thought that was great. We had a Caesar to start and the calzone but same ingredients but a pizza instead. Both were bomb. We mentioned that we were splitting the Caesar to start and they brought it already on two plates. Love when places take the time to do spending like that on their own without having to request it. Great service. Great selection of beers. We were kind of difficult customers because we could have sworn we tasted a delicious cream ale in our flight but most of the beers were IPA&#39;s. Bartender even came over to try to assist us. They were very patient, and we decided we were just so high off the delicious pizza that we were delirious. Appreciate the fact that they genuinely tried to help us figure our problem out, and we are pretty embarrassed to be &#34;those people&#34; but what are you gonna do. Overall service was impeccable, food was delicious, tap selection was on point. We will definitely we putting this spot in the rotation!"

We&#39;ve been there 3 times.  We have gotten:

- braised meatballs: always overdone, so kind of rubbery
- brussels: solid
- rigatoni bolognese: tasty, but small for $14 and meat overdone
- roasted beat salad: tasty, but lightly seasoned so very little flavor unless you dump dressing on it
- 2 different pizzas: gluten free crust was nasty, but otherwise fine pizza

Fun local joint, but couch your expectations on the food."

There were a few large TVs playing sports games, but they weren&#39;t so loud that I couldn&#39;t tune them out for the most part. I liked the different seating area options; next time I&#39;ll come with a group so we can sit on the ski lift chairs!

Our food and drinks arrived very quickly. I had a &#34;Mexican hot chocolate stout&#34; ($7) which was really delicious and complex, as was my boyfriend&#39;s pumpkin stout ($7). We got the &#34;Italian works&#34; appetizer, which was really flavorful, balanced, and the potato cubes were the perfect mix of soft and crispy. 

I had the minestrone soup, which was quintessential minestrone, if a bit salty, but very fresh and filling. And the kale salad was very satisfying; highly recommended! I put extra Parmesan and black pepper on everything, but that&#39;s just my personal addiction, I mean preferences. ;) Extra points for having a pepper grinder on every table! My boyfriend had the mushroom fusilli with sausage, and I couldn&#39;t stop reaching over and eating off his plate. 

This place has a lot of unique and flavorful  non-pizza options, although the pizza looked great every time we saw it carried past our table. Some of the dishes portions looked a bit small, but I was super full by the time we left, and had spent about $27, which was reasonable for the diversity and quality of the food ordered.

I could snack on the candied bacon all day. So I think, in my humble opinion, they should bring a side of it, just for those of us who think it&#39;s fab, along with the pete-za. 

Ok, one small complaint--and this won&#39;t prevent me from returning and ordering this amazing pie--- our pizza came somewhat watery in the middle...i hope they cook it more next time. I will be sure to ask.

Unfortunately for us, this is not a pizza (or burger) place that I&#39;d recommend. 

Service was very friendly - no complaints there. But the food. Yikes. We started with the the cheesy garlic bread and it was a pretty good indicator of what was to follow. It was served on cubed French bread that tasted like it had been frozen and reheated in a microwave. And there was zero crunch- very soggy while simultaneously being slightly chewy. It came with a side of marinara that was super watery. It literally had the dripping consistency of water. Then came the Margherita pizza. It was smothered in thick layers of cheese that made it a soggy gross mess in the middle. The dough wasn&#39;t cooked thoroughly and the sauce was - again, quite watery. It didn&#39;t even remotely resemble a true Margherita pizza. The burger we had was serviceable but nothing like a Park Burger which I *think* is also the proprietor here, so that&#39;s weird. It clearly had been a frozen patty so there&#39;s no ability to cook to a requested temp. 
Sorry to be a downer considering how many positive reviews there are here. Maybe it was just a very off day. Too bad for us."

I go back and forth from Denver a lot, and always make it a point to go to park burger when I&#39;m in town.  But because this was a short trip, I had to make the choice of either Park Burger or Homegrown Tap and Dough which I had yet to try.  I figured since they had the same team behind them, I would be in good hands either way.  I could not have been more wrong.

The ambiance was fine, and as a regular Park Burger patron, it seemed very familiar.  That is where the similarities ended.  Whereas after going to multiple locations of Park Burger over the last six years or so and always having above average to phenomenal service, I was taken aback by how disinterested our waiter seemed in being there (though he did an okay job overall).  However, the biggest surprise was the utterly abysmal quality of the food.

My mother and I decided to share the 14 inch Funguy Pizza and an order of the shortrib ravioli.  With the ravioli, we substituted the regular sauce for the truffle alfredo sauce, which thankfully was the best tasting part of the dish.  As the pasta was like $15 or so (about the same cost as a pizza), we figured that, along with a pizza, the dish would be big enough for the two of us to share.  We were wrong...the whole dish consisted of five of six small raviolis smothered in sauce and bacon bits (seriously, not bacon, but what appeared to be manufactured bacon bits...wtf?).  

The pizza, despite looking appetizing on the menu, was not any better.  I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if someone would have told me that it was manufactured elsewhere...and oddly enough, it came utterly drenched in arugula (perhaps to give it a fresher presentation, but it backfired, as there was so much arugala, it was distracting...it literally covered the whole pizza).  Usually we relish the opportunity to eat leftover pizza, but this one was so bad we just threw our leftovers in the trash when we got home.

If I had any advice it would be to fire whoever sources their ingredients and revamp their menu."

We were there in time for HH so we ended up sitting at the bar for drinks and our meal. Bartender/ service was great with recommendations on drink and the menu. 

My friend and I couldn&#39;t get past all the delicious sounding apps, so after a couple recommendations from the bartender we ended up ordering polenta, mushroom arancinis, meatballs and three-cheese garlic bread. The garlic bread wasn&#39;t on our radar until the bartender overheard us trying to decide if we also wanted chicken parm sliders, so he suggested we get the garlic bread and use with the meatballs to make our own meatballs sliders- OMG, best idea ever!!!

The polenta was probably our least favorite, but mostly because it was such a large portion and so rich along with everything else. The mushroom arancinis were decadent. And the meatballs, both in our garlic bread &#34;sliders&#34; and on their own were spectacular! My friend isn&#39;t a huge fan of ground beef and even she was proclaiming their awesomeness.

Great line up of beer taps, and good selection of wine too. Service was prompt and everything was awesome- even the price! It was a cold, blustery day when we were here so we weren&#39;t able to enjoy their awesome looking patio area, but I can tell I will definitely be back to check them out in warm weather, and make next time I&#39;ll order something past the appetizer menu!"

They didn&#39;t seem to care, on the phone, to chat more about my experience but whatever.  I figured I would try this place again because I received a $5 off coupon from my local gym and I believe in giving people and places 2nd chances.  It was no better/no worse.  We even had the same, unfriendly server.  Not being blown away by the pizza last time, we figured why not try the burgers since we know we both love the burgers at the other restaurants.  While I didn&#39;t expect them to be identical, it was obvious that the quality of ingredients was significantly lower.  My bun was stale, the bacon was too chewy and at times hard to really bite into, and the fries were clearly not fresh.  Nothing about it tasted fresh at all, in fact.  And I get it, it&#39;s a pizza place.  Ok, my bad.  But the service remained the same. No one looks happy to work here at all. It&#39;s the service industry - you shouldn&#39;t be in it if you don&#39;t enjoy the part where you are serving people. The table next to us ordered something three times before the server got it correct, our server was not friendly at all, and we waited 20 minutes after only half finishing our meal (and I was starving when we had arrived) before going up to the bar to pay the bill.  I didn&#39;t mention the service until after he rang me up.  I didn&#39;t expect a discount.  I expect good service and decent food for $50 bucks.  Especially given that ALL of the other restaurants owned by this guy have impeccable service and food.  I won&#39;t be going back here.  If I get another gift card through the gym, I&#39;ll just decline.

A tad salty but I&#39;m more effected than most. The service was abysmal. It took too long for the host to come around and he really seemed like he couldn&#39;t be bothered. Our server was pleasant but unprepared. He didn&#39;t know what seasonal beers were available. It&#39;s a tap house, come on! We order our drinks and they are out of the cucumber vodka. We re-ordered beverages and after they arrive we wait a solid five minutes. I know it was five minutes before he returned because we set a timer for five minutes that if he wasn&#39;t back before then we&#39;d pay out and leave. He came back with four seconds to spare. Order our food and an appetizer. He asks if we want the appetizer first, we said yes. Our food comes out first. I asked to cancel the appetizer and at the same time my companion asks for another beer. The glass had been sitting empty and deliberately placed in plain sight. We still had to ask. He walks away before I can order another cocktail. That&#39;s when I crossed into pissed off. A busy night is not a bad problem for a server to have but the point is, he made his problem my problem and I don&#39;t appreciate it. Two stars for food only. Zero stars for service."

It was crowded when we arrived, lots of people eating outside. They had a corn hole area for the kids to play and a nice beautiful garden outside. They also had ample bike racks. 
There was over 30 minute wait so we sat and relaxed for a while well we waited for table. 
The inside of the places just as beautiful as the outside. They had many different seating arrangements from two seaters to swinging benches that hang from the ceiling. It was unique look. 
The menu had a lot of salad pasta and pizza choices. Lots of the pizzas came with white or garlic sauce but if you ask They will swap out red for you. 
They also had a large drink menu. A good amount of wines and lots of different beers. They even had a Colorado cider that was right up my alley. 
They also have a juice bar in the place. Beware, it closes before dinner. Don&#39;t come here for dinner expecting a fresh squeezed juice. Hit it up for lunch if that&#39;s your MO. 
Unfortunately we waited forever for everything. They didn&#39;t come to take our order, after 10-15 minutes we had to flag someone down. They didn&#39;t even bring out our drink orders for 20 minutes or so. We waited so long for the food we were almost ready to leave. The waiter was very apologetic, and comped our drinks for the wait. He also brought us garlic bread on the house. That was a nice touch, but we were still hungry, waiting.  
The food was good but it was quite marred by the untimeliness of the events. The pizza had good crust, but none of the flavors wowed me. I got a pizza with pancetta and it was good, but was overly salty. The flavors just weren&#39;t balanced. 
My friend got their funguy pizza. Their garlic sauce was good, but again, the toppings didn&#39;t stand the test of time. 
My other friend ordered the bolognese, and she wasn&#39;t happy. It was too al Dente for her taste.  
Overall this is a cool place and it looks really nice but the food just isn&#39;t spectacular. If I&#39;m going to wait so so so long for food, it better be banging. And it wasn&#39;t."

Monday is the best, they have half off selected wines all night and it is so worth it.

The atmosphere is great and you really feel like you are eating in a locally inspired restaurant. During my visits, I have tried the pizza, pasta, and almost every appetizer and have more than enjoyed each of them. The food is fresh and made with quality ingredients by quality chefs. 

The only reason I wouldn&#39;t give 5 stars is based on the service. They seem to be understaffed most of the time. I imagine this is due to the lack of space in the restaurant as they probably do not want to overcrowd with kitchen and wait staff. Either way, every time I have been here, the staff seems stressed and overwhelmed, which rubs off on the customers.

All together this is a great restaurant in a great location with a great atmosphere. I would recommend it to anyone in the Wash Park area."

I ordered the burger, which is a weird choice at a pizza place. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the cheese on it but beyond that it was really good and flavorful. The truffle fries that came with it definitely made the meal. I tasted a friends margarita pizza, which was really good.
I feel like the size of the pizza for the price is super reasonable, especially for Denver."

The inside is nicely set up and decorated and the outside area is great and spacious with fire pits and nice seating. The pizzas are great and pretty big for the price. The dough is great, not too thick, not too thin, tasty and crunchy. And also their beer selection has something for everybody.

Drink:  the beer selection is good, but not overwhelming. Something to please everyone, and things you maybe haven&#39;t seen before, but not so long that you&#39;re left scratching your head.  They also have a decent wine list - again, enough to make most everyone happy, but manageable. Overall: everything you need, and nothing you don&#39;t. 

Food: The pizza is good. Inventive choices, including some that will remind you of the burger offerings over at Park Burger (their sister restaurant). As has been mentioned, they get it right on the crust - just the right amount of thin without it being a straight up tastes-like-air cracker. There is also one burger on the menu and, as one might expect, it&#39;s great. They also serve Little Man on their dessert menu (alongside other things), so that&#39;s an added bonus if you like their ice cream. One issue with the pizza is that, although the crust and toppings were good, it felt like it was missing that one last bit of awesomeness that my favorite pizza tends to have. I would describe it as good, maybe even very good, but probably not great.

Service: Both times, my waitress was kind and helpful. She didn&#39;t blow our expectations out of the water, but she took our orders promptly, checked in at the right times, ect. No complaints, but also no rave reviews. 

Decor/Atmosphere: Really like the feel of the place inside. Warm, inviting atmosphere with an appropriate, but not obnoxious, level of rustic Coloradoness. Exposed brick, wood slab tables, a couple of hanging ski lifts as high-top chair replacements. Big exposed pizza oven by the bar. My only small gripe is that the tables are a tad too close in places, making it difficult to hold a private conversation, or even get in and out to go to the bathroom without annoying the table next to you. 

Overall, I will definitely be back. It is a solid, low key, go-to type of place. It might never completely blow you away, but it will never disappoint either."

I&#39;ve been really impressed by their food.  I&#39;ve ordered the summer salad (spaghetti squash), the beet salad, a quinoa dish (which I don&#39;t think they have anymore) and tasted a bunch of the pizzas.  We also got the zucchini fritters last night which were absolutely delicious.    The prices are great for the quality of food you get.  The anbiance is a litle loud...it seems like a lot of people bring their kids here.  I will say though, I&#39;m not giving them 5 stars because the service is pretty spotty.  We were in last night and our server just seemed incredibly rushed, which made it hard to order anything because she would always ask a question and then run off.  Just didn&#39;t seem very genuinely interested in how dinner went for us.  The last time we were here we waited about 10 minutes before anyone came to the table and then the server came out and gave us some sob story about how busy they had been blah blah blah.  Wasn&#39;t really much of an apology, mostly just an excuse and kind of a &#39;deal with it&#39; attitude.  So, we love the food so we like to stop by and eat, but I wouldn&#39;t expect too much in the area of service."

That&#39;s right, homemade pita bread.  I came with a vegan co-worker and even she was able to enjoy the falafel sandwich.  The sandwich first starts with the aforementioned homemade pita bread.  It is soft and wonderful; full of flavor.  Then a layer of hummus covers the bread, then pickled turnips, falafel and lettuce.  The whole combination, particularly the pickled turnips makes for an absolutely delightful experience.  The sour component of the turnips helps to cut through the fatty fried falafel and rich hummus.  For a side I got my beloved baba ganoush.  This wasn&#39;t the best baba ganoush I&#39;ve had but it was pretty darn close.  

A little slice of baklava was meant to be the finish to this wonderful experience but I ended up eating it as my appetizer.  Regardless of what point of the meal you consume it in, it was exactly as I like my baklava.  Sweet, but not overly sweet and without the rose water essence which isn&#39;t my thing.  Just pure walnuts, honey and phyllo dough heaven.  And also a huge bonus to the experience was the wonderful and friendly owner.  He could not have been nicer and I am happy to support him time and time again."

The food was spectacular! I love trying new foods and hadn&#39;t ever tried a falafel or shawarma so I got both. I only wish I lived in Denver all the time to enjoy FelFel more often. If I ever come back to Denver, I&#39;m coming here for sure!"

The outside appearance is so so but there are plenty of seating both inside and outside. I would recommend getting the plate. I got the chicken shawarma plate with brown rice, spicy hummus with pita bread, and vegetable salad. I also got a grape leaves on the side. 

I really enjoyed the chicken shawarma. Though it was kind of dry, I poured the spicy sauce on it and it really added moisture and flavor. The rice was special too it had some seasoning that made it taste better than just plain brown rice. The hummus had a big glob of jalapenos so beware because it can get spicy! Eat at your discretion. The vegetable salad was really good with cauliflower and potato that were roasted and flavored with red spices. I&#39;ve never tried grape leaves before and I actually really liked it! It seemed weird eating a piece of leaf but this was good it was soft and the rice wrapped inside was very flavorful. 

I recommend this place if you&#39;re in the area and craving Mediterranean cuisine."

I was impressed though, that Fel Fel made it a point to provide great service. I was greeted warmly and asked if I had been in before.

Much like a Chipotle, you&#39;re served at the counter and you select your base (wrap, plate, etc), choose your protein, choose your fillings, and choose your sides.  Most options are under $10.

The Boy and I wandered in on a whim. We&#39;d just eaten, so we were looking for a small snack.  A very nice lady (the owner, I think) approached us and explained how the ordering system worked.  We ended up getting some spicy hummus (it was regular hummus topped with fresh jalapenos), an order of pita, and some grape leaves.  Even though this was a tiny order - $4, the owner threw in some free falafel for us.  We ogled the chicken, beef, and lamb shawarma rotisseries while we looked over the offering, agreeing we&#39;d have to come back to try those.

We&#39;ve been spoiled by some pretty incredible middle eastern restaurants, so it was difficult to compare the food here, but we agreed that if we hadn&#39;t been to places like Beirut Grill, we&#39;d have found the food at FelFel to be very good.  The pita was made fresh, which is always a bonus, and the falafel was amongst the best I&#39;ve tried. The grapes leaves and hummus were so-so.  No bad, but not comparable to the amazing offerings we&#39;d had elsewhere.

Overall, this is a great concept for fast-casual Mediterranean food.  While it&#39;s not the best ever, it&#39;s quite good and worth the occasional visit for sure."

I&#39;ve driven past FelFel a hundred times, but finally had the opportunity to check in. So glad I did! Ordered gyro wrap with some fries, and sat at the window bar to eat. It was excellent, some of the best Mediterranean food I&#39;ve had in the DTC area. I&#39;ll drive out of my way for this place now! 

It was very busy during the lunch rush hour, so you&#39;ll definitely have to plan for a bit of wait. Trust me though, well, well worth it. I&#39;m eager to try some of their other dishes because I highly doubt they will disappoint."

I also added lentil soup ($2), which was OK but not exciting. With my drink ($2), the total was $16, plus tax/tip. Food is delish. Falafels are crispy, and not super spicy. I have the spicy hummus, which was good, but next time I would probably try the baba ghanouj instead. The homemade pita was soft and warm, the food came quick and the service was great.

I ordered the Steak Sharma and it was bursting with flavor my taste buds went on a wild rampage it was awesome. My salad&#39;s were hummus, tabula, baba-ganoush. My dish was served with a homemade piece of pita. The rice definitely needs improvement it is just plain American rice it should be Basmati hopefully in the future they will switch it over. The atmosphere was clean and pristine this place definitely has potential I foresee it being around for many years to come. It would also be nice to have an enclosed patio, living here in Colorado do to we have so much snow and bad weather with lots of just cold days. There is ample parking so I don&#39;t see that ever being an issue, the location is very easily accessible. The portions fit the price, (but if the portions were any smaller) they would not . I really enjoyed my visit today the staff is very nice very professional. I do hope in the future they have more Middle Eastern drinks such as the  yogurt drink ,the mango yogurt drink, the mint yogurt drink, but only if they are homemade. And also to expand their menu to more Middle Eastern Foods  such as Bryani  &amp; Kabsa, Munsuf. It is nice to see something in the (Tamarac area) next to Microcenter and 7-Eleven.

Their signature lamb kabob is single handling the best piece of protein I have eaten in the state of Colorado. Do yourself a favor, and stop reading this review and go eat there. Don&#39;t forget to get some baklava on your way out as it is the only way to end your meal at FelFel. 

For anyone looking for high quality catering please look no further. I got our office manager to bring this in for catering once, and we have now eaten it a dozen times. The owner is already one of the most friendly people you will meet, but once he forgot to drop off the pita with the order he then came back and served our 100 person office pita by walking around our cafe and handing out the pita one by one to our employees.

I&#39;ve passed this place more times than I can recall and now regret not having stopped in sooner.

First, the owner, is such a kind and caring man. From the moment we walked in he treated us as if we were the only people in the establishment. This despite there being a handful of people. He truly cares for his customers and it shows.

The food here is as good as the customer service. And that says a lot. The hummus is nothing short of smooth and creamy goodness! Perfectly seasoned. The babaganoush and the tzatziki sauce were also phenomenal, and I&#39;m not a huge fan of spicy foods. The meats (Lamb, Chicken) were superbly tender and not over cooked at all. 

The portions are more than filling (I didn&#39;t get my girlish figure by skimping on the portions) and I often have enough left over for either a late night meal or for lunch at work the next day. So, you shouldn&#39;t leave here hungry.

The location is convenient and the place itself very clean.

If you enjoy great tasting Mediterranean food you owe it to yourself to make a visit here. With fall lurking around the corner this is a great place to have a bite on their patio and enjoy the warm Colorado sun and pleasantly cool temps.

Highly recommended!"

The chicken shawarma was very tasty, especially with the tzatziki sauce and hot sauce smothered over it. The rice was also very good and I usually don&#39;t care for it. The babaganoush was one of the best I&#39;d had in a long while, and spicy hummus was on point. The warm, fresh pita along side sealed the deal. Can&#39;t wait to come back! 

PS- The owner was very nice (and not at all creepy like some other rude reviewer said). I had about a 5 minute wait to pick up my online order (no biggie, it was a big order) and he kept me posted the whole time about the eta.

The owner and all of the employees were all smiles as soon as we walked in, with very genuine greetings of &#34;How are you?&#34; and &#34;We&#39;re so glad you&#39;re here!&#34; The owner/manager (I assume) talked to us briefly about their mission to use grass-fed, humanely raised meats and fresh vegetables, and told us that everything going into their savory lunch/dinner options is cooked on-site. I might add here that it smelled delicious as soon as we&#39;d walked in, so I had no reason to doubt him.

We ordered two sandwiches: a chicken shawarma pita and a beef shawarma lavach (wrap), as well as two pieces of baklava for dessert. The owner/manager also offered us two falafels for free to taste, since it was our first time in the restaurant, which I thought was very generous.

Everything was delicious. Let me repeat that, so you understand how strongly I feel about their food: EVERYTHING was delicious. The meats were tender and flavor-packed, the wrap and pita warm, the veggies seasoned well and well-proportioned in the sandwiches to the meat. The falafels were possibly the best that I&#39;ve ever had. The baklava (which is also made on-site) was a fantastic end to the meal, and we went back up to get extra to take home.

From start to finish, my experience here was excellent. I&#39;ve tried a few other shawarma/gyro/falafel places in the area, and none of them even compare. So happy to have found my go-to Mediterranean spot!"

FelFel completely turned this series of unfortunate eats around. 

I have come here with my partner several times now and always leave incredibly satisfied. Esmail (the CEO) was friendly right off the bat and radiated a  warm, welcoming presence. We ordered the beef and chicken shawarmas, both of which were spectacular. Esmail also threw in a couple free falafels since it was our first time in; they were amazing. Some falafels are just too dense and dry for me to eat more than one, but these were fresh, warm, tasty and light. We ended with the homemade baklava, which is hands down my favorite dessert, and I have to try it everywhere we go that serves it. Their take on it was just as delicious as all the food we had just eaten. You could taste the honey and feel each layer of the crunchy phyllo dough when you bite into it. 

We have come back since, and the customer service from everyone working there and the food we have eaten is stellar. I will keep coming back."

I&#39;m also not a huge fan of the flags and balloons they usually have outside...but I guess none of that matters since it turned out to be great! The inside is really nice, clean, and bright with a setup similar to a Garbanzo&#39;s (pick a plate, salad, wrap, etc. then pick your protein, salads, and sides) and a big TV to watch. The vast array of choices impressed me the most...for example, they had about 8 types of salad to choose from - pasta salad, greek, cauliflower/potato, etc. I tried the greek which was very classic and done well; the cauliflower/potato was also amazing and quite unique. My falafel plate was huge and both plates came with warm pita bread, rice salad, and hummus (get the spicy!).

Ordered the chicken schwarma sandwich, with lentil soup and fatoush salad.  Great portions for the money.  However, I know this is my fault but I assumed the sandwich would be with the traditional pita.  Instead, it was in a tortilla wrap.  I was so disappointed because I had read the raves about the homemade pita here.  It was soggy and hard to eat.  The salad was good but missing the fried pita bread that is in a traditional fatoush salad?  The soup was lacking in flavor.

I ordered the falafel plate - and right now I&#39;m trying to lower my carb intake and so I asked if I could get my plate without rice and replace it with salad - the girl at the register said that no, but I could order another side of salad if I wanted to - so I had to pay for it (full price, not an extra charge) which is whatever, I guess. Other Mediterranean restaurants in the area have no problem making this substitution for free.

First, the good: the falafel were good - they were perfectly crisp on the outside, with a soft, fluffy center - and they had some flavour. The pita was fresh - it appears they bake it there, and was pillowy and soft - even if I could only eat a little of it. The Mediterranean salad (Jerusalem salad) was pretty good as well, and well-dressed.

On the meh side were the tabbouleh (which had nearly no bulgur and was very soupy and wet), the fattoush, which was fine but didn&#39;t have any bits of toasted bread in it and was kind of lacking in flavour, and the spicy hummus - which was grainy and needed a -lot- more tahini. I like my hummus to be smooth and creamy - this hummus was really just mushed up chickpeas. It tasted fine, but the texture was not appealing to me. 

My boyfriend ordered the chicken shawarma wrap with split pea soup and a side of Mediterranean salad - between the two of us the meal was pretty expensive (since I was charged for extra salad and I ordered a side of hummus) for a counter service meal - I pay less at other Mediterranean restaurants for a larger/more varied portion of food.

My food was edible, certainly - but I wish that there was hot sauce or toum (garlic sauce) available (I didn&#39;t see it on the menu, nor was it offered by the cashier), as everything seemed a bit underseasoned? I also saw kabees (those hot pink pickled turnips) on the photos of the food on the screens, but there were no kabees on my plate, sadly. The staff were friendly, but the food just didn&#39;t do it for me, unfortunately - I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d return."

I will say the falafel and baklava are legitimately good, as is the spicy hummus, and the salads looked good as well. The falafel especially is worth mentioning as it is nicely seasoned and nicely cooked compared to most of what I have had around Denver. 

Overall, everything needs a little more salt but several of the dishes had specific issues. The rice, which there is no shortage of, is pretty bland. Kind of like uncle bens rice. When rice is the most plentiful item on your plate it should be high quality, seasoned well, and maybe have some fresh herbs and citrus. The chicken and beef shwarmas are both a little dry but the chicken one at least tastes pretty nice. The beef I did not care for as much. 

The pita bread is a divisive subject. On the one hand it is lite and fresh but on the other it isn&#39;t the same as most pita bread. Most places do not have fresh house made pita, but the pita seems more leavened than it should be and is overall a bit odd. Not to be snobbish but I don&#39;t meant that this isn&#39;t the bought-in, bagged pita bread I am used to but is different than anything I have eaten anywhere, including Jordan and a couple of other middle eastern countries I have been fortunate enough to visit. Anyway, it&#39;s fresh but a little unusual. 

A lot of criticisms so let&#39;s end on some positives other than the price. Everything comes with a sauce so you don&#39;t have to pay extra for hot sauce. Service is quick and friendly. The restaurant looks clean and the salad on display as you walk up looks good. 

The restaurant has a chain feel to it but is not a chain and I think is just more polished than anything. Though, the lack of any homemade drinks or iced tea and the large selection of bought in desserts add to this chain feel and are a bit of a turn off for me. I would honestly rather just have baklava and a mint iced tea option. They can keep the soda fountain and pre packaged desserts."

When the staff or management of an establishment decides to attack a reviewer and criticize irrelevant aspects of a review (for example, grammar), it only further proves that this business has no idea where the fault lies.  It also shows their approach to criticism.   I would not suggest telling them then and there that their chicken is mostly cartilage as they might go to the back of the place, call you stupid and spit in your food.  That is exactly the type of behavior I would expect from a &#34;restaurant&#34; that thinks it is ok to bash reviewers.   Sorry fel fel, but if you don&#39;t like what people have to say, maybe it is time to reflect inward.  As a place of business this should have been your opportunity to take the high road, but instead you have publicized the very attitude and lack of professionality that incited my first review.  This place used to be good.  It has changed. Everything I said in my first review is based on real experiences eating from this establishment.  I hope the owner doesn&#39;t grade my review again but hopefully my grammar is better this time just in case.  Oh no, I ended my sentence in a cliché, he may take off points for that.  No matter how many sentence fragments were in my original review, I will not go back here.  This is because twice in a row, I was given chicken that had a piece of cartilage in almost every bite.  And insulting my ability to count does not make them look any better either.  I may not be a genius but I know four pieces of lamb when I see them.  I also know when something is cooked fresh versus being reheated.

Save yourself the awkward experience and go to Yanis instead.  It is near by and much better Mediterranean food than this.  Oh and I bet their owner doesn&#39;t insult their yelp reviewers.   Anyone writing a review is a reviewer whether positive or negative.   If you are going to respond to a review,  at least respond to the actual complaints rather than attempting to insult the intelligence of your customers. 

Original review below:

DO NOT EAT HERE!  $14 for 4 small pieces of overcooked lamb.  Sometimes you get hummus with your hummus plate, sometimes you get lettuce.   The menu and ordering process is a mess.  It is a gamble what you get.  The staff and owners don&#39;t even know how to explain it.  Just try asking.   Chicken was nothing but cartilage.   Gross chewy overcooked mess.  We asked for garlic instead of tahini and we got extra tahini only.  It is as if they don&#39;t even listen while you order and just make up in their head what they think you might want. No consistency.  Low quality.   Overpriced.   Spend your money elsewhere."

Today I ordered online falafel sandwich and side of baba ghanoush. Amazing!! So fresh and delicious. Maybe the yummiest baba ghanoush I&#39;ve had. The only bad part is the deserts in the counter are so beautiful and look so good. I&#39;m gonna ruin my diet!! I hope this place does well because I need them to stay around!!!

First I walk in and am greeted by the owner as if I&#39;m a close friend. He even gave us free falafels and baklava. Yes, stuff my face with more food, this is the way to my soul.

I ordered the lamb and chicken shawarma platter and it was the most amazing Greek food I have ever had, even though prior to this night I was a shawarma virgin. Shawarma is a rack of seasoned meet they cut and grill fresh when you order. On my monstrous platter was spicy hummus, Greek salad, a huge pillowy warm pita, and brown rice. All amazing. The meat was seasoned to perfection. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to choose between the lamb and the chicken- thank goodness the staff is so understanding about this predicament and let me order a mixture of both.

The falafel and baklava weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but they were free anyway so who cares. I paid for the shawarma and boy did I enjoy the shawarma. Come for the shawarma. Let me just say it one more time: shawarma."

My only complaint is that the staff isn&#39;t terribly flexible in accommodating special requests; instead they try to upsell you.  At Garbanzo&#39;s I can get 1/2 meat and 1/2 falafel with my combo plate.  At Fel Fel, that isn&#39;t an option.  You have to get one and then you have the option to add - for a fee.  They also charge for additional sauces -- tzaziki for example.  That&#39;s more an irritation though because I keep going back for more!"

I&#39;ve had amazing Shwarma and Mediterranean food while living in Miami and I was excited to try this place as it had such high reviews.

The owner was very nice I have to say, and even gave me a piece of Baklavah while I was waiting for my bf to meet me. 

I tried the Chicken Shwarma with a side of Tabbouleh. The sandwich was decent overall but it needed a little more salt or a delicious garlicy sauce...just something! Compared to other shwarma that I&#39;ve had, this fell just a little flat. I also didn&#39;t like the fact that I couldn&#39;t make my sandwich how I wanted, rather it was a set menu item that already came with certain toppings. I personally like to customize my shwarma.

The Tabbouleh was also just ok, it was fresh but it had a bitter after taste that I didn&#39;t particularly enjoy.

The one thing my BF and I really liked was the Falafel. It was fresh and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside! For the price, 2 for $1 you can&#39;t go wrong, but I wanted something to dip it in!

Clean restaurant, nice staff and owner, but I need more flavor!!"

We ordered the Beef Shawarma, Chicken Shawarma, and Kofta Kebaob plates.  They were all delicious, but I&#39;d say the Chicken was really amazing.  Food isn&#39;t salty at all.

The Hummus was fantastic, especially with the warm and soft Pita.  Wife loved the Spinach side salad.  The rice was also tasty.

I think the portion size is just right.  However, If you like a lot of meat, then I&#39;d suggest you upgrade you entree for 2 bucks."

So I went into the place unaware.  My wife and I love good falafel  and other Mediterranean food. Yet we have been let down - several times

The competition - firedough opened near our house (south of arapahoe) and though decent the chicken was dry, the falafel made you cough as dust peppered your throat, and their service was awful.


very few complaints about FelFel.  For one, the service is always awesome and they are great for yelpers. Always check-in, you might get something!

They have both platters and wraps.  By wraps, I don&#39;t know how authentic. Its like a flour tortilla wrapped with your favorite shawarma.  Good. . .but feels cheap.  I would love pita sandwiches a LOT MORE.  The platters are better, as some have mentioned.  Nice warm pita. . just fills more in style.

The shawarma and the falafel is moist and delicious.  The choice of sauces (I normally do the cucumber yogurt) sounds delicious - i wish i could get a sample of all.

Fries are pretty good (which is always nice) and self-service on the cokes and sodas.  


I have been back several times . .and they also have kids specials on Sundays.  As long as the service is friendly, i&#39;ll be back."

First experience was for a 12 person work lunch. Everyone ordered separately and I pre-ordered in advance so that it could be delivered by a specific time (which was before they actually opened). The owner, Ishmiel, delivered the food himself. He was so accommodating and followed up up me me afterwards to make sure everything was to our liking. 

Second experience was lunch (buffet style) for several hundred people. This was their largest catering event and they were really on it. They came with a team to deliver our food and even made a second trip for the beef, chicken and more falafel because they didn&#39;t want it all to get cold. 

Everything was amazing! We had great feedback from our group and since they make everything fresh, the taste is authentic and packs a wallop of flavor. Their pita are like big fluffy pillows of awesome-ness, their babaganoush is incredible and the falafel is delish with the right texture and consistency. Felfel is the real deal. 

Warning - their garlic sauce is addicting. I had visions of slathering it on everything I eat for the next week. I know my husband isn&#39;t excited by my new found obsession but my taste buds are!"

We ordered the falafel wrap and lamb wrap and both were excellent.  So many times falafel is dry and this is so tender and flavorful, and I also loved all the veges that were in the wrap.   I tasted my lunch partner&#39;s lamb wrap and it was so good too.  The fries that came with the wraps were a perfect amount.

I was also impressed by the service.  From the cashier to the people picking up empty plates, all asked how everything tasted.  The owner even stopped by our table personally to ask how everything was - he even brought us out extra tzatziki sauce when we asked.

The service both times has been great in the sense they are patient and helpful explaining if it is your first time and also friendly when checking back in throughout your meal. 
Both the food and service are solid and consistent. They do tend to get very busy during lunch as I&#39;ve been there at lunch each time and the place was full."

They all sucked. I&#39;ve grown up in the middle east so trust me when I say it sucked. Even hummus,  baba ganoush n basic Mediterranean dishes that make the basis of a good Mediterranean sucked outright bad.

I prefer Lamb, spicy hummus and falafel balls when I go.  The lamb is baked in such a way that the taste of lamb pervades the entire loaf.  No bite of this lamb is a disappointment.

Your dish will typically come with some kind of hummus (or even an additional one) for dipping of the pita bread.   Also very good and authentic.   You will get enough pita bread for 1, and at $1 per 2 loaves, I recommend ordering 1 additional pita bread for each person you bring.

The soups have never disappointed me, all of the ingredients seem to be fresh and all the soups I&#39;ve tried have been great.

Coming here has become the thing to do after any run to Micro center.   Its hard not to eat here again if you&#39;ve done so at least once.  The proprietor is friendly, involved, engaged and remembers his regulars.   No risk of an ABC experience here.

I&#34;m sure not all the dishes are for everyone but there will be something here you will like and come back over and over for.   All the food feels healthy going down.  Eating here is a good habit to have."

The owner asked if it was my first time in, and since it was, he took time to explain the menu and make suggestions. Such friendliness and hospitality! He included free falafel to try, which was wonderful. The hummus was yummy too. We also had a lemony, creamy cake with blueberries for dessert that was to die for! I will definitely be stopping by here again when I&#39;m in the area."

It is always consistently delicious and delivered with grace and class.  Stoic and Genuine was our latest restaurant of hers to try.  With it being in Union Station and parking tight in this area, we took a Lift in and it worked well.

The setting feels as if you are in a seaside restaurant and perhaps the ocean is just around the corner.  We stumbled on all day happy hour which I love when restaurants do that.  I sampled each of the happy hour oysters.  They were wonderful except for a little piece of shell that I found in one.

The cocktail menu was wonderful and both my husband and I ordered off that instead of the happy hour.  Mine was a spiced pear and vodka cocktail that was divine.  My husband had a whisky cocktail that he was also happy with.

For the mains, he chose the fish and chips and I went with the paella.  The fish and chips advertised thrice fried chips which were not the crispy delight we were expecting.  That was really the only miss of the meal.  But the fish was incredibly flaky with a lovely beer batter crust.  He didn&#39;t care for the mint in the mushy peas but I did and had the great fortune of getting to eat it.

My paella was a spin off on the classic.  It was more of a light stew with perfectly cooked pieces of fish floating in a broth with two triangles of saffron rice fried in a cake.  It was very very good.  With that being said, if people are expecting the classic rice dish, they might be disappointed.  I ordered two cornbread sticks to help soak up the sauce and those were perfect too.

My husband finished his meal with the warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream.  The apple pie was delicate, yet rich with flavor and a perfect example of what apple pie can be!"

Husband and I ordered 12 oysters, half lobster, chilled king crab legs and two bloody marys. For what we received it was too pricey. The half lobster felt like it was the size of a crawfish. The oysters were $3.50 - $4.00. I felt like I&#39;ve paid less for cleaner oysters. 
Bloody Mary&#39;s were spicy but nothing special.

The stars are for the service. They had brought steamed crab legs and quickly corrected themselves."

I&#39;ve been before, but we only had drinks so I wanted to get back to check out what everyone was raving about.  

Everything with our order moved really quickly, borderline rushed, and we were here for a business dinner so the rush wasn&#39;t exactly great, and there didn&#39;t seem to be a wait for our table.  

Presentation is one thing they do REALLY well.  The appetizers had impressive presentation, though some dishes seemed lacking a little taste, but the octopus was really unique and tasty, which if it weren&#39;t for the recommendation from the server, I would have skipped, but it was the best app we had. I found the rolls to be way too dry, seeming like they were a few days old, and not up to the quality of the other food.  Our table tried a variety of their specialty cocktails &amp; the &#34;you had me at hello&#34; was fantastic.  The drinks all had great presentation too &amp; everyone liked their drinks and entrees, with the exception to the crispy whole haddock which is probably good for people who don&#39;t mind their food looking at them.  The stone bass with wontons and kimchi brussels was really great.  

Outside of the rushed feel, it&#39;s still a top place to check out at least once, though I didn&#39;t feel super wowed to be in a hurry to come back.   Judging from the other patrons, it seems to be a popular date spot, so with the rush, probably better for dates than business dinners."

This was our 14th wedding anniversary and S&amp;G kind of missed the mark. The staff was great, very kind and excited to help us celebrate. However the food was a little underwhelming.

We started with the Ceviche Granita Parfait. It sounded great but lacked notable qualities. It just came across as bland. We also ordered the Fritto Misto, this one knocked it out of the park. We also had a few oysters which were delicious when accompanied by the creative granitas.

For our entrees, my wife ordered the Seared Hawaiian Gamefish and me the Whole Striped Bass. The Gamefish was bacon wrapped but the fish was dry as it could be, she could not enjoy this. (Edit: She ordered the Seared Hawaiian Gamefish however when I uploaded the photos I realized she received the Prosciutto Melon Halibut, either way it wasn&#39;t great) When I ordered the whole bass I asked the waitress how user friendly this was because I wanted to spend time with my wife not working away on a meal. She said it&#39;s pretty user friendly so that&#39;s what I went with. Turns out this was quite a bit of work for not very much reward. The fish was not very tasty and it was full of bones that I could not navigate around. I can&#39;t fault them for my inexperience in tackling a whole fish but I did ask first. 

To finish we ordered the Banana Bread Pudding Ice Cream Sandwich which was amazing. We also had the special which was a coconut cream pie which did not meet the mark.

So all in all about 50% of our meal was amazing, the other 50% was not. In the future I think I&#39;ll stick to some of the other Chef Jen restaurants.

One other tip, don&#39;t set anything down you don&#39;t want to disappear. The staff will remove anything from your table that you are not actively eating or drinking. This was rather frustrating after we had ordered a few oysters and several granitas. The minute the last oyster was gone the entire plate was whisked away. We had planned to order more since we had all these great granitas but before we saw our waitress it was all over."

Definitely not a cheap night, but a tasty night!
Started with the lobster bisque - and they do this cool thing where they will pre-split items in the kitchen. 

The lobster bisque - omg...  oh, my, gerd....

Next up was the bass. And we also got the paella. Another pre-split dish - very interesting way to interpret the dish - the rice isn&#39;t below - it&#39;s presented as a rice cake. So - pro-tip - order a side of bread to sop up all that good sauce!

The sea bass was displayed as one dish - and was it delicious! It should have been eaten first, as the flavor was amazing, but was over powered a bit by the paella.

The deserts seemed a bit weird, so we skipped it.

The outside seating was lovely, and as the sun set, the setting was amazing!"

Union station itself is a pretty cool venue within itself. We just stumbled into stoic and genuine for a quick drink prior to our dinner reservation. They were all booked but we found a seat at the bar, which you&#39;re allowed to order dinner at. 

Both the drinks we got were delicious and the presentation of each was also great. Classy, with a twist, but not overdone. We each got a small appetizer plate; I got the 3-way cauliflower and he got the potato salad. I tried it without the bacon pieces and wasn&#39;t too impressed, however my boyfriend tried it with the bacon and said it was fabulous. The 3-way cauliflower was good, however I don&#39;t think I would order it again. I enjoyed the mashed cauliflower portion and thought it was absolutely delicious - a much healthier and lighter alternative to mashed potatoes. Besides that, I thought the dish was slightly bland. Would have appreciated some sort of sauce or spice to the dish. 

I&#39;m giving this place 3-stars essentially for the customer service, the drinks and presentation for the food. For the food itself, I&#39;d give it 2 stars (however I only tried 2 items)"

As usual, Yelp would be our saving grace to help when it came to tracking down a spot for lunch. Stoic &amp; Genuine had mixed reviews but a majority were favorable so we had to come and check it out.

Stoic &amp; Genuine is not easy to find. It is located on the corner of Wynkoop St and 17th St in the heart of Downtown Denver. It should be stated that the restaurant is inside of Union Station, away from the food court. You&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re walking around in circles because the address doesn&#39;t make it clear as to where it is located.

The restaurant is very small and will not accommodate large crowds at one time. A small bar is near the entrance and serval tables line the wall along with a corduroy couch that is like a long bench seat. Modern decor gives Stoic &amp; Genuine a hip look. Thin wood beams intersect one another along the ceiling and they give the restaurant more character. 

Upon being seated, we were greeted by the most awesome waiter ever, Kael! He didn&#39;t miss a beat and accommodated my unique dietary habits. I wanted grilled shrimp but the salad had some vegetables that I didn&#39;t like. So he made some suggestions and told me not to worry about my order as everyone likes things prepared a certain way. Therefore, I got my grilled shrimp on a bed of arugula sprinkled with some olive oil, salt, and pepper. The fries are usually prepared with a spicy seasoning but Kael made sure that they didn&#39;t make it too spicy. My fiancé still wanted that extra kick to the fries so they said that they&#39;d bring out a side of spice for him.

What I thought was quite interesting was that they don&#39;t serve a lot of store-bought sodas. They make most of their sodas in-house. If you&#39;re looking for something different, you could get a strawberry, cantaloupe, vanilla, and something called squirty soda. I ordered the strawberry soda and it looked nothing like the kind that you find in the store. It was orange in color and resembled an alcoholic drink. When I took my first sip, I was puzzled. It seemed to be made with real strawberry juice and had a hint of lime in it. Honesty, I&#39;ve never tasted anything like this before. The website states that their sodas have vodka in them but I did not know it at the time.

When our food arrived, I was excited to dig in! I could tell that the arugula was fresh and the shrimp sprinkled throughout the greenery added extra flavor to the entire meal. The shrimp was soft in texture and perfectly sprinkled with salt and pepper to give it enough flavor without being overpowering. The arugula actually absorbed the fishy shrimp flavor and was very good. Our fries were thinly sliced, almost like shoestring fries. I&#39;m not a fan of fries and typically eat them when my options are limited. I was pleasantly surprised as to how good the fries were. I also had a small Parkerhouse Roll. It&#39;s a simple dinner roll, freshly baked and topped with butter and some kind of green herb, possibly chives. Nevertheless, it was good!!!

What&#39;s funny is that when we had multiple small conversations with Kael, we discovered that he&#39;s also from our home state. Not only was he a previous California resident, but he grew up in the city in which we are moving to! We had a great time connecting with Kael but also, enjoying such an amazing meal. 

Is the food at Stoic &amp; Genuine really that great? Absolutely!!!! It seems like they&#39;ve taken the all natural, organic route. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to return to Stoic &amp; Genuine when we&#39;re back in town because it really is worth a second visit. It&#39;s not just that our waiter was awesome but mainly because I&#39;m so hooked on their food! If you&#39;re in Downtown Denver and want delicious food in and intimate setting, stop by Stoic &amp; Genuine for a satisfying meal!"

We were looking for a restaurant to eat at while visiting Union Station in Denver.  In looking at our options, I was drawn to Stoic &amp; Genuine for the menu and the interior décor.  The patio area is nicely situated and offers a pleasant outdoor dining experience.  The food was very good.  The service, however, needs improvement.

Location:
The restaurant is located in the hallway on the right side of the entrance to Union Station.  Walk down the hall and the entrance is to the left.  There is an outside entrance near the courtyard fountain area.

Décor: 
The décor is quite nice and was what drew me into the restaurant in the first place.  The modern eclectic feel of the place was interesting.  The outside seating area is pleasant as well and offers a nice view of the fountain courtyard area.  

Menu: 
The menu is well designed and offers several different unique options.  I noticed the next table had ordered crab legs and they looked quite good.  I ordered the same thing and was very pleased.  The crab legs were sliced for easy removal.  They were fresh and cooked just right.  It was a good sized portion.  I would highly recommend this dish.  We also ordered a salad.  Though the servings are small, the dishes are well done.  The Parker house rolls were delicious (there is a small additional cost to order these).
The wine menu offered good choices and they had a nice sparkling wine selection as well.  

Service: 
The service was lacking.  The young woman who greeted and seated was obviously not in a good mood.  My husband and I thought about making a comment to her about it, but then another waitress took over.  Though she was more pleasant, it did seem like there was something going on that was creating an uneasy dynamic with the staff that I think could be felt by the customers.  

Restrooms:
The restrooms were very nice, clean, and well maintained.

Final Thoughts:
I would be writing a very positive review about Stoic &amp; Genuine if it wasn&#39;t for the staff issue.  The food and décor were all excellent.  The location adds to the experience as Union Square is a lovely place to visit.  I would highly recommend the crab legs and the broccoli salad.  The wine selection was also a plus.  I am hopeful that this was an off day for the restaurant with staff, because otherwise this would have been a place that I would highly recommend."

I&#39;m so pleased with everything. I suggest making a reservation. It&#39;s for the best. We did and we were walked in to our table as soon as we checked in. The ones without reservations was told 1-2 hrs wait!

We started with a couple of drinks. The &#34;One foot off the Merry Go Round Granitas and the Ginger Crane. Mine was the Ginger Crane and I will get this again. For sure. It&#39;s stiff, original and very pretty looking.

We ordered the Beet Salad and Tuna Tartare to share to start with. When both came, they not only look pretty but the taste was on point. Fresh fish for the tartare and the sauce painted around it was so vivid. It was stunning! 

I had the Paella Moderna. This is an all seafood paella. The portion is somewhat small. The size of the dish has nothing to do with the big bold taste this dish comes with. It&#39;s one of my most memorable dish ever.  The sauce was amazing. I managed to stop myself from finishing the whole dish just so that I can take home the sauce with me. The following day this paella still remains outstanding. So get this if you&#39;re a paella or a seafood lover. I am reviewing this and already I&#39;m wishing I&#39;m back at the restaurant. 

The staff here are truly amazing. Only the best! Our glass of water was never empty. It&#39;s like they&#39;re somewhat connected to the guy that pours them. He&#39;s always there making sure that that glass is never going to reach and stay in that half way point for too long.

They just gathered a couple of fans in us!"

I visited Stoic and Genuine after doing some research and after getting a recommendation from a local friend. Given the fact that my visit to Denver was very short, I decided to visit Stoic and Genuine during lunch and was very satisfied.

I was seated near the oyster shucking bar and had the opportunity to watch the semi open kitchen in action. Oysters were shucked fresh in front of you and they were very tasty. The menu accurately described the flavor taste/profile from each oysters that are served during the day. I wish I had gone the day before for the oyster happy hour. The lunch menu was generous with many varieties. I ordered the kajiki (fish of the day) with grilled baby bok choy and house-made Chinese black bean sauce. I have to admit that the bok choy outshined the kajiki as the kajiki was a bit overcooked. Having said that, I am very satisfied with overall meal in Stoic and Genuine.

All and all, Stoic and Genuine is a semi-hipster, seafood-centric restaurant that will please anyone who is not allergic to seafood."

After taking our drink orders, instead of politely asking to see our IDs, she said &#34;I&#39;m definitely going to need to see some ID&#34;.

I wanted to go to a place where I had not been to yet, but had heard solid things about it.  Knowing this place was walking distance from the &#34;house&#34;, I decided we should check it out.

Located right in the front of Union Station, Stoic &amp; Genuine is an upscale seafood place that includes an open kitchen and a nice size patio.  When we went, I opted for the patio, as it seemed somewhat stuffy on the inside- plus the weather was awesome that night...

We were greeted and seated almost immediately.  I forgot our servers name, but he was very helpful and had friendly &#34;assistants&#34; as well.  I never felt like we waited too long for anything.  the menu was mostly seafood, with a ton of drink options.  They even had a list of handmade sodas, and granites!  I decided to get one, amongst some other drinks.  The drinks were solid there overall.

This is one of those places that you could pretty much order anything and not be disappointed with.  I ended up getting a seafood platter to start which was awesome, and then got a split order of the seafood chowder.

We enjoyed the food immensely as well.  This was one of the better meals I have had to eat in Denver so far.  I could keep going on, but yea, you should see it for yourself!

Just shy of 5 stars, if you like seafood, give it a shot, I do not think you will be disappointed!  Be prepared to drop some $$ though!"

I also recommend the halibut with the glazed carrots. The carrots were amazing! I&#39;m inspired to eat more veggies now (glazed w/ honey... hehe). The fish was cooked perfectly, too. 
The octopus was also interesting and thinly sliced... never had it like that before! Although the food was good, I thought it was overpriced."

If you love oysters - this is the place to go. I had their version of Surf and Turf which is pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon and some &#34;line caught&#34; marlin. The nice part was the peel and eat artichokes and all you can eat cornbread.  They had a unique dessert called Cappuccino Cigarettes which is dark chocolate and coffee cream wrapped very thin in a crepe. I did have a good time at the Stoic.

Yes, meals, plural,  because we needed both lunches to even explore enough of the wonderful seafood menu. We are former coast (mostly east) residents and we have felt a bit landlocked in CO over the decades. But this will be our new go-to for quality fresh seafood in the area. Wish it was a bit closer for us, but we will find a way.

Over our two day visit we had a variety of fresh shucked oysters, all good. My husband preferred the cocktail sauce and horseradish, I preferred the mignonette. There is a choice of both on the plate. We had lobster rolls the first day, small enough for lunch to still enjoy sides and dessert. Classic New England presentation though with upgraded components over the beach places I usually frequent. The side of potato salad was gourmet and exceptional. We shared each dessert, the pineapple right side up bread pudding and the blackberry allspice granita. The granita was so good and seasonally inspired that we had it again the second day when we really needed a lighter finish.

On our second lunch of two days of extended eating, we did go a little lighter but not any less perfect. I had the fritto misto which included my must-have calamari along with some fish pieces (haddock or halibut, I have forgotten) and artichokes, another favorite. A light dressing with a feta cream and a piquillo pepper drizzle added just the right zing. My husband had the Bang Island Mussel clam chowder which look astounding to me and he confirmed it tasted as good as it looked. A full bowl of traditional ingredients mounded up in a classy broth with a full ring of steamed mussels in the shell around the perimeter. We both ordered a parker house roll as accompaniment and it was just the right touch and clearly right out of the oven, with an excellent garlic butter preparation. 

I cannot fathom not making this part of our special meal locations, no matter the distance. Kudos to everyone there, as the service was excellent and everything a far better effort than most places would make for lunch."

The first time, six of were seated on the outdoor patio. The food, when it finally arrived, was decent. But the service was severely lacking with meals showing up at different times, some items overlooked. They were busy, yes, but given the location and popularity, a place of this stature should be prepared for that. The prices were $$$ and not worth that considering the service debacle.

The second time two of us patronized the bar when it was not busy. My drink - $8.50 - was mostly water; the weakest pour I&#39;ve ever experienced. When my guest asked for a cocktail napkin, the bartender brought one for her, but not me. We sent one drink back and with that, the bartender copped an attitude. We finished off our essence of alcohol, paid our tab and promptly left the premises. 

Genuinely bad. Head over to Larimer Street if you want a choice of good places and service."

They had oysters which looked delicious but unfortunately I can&#39;t eat them because I&#39;m pregnant . The hubby ordered the tuna melt, I got the double cheese burger, and watermelon salad. 
The double cheeseburger was divine! Like literally so creaking good. My husband said that the tuna melt was the best he&#39;s ever eaten. The watermelon salad was refreshing and had delicious speck in it. 

Service was on point. The food was delicious. Will be back when we come back to Denver!"

Of course, when you haven&#39;t dined in Denver before, you want to visit a special restaurant. This one was just not a special restaurant, but it felt like we were at home too. The name of the restaurant just felt right. Welcome to Stoic &amp; Genuine at Denver Union Station.

Located inside of Denver Union Station, but the furthest left of the building, you will find Stoic &amp; Genuine. There is a restaurant that we accidentally walked into at the end of the hallway. You can easily miss it from the inside since it was just a small door that looked like a closet door. Stoic &amp; Genuine shares with many other restaurants at Union Station. Parking is mainly street parking. If you are riding through the Metro System, you will have no excuses of not stopping here since your train did.

The architectural interior of Stoic &amp; Genuine is absolutely amazing. If you look up, it almost as it seems that the window blonds were holding up the second floor. The creative use of the bulbs from the ceiling. Also, the oyster bar area almost seems you can probably buy fresh seafood right on the spot. The use of the wood throughout the restaurant was the key factor. It made the restaurant feel you are in a luxury setting without the harsh hit of your wallet.

Our server for the day was Kael. He made sure we were comfy from the beginning to the end. When he took our drink orders, he warned us that they didn&#39;t serve a lot of soda options. A lot of their sodas are homemade. He did provide an alternate without alcohol in it. If you take a close look at their drink menus, you will see a lot quotes from the famous movie, The Sandlot. If you haven&#39;t seen the Sandlot, &#34;You&#39;re killing me smalls!&#34; By the way, its a cocktail too! Kael also accommodated my fiancé&#39;s special needs. She ordered from the&#34; I&#39;ll have the Fish&#34; Lunch Special ($19.50). She had the Wild Argentinean Shrimp with arugula salad. In addition, she ordered a Parkerhouse roll ($1) and a side of Spicy Tater Fries ($4). My fiancé didn&#39;t want her fries too spicy, but Kael would place the spice to the side of the dish. As for my meal, I had something as special as her meal. I had the Tuna Melt ($13.50). I guess the way I ordered it wasn&#39;t all that special, but the photos will explain for itself.

The wait for our food was about 10-15 minutes. We did enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant as well as view the patrons walking by Union Station. While looking around, I noticed a bucket with a shovel. It was a cute salt shaker. Well, not a shaker, but a scooper. That was incredibly hilarious to dig into your ingredients. Our food came in and I was very surprised with my dish. My fiancé was very satisfied with her dish. The Wild Argentinean Shrimp was placed on top of the arugula while it was sizzling. The rest of the staff brought the delicious, buttery Parkerhouse Roll and the Spicy Tater Fries. I loved that you can get the fries without the heat right away. I started dipping the fries into the hot spice. I started coughing because I knew what kind of heat I was going to get into. 

My Tuna Melt was something different. I am used to fully cooked tuna, but never a seared one with the middle raw. The sandwich was tall and it had to take a few attempts to grab a bite. You would be surprised without looking at the menu that bread is a English muffin. With the American Cheese melting (Which is the only cheese that they serve here), you would almost want to tell yourself that you are eating a Ham &amp; Cheese sandwich. On the bottom of the sandwich was a nice layer of slaw. What else am I missing in this sandwich?! I would re-order this when I get back. 

Stoic &amp; Genuine has a wonderful line of food, but what made our experience was our host, Kael. He reminded us that we are never too far from home. Especially when Kael was originally from the SoCal. He hasn&#39;t been there in years, but it was nice to send some Cali love to Denver. Stoic &amp; Genuine is a great place to grab a bite when you&#39;ve traveled for so long or just simply walking around before a football or baseball game. I just got to pronounce Stoic correctly. Is it Stow-ik? Stoyk?! Ahh, I&#39;m going back Stoked!

I tried four different courses here and from each and every one, you can tell that serving fresh, high quality fish and maintaining the integrity of the food is of upmost importance to the chefs.   

Course 1: You must get oysters here.  Absolutely the best oysters of my life.  SERIOUSLY.  And some of you may read this and say, what does she know, she lives in a landlocked state.  People, I have traveled to the East and West coasts often, and tried many an oyster.  These were PERFECTION. 

Course 2: Fresh sardines, which were paired with blood orange.  Absolutely a fantastic pairing.  For anyone who doesn&#39;t like sardines, the stuff you get in cans is not real!!  These beautiful little fish have an entirely different flavor when fresh- just a little salty, but very delicate.  

Course 3: Sea urchin paired with walnut butter, black mission fig, red wine gastrique, fried rosemary .  I have to say I am not a fan of sea urchin.  Because what you are eating is basically the reproductive organs of the urchin, which just grosses me out to begin with.  But this was very good; the walnut flavor was unique and delicious.

Course 4: Seared halibut with chantarelle mushrooms, corn, cilantro, and a truffle/honey custard.  The fish was fantastic- cooked perfectly and so fresh- I watched them filet it immediately before cooking.  I loved the mix of flavors in this dish, and they all paired together so well.

Wonderful service here as well!  I can&#39;t wait to come back!  They have happy hour with $2 oysters, which is a screaming deal for those puppies."

We&#39;re from southern california where the seafood is more fresh, but we were wandering around downtown and got hungry and we were able to squeeze in here at the bar.  

I can say that sitting at the bar is a dangerous proposition... you&#39;re sitting in front of the seafood prep area and you just see them continually either breaking down oysters, breaking open clams, preparing those giant lobster tower things... makes you want to go overboard ordering seafood. 

The food was pretty good.  Ordered an assortment of oysters and I went with the crispy whole haddock.  I&#39;m really getting behind this whole fried fish revival that&#39;s getting play at nice restaurants.  Started with that lion fish at Chengdu Taste in Alhambra... anyways, the haddock was quite nice.  Cleaned that fish up properly like a true asian man.. haha.

Anyways, the pricing was semi reasonable for what they were going for here.  Special occasion type of restaurant."

This had been on our list ever since Union Station opened up...a ago year already?? Anyway, I&#39;m glad we finally got to check if off the list. 

I decided to surprise hubby with a midweek lunch date and snagged an early lunch reservation. At first I thought it might be dead at lunch since no one was there, but it filled up in about 15 minutes and ended up being rather lively. 

I love the interior - the ambiance is really cool and I only imagine it being better at night. Our waiter, host, bus guys, everyone, were also really nice and helpful too. I had the little munchkin in tow and the host went out of his way to make sure I knew where the restrooms were since the main ones were under construction. 

What about the food, you ask? Right. Noms! We started with the crawfish, which were just ok. The sauce was great, but the fish were just meh. I personally don&#39;t care for the buggers and would&#39;ve picked something else, but we were celebrating hubby and that&#39;s what he wanted so I didn&#39;t speak up. For lunch he had the fish &amp; chips, and I had THE BEST TUNA MELT EVER. Seriously, no tuna + mayo salad here folks. We&#39;re talking slab o&#39; seared tuna on your sammich with slaw, and melted American cheese. If I&#39;m being honest, I turned my nose up at the American cheese at first too, but leave it be and don&#39;t change it. It was perfect the way it was!

We skipped dessert this time, but I guess that means we have to go back and check it out!"

He really seems to challenge himself (and his staff) to push the envelope and bring creative, fresh, and delicious seafood to the table. One of his primary personal tenants is to act with integrity and to only serve dishes that he himself would be ecstatic to consume. Not everyone will share his tastes, hence some of the lesser reviews, but if you appreciate high quality, unique seafood dishes - you will not be disappointed. 

I tried several dishes, but for me the standouts were the fresh oysters and the sardines served with blood oranges. Highly recommend."

They have a great happy hour, including select oysters, $2 off the chosen crudo, and a selection of drinks.

Their crudo menu alone is a reason to visit. The tuna tartare crudo (with beets served multiple ways) is honestly one of the best dishes I&#39;ve EVER eaten. I wake up thinking about that dish on may occasions! 

Aside from that, the selection of oysters is incredible (both east and west coast) and the staff are super-knowledgable to help you make your decision.

I know so much about Urchin now!
The location is great, right next to Union Station. Cozy and full of energy at the same time. 

The sardines, as mentioned by so many, are amazing! 
The Sea Urchin was so creative and tasty! Everything on the plate was perfect!
Its obvious that freshness is a top priority. 

Absolutely my favorite part of the meal was the Alaskan Halibut. The piece was cut right in front of me and cooked to perfection! The corn and BACON served with the dish mixed so well. 
The meal really was memorable and the food is soooooo worth the trip.

Although I had never heard anyone say good things about this place, from the outside there seemed to be a lot of people enjoy their meals so my wife and 4 other friends decided to check it out. Below is a summary:

Food:  this is one of those places that will charge you $30/entree for a &#34;pretty plate&#34;. Meaning you will walk out still hungry. I ordered $21 clam chowder, it had 6 clams in it. We ordered 12 oysters, the shells were 3x bigger than the bodies, @ $4 each. Not to mention the insanely inappropriate number of shell fragments myself and the group managed to pull out of our mouths. My wife ordered the halibut. It was delicious. If you were maybe a 5 year old. It literally was the size of 2 matchboxes. MAYBE 2 ounces max. And on the menu everything is plural, leekS, potatoeS, etc.. Well they come out singular. Meaning you get one Leek or 1 tiny potato cube. Our final bill was $330. We were all so hungry afterwards we went to thirsty lion for 2 appetizers. 

Service: Absolutely the worst service from a waiter at a restaurant of that &#34;class&#34; I really have ever been too. He never came to our table, of 6, he forgot drinks, and 20 minutes after we ordered them he would come back and say &#34;I owe you a wine&#34; or &#34;club soda&#34; then disappear. He did that 2x until I finally had to ask a busser. Waited was nice, but seemed to be in some comfort zone thinking he didn&#39;t actually have to work and he&#39;d still get tipped on $330 meals. We all ordered bread to eat with our meals. It came once 4/6 plates were already taken off the table and the soup I wanted to dip it in was 99% gone because I was so hungry I used my spoon. Not to mention the 20 mins I waited for them to bring bread before I started eating. No one likes cold soup."

The only downside is the appetizers dishes are a little too small."

They charged me $1.75 for the Coke in my whiskey and Coke. I have a hard time wrapping my head around this. I&#39;ve been to hundreds of &#34;fancy&#34; and &#34;nice&#34; restaurants. Who in the world charges $1.75 for the splash of Coke in a whiskey and coke? Apparently this place. I asked for
Jack and they didn&#39;t have it. I was then offered a magnitude of other whiskeys, I chose Whistle Pig, which is a fabulous whiskey. Yeah, I got a Whistle Pig and Coke. Judge me. Please. 

The other drinks were subpar. We both ordered an extra dirty martini to start the meal and the vodka was sweet...Ugh! The worst martini I&#39;ve ever had to say the least. We asked about the sweet taste to the martinis and the girl had not a clue in the world. She&#39;s said it was probably the well vodka. Yuck. With all the expensive vodkas she rifled off I&#39;d expect the well to be at least decent. 

The only saving grace to Stoic and Genuine were the oysters. They were truly delicious. We had one dozen made up of three different varieties. Some were better than others, but they were all wonderful. They were full of flavor and very distinct in taste. A plus for the evening. 

After the oysters we had an appetizer of Hamachi Poke and Shoshito peppers. There were way too many peppers. I love peppers, and these are pretty mild, but the ratio to the fish was insane. Not only that, the fish was supposed to be raw, and whatever sauce they used to dress it cooked some of the pieces. Did I mention how many freaking peppers were in the dish? I felt like we were only eating peppers.

The rest of the meal was just &#34;meh.&#34; My tenderloin was cooked well and the wife&#39;s whole haddock was nicely presented and flavorful (we even ate the eyeballs). But, they were out of a lot of items on the menu and the mussels that were supposed to come with my main were replaced with shrimp. I don&#39;t find it very acceptable to be out of so many items on a busy Friday night. The table next to us tried to order the mussels, sea urchin and octopus and they were out of those as well. Our server was very nice and tried her best given the situation. Overall, the meal was just ok at best, but nothing above and beyond. 

With all the new additions at Union Station, this wouldn&#39;t be my first choice. Honestly, everything was over seasoned and over priced. There are a lot of better options around."

Came to Stoic &amp; Genuine on a Friday evening with reservations. They sat us immediately and even gave us a choice of indoor or outdoor seating. 

For food we stuck with the things that we had read were good: 
For starters -  cornbread and 1lb of king crab legs. The cornbread was perfect; crisp and salty on the outside and moist on the inside, and the crab legs were well cooked and yummy.

Main Course - Haddock. This large, head &amp; tail on fish is battered and fried and was so, so scrumptious!! The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and pulled right off the bone. It was also big enough to share - which is the key to leaving with any money left in your wallet here ;)

Extras - we ordered Albarino as our wine - a smooth white that I love, but can&#39;t always find and because it was my birthday they brought a pineapple bread pudding dessert with cherry ice cream. It was yummy (but I probably wouldn&#39;t have paid for it)

The &#34;deal sealer&#34; for me though was our service. Our waiter, Matthew, was attentive, fun, and extremely helpful. He wasted no time giving us suggestions about the menu, and was really knowledgable in guiding my BF to the right oysters for him. He gave us &#34;tips&#34; throughout the meal - like suggesting that we try bits of the grilled lime wedges with our haddock - something we wouldn&#39;t have known to try on our own.

Overall, I had a fantastic evening meal."

This. Is. It. 
We came here on a Saturday afternoon. No wait and a perfect patio table for people watching... With a parked stroller.  The hostess was less than excited about being at work and I wondered what was in store for us.  However, our server arrived quickly and started our true experience here.  He guided us through our raw bar choices and found both the perfect sparkling wine for me and a gin cocktail for my husband to pair with our oysters.  Next Kael (our server) suggested that we not choose between the tuna melt and the lobster roll, but instead have both - splitting each for us beautifully plated.  The lobster roll was good.  Creamier than my perfect roll, but hey... That&#39;s just me.  The show stopper was the tuna melt.  It was not your average deli sandwich.  The meat is a thick seared tuna steak and it is delicious!

The space is long and narrow (almost like a train car I would say) with a high ceiling and sort of hip and cool but not warm and inviting.

They have a &#34;granita&#34; concept for their drink menu.  Basically a grown up slushie + liquor.  I got a blackberry one and had a hard time finishing it. And I ne-VER have problems finishing drinks.  I just didn&#39;t care for it.  

I ordered the Tuna poke and I wish I had just looked at it and admired it visually.  It was a little slimy and non descript for what I believe was a $14-ish appetizer.

And for dinner I got the skate which was breaded and served with Brussels and some other things. The sprouts...delicious.  The fish very nice.

Then ordered wine...and Albarino that was uncharacteristic for that kind of wine heavy on the mineral and not much fruit/body. Sort of a surprise.  Thankfully I was able to drink the wine.

Our server dropped the check without asking if we wanted coffee dessert of another granite...then he disappeared.. maybe went upstairs to the Cooper lounge for a proper drink.

Please restaurant people, if you charge more than $8 for an entrée and don&#39;t serve waffles, please don&#39;t ever drop a check without first verifying that we are finished."

I&#39;ve had plenty in my day, and loved them all, and this was the worst by a mile. It is less than half the size of an actual lobster roll, though the price is higher. It contains a tiny amount of lobster, and it essentially tastes like cole slaw. Bread was good, but still, yikes. Service was good, btw. This is a lobster roll-specific review."

Went there over the week end and we sat at the chef counter in front of all the seafood. The place is great and located in the Union Station. It adds so much charm to the experience. The service was really good and we felt really welcome. The food was really tasty and well presented. Some items did not work but it was more due to our preference. The oysters and the crab were super fresh. My favorite was the Baramundi fish. Great presentation and cooked perfectly. Their cocktail and wine selection was well crafted too.
Would definitely recommend."

This is hands down my favorite seafood restaurant in Denver. I had the ceviche which was fresh and very good with the different flavors and textures. I then had some oysters, a total of 4 from different regions in the US and Canada. They were the best tasting oysters that I&#39;ve ever had. I then was curious about tasting uni for the first time, the waiter (Bryce, I believe) recommended the uni fried rice which was absolutely delicious with the ponzu sauce and kimchi. As I was waiting, the waiter offered me the paella because the chef made an extra. I was so happy because this is probably the best dish I had, if you go there have the paella moderna. Now let&#39;s talk about drinks, absolutely delicious with the different flavored granitas(like snow cone). Great service and even better food, what more could you ask for."

I have had everything from the raw oysters, sardines, and the halibut. All fish served here goes from sea to plate in 72hrs or less. 

The passion in the food is evident here.  For an appetizer I had the Fresh Uni.  It was served with walnut butter, a small fig, and some scattered walnuts.  I have had uni once before but it had been lackluster.  This was definitely the way it should taste.  I was told that the urchin is alive until you order so that&#39;s as fresh as you can get it.  If you have some fresh oysters I recommend the Lucien Albrecht Cremant Rose with them.

I had the halibut as my main course.  It was cooked to perfection.  It was fresh and seared quickly with just a bit of oil and butter.  It was plated with some fresh local corn and some chanterelle mushrooms from Colorado in a lite sauce.

My dessert was of the liquid variety.  I had the El Duderino.  It is their interesting take on a white russian inspired by the Big Lebowski.  A perfect finish."

This was the best restaurant so far. Extremely fresh seafood. Oysters which were prepared right in front of me and stored ironically right in front of me where I said also. Extremely delicious. My wife had a dish with salmon mussels octopus calamari and shrimp. I don&#39;t know who thought of putting so much Seafood in one dish but she loved it. What helped the situation was seeing your food prepared right in front of you. It build such an anticipation and did not disappoint in its finality. My dish was a bowl of mussels with this delicious broth at the bottom. We also had cornbread with both meals which helped with sopping up all of the delicious broth. Our waiter was extremely attentive and very helpful. When we return to Denver we will be back to this restaurant.

It&#39;s hard to find a good restaurant that offers decently priced seafood. For the quality of product you are getting the prices are more than reasonable. Scallops of $12.50 you can&#39;t beat it!
We ate the scallops, bacon-wrapped cod chowder, six oysters, sunchoke salad, and brussel sprouts. Split between two people it seems like quite a bit of food. 

Personal favorite was the scallops. So tender and delicious plus you don&#39;t get the grainy crunch you can get from some that weren&#39;t prepped correctly. 

After the last bite we were full and satisfied but didn&#39;t have that stuffed want to go lay on the couch feel. Which is nice!
Wash it all down with a nice happy hour drink and you&#39;ll be all set, enjoy!"

The first decision to be made was inside or outside. We chose the patio and on a perfect summer night I&#39;m not sure it could have been a better atmosphere. 

Matthew was our waiter and despite many lousy reviews about the service, he might have scored a perfect score in every category. I really appreciated this honestly, decisiveness, and attention to detail. He wasn&#39;t afraid to tell us what he thought and even, at one point, noticed we were ignoring the lime wheel on the dish and told us how we should enjoy it, and what a great detail and suggestion that was!

We more or less based our ordering on the Yelp reviews but his were very much in line with those. We went with the cornbread, crab legs, and haddock. I did have two oysters to start- I had to- after all, this place is named after them and they didn&#39;t disappoint!

The cornbread was to die for. It might be worth a trip to just have these. The crab was steamed perfected and cut enough to make it easy to get rather than struggling and being all messy. The haddock was the highlight. What an amazing fish, great taste, excellent complimentary ingredients making this dish an absolute must.

When I think back to the three key aspects of the night- ambiance, service and food- this place blew it out of the water. They nailed all of them and made this an unforgettable night and one we hope to repeat at some point in the future."

It&#39;s definitely a nice place with a nice atmosphere, but we didn&#39;t think the food was extremely special. I&#39;ll admit neither of us are seafood experts. I had gazpacho, which was nothing special and a side of cold (?) broccoli. My fiancé had the 1/2 pound of shrimp- he was surprised it was brought over ice and they were very nice about redoing the dish and throwing it on the grill. However, he left hungry and even ate a half turkey sandwich after. The best part? The watermelon jalapeño pepper margarita - that was really special! Needless to say, I won&#39;t be coming back."

Went with 5 others and started out with the Sardine appetizer. It was 9 or 10 dollars and it had 1 sardine cut in half. That&#39;s right, 1 measly sardine. Small dish and didn&#39;t think all the components worked. My main course was the &#34;paella&#34; though I wouldn&#39;t call it that. Dish was very flavorful but again, quite small. Calamari was cut too thin imo and thus a tad chewy. But a quality dish nonetheless. Wife got the Haddock. It was served whole and the presentation was really cool however it lacked flavor and had Zero side dish. My wife kind of complained about that when asked how everything was. So the server offered to bring out some veggies for her. She thanked him and then saw that we were charged $10 for them on the bill. WTF, don&#39;t offer something like you are doing us a favor and then charging for it. Plus, $10 for roasted veggies?? That&#39;s steep. Lastly my friend found a piece of plastic in his dish and thus lost his appetite. They took his meal off but offered nothing else. Not impressed. We would have offered a dessert when I worked at the Cheesecake Factory. Won&#39;t be back unless it&#39;s for a couple oysters. Too much competition in the area to waste that much money."

My friend and I wanted to chill out at Downtown and to Union Station we went.  While we were there, we decide to have LUNCH at Stoic &amp; Genuine.  Yes, the space can be &#34;crampy&#34; if you decide to seat at the Chef&#39;s Bar and the arrangement of chair/seating and table areas, are somewhat &#34;weird&#34;..  BUT if during the SPRING/SUMMER or when the weather permits, you are welcome to dine out, coz they offer PATIO Seating.

From their SIMPLE LUNCH MENU, we ordered the following items and shared them :

*  Scallop Crudo ($12.50)
*  Octopus ($14.50)
*  Tuna Avocado Crudo ($16.50)

Both my friend and I ordered Lobster Roll each was $19.50 hence it was $39.00

My friend opt to have Bloody Mary ($10.00) and Potato Salad ($3.50).

Good to come early coz this establishment tend to filled up fast.  Furthermore, though there are plenty seating at the Chef&#39;s Bar but it seems that this establishment is &#34;rather small&#34; in size.

The service is stellar especially from Our Main server.  His name is James P.  Our water is filled periodically when it runs empty by another staff.  

Decent food, though IT WAS VERY PRICEY with &#34;ATROCIOUS&#34; small, tiny portions...  Nothing stood out, though I cannot deny since its DOWNTOWN and RENT DOES NOT COME CHEAP for this Venue, all the food can be OVER-PRICED for some.

Sorry Stoic &amp; Genuine, you CAN SHINE in others, but you don&#39;t shine in mine!  As in terms of SEAFOOD, I guess, I will stick to JAX Fish House which is a couple blocks away in the same Neighborhood.

* DOUBLE SIGH*

After like 30 minutes of Lunch from this establishment, I am still hungry.  NOT GOOD in my books when I SPENT ALOT for LUNCH.  Its an EXPENSIVE LUNCH indeed, which I don&#39;t fancy.  

Just another establishment that is OVER-HYPED and OVER-RATED....  *SAD FACE INDEED*

stoic-and-genuine-denver-4,Natalia K.,BnIY7cXbUfnrEqoQdQc9Pg,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,346,176,XXnfHBwAgH2fHpPTkhfsZQ,5.0,2015-02-25,"I have to be honest. It took me a little while to warm up to the new Stoic &amp; Genuine seafood restaurant at Union Station downtown. At first glance, it seemed a little too expensive and fancy for Denver. And who hasn&#39;t made fun of this new hipster trend of naming restaurants &#34;____ &amp; ____&#34;? 

But then I found myself repeatedly ending up at S&amp;G on the weekends. They have this great little patio with a perfect view of all the hustle and bustle outside Union Station -- and on a hot day, what sounds better than a cold bottle of white wine and some oysters under one of those umbrellas? It&#39;s not like Jax is open for lunch anymore. So that&#39;s how I found myself at Stoic &amp; Genuine over and over, until I realized that I kind of love this place. The location is perfect, the food and wine are delicious, and the people are incredibly friendly and genuine (see what I did there?). And it&#39;s actually not that expensive if you know what to order.


THE WINE

One of the first things that got me hooked on S&amp;G was the wine. I absolutely love wine, and I love it even more when it&#39;s delicious, but not expensive. My personal favorite here is the Basque A20 Albariño. It&#39;s an effervescent wine (which means it&#39;s almost sparkling) that I think is unrivaled when it&#39;s hot out. A close second to pair with the seafood is the fruity Laurenz V. Grüner Veltliner. And both of these bottles are in the mid-$30s! Hey, when you drink as much wine as me, it matters.


THE FOOD

I&#39;m a sucker for oysters, so I never leave here without having some. There&#39;s a great rotating selection here from both coasts, at pretty reasonable market prices. There are also $2 oysters during HH (2pm-4:30pm M-F, 11am-4:30pm Sun), but that still makes Jax less expensive at $1.25 HH oysters. However, Jax doesn&#39;t open until 4pm on any given day.

If you get anything here, get the Crispy Whole Haddock (with lemongrass butter, lime, ponzu, and fresno chiles). At market price, it&#39;s usually about $30, but it&#39;s definitely a full meal for 2 people. It&#39;s the house specialty, and it does not disappoint.

If you&#39;re looking for an individual entree, the Squid Mac (with Point Judith RI squid, cream cheese hollandaise, grilled Maine lobster tail, and watercress) is pretty amazing, too. Although it&#39;s almost the same price as the Haddock, so at that point, just pick whatever makes your little heart stutter. This option is a lot creamier, but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s sharable.

Another great option is the Steamed Clams (with Bilbao chorizo, tomato fondue, fennel, and ciabatta). I&#39;m usually a bit hesitant about ordering mussels or clams with chorizo, because it tends to get too salty and greasy -- but this one is done right. The chorizo comes as larger pieces of the spicy little sausage, and it doesn&#39;t completely overpower the clams.


THE PEOPLE

Every once in awhile, I come across a place where the people deserve their own mention. S&amp;G is one of those places. Either they&#39;ve managed to hire only the most positive, friendly people in Colorado -- or the work environment is so great that they really enjoy being here -- or both. I&#39;ve yet to have a server here who hasn&#39;t been incredibly friendly and happy to take the time to chat about his life and mine (and even my cat Meatball&#39;s). Even on a busy day. It&#39;s that kind of service that takes a restaurant experience from great to amazing."

Chef Jorel is really what makes the place so genuine. He has the most respect for his staff, the food quality, and his guest. He will always put food credibility over costs and you can tell it is a true passion of his. He is a partner to Eulicid and Rioja which are also amongst my favorites. 

Out of all the meals I tried I would say the Halibut was my favorite. I recommend sitting up at the bar too and watching the staff crack open all the oysters &amp; Uni."

We were looking for a place and this restaurant presented itself.  I view this as an upscale oyster bar charging excessive prices for a lunch menu.  Maybe they have big rent at Union Station?
The atmosphere is clean, modern, airy, high ceilings with an outdoor patio for dining.  We chose to stay out of the 88 degree heat.  Service was attentive.  We ordered fish and chips to share.  We were served one beer-battered piece of cod over a bed of shoestring French fries.  ($13).  Somehow I was expecting more fish and less fries.  I was disappointed.  I gave it two stars not because of the quality of the food but for the price v. value."

Came here for a late lunch with my bf which turned into happy hour and lunch at the same time. The interior looked great, but it was so nice outside so we opted for the patio instead.

For drinks, I tried their lychee granita and it was yummy! Just the right amount of alcohol and hint of lychee. We ordered their $2 fresh oysters during their HH and it was a great starter! We got two of each and it came chilled with the side condiments. 

For the rest of the food, we got the Brussels sprouts, George Bank&#39;s scallops, Comice pear and roasted sunchokes, and bacon wrapped cod &#39;chowder&#39;. I think my favorite was the scallops because it had so much going on in the plate and it was new and refreshing! The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly and was a wonderful accompaniment with the cod chowder which our waiter split for us already so we wouldn&#39;t fight over it! The salad came last because they had to roast the sunchokes which took a long time but it was a nice way to end the whole meal. Did not expect that much Gorgonzola though, but we just put it on the side so it was all good!"

Had their lunch menu and happy hour on a Sunday. The food was ridiculous!!! Holy crap, I wish all the portions were double in size. 

Pretty sick bar list too. I had the strawberry mint granita (and I usually do whiskey straight up) and it was

Each time I&#39;d say that the key element missing was great customer service.

First of all, let me say I&#39;m in love with Union Station and how it has been transformed into a location destination with restaurants and bars. Stoic &amp; Genuine is a good addition to this space, and I love how they&#39;ve fit two separate bar areas and a seating area into such a small footprint. When outdoor dining is available, they easily double the available non-bar seating. Finding the hostess stand is a little confusing, but they generally do a good job of helping you if you seem to be standing around, lost.

Their selection of oysters is fresh daily and includes east coast, west coast, and sometimes international options. I&#39;ve been impressed with the selections I&#39;ve had, although they do seem to be a bit pricey (ranging from $2.50 - $4.00 in my experience) and the horseradish isn&#39;t very strong in the dipping sauces that come with. I&#39;ve also enjoyed the watermelon salad (with bacon!), the grits side (big enough to be a person&#39;s dish), and the mussels entrée. Least favorite has been the paella moderna; it looks cool (the rice is molded into an &#34;M,&#34; I&#39;m assuming for &#34;moderna&#34;) but the rice tastes very sweet and isn&#39;t enough to really make me feel like it&#39;s a true paella. Overall I think their dishes are creative, there&#39;s a wide variety of seafood options, and the flavors seem to play well together.

My biggest disappointment has been the service. Everyone has been nice, but there have been some odd moments. I&#39;ve never had a true introduction or welcome to the restaurant and haven&#39;t had an offer to walk us through the menu. Last night my boss and I ordered wine, his being white and mine being red, and the waiter switched them when he dropped them off (not a huge deal); we switched them back, and then when we ordered a second, the same thing happened - except this time he said something about how we must have changed our minds. Another time, when I went with my parents, my mom ordered a  1/2 lobster and they brought her a whole one. The waiter apologized and said he thought he heard her order a whole, but that definitely wasn&#39;t the case. The receipt came and still had the whole lobster on it, and the manager came out to address the concern and my dad explained that a half was ordered but a whole was charged. The manager&#39;s response was VERY surprising to me - she put her hands up and said &#34;I wasn&#39;t here to hear the order, so...&#34; I mean, come on! We&#39;re not cheap people, we&#39;re not going to try to cheat you out of an extra $28, but that&#39;s not ok to claim that we were lying. 

I&#39;d be happy to try more of their food, specifically in their atmosphere, but their service will make me hesitant to make it a go-to."

I almost didnt believe it myself. Sitting here on this McPlaza, a construction yard since before I came to Denver. Eating an oyster at yet another restaurant with two adjectives and an ampersand. 
I enjoyed the mahi mahi. Or was it a butterfish? The server was pleasant, and he kept the bloody marys coming. Even though the food was good I don&#39;t get the hyperbole. It wasn&#39;t that good. It wasn&#39;t $350 for a party of 5 good. 

Nothing against the good chefs and attentive servers. This place just seems like bait for expense accounts and first dates. Were it not for the location, would I have even bothered?

Instead of getting a drink at the Terminal bar, we came down here. Love the vibe. There were not any seats at the bar open, so we stood at the drink rail, which was totally fine. Not having any idea what &#34;granita&#34; was, we stuck with just wine, which was very good. Bartenders were incredibly friendly, and I really like their &#34;uniforms&#34; as well. Saw some granita cocktails come out, and was angry with myself for not asking what they were, which is essentially flavored shaved ice, with liquor poured over it. They looked really great. Had a great experience, but the aroma of the place made me really want to come back and try their food. My only criticism is that the drink rail is very close to the bar, so you are very much in the way of any one trying to get back behind the bar, as that was the only entrance/exit to get there."

We started our meal with George&#39;s Bank Scallop Poke, with bruleed grapefruit, jalapeno, avocado, basil, and cocoa nib-coriander vinaigrette. While that combination could have gone poorly, potentially demanding a closer edit, it was stunning. The scallop was perfect, the grapefruit offered that sweetness and tang, the jalapeno gave it some heat, the avocado mouse provided earthiness, the basil gave a great herbaceous touch and the cocoa nib-coriander vinaigrette (which had chunks of cocoa nibs throughout) offered the slightest bitter note and the umami the dish needed to round it out. All together, a beautiful bite, and the star of the show for me. 

Next up with the Octopus Mortadella with candied lemon vinaigrette, smoked salt and sorrel. This was another winner. The octopus was thinly sliced, with pistachios perfectly placed throughout to resemble mortadella. The lemon, salt and sorrel offered just the right notes of sour, salt and texture. 

The Seafood Tower of Power ($75 version) came with a dozen oysters, crab legs, shrimp and caviar. The oysters, half of which were from the East coast and half from the West, were good, but nothing to write home about. Really, they did as much as they could have done with day-old oysters. I didn&#39;t love the strips of horseradish in the cocktail sauce that forced youto chew your sauce. The crab legs and drawn butter were excellent. The shrimp weren&#39;t as fresh as I had hoped - they tasted like they had been cooked and then sat on ice for hours. The caviar, served with creme fresh, shallot and lemon herb blini (delicious and still warm) was lovely, though I was slightly disappointed that there was no mother of pearl spoon offered. 

The Brioche Crusted Skate Wing with butternut squash, brussels sprouts, guanciale and apple vinaigrette pistachio pesto finished off the savory portion of the meal for us. It was excellent - the skate was perfectly crisp on the outside while still buttery and flaky inside, and the pesto was simply delicious, with hints of dill. The brussels were good, as was the butternut squash, but neither seemed like they were perfectly paired with the skate and pesto. Nonetheless, I&#39;d order it again. 

We finished off the night with a foie gras creme brulee, (we had been told to save room for dessert because we were celebrating an anniversary) which was savory and sweet all at once. We wanted decaf cappuccino, but learned that the restaurant doesn&#39;t have an espresso machine. Decaf french press was a suitable substitute. 

The granita cocktails were delicious, and the bubbly offered to us for free with our raw seafood in celebration of our anniversary was a very nice touch. I very much enjoyed the hot towel served between dinner and dessert. The service was excellent. It&#39;s a bummer that you have to leave the restaurant and go down a flight of stairs to the restroom, but the restaurant can hardly be blamed for that - they are in Union Station after all. All in all, an excellent experience, and one I&#39;d repeat when I&#39;m craving seafood in this land locked state."

The food was good but the drinks and service were very underwhelming. The Chenin Blanc wine ordered tasted like the bottle had been open for some time and the other drinks were far too sweet. Additionally, the service was laughable. Took 15 minutes to order a drink not once but twice. The server asked if we were ready to order as he dropped off our oysters, we said &#34;yes&#34;, he proceeded to walk away and not return for another 10 minutes. Overall an experience I would not repeat."

First of all there is no lunch menu, so everything comes at dinner prices.  That alone makes it a poor lunch choice; unless the food is spectacular.  I ordered the lobster roll.  $25. It was tiny.  It should have been labeled as a half roll, not built up as &#34;Damn near a half lobster shoved into a New England style bun&#34;.  On top of that, it was heavily salted; so much that it was annoying (it takes a lot of salt for me to be bothered).  The potato salad that came with it was better than the sandwich.  Bacon makes everything better...  Sadly, I have made better lobster rolls at home and have had better in Maine (of course) and in places as far away from Maine as Houston."

We started off with the octopus dish and the uni.  I really like the octopus.  Another reviewer thought that the sauce was old and burnt (which doesn&#39;t make sense given that it was a pesto), but I thought it went great with the octopus.  By the way, it&#39;s not a real pesto made with basil, but rather a pesto with pistachio and dill, which explains why it&#39;s not bright green (the reviewer also complained about the color of the sauce).  It also had pickled onions which gave the dish kind of an Indian flavor profile.

The uni was my favorite dish, as it came served cold on top of hot beef, which made a really nice temperature and textural contrast.  It was the most creative dish of the evening.

We also had a fried oyster sandwich, which I thought was fantastic, and probably the best value on the menu.  The bun was awesomely soft and pillowy, and the perfectly fried oysters were overflowing and cooked perfectly.  I would return if I could budget for it."

The tuna tartar and ceviche parfait were unique creations that were fun and delicious. My table mate&#39;s entree of steak wrapped tuna was also unusual but very flavorful. The problem was the very overcooked speck wrapped halibut. The speck became a flavorless chewy crust and the halibut was so dry it was crumbling. The ice cream sandwich dessert was excellent. It also showcased Stoic &amp; Genuine&#39;s creativity and need to pack everything into one bite: warm-cold, sweet-salty, creamy-crunchy, etc. Service left me feeling neglected. We ate our appetizers on top of our menus and after flagging our waitress down to order entrees she still didn&#39;t remove our menus or the empty appetizer plates. No &#34;goodbye&#34; or &#34;thank you&#34; when I leave never sits well with me. Because the majority of the food was so original I would go back for a second try."

My partner and I had a full three course meal and certain things were not good and certain things are perfect.

The appetizer they were recommended was the octopus. This octopuses supposed to be served with a pistachio pesto sauce, but the sauce was dark green which is an indication of it being old and it definitely didn&#39;t taste very fresh. When I go for seafood I expect all the ingredients to be fresh, crisp, and not taste like day old sauce as it were. Stuck in genuine was off to a bad start after the octopus. When I looked around I noticed that a lot of people were eating octopus, and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if it was because the sauce was old and that&#39;s what they were pushing that night. It was the dish that our server had recommended. Had we been duped?

Anyway, our second course was a cucumber salad with the curry sauce, caramelized cashews, and golden raisins I think. The salad was very small, and it looked like something that I could serve at home. The dish tasted like fall, and we are approaching summer. Did it taste good? Yes it did. Did it seem out of place? Yes it did.

Now, we ordered both of the breads that you could order on the side. The hot cross bun and the cornbread. I could tell just by tasting that the cornbread was made in house and the other bread was not, when I asked the server, he confirmed my suspicion. I am leery of any restaurant that doesn&#39;t make their own bread. It&#39;s Bread. It&#39;s a staple. How can I respect a chef that will serve someone else&#39;s bread in his or her own kitchen?

Our third course included the clam sandwich which really was no bigger than a taco, and a dozen of various selected oysters. The clam sandwich was pretty boring. It&#39;s not too difficult to fry up some clams and put it in between brioche bread.

However, the oysters were the best oysters I have ever had in Denver. I&#39;ve had oysters at nearly every seafood house in the state and these oysters were just as fresh if not more fresh than the oysters that I&#39;ve eaten right out of the ocean. But! It&#39;s really hard to screw up oysters. Oysters do not require any culinary genius. If you are thinking about going to this restaurant, stick with the oysters. I wouldn&#39;t go to stoic and genuine if you are looking for culinary creativity."

We went here last night.  We had an early enough rez (5:45) to get outside seating.  Great outside patio!  More importantly, it&#39;s in the shade for dinner.  Fortunately the nightly T-storms did not pay a visit.

Our waiter was an interesting character.  He was attentive and extremely opinionated.  He discouraged ordering the lobster roll and clam roll since they were &#34;lunch portions&#34; (in the case of the lobster roll, without the lunch price).  He was also opinionated on the sodas - the cherry one being his least favorite.  He was helpful though with the choice of oysters as two in my party were not oyster aficionados.  2 minuses in that we decided on a few more oysters (never ordered, never charged) and it took him forever to notice my wine was empty and to ask if I&#39;d like another glass.  If he improves his delivery he could actually be a great waiter.

Ancillary help was great - our water glasses were never even half empty.

Food:
-- Cornbread is heavenly
-- Others in my party loved the oysters
--  Paella is a different take on paella if you&#39;ve been to Spain or a true Spanish restaurant
-- Halibut wrapped in bacon with chowder is great
-- chicken was fine

But if you don&#39;t order desert you&#39;ll leave hungry.  Portions are small.  In of itself that&#39;s not a problem - I don&#39;t need to be stuffed - but you like to leave a restaurant comfortably full.  In this case we left, walked over to 16th street, walked by Anthony&#39;s, and I was really tempted to order a slice of pizza.

Wine pours were average but reasonably priced.

IMO, a good restaurant.  Not a destination restaurant.  Unfortunate since their location rocks."

A few things start... Cocktails were delicious. Our lobster was poorly portioned, very minimal meat for a high price --- don&#39;t give me a portion of a tail you know there is no meat on and is going to go straight into the dump bucket. The Mexican shrimps was mediocre. The house salad was delicious. I don&#39;t think I can give it a 50/50 rating. More on the 40/60. 40 great 60 subpar.

The oysters were fresh and served with a yummy mignonette. I had two west coast varieties.  I love oysters. I had the hamachi sashimi. The fish was very fresh but I wanted a more balanced flavor.  I felt the harissa was the heaviest flavor on the plate, while delicious, I found myself wanting more citrus, perhaps the lime wasn&#39;t coming through for me.

I also had the fritto misto.  I know it says feta crema and piquillo coulis but I couldn&#39;t help but think franks red hot and blue cheese through this dish. With that being said, it was tasty.

The lemon sage soda and vodka was a nice drink. I would get it again.  Refreshing. 

I would love to try this place again for supper.  I enjoyed lunch but with how fresh and creative everything was, I think it would be enjoyed best with a group that likes to share so you could try multiple dishes.

Service was exceptional and I was well taken care of.  Thank you."

After some great beers at the Thirsty Lion (I tired a flight of 6 from their 52!) my girlfriend and I were hungry for dinner and Stoic &amp; Genuine looked like a great choice for quality seafood.

Heading in on the later side (9:30pm) our waiter did not seem annoyed or ready to head home. He offered suggestions on drinks and I chose the The Eleanor Zissou made with Bulliet Rye, Benidictine, house made ginger syrup and Colorado peach granita. This was a great suggestion as I could clearly taste the bourbon and the other flavors mixed very well for a evenly rounded cocktail.

S&amp;G  has several granitas (shaved &amp; flavored ice) to choose from. 

My girlfriend had the One Foot Off the Merry-Go-Round
with Mell vodka, blackberry, basil syrup &amp; lemon juice. She didn&#39;t add a granita and liked the drink but found it a bit sweet for her taste. 

Wanting to try a little of several things we started with raw oysters: the stoic (Long Island Sound, NY) Kaipara (Kaipara Harbour, New Zealand) and one from Washington. My favorite was the stoic but my girlfriend preferred the Kaipara. The oysters came on ice with sides of fresh horseradish, cocktail sauce, mignonette and wedges of lemon. All were good. 

We then tried the Hawaiian Tataki, which comes with coriander-seared Kajiki, Rocky Ford melon &amp; chimichurri sauce. The plate came with four pieces of fish, melon and dabs of the sauce. They all worked excellently together. 

We also tried the flash Seared Georges Bank Scallop in a champagne basil consomme with Palisade peaches. I love the use of Colorado peaches and they helped offset the salty flavor of the scallops, which I believe were crusted in something. 

The chef surprised us with an order of fried clams with aioli sauce. The batter was crispy but not heavy and the sauce a good complement to the clams. 

For our main course we shared the Bacon Wrapped Halibut &#34;Chowder&#34; with Bang&#39;s Island mussels, surf clams, Colorado corn, shiitake mushrooms and Yukon Gold potatoes. The kitchen split the dish without us asking (major points for this!). It was a good portion even split 

It is not a cheap restaurant but it was well worth it. The only downside I can see about S&amp;G is that the restrooms are shared with all Union Station restaurants, stores and travelers. I&#39;ll definitely come back."

Our inspiration was the incredible the yellow tail collar at Izakaya Den. Most fish places aren&#39;t open for lunch but thankfully the constant buzz at Union Station ensures that Stoic and Genuine stays open, even at 2:15pm. Our waiter was hyper aware and professional attendant. He knew exactly when to appear. He perfectly setup the meal into sections with great wine pairing. Please eat the haddock and eat the tail, fins - under belly juicy pieces here, even the face!  They taste like the sea or a Great Lake.

It&#39;s amazing when a business like this takes the time to improve in every category even in the early stages of their initial opening. 

First off if you&#39;re making a reservation ask to be served by Michael, he&#39;s excellent and will guide you through a fabulous dinner experience. 

Next if anything isn&#39;t exceptional make sure you find the very caring and skilled manager Alaina to help you meet your needs. 

While I think Stoic &amp; Genuine is still a work in progress, they have quickly met the needs of picky guests like myself in an effort to raise the standard of service and the overall quality of the dining experience. 

On my last visit we had more totally delish oysters. Seriously, order one of each and have a tasting journey...

Def want to try the Sardine-- it&#39;s amazing!! Really just get it and you will be glad you did. 

The Louie salad is spot on and very very good. Not huge so don&#39;t make it an entree, but loaded with flavor. 

The heirloom tomato salad lacked the punch and flavor I would hope for, and seemed a bit bland, but it was still good-- just not amazing. 

Shrimp cocktail was good, really nice sized shrimp and fresh-- but I hate having to ask for fresh horseradish. Just bring it fully equipped and ready for all needs and tastes. I will add that service when anything requested was prompt and very caring! 

The crudos are really really really good. So many great flavors and very fresh fish. You will want to try them all... 

The highlight is the King Crab, I will be back for that alone soon! If you&#39;re a crab lover or even just like it, you will find the very best and most flavorful king crab in Denver!! Yummmmmm....

Again I want to commend the service and each food runner we experienced. 

On the downside, desert was really blah and needs some improvement. Had a wanna be banannas foster and it was an imposter at best. Table beside us seemed to complain a bit about their chocolate cake desert too. They seem to be trying this fancy play on thing, but it&#39;s keeping them from achieving the excellence they strive for. 

Overall I am excited about S&amp;G and will be going back again soon! 

The food is really good, super fresh seafood, and the service has improved by leaps and bounds. 

Hopefully they will nail the deserts soon too!"

You think Stoic &amp; Genuine is a 4 star place. Well, it is close to a 4 star place if you don&#39;t mind spending too much money for what you get and if you really like shellfish, which, by the way, isn&#39;t fish . . . it&#39;s shellfish . . . which I like . . . but which . . . isn&#39;t fish.

Went there for my birthday dinner thinking &#34;fish&#34; and came away thinking &#34;those are very nice people who work there.&#34; Prolly not the best review result for a restaurant I was so looking forward to try.

Best dish of the night was definitely the pricey scallop crudo. A great tasting appetizer with a neat mixture of accompaniments that each added an extra kick to the final taste sensation. The dish was delicious and shareable. You should get it if you go. The rest of the meal, however, just didn&#39;t measure up.

Did, however, appreciate that they&#39;re very serious about their food there. The dishes were all crafted with different layers of flavor and textures and even visual appeal. It was just that with the one exception of the scallop crudo I didn&#39;t really like the tastes very much or didn&#39;t think that they were worth the expense. 

For example, the Stoic brand oysters were good, but not worth $3.25 a piece, say what you will about transportation costs. The broccoli salad was nice in that the mini-florets were perfectly cooked al dente and the small slivered apples were a nice touch with the unusual mixture of avocado and sunflower seeds, but it was all a bit overwhelmed by the ponzu-like dressing/sauce so it ended up tasting like some broccoli florets in ponzu. 

Their cornbread was very good, but paying for cornbread by the slice seemed a little tacky, especially when no bread is offered as part of the overhead (Parker House rolls were also on the menu, but similarly priced ala carte).

For the main course we split the whole crispy haddock (their only true pure fish dish) also served in a ponzu-like sauce that was the main flavor of the dish. The Brussels sprouts in a creamy but not overwhelming sauce with some gently candied hazelnuts provided a nice side that supplied most of the flavor when paired with the haddock.

Speaking about value, however, they did have a very affordable and very reasonably priced Gruner Veltliner at around $30+ from Austria that was well matched with the haddock. Dessert was generously offered by the house (along with a surprise birthday card which was a bit weird--getting a card signed by all the staff who you don&#39;t know, but it was an interesting marketing idea that was kinda cute). The bread pudding offered was good, not great.

So, indeed, it ended up being a surprise birthday party . . . as in, gee, I&#39;m surprised that I didn&#39;t like it as much as I thought I would. But I guess any surprise on your birthday is worth something.

Nick and his waitress are both really nice- when we sat down Nick came out from the kitchen to give my son a matchbox car.  Not only was this a really kind gesture, but as any parent of a 2 yr old can attest, a new toy to capture your child&#39;s attention during a meal is worth its weight in gold!

For the food- I got a breakfast burrito smothered in green chili, my wife got the spicy Italian sausage omelet, and we ordered 1 pancake for our kiddo (after the waitress recommended that the short stack would probably be too much).  First, the portions were really big, I don&#39;t think any of us cleaned our plates.  The burrito was tasty, and my wife who doesn&#39;t usually like omelets enjoyed hers.  The pancake was fluffy and delicious, although my son really just wanted to eat the bacon.  

On the way out Nick recommended a free car show just down the street, so we had some bonus family fun that morning as well."

But small family owned dinners are where the best food is served in my opinion and Nick&#39;s doesn&#39;t disappoint. Remember to bring cash and don&#39;t show up in large groups.

Once inside, it is immediately obvious that this place has charm and character.  Decorated with Elvis memorabilia, Nick&#39;s was a blast from the past.  The restaurant was clean, Nick and the staff were friendly, our order was quickly delivered and it was absolutely delicious!

I get it, I think. Regulars and people that know them, love the owners, and yes, that&#39;s worth a lot. People love the atmosphere - I get that too. You really have to experience the atmosphere to understand it. By most standards, it&#39;s too small, the furnishings too old, the tables and chairs too close together, and the walls too cluttered with Elvis memorabilia, but somewhere midst all these &#34;toos&#34; is a quirky and indescribable charm. Prices are good - hard to find comparable breakfast or lunch prices elsewhere. I also appreciate their support of/commitment to law enforcement - we sat at a corner table beneath a number of pictures honoring fallen law enforcement individuals.

Many other Yelpers have commented on the cash only policy. Not really a problem, but good for diners to know in advance. Disposable cups and cutlery also doesn&#39;t generate much enthusiasm. Our food was fine. There were 4 of us, we chose 4 different breakfasts, and all were fine. &#34;World&#39;s greatest gyros&#34; seems to be a theme in many reviews, and none of our breakfasts included gyros, so there&#39;s one good reason for us to come back. We will also come back for the overall &#34;experience&#34; - I can honestly say I&#39;ve never been to another place quite like Nick&#39;s. But the food itself (while perfectly fine) and the dining experience per se, disposable cups and cutlery included, wouldn&#39;t, on their own, bring me back. I really did enjoy Nick&#39;s, and really will go back, but at the end of the day when I do all the math, I still come up with 3 stars."

I got two pancakes, 2 eggs, and home fries. The first time I went the food was pretty good, but I didn&#39;t finish the home fries. Today I went and the food was even better- I finished it all. The portions are large and prices are low. Nick&#39;s story of how he met Elvis is intriguing and he really is a great guy. I can&#39;t wait to try the breakfast sandwich.

Me and my girlfriend are from CA and decided to see her favorite band play at Red Rocks. We always Yelp local places to avoid any chain-type restaurants.  Not that chain restaurants are necessarily bad. It&#39;s just that we like going where locals go.

So as we&#39;re planning our trip. I Yelped breakfast joints and Nick&#39;s comes up. Good ratings. So, ok we have Nick&#39;s at the top of the list.

We arrived the day before the concert and hit Nick&#39;s after we get settled in town....AND WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!!

Nick&#39;s was AMAZING! Quaint,  quirky. The ambience was excellent. What we loved was all the cool Elvis memorabilia strewn upon every wall (including the bathroom). They even have Elvis hot sauce (try the green one).

Nick was there cooking away. The wait staff was beyond cool. One waitress. I believe was his wife, told us a story about Nick and Elvis. When Elvis came to Denver. If you go, have her tell you the story. It involves the Fool&#39;s Gold sandwich.

My breakfast was simple bacon, eggs and pancakes. But what was simple was a whole lot more! The food looked like something mom used to make. The bacon was perfectly crisp, my eggs just like I like them. But the pancakes...were epic. Irregular shaped (like mom&#39;s). Not uniformly round like from a Denny&#39;s. The taste. Perfect.

So, the day of the concert. We go for a brunch. I asked our waitress (the same one). What she recommends. She suggested the Rocky Burger. Awesome. A Denver specialty. I couldn&#39;t have been happier! This burger was delicious!  Can&#39;t tell you what&#39;s in it. Just get it. 

My girl had the gyro. Nick has a traditional spit in the kitchen roasting the meat. You can see it cooking away. It was the best ever! The meat was juicy, succulent, spicy. The feta came in slabs. Not crumbles. Again, epic! I love me some feta!

The prices for the meal was pretty cheap.  6-10 dollar range. It&#39;s cash only. Some reviews were pretty against that policy but cash only is pretty smart. Nick doesn&#39;t have to pay the credit card companies their stupid fee for using their machines. So the savings comes in the form of cheap prices. Not cheap food.

Go! Just be a local and go. Tell Nick that the couple from California said Hi! And we&#39;ll be back!"

The aforementioned Nick (a friendly and very affable fellow) fills the role of cook and cashier, and has a fairly straight-forward menu of pro-typical diner food. 

On a recent trip, I had Nick grill up his &#34;Bud&#39;s Burger&#34; which was a pound of meat. It was the size advertised, and very tasty. Nick checked on my satisfaction several times, and kept the restaurants six or so tables happy with food coming, I noticed. 

Nick&#39;s Cafe may be a throwback to another era of dining, but he proves it&#39;s not one to be forgotten. It&#39;s hard to imagine anyone in search of breakfast or straightforward comfort food disappointed in what Nick provides."

However, the food? Meh. Not what people are raving about, at least as far as I can tell. My husband&#39;s breakfast burrito was not very special.  And $2 for a can of coke? Yikes. 

My toast came without butter. My eggs and sausage were okay. There&#39;s no cream for coffee, just those weird unchilled half-and-halfs with an indeterminate shelf life. For that matter, the coffee was served in a styrofoam cup, not a mug.

I have never spent more than $10 for a meal with a tip here.

I&#39;ve had most of the items on the lunch menu and enjoyed everything. The &#34;American Gyro Burger&#34; isn&#39;t listed but is occasionally on the specials board.  It&#39;s awesome - cooked to order with fries, a couple slices of American cheese, and a heapin&#39; helpin&#39; of freshly grilled gyro meat on top - delicious.

My office mates have joined me a couple of times, and an out-of-town work visitor joined a couple of times, and everyone has had great things to say about the food, the service, and the kitschy ambiance.

They serve everything with &#39;picnic&#39; style plastic. Yes. They are cash only.... If you don&#39;t like places like this. DON&#39;T come here. Just don&#39;t.

You&#39;ll LOVE it!! Order Nick&#39;s special breakfast sandwich. Eggs. Green chili. Cheese. And a big, fat Italian sausage. All on Texas toast. Oh yeah. Good eatin...  We came back for lunch the next day just for the gyros. This is the real deal, folks!!! Deeeeeelish!!!! The King reigns supreme in this place and they&#39;ll be happy to share their Elvis stories with ya while Nick cooks up his magic in the kitchen. I love finding goodness like this lil slice of Americana. Family owned and run businesses like Nick&#39;s. Can&#39;t wait til our travels bring us thru again..."

The place looks like a real dump from the road, but don&#39;t be deceived: This is a cool breakfast spot.

HIGHS:

- Atmosphere. Supposedly, the owner Nick used to work for Elvis. The place is stuffed with &#34;old Diner&#34; kitsch (most of which is devoted to Elvis), but it&#39;s the real deal. It&#39;s not stupid kitsch like Johnny Rockets.

- Staff. Really great servers, and Nick himself greets you from the kitchen when you walk in the door.

- Quick service.

- Price. Incredibly inexpensive. Two breakfast burritos and two coffees for $15...including a 20% tip? Stop it. It&#39;s too good to be true.

- Food. It&#39;s good. Nothing special, but definitely not bad. I could see becoming a regular.

- Hilarious sign. It says &#34;Voted #1 by Rick and Al&#34; - who? Funny.

LOWS:

- Parking lot is weird and small.

- No credit cards - CASH only.

- Not a lot of tables. If this place ever catches on (and it should), it&#39;s going to be impossible to get seat.

Bottom Line: IF you live in Golden or Lakewood, cart yourself up to Nick&#39;s for breakfast. It&#39;s worth a look."

I was immediately greeted by Nick and a young waitress. We were seated and had drinks in seconds. They had fresh brewed decaf!  Not really impressive unless you drink decaf and know most places have to brew it fresh and gouge you for the price of an Americana.  My so ordered the egg sandwich with bacon and home fries and I an all American 2 eggs over easy with sausage links and some more of those perfectly cooked yummy skin-on taters.  You can&#39;t go wrong with sourdough bread neither. Pretty laid back little joint with about seating for 10. Love all the Elvis stuff plastered on the walls and the Elvis singing on Elvis serius xm Radio.  Pretty. Fun little place with a small patio as well

They might do this for everybody, or it might just be because I order from them regularly, but they always include free wontons or egg rolls with my order. 

Speaking of the food, I haven&#39;t had a bad dish yet. My favorite so far is the Sesame Chicken meal. I can&#39;t get enough of it!!! I have had many other meals there but all have been fantastic! I still have plenty of dishes to try though as they have a pretty good sized menu.

They have a great location with ample parking. I&#39;ve been coming here for years and there&#39;s always this friendly older woman who gives me a hard time about my food orders (I like it spicy) and is always timely and sweet. The bathrooms are usually clean, there was one time that the ladies room was in serious neglect but other times have been good! The food is fresh and piping hot and they always get my order right. I usually order volcano chicken, but this time I ordered the jalapeño shrimp and they were quite generous with the shrimp! Their hot and sour soup is good here too. I love the wontons and everything on the menu is generously portioned and very affordable!

The reasons I take away a star are because of two minor things. One of them is that the restaurant isn&#39;t really updated, and the decor is lacking. I completely understand saving money on table coverings and dining accessories but the atmosphere feels cheap with the paper covering the tables and open wall space. My second reason for taking away a star is that when we dined here tonight, the lobby was slow. Wednesday night brought maybe 4 tables, and our server was a young Asian woman (high school or college age who I&#39;ve never seen before) and was SLOW. I&#39;m not sure if they cut the staff down on Wednesday nights or what, but service was unusually slow. What would have been a 30 minute meal turned into an hour. These reasons are minor so they wouldn&#39;t stop be from returning here. I&#39;ve been a patron for several years and I&#39;ll definitely keep coming back. :)"

For starters, their food is wildly inconsistent, and not just quality-wise. Depending on who made your food, one dish can seem like a totally different dish between orders. For example, I have had Kung Pao chicken from this place include completely different vegetable combinations and sometimes none at all, with peanuts, no peanuts, in a red sauce and in a brown sauce, diced chicken and big slices, completely devoid of spice and so hot it burned my face off.  This can happen with any dish you order. 

Second, some of their items are complete ripoffs. See my pictures for visuals on what I mean. Their egg rolls are fried spring rolls. The first time I ordered them, I called to explain they had given us spring rolls by mistake. &#34;No, those are egg rolls. They are our version of egg rolls.&#34; was their excuse. I let it slide that time.

However...

This evening my daughter ordered chicken chow mein. She likes the crispy noodles much better than the soft lo mein. Imagine my surprise when we received sliced chicken drowning in soupy, bland white sauce and a bag of FRIED WONTON STRIPS. I call them about the mistake and am told &#34;No, that is chow mein. You meant to order lo mein.&#34;  I explain to the woman at the restaurant that no Chinese place on EARTH would say that the fried wonton strips - you know, the ones you usually get for free in a little paper bag - are chow mein noodles, and that I know what the hell lo mein noodles are. I am from Chicago, for eff&#39;s sake. I ate noodles in Chinatown there and a million other places. Guess what she says?

&#34;Well, that is our version of chow mein.&#34;

No offer for a refund. No makeup order. Nothing. Just a snippety, argumentative jerk who talks down to me. I told her I would never order from them again and hung up.

Done. So very done with this joke of a Chinese American restaurant. I will take my business to Bangkok Tokyo or P.F. Chang&#39;s."

I have lived on both east and the west coast and have had terrible small town Chinese and authentic(entire menu in Chinese) 
Cafe Ambrosia is a generic pan-asian style eatery.

I am still trying to figure out how they make their food. For instance their chow mein is a thick soup, where I was expecting fried noodles with very minimal sauce. Maybe their pan fried noodles are actually what I&#39;m looking for? Their egg rolls are very greasy as well, not such a big fan.  The wonton soup is pretty questionable, so is the fried rice. The noodle bowls are cold, and the noodles are plain, sauceless noodles - just an FYI

Ive ordered from here a few times and some good options are general tso, orange chx/beef, their plain wings are bomb.

 I really think they should lower their prices.  For what&#39;s in the area, its similar to everything else in the sense that you will never get authentic Chinese food in this area."

I have never dined in, but we have ordered from them several times over that last few years.  I have to say for the price, you get the freshest, best tasting food in generous portions.  

I love the volcano chicken.  It is hot with out killing your tongue.  They pile on the chicken and give you a great variety of mixed veggies (not just bamboo shoots and water chestnuts!).  Plus you can get brown rice with your entree!  A nice little touch.

We ordered through GrubHub, and we ordered one orange beef, one pineapple shrimp, one vegetable lo mein, and a strawberry boba drink (hold the boba, since it was for my three-year-old). Delivery took roughly forty-five minutes, but the food arrived very hot (and the boba drink was bagged separately to keep it cold- which I appreciate!) and fresh.

All the veggies- from the lo mein (to the veggie-filled pineapple shrimp) were super fresh, still a bit crunchy, and had flavor. They don&#39;t cheap out on their vegetables here, and nothing seemed frozen/wilted/cooked within an inch of its life. The lo mein was simple, but really tasty and firm- my daughter commented to me: &#34;Mommy, these are REALLY good noodles!&#34; (and she&#39;s in a picky phase right now). The pineapple shrimp was delicate in flavor- and a bit sweet, but not syrupy. It was light and the shrimp were firm (not rubbery or overcooked) and fresh (not deep-fried, either). The orange beef came sliced very thin and lightly battered and sauced (it was still super crispy, not soggy at all) on a bed of those fried rice noodles- we ordered it medium, but it wasn&#39;t very spicy, so if you&#39;re hoping for spice maybe ask for extra spicy. The flavor was excellent, though! 

Even the fried rice that accompanied the entrées was good- simple, but good texture (not mushy, not dry) and had flavor, but wasn&#39;t overpowering. The boba was probably the highlight for my daughter, and it came topped with whipped cream- needless to say, she loved it.

Even though we ordered through GrubHub and didn&#39;t apply a coupon, the delivery lady informed me we&#39;d gotten free crab cheese wontons- which I thought was a really nice touch! She was also very pleasant- I imagine this is a family-run place with mom doing deliveries. 

All in all, Café Ambrosia was excellent. Portion sizes were great, food was fresh and flavorful, and nothing was overly sweet or overly battered/fried. We&#39;ll be back, Ambrosia! (and please consider being open on Christmas day this year, since I don&#39;t want to order from anyone else now!)"

 I love pork fried rice.  I grew up with it, it&#39;s what I am used to.  How I am used to it is this....Roasted Pork...the red kind not where it looks like someone cut up a pork chop and threw it in.  Onions...lots of them, both yellow and green, bamboo shoots and peas and carrots.  Yes, I know there is supposed to be egg, but I am allergic so I leave that out.  

This is what to my glorious surprise Cafe Ambrosia gave me.  With the addition of just a touch of white pepper at the end.  An extremely generous plastic tray of it piled so high it sticks to the lid, not the traditional oyster pail.  I was overjoyed to find this place.  I will go out of my way 8 months of the year to get there because the other 4 I am at a tax office close by.  I have had saplings of their other dishes when friends order them, but that is what I go for when I go.  I have done both eat in and carry out so both are consistent on portion and taste."

They are definitely one of the cheaper Chinese places around (like $20 for the same amount of food we get for $30 elsewhere). Delivery is quick and painless.

My standard with Chinese food is either chicken fried rice or sweet and sour chicken. I&#39;m not terribly impressed with their chicken fried rice, altho it&#39;s decent. They put bean sprouts in there (which no else does) and I really don&#39;t like those, but as long as I eat around them I&#39;m good :)

The Panang curry was decent, but we&#39;ve had much better even in the Aurora area. And the hot &amp; sour soup had a kind of coppery flavor.

I won&#39;t go into detail (for a good description check out Jese S&#39;s review).  The Mongolian Beef was a very generous serving.  It had lots of tender beef, tons of al dente onions, and absolutely zero mystery ingredients (like random celery).  The flavor was nice, if not that strong.  I could have used a little more heat.  The white rice on the side was moist and perfectly cooked (I am surprised how many places cannot seem to get this right).  The wontons were good, and they even threw in an extra order of them.  They were not my favorite wontons, as I prefer a crispier more heavily deep fried take on them, while these were lighter and more &#34;baked&#34; in appearance."

I guess they had a large volume of calls tonight because the wait was 45 minutes and the very nice lady on the phone kept asking me if I was sure we would be ok. She said that we could pick it up at any time if we wanted. Just having had dental work done an hour prior I told her that it was fine, nobody here was starving.

It was definitely over 5 mins but definitely under 10 so I would say it probably took them 7 mins.

I ordered on their website dinner last night--We decided to try them because of the star ratings on Yelp! (Got to love Yelp!!).  Ordered Chicken Chow Mein, Chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and sesame Beef.  We ordered also 2 vegetarian Egg Rolls.  I put the order in at 6:16.  I read yelp and saw @Bridget B state the order took a long time.  So I called, let them know I put it in on the internet. She pulled the order up and said, yes we have it.  At 7:45 I called and asked where the order was? They said, sorry it is on the way.  At 8:10 the order arrived. They must have known it was really late, as they threw in for free Crab and Cream Cheese Wontons. (By the way, you should call, apologize and ask what a customer wants as a freebie.  For Religious reasons we do not eat Pork, shrimp, crab--Any bottom feeder).  I appreciated that they wanted to show an apology.  But calling would have created a better impact.  Letting us know it was late.. I didn&#39;t even need anything free.  By the way--The food--Chow Mein, best I&#39;ve had in a long time.  Fresh and good.  Chicken fried rice and sweet and sour was alright.  Sesame beef had a strange flavor to it. I wasn&#39;t a fan of it.  I truly would have given them 3  with a down for the beef.

I ordered 3 dinners, each with egg rolls and fried rice. After I ordered all 3 this way, she abruptly and irritably said &#34;It&#39;s dinner time, they&#39;re all dinners, they don&#39;t come with egg rolls and the rice IS fried.&#34; I had spoken with someone before her that said it will come with egg rolls if I order it as a dinner, so I asked why was the story different now? I was told that to get them, it would be $10 more. I wanted 3. $10? Um. No. They could charge me for 4 egg rolls, but didn&#39;t tell me that price. If we spent $30+, we got 8 free wontons. Fine. They said it&#39;d be 45-hour for delivery. An hour and 20 minutes later, our order arrives, but they don&#39;t have a receipt for me, so I don&#39;t know what the price is, don&#39;t have any idea what to tip the driver and have no proof of anything I&#39;ve ordered. Super. We get our order out and discover the sesame chicken and general tao&#39;s is soggy and warmish. There is zero flavor with the sesame and the chicken and broccoli, which tastes and looks like it was simply steamed, except for some reason it&#39;s slimy. The wontons were empty except for a thin layer that looked like rubber around the edges. I took pictures. It&#39;s disgusting. The rice was closer to steamed than fried and again, zero flavor, plus, we only got one container of it instead of separate containers for each item as ordered. My 6 year old would eat chinese every night, but wouldn&#39;t take a 2nd bite of this crap. My husband and 12 year old eat like it&#39;s the last time and they wouldn&#39;t take more than a few bites. I don&#39;t like to waste food, so I will eat even if I don&#39;t like it because I was raised that way. My stomach was turning. So I got to make dinner at 7:00 p.m. as well as paying for food that was simply not edible. I called after taking a bite of the chicken and they offered to come pick it up for a refund. We had just waited 80 minutes for it to get there though and I figured we would just tough it out and I made some quick gravy to make the chicken palatable. Fail. That was before I tasted the rice, the wontons or the broccoli. I didn&#39;t want to have to cook, wait for another place to deliver or have to leave the house as this is what I was trying to avoid, so I said no. They offered 20% off. Told me I was not the only customer waiting. Really? THAT&#39;S supposed to make me feel better? Then said, &#34;Well we gave you the wontons for free&#34;. Oooh! I ended up getting 50% off after arguing with her, but I think they should have paid me to throw out their &#34;food&#34;."

In all of the places  I have lived, Philly has some awesome restaurants.  So, I have pretty high &#34;standards&#34; and opinions of what good/great chop suey should be.

The food at Cafe Ambrosia is pretty good, but not really tradtional chop suey.  If you want that, check out China Chef III/China Chef Express or Little Panda.  (Wonton soup, egg foo young, fried rice, egg roll)

I liken Cafe Ambrosia&#39;s food (at least what I order) to a fusion between chop suey and PF Changs.

The good:
Fried rice (not like traditional chop suey)
Tofu black mushrooms
Orange chicken
Crab cheese wontons
Kung Pao chicken

While their wonton soup is okay, it&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve had.  I don&#39;t think that I remember a place in CO with really good/traditional chop suey wonton soup (wontons, broth, roast pork strips, +/- napa).

I order at least once a month from here...a lot considering that I only eat Chinese 2 times a month and eat out once a week.

If not for their tofu+black mushrooms Ivery reasonable price), I&#39;d probably alternate or go to Paradise Asian Cafe instead."

After a three-year-long search, I may have found a go-to Chinese joint to satisfy my occasional bottomless-stomach-pit-syndrome and the perfect cure for hangovers. The best Chinese restaurant, it is not. But it certainly serves up good food and plenty of it at a low cost. The location of the restaurant is not fancy if not down right sketchy after dark.  It is after all, located on East Colfax, in a strip mall by the walmart and across the street from a pawn shop.  So it&#39;s divvy, but I have special love for divvy, hole-in-the-wall joints with awesome food. It is important to order the right food from here as there is quite a few on the menu that are bland. The good ones I&#39;ve tasted thus far are: Moo shu chicken, chicken with garlic sauce, beef with broccoli, sesame tofu, steamed dumplings (you can get these suckers fried also) and eggrolls.  I also like their shrimp in lobster sauce - it is more soupy than saucy and features rather subtle flavors... and it tends to be on the bland side but for some reason, I like it... just salt it and eat it.  Their kung pao and szechuan dishes taste almost identical to each other as do the meat + cashew dishes. These are just average or below as are their lo-mein and fried rice. 
Cost wise, their lunch or dinner combo deals can&#39;t be beat - rice + main dish + eggroll for 4-6 buckaroos!"

I&#39;ve had a few of the other Chinese places around here and wasn&#39;t impressed. I was pleasantly surprised today that there is something decent in the area.

When I called to place an order for delivery, the lady that answered the phone was friendly and pleasant. The food was delivered in the time promised (I actually think it came a little sooner to be honest). And the price was reasonable.

The food itself wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had, but it was definitely in a higher tier. The Mongolian beef was smoky and had just the right amount of spicy. Too many times I&#39;ve had food that claims to be spicy and its bland. Also, I&#39;ve had the experience when the cook will go to the other extreme, and add so much heat that my taste buds are overpowered and I can&#39;t taste any other favors. This was a happy medium, right at the mythical place where the heat tickles the tongue and actually adds to the flavor, instead of taking away.

Like I already mentioned, this is my first go at this place, so I can&#39;t speak for everything on the menu. But I can say I was quite pleased with this experience, and would recommend someone else give it a try."

The restaurant is very nicely decorated. But the complete lack of windows is strange and a bit depressing. Everyone I have been to the Rail with mentions it. One friend described it as a &#34;bomb shelter.&#34; 

The owners are clearly chasing a more upscale market than the typical sports bar/restaurant - and the prices reflect that fact. The Happy Hour is OK, but not anything I would drive out of my way for (wine is a very good deal at HH though).  

Food: - Let&#39;s get to the star of the menu - the handmade Gouda stuffed &#34;tater tots.&#34; These are the item that everyone raves about and keeps us coming back. I&#39;m pretty sure I could eat my body weight in these - and I ain&#39;t skinny. If you are in a party of four or more - get at least two orders or be prepared for someone getting a fork in their hand when they go for a third tot. 

We have been to the Rail often enough and in large enough groups to have tried a substantial portion of the menu. Everything is ok, but little has stood out, other than the Southern Fried Chicken. Ordering that means you are going to have friends begging for a bite of the delicious breaded breast. The Garlic cheddar mashed potatoes are also popular. 

Failure: - The French Onion Soup. This is a personal crusade on my part. Nothing annoys me more than a restaurant that puts this highly profitable item on the menu and then offers up a bowl of weak bouillon with a half melted slice of indifferent cheese draped over a chunk of stale bread. You want to offer French Onion soup? Take the time to make a hearty beef stock and let it simmer with the onions until they are melt in your mouth soft. Then serve it in a crock with a thick slice of crisp bread slathered in cheese. Put it under a broiler until the cheese is black, brown and golden.

The Rail serves up luke warm bouillon over a piece of bread. They crisp the thin layer of cheese with a propane torch. Not acceptable! If you are going to charge $8 for a bowl of soup it damn well better blow me away! This fiasco cost the Rail a full star on this review. 

The service is usually very good. Once we had a new waitress who seemed a bit overwhelmed by a table of six and who knew little about the menu or specials. But she was nice. 

The Rail has promise - but they need to punch some holes in the back wall and make an effort to step up the food if they want to be more of a restaurant than a sports bar."

We had the handmade tater tots, the rib eye with onion rings and mac and cheese, the tavern cordon bleu, the beef tips, and the southern fried chicken.  Everything was delicious.  The poblano white cheddar mashed potatoes with sausage gravy was a huge hit.  So rich and creamy!  The rib eye was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  We also tried a couple dessert, the lemon poppy seed cake and the chocolate peanut butter cake...so good!

And the drinks...not the usual bar cocktails.  Perfectly mixed and so refreshing.  The staff was great.  Everyone was attentive and fun.  Definitely check them out, I know we will definitely be back!  Cheers!"

The ambiance was a little weird. The bathroom with the pink mosaic tiles were even weirder. The main dining room was filled with about 8 tables of old ladies playing some kind domino-like game. The place looked dated but worn-in and comfortable, a place where a lot of good memories were created but also a place that has seen better days. 

The chicken wings come smoked, which is unusual. They are tiny but delicious.  Tasted like tiny turkey drumsticks. The cheese stuffed tater tots with chipotle ketchup were ok but not as good as they sounded.  Everything else we had(burger, fish sandwich, etc) were average. 

Their specialty appears to be steaks and other grilled meats. Maybe we should  have gone that route."

We ask do the manager, 15 minutes later (not exaggerating) we have to ask for him again. Mind you now there are 2 more tables. So still not busy, finally manager/owner meets is at the door as we are walking out. We explained our situation and he said &#34;well, shit happens&#34;.

The first time we came for Superbowl in February 2016. It was walking distance from our apartment and had big screens showing the game. And happy hour all day. We sampled everything on the happy hour menu and ordered drinks for a good few hours and came away full, happy, and without spending too much money. The chorizo sliders were the best, plus super crispy homemade chips. The bartender was even such a friendly guy that he kept offering us jello shots (in Broncos colors of course!), which made us feel like part of the family! Great experience, so much fun, and great food. 

Second visit was just today, me and one girlfriend for dinner. The service was quick and friendly (Rachel was our server, thank you!), we had a variety of food and drinks, and again came away without feeling robbed. The food was all delicious. Burger (dinner menu) was enormous for only $12, and again the sliders were delicious for just $2 each. They had a good selection of 4 different happy hour beers for $4, including an IPA, Blue Moon, and an IPL. 

A bonus about this place is that happy hour goes from 3-7pm, and you can sit anywhere in the restaurant for happy hour. Plus if you get there a little late and want to eat dinner, it&#39;s delicious and not too expensive. I&#39;m coming back again!"

I had never been and I&#39;m very much a creature of habit when it comes to food. However, that was the best experience I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant. Most servers at nice restaurants look at my boyfriend and I (a couple of twenty somethings) and assume that because of our age we won&#39;t tip well and we receive terrible service. Rachel, our waitress that evening, treated us with respect and was very attentive. The food was impeccable, I couldn&#39;t get it into my mouth fast enough! Dessert wasn&#39;t an option until we saw the menu and then we quickly changed our minds. I never eat the icing off of cake because of how sweet it usually is but I damn near licked my plate clean that night! That man in the kitchen certainly knows what he&#39;s doing!!!"

Came here with a large group following a graduation ceremony. Service was fast, and attentive. Everyone was welcoming, friendly, and really knew their stuff. Right away we were impressed with the knowledge of the server on the beer menu. They have a huge variety of beer on tap, and an awesome selection of rotating seasonal beers. She made great suggestions, and the Jack Daniels on nitro is so smooth you would think its a $100 whiskey. 

The menu looked really good, but the prices were so reasonable that we were not expecting more than your normal bar food. Boy were we surprised. First of all, after living in New Mexico, I have a whole different appreciation for what green chili should be, and this is the best I have found in Colorado. None of this green chili sauce bull*** ... its big, beautiful chunks of roasted green chili. I had it on the Wheat Ridge Philly, and the Green Chili Mac n Cheese. Delicious!

The quality of the food was what you would expect in a much more expensive restaurant. Everything was so delicious, the appetizers were amazing, and everything was so full of flavor. We ordered a lot of tapas for the table before receiving our meals, and everything was great. I had the Philly (as I stated before) and members of my group also had the burgers (HUGE and amazing looking) the Mahi Mahi (YUM!) and the steak (cooked perfectly) not a single person had anything bad to say. In fact, there wasn&#39;t a lot of conversation going on because everyone was chowing down so hard. 

Stop by here. You will not regret it."

Much of the menu is fried, and the &#34;special house chips&#34; were overcooked (fried), dry and tasteless.  The fish and chips were OK, but once again fried within an inch of their life.  The fried chicken ordered by another diner were bland but acceptable once salt was added for some flavor.  The waitress said that the fried chicken was her favorite dish on the menu - we were not impressed.

The room was bland and unexceptional.  A door standing open on one end of the dining room revealed shelving and part of the kitchen.  Not an appetizing sight in a dining room that looked like it had been designed by an amateur.  Dark grey and black carpet tiles on the floor were dreary.  Off white walls gave an institutional feel with brown soffits that added to the dreary atmosphere.  The diners themselves were the only life and color in the room.  And black tablecloths?  I understand they are easier to keep looking clean, but the room desperately needs to be lightened up.  There are no windows and it was like dining in a dungeon.

The waitstaff is willing and enthusiastic, which added a nice touch, but they need more to work with.  This restaurant/bar needs an infusion of freshness and color."

To our delight, it far surpassed our expectations. The steak and accompanying sides were delicious, there was plenty of beer on tap, and most of all the service was just outstanding.

First I want to say that the waitress we have was absolutely great, her service was excellently  refreshing and we really enjoyed having her as a waitress. And the tater tots we ordered as an appetizer were really good. But that is where the goodness ended. I got the macaroni and cheese and chicken and it was swimming in the cheese sauce and it was bland, no seasoning no taste whatsoever. very disappointing. the other people in our party ordered the signature hamburger, both of them said that that it  was very bland no seasoning to the meat  the only taste that they got was from the mushrooms and bacon on the burger. And the fries were all mushy not crispy at all. Very disappointed."

I was immediately welcomed not only by the great bartender, but also by most of the locals dining/drinking there. I had some pretty conversations, while enjoying some local brew, followed by a good Manhattan, and a pretty good steak. Price-wise it was very reasonable (this is from a Seattleite driving from Vegas, so YMMV), and it was one of the few places open a bit later.

Overall a very solid place to have a great time if you&#39;re around West Denver, craving good food and drinks, and you don&#39;t want to end at a national chain."

Glad I did- Excellent! The food was delicious and the service was great. We came in for Sunday brunch. They have a good variety to suit all appetites. I had the IRT omelette which was as tasty as it looked. My brother ordered the Southern Style Fried Chicken. He too loved it. And the generous portions are always a plus. All staff was friendly, restaurant was clean, a great place all around. I&#39;m excited to go back and try their steak."

Waited nearly 20 minutes when we got there to find out they gave our table away while we were waiting. The girl at the desk kept disappearing and the manager or whatever he was didn&#39;t acknowledge us or anybody else waiting for a table. We were not the only ones that left without getting seated. Looked like the crowd was older, 55+ and the menu wasn&#39;t very alluring anyway.  The atmosphere and the crowd reminded me of an old country club. I won&#39;t bother coming back."

I looked at their website, was pleased with the menu, read some positive reviews, and even saw that I could make reservations by email.  Excellent - I love the efficiency of that.  Sent in an email late Saturday morning, requesting a reservation for four for 8pm that evening.  No reply all day and it was getting close to dinner time, so at 7:15 I called to ask about the status of our reservation.  Girl on the phone had no clue what I was talking about, so I was passed off to someone else.  He also seemed very confused, so I walked him through the website, saying that on the &#34;Contact&#34; page, it said to email reservations to info@ironrailtavern.com and his reply was &#34;oh, that goes to the owner&#39;s email address, he probably forgot to tell anyone&#34;.  First red flag. I asked if they would still be able to accommodate us and he replied in the affirmative.   

My girlfriend and I walked in (at 8pm on a Saturday) and were greeted by an empty table/desk that apparently doubles as the hostess stand, as evidenced by the menus strewn across its top; I flagged down someone official-looking in the dining room to see about getting our table.  A couple of servers and what appeared to be a GM-type hustled over and couldn&#39;t decide where to put us.  Someone finally suggested table 22 - I think that was the number, I don&#39;t recall exactly - more to the point, nobody who worked there seemed to know where that particular table was located and they settled on an 8-top in the corner of the dining room.  On our way to the table the GM-type said instead of sticking us in the corner he&#39;d put us at the 4-top right in the middle of the dining room.  

Ok, fine, just a tiny wrinkle, right?  Not so fast - it seems that the dining room, inexplicably, is situated in between the kitchen and the dish hole. Now, I may be wrong about the layout and if anyone who works there is reading this and would care to educate me, I&#39;d love to know, because it was unbelievably distracting and annoying to have a constant parade of busboys rattling back and forth past our table with bins full of dirty (then clean, etc) dishware, glasses, silverware - it felt like we were intruding on prep for the day.   

We sat down, got our menus, aaannndddd the menu was different than the version posted on their website.  Not entirely different, but not the same - and no notice on the site that the menu varies.  Just another wrinkle, nothing to get upset about, right?  English teachers and spelling geeks beware - they don&#39;t have a proofreader on staff, so you may want to have a drink before you open the menu, fortunately they have a very good selection of local beers on tap, I was pleased to see Odell&#39;s Cutthroat Porter, an old favorite. 

On to the food - we started with their specialty, the House Made Tater Tots, which are stuffed with smoked gouda and served with a house made chipotle ketchup.  Not bad, but unevenly cooked - the bottom was almost burnt while the top was light golden.  Eh, just a little wrinkle, right?  We also ordered the pork belly appetizer and were informed that the table behind us ordered the last portion.   Memo to every server everywhere - the proper response in that situation is &#34;I&#39;m sorry, our kitchen ran our of that tonight&#34;, don&#39;t point at another table and say that they did it.  Poor form, but just another wrinkle, right?   The highlight of the night was the Baked Marinated Feta, which was served sided by sauteed spinach and toasted baguette - a perfect small plate, truly excellent.

Entrees - My girlfriend ordered the Black Truffle and Porcini Ravioli, purportedly served with a Parmesan cream. What she got was a bowl of Parmesan cream soup with raviolis floating in it - drowning food in sauce makes it look like you are hiding the food. I ordered the Beef Short Ribs, served with chipotle mashed potatoes, but it looked and tasted like something from a cafeteria, the cut of meat wholly unidentifiable and drowned in sauce. At first there was no sign of the mashed potatoes, until I finally located them buried under the heaping pile of shredded meat, chopped onions and mushrooms, and lifeless grey sauce. Anyone who flew a lot in the 80s and 90s would recognize it as airline Beef Bourgignon. 
    
Throughout the night there were no fewer than three men in dress shirts who were milling about the dining room, having hushed conversations with each other, and with servers, and occasionally checking on tables.  No clue who if they were owners, or GM-types, because none of them ever introduced themselves.   Just a little wrinkle, right?  

All in all the experience was so disjointed that it felt like we were there on the first night of dinner service, but Iron Rail has been open for more than three months, one would think that would be sufficient time to at least iron out the wrinkles in the red flags that kept popping up, but they couldn&#39;t even take an email reservation.  They have a ways to go"

For my friends that don&#39;t like to read lengthy reviews... I&#39;d say try at your own risk.
First of all, I know that shtuff can happen and a reservation at a busy restaurant is tough to manage (A half of an hour wait? Maybe best not to take reservations?). They did apologize a lot (I wonder if that was because the reservation was made on their Yelp listing) and comped us a small sampling of their &#34;new&#34; tater tots. 
We ordered two items off of the Tapas (or what I call appetizers) menu. The Pork Belly ($8) and the rec&#39;d by our server Hickory Smoked Chicken Wings ($6). The pork belly came sliced with a slaw side. Belly was very fatty but cooked decently. It wasn&#39;t super tender but wan&#39;t tough either. The problem was that it was woefully under seasoned and with no discernible smoke flavor. The wings were possibly the worst wings i have ever had. They did have a little smoke to them but had no seasoning whatsoever to the skin (and definitely hadn&#39;t been brined because the flavorlessness ran to the bone). No salt, pepper, herb, or spice and the two sauces they were served with... the Buffalo tasted of either Durkee&#39;s or Frank&#39;s hot sauce and the Bleu Cheese was closer to a thin Ranch.
Our entree orders consisted of the Beef Short Ribs $18  (he likened it to a pulled beef stew), Chicken Mac and Cheese  $13 (she said it tasted similar to a frozen mac with sliced packaged chicken breast), the Iron Rail Signature Burger  $12 (the consensus at the table was that this was the best looking dish. he said it was pretty good.).
I had the Iron Rail Wedge Salad w/Pork Belly Bacon $9
(maybe 5 or six pieces of tiny 1/4 inch cubes of belly, very small dice on the tomatoes, were there red onions?, and the description had the word &#34;balsamic&#34; at the end..? don&#39;t know, It came with an okay housemade bleu cheese dressing that I had on the side.
and the Filet Mignon French Onion Soup $8
It was served in a rather large shallow dish and is not the gratined style (no caramelized cheese). It has a small oval of toast in the middle of the large shallow bowl (I think there was cheese involved? Maybe under the toast?). The broth was good (I didn&#39;t finish it all. That&#39;s saying something.) and the onions plentiful (cooked but it was missing the big flavor that heavy caramelization gives) and the filet mignon was tender (but again cut small and sparse).
I guess being the snob that I am nothing on the beer list held any interest for me (they had run out of Rickoli&#39;s Authoritah :(  but they did have local beers on tap. My wino buddy was disappointed in their selection of reds.
I guess I need to try more of the menu but frankly... I&#39;m almost afraid to. This visit was a MAJOR miss. Hopefully if I get the courage up to try them again it&#39;ll be better the next time around."

If having an incredible 25 draft beer lines on tap wasn&#39;t enough, they also have Jack Daniels on a nitro tap pouring silky-smooth Tennessee whisky. 

Their tater tots rival my favorite tots in the world from Highland Tavern. Don&#39;t miss the mac &amp; cheese! It&#39;s unbelievable, made with creamy smoked Gouda, and available as a side or an entree. We also enjoyed the mahi-mahi fish and chips and the delicious cheese steak. 

Our server, Chris, was awesome offering lots of suggestions for delicious choices and was very attentive.

Not much to look at from the outside, but a full parking lot during happy hour and into dinner time was a good sign.  The interior is where they must have focused the resources of their retrofit, and to good effect; it&#39;s apparent that this was a much different restaurant before.

Our server described their menu as wholly &#34;from-scratch&#34; and made excellent recommendations of the Caesar salad (which has a savory dressing as opposed to tangy or oily), the pork belly (which was smoky and perfectly spicy), and the beet caprese (for my mom, whose appetite is usually very light).  Of all the things I tasted, however, I was most pleased with the green chili.  Green chili can be excellent or it can be horrible, but I got a true sense of the chili itself without too much salt or kick, and covering the home-made potato chip appetizer with thick bacon, it was awesome.

They have $2 Rolling Rock all day every day, so it&#39;s a good thing I don&#39;t work on that side of town.  Their other beverages are well-chosen and on tap (even their Jack Daniels and some wines).

They comped my mom a dessert on her birthday, which is always nice, but in this case it was a gigantic wedge of lemon poppyseed cake which was as delicious as it was generous."

The grilled asparagus was yummy, and the lemondrop martinis were tasty, tasty, tasty.  We topped everything off with the orange chai mousse cake which is just a little slice of heaven.  Yes, it&#39;s a bit spendier than some of our other favorite hangouts, but it&#39;s definitely worth the occasional splurge."

As we walked in I was surprised how spacious the restaurant was. The staff was VERY nice when we walked in and greeted us. As we sat at the table I noticed the fresh clean table cloths. We started with the housemade Tots and spicy ketchup. They were really good. I ordered the burger which was good, I liked that it came with Guda cheese which is not the norm for burgers. They also season their fries with dill and other spices. My sister had the chicken confit. I tried it and it was delicious. Even my nephew&#39;s corn dogs were tasty. We then had to try dessert since all our meals were so great. We had the apple spiced cake, apples foster and the peanut butter chocolate cake. They were all very tasty but the apples foster was my favorite. Our server was amazing. She kept our drinks filled and was very nice. I want to be clear that this 5 starts is based on what I was expecting and what we actually received, from a place that from the outside looks like your typical bar. If I want fine dining I&#39;d go downtown but this food and atmosphere was a happy medium. I will be back again and hope this place is successful."

We started with an appetizer that we heard was awesome, the homemade tater tots stuffed with smoked gouda with chipotle ketchup. Not sure if it was an off night or something but they were just ok, kinda bland and sounded much better than they tasted. I was disappointed that the potato portion didn&#39;t have much flavor and the smoked gouda flavor didn&#39;t really came out as expected. I will say the house made chipotle ketchup was very good. For dinner we ordered the Baseball Sirloin Culotte. This was 2 4oz portions that were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  For my sides I ordered the onion &amp; green chili mac and cheese and the Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were cooked perfectly, but again were just ok...they were good but lacked the wow factor.  Speaking of wow factor, they have hit a home run with the Mac and cheese.  Great flavor and it stayed nice and creamy to the last lick of the bowl.  The part we felt great about was the price.  $16 for great steak and two sides was very reasonable.  Like other reviewers on Yelp have mentioned, our only complaints were the decor/ambiance and lack luster beer menu. We will definitely be back and think there is a lot of potential for this place to be around a long time!"

My first visit was with girlfriends and we had fish and chips, Mac and cheese and the tavern burger.  All three were excellent!  Yesterday my husband and I went for an early Valentine dinner.  We shared the pork belly.  It was wonderful.  He had the rib eye steak, asparagus and poblano mashed potatoes. Yes, you have a nice choice of two sides.  I had the lamb chops with brussel sprouts and onion rings.  Everything was outstanding.  The brussel sprouts were some of the best I have ever had.  Our waiter, Zach was knowledgeable and attentive and the owner Chris came by our table to make sure everything was perfect.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  You receive a lot for your money.

We saw a lot of pix &amp; great reviews on it specifically.  They were right!  Crisp bacon, fresh turkey &amp; avocado.  The fries were a lil salty, but I like them like that!  

Mom &amp; dad split the Filet Fish Sandwich, they said it was fresh &amp; crisp.  Mom love it, dad said 8 out of 10 stars lol.  The bread was well toasted, not soggy &amp; had a nice crunch.  We were all fully satisfied for our next 10 hour drive &amp; no tummy aches.  

Miguella was our remarkable server!  She was not only knowledgable on the menu &amp; recommended the favorites &amp; specials, but she did not charge us for sharing.  A kind gesture on her part &amp; we will be back when passing through again!  A little goes a long way.  Wish more people were like her, smile on her face &amp; truly enjoys her job.  It was like Cheers, like we&#39;d been going there forever.  The portions were so large that it makes sense why they&#39;d charge unlike certain places... One of which I yelped about that could take a lesson or two.  

Excellent stop from the I76 bypass to I70, only a mile &amp; a half away.  Right before it was much needed gas station also so very convenient &amp; easy bypass!"

It&#39;s in a strip mall in an industrial part of town but I knew it would be good when I walked in and there were no tables available.

There are a lot of unique antique items hanging on the wall that is great for conversation. Everything seemed well kept even though this is an established business.

Everyone was very nice and the food was absolutely delicious. They were out of the first thing I originally wanted and also had no pie or cake. They said that they have a baker lady who brings her pies and cakes once a day. 

If I&#39;m ever on this side north of Denver I would definitely come back here."

While I was surprise by the service, the food itself wasn&#39;t anything special. I got chili cheese fries and the Rooster Sandwich (New York Strip Steak sandwich). The fries were lukewarm and had almost no flavor. For the record I just want to say putting meat on a slice of bread does not make it a sandwich!! (At the minimum there needs to be at least 2 slices of bread for it to be a sandwhich!!!) But the steak tasted like something I bought at kingsoopers and cooked at home (Ps I&#39;m kinda a crappy cook)

Really the only good thing about this place was the service and portion size."

My friend split a sandwich with me. The staff was as friendly as humanly possible. The reason i give it 3 stars is all about the location. Its in an old building located in a slightly scary area. The interior has an old school diner vibe like they built it in the 60s and never changed a thing.

Red Rooster cafe was my second choice.  When you walk in, you will feel like you are on the set of a dated movie.  Or maybe you&#39;ll feel like you are in some remote town in the middle of the desert.  Who knows what YOU will think about this place but I will assure you that there is no other place, operating in the same general &#34;space&#34; that can compete with the burgers that you will get from here!

I ordered the Arizona burger (not on the menu, but it&#39;s the Arizona Turkey sandwich but with a burger).  The burger is enormous, all beef 1/2 patty, avocado, bacon, cheese, tomato, pickle, onion, and lettuce with fries.  You would think that&#39;s enough...but you&#39;d be WRONG!  Of all the amazingness that I listed, it&#39;s there BUNS that have captured me.  And I&#39;m not referring to the waitresses!  Their homemade buns are thin but rich in flavor and texture.  Overall, the burger is huge, but I wanted a bite of bun with each trip that this burger made to my mouth!  

Lastly, the staff here is great.  If you don&#39;t like, some 50 something mother-figures calling you &#34;honey&#34;, &#34;babe&#34;, &#34;sweetie&#34;, and &#34;darling&#34;, this isn&#39;t the place for you...and WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!!!!!

The chicken breasts are juicy full sized chicken breasts.  The fries are hand cut.  The veggies are fresh and not canned.  The meat is quality cuts of meat.  The potato salad is home made so there&#39;s never a preservative aftertaste left in your mouth.  My office is located down the street from this place and my crew begs me to order from here all of the time.  We all love the food we get from here.

Our meals became inedible while waiting for them; So if your cool with mass pandemonium this place is great for you. If you like organization stay far from this dive. 

You should not charge full price for something you could have stopped yourself and did nothing about. They are more concerned about taking your money more than anything else.

The portions are a little obscene. As in, HUGE. As in, you&#39;ll be eating them for at least two meals, possibly three. But the food is reasonably priced and damn tasty. I had the Shooting Star Skillet, and it was amazing. The herbed cheese (think that Boursin stuff you spread on crackers) really added a nice twist to what would have otherwise been a basic diner offering. I always order my eggs over-medium, and you&#39;d be shocked at how many places can&#39;t get this simple request right. Red Rooster nailed it: the whites totally solid and a little crispy on the edges, the yellow soft and oozy, but not runny or watery. 

The staff is friendly and accommodating, and the food came out pretty quickly. The one thing they do need is a couple more high chairs. This is totally a family-style place, but they&#39;ve only got about three of them. Just a suggestion!"

We live in Colorado Springs and couldn&#39;t pass up the chance to see grandma even if it was just for a few hours. We started at the Hammonds Candy Factory and turned to Yelp! to look for a restaurant close by for a quick bite. The cafe was one of the top options and insanely close (same parking lot for the most part!) and had great reviews. We pulled around and I will admit I was a little skeptical because it&#39;s tucked in to an older shopping center. Do NOT let that deter you. Our waitress introduced her self and got our drink orders and left is to look at he menu. I was a little shocked to see the average pricing to be around $10 a plate for cafe food. My mother in law and I both ordered the Arizona turkey and my husband, the Philly cheesesteak. The girls got the kids pancakes and my son got a cheeseburger. The servings were HUGE and absolutely delicious. My mil finished just a 1/4 of her sandwich. We all needed boxes and it tasted great the next day.

Fortunately you can just the place by the cars on the outside, as was pretty sizeable in the inside.  Our friends were already there and so we sat right down.

They were super accomodating and nice.  The breakfast selection was a good variety, and I selected to go with Pigs in a Blanket... others had waffles, and biscuits and gravy... and all the dishes were HUGE... especially, the blueberry pancakes with oatmeal... they were gianormous!!

Burgers are good and so are many of the sandwiches I really like the cheese steak.  But what I usually order when I go here it the BIG GREEK SALAD with chicken.   It is the standard to which all Greeks salads should be measured.    They even put a couple dolmas in there and top It with a grilled peppers onions and mushrooms, a bunch of feta and it has a ton of fresh vegetables in it, served with pita bread.   Home made Greek dressing and tzatziki....  It is huge and oh so good.  A little off the beaten path but I tell you what this salad alone is reason to take a ten minute drive from the city into Denver&#39;s industrial district.    The place is usual pretty busy as it has been around forever and has many regulars but you wont be waiting for an hour..

A mission to find a breakfast joint in NW Denver that served crispy shredded hash brown potatoes.  We had been to the Breakfast Queen and the Sunrise Cafe, as well as DJ&#39;s, Javier and C&#39;s, and Stella.  All of which serve the ubiquitous home fries.  

So, imagine our utter delight when searching for &#34;hash browns&#34; on Yelp, we discovered the Red Rooster Cafe.  Okay, so it was on the other side of I-25 and not really on the way to anywhere.  But from the looks of the reviews, we were ready to take the drive.  

Upon arrival and looking at the menu, complete with an actual *photo* of aforementioned hash browns,  perfectly golden and crisp, as part of the Morning Glory special, we both looked at each other and said, &#34;I think we just found our new place.&#34;

So, when our food arrived, why oh why was there a half of a plate of soggy home fries on each of our plates?  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing?  Maybe we should have been more clear?  So upon inquiring of the waitress of the lovely shredded crispy hash browns, she replied, &#34;No, we don&#39;t have those.&#34;  WHAT!?

Okay, fine.  We&#39;ve had breakfasts with home fries before.  We can do this. 

But my greek omelet had too much filling and not enough eggs (picture gyro meat that is still in unpeeled layers and giant chunks of feta).  And my pancakes were clearly made from a mix......  Worst of all, maybe even worse than the lack of home fries, after trying to flag down our server for syrup for my pancakes for a good 10 minutes, while my pancakes cooled into soft piles of doughy grossness, my boyfriend finally went to the counter and asked the cashier for some syrup.  She picked up the carafe by the handle and shoved it at him, so that he had to grab the hot sticky bottle.  Euw.

This is not our new place.

The lady who was waited on us was lame, forgot to bring us our side of biscuits and gravy; then wouldn&#39;t give us a discount when we didn&#39;t want anymore. The people at the table behind us had the same thing happen to them with their pancakes, yet no one tried to make them happy and the waitress was left with no tip from either of our tables.

The servers and cashier were extremely friendly and it was a full house at lunch on a Thursday.  Lots of locals frequent this place and the hearty portions reflect the needs of the hard working clientele.

Truly terrific portions; I&#39;m talking serious plate coverage on gigantic plates.  I had a tuna melt served with pickles (I can&#39;t get enough of these at diners; I really like trying them everywhere) and it was tasty--the fries, however, were disappointing.  They came out looking like the amazing boardwalk fries I&#39;d grown up on in Ocean City, Maryland but they were limp, soggy and quite a bummer.  I found myself scrounging for the smaller fries which had retained some crunch.  

SV had the &#34;Big Fat Greek Plate&#34; which had chicken, pork and a shaved meat which I will assume was the lamb log that is apparent in many kebab houses.  It was delicious.  Lots of red peppers, onions, olives and two tubs of spicy yogurt sauce to spread on the included pieces of pita bread.  Her meal also included the lackluster fries which were summarily ignored as well.

We&#39;ll have to go back and see if the fries were a fluke--there&#39;s lots to try on the menu so I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find something else I like.  There was also an assortment of pies and cakes there.  Maybe we&#39;ll come by for dessert sometime..."

No worries though...a Texas poinsettia made the time fly by. 

Once inside, the service was excellent. For as busy as it was, I was very impressed with how quickly our food and drinks arrived. I had their biscuits and duck fat country gravy. I&#39;d have to say that they were possibly the best biscuits I&#39;ve had anywhere in the country.

I wish we had this back home. First off, I love that the restaurant is located in what looks to be an old Victorian home. If you weren&#39;t looking for it, you might even drive right by, as it&#39;s smack dab in the middle of a suburban neighborhood with houses and apartments all around. 

We didn&#39;t have to wait too long for a table, only about 10-15 minutes. We got seated outdoors, which is what we preferred being that it was a nice sunny morning. All the menu options looked so good so the bf and I ordered three dishes to share between the two of us =D Even the staff seemed a little surprised by our appetites, as when they brought it out, they had to verify with us that we truly did mean to order 3 plates. (And just for your FYI, we did finish all three plates.)

Highly recommend the eggs sardou and biscuits and gravy. This is comfort food at its best. I really wanted to try a Bloody Mary while I was here too as they have a TON of options, but being that I had already drank a lot the night before, I didn&#39;t think it was the best idea....

Staff was super friendly and it was a great meal and experience to have as my last breakfast while in town."

There are two locations and this one has its own small parking lot, so that is a win on my list. Also, the street parking isn&#39;t too horrible either, but definitely read the signage!

Just a quick reminder, they do not take reservations on the weekends, but you can call ahead to put your name on a &#34;wait list&#34; and once you arrive you can check-in and hopefully be seated in no time. Lucky for me I had a group of 11 and even with the wait list we waited for a little over an hour. I wouldn&#39;t recommend such a big party if you&#39;re in a rush, but fortunately you&#39;re able to order drinks before you&#39;re seated and that made the wait more bearable.

On to the food! I ordered the Eggs Sardou and a side of biscuit and gravy. The grit cake was crispy and the eggs were pouched just right, so when you stick that fork in the yolk just oozes out perfectly and covers half your plate. The fried oysters had just enough seasoning in the batter, and it was nice and crispy. I would recommend this dish for sure. As for the biscuit and gravy, I would pass on that and go with the deviled eggs or beignets. Happy eating!"

The hollandaise just didn&#39;t have much flavor to it, and tried to be balanced out with the collard greens were just too sweet.

You know that Foo Fighters song where Dave Grohl just keeps on repeating THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST over and over again? Well that song was playing through my head while I was eating here at Sassafras.

First off, this place is so damn cute. It&#39;s the kinda place Little Miss Muffet would find perfect. Sassafras pretty much is just someones house that they&#39;ve turned into a restaurant, and it really shows with how cozy and comforting it feels inside. From the silverware wrapped in colorful pieces of cloth, to the sign on the wall that hilariously reads &#34;I like big cups and I cannot lie&#34; with a picture of a coffee up in the middle, Sassafras achieves a pleasant vibe without going overboard into creepy.

The food is the real deal though. Oh man, my body was not ready for what I was about to eat. I opted for the Chicken Fried Eggs with Buffalo Hash. I was in heaven after that first bite. Audible moans escaped from my mouth with how good this was. That Chili Hollandaise sauce that they drizzled over everything was so delicious and those eggs were so uniquely cooked. That buffalo hash had such a strong and rich flavor that was immediately balanced out by the sweet corn bread. It was like the perfect breakfast. I really couldn&#39;t have asked for a much better meal than this. 

I also got myself their Sassafras Iced Tea, which was pretty darn good in my opinion but probably not everyone else&#39;s...cup of tea. It had a weird flavor to it, almost like old timey medicine, but I loved every sip of it. My friend wasn&#39;t so high on it as I was though.

So if you haven&#39;t realized it by now, I&#39;d definitely be recommending Sassafras to you the reader. Like, make it a point to actually wake up early on a weekend and make it out here because you will not regret it one bit."

I haven&#39;t written a review for Sassafras even though i&#39;ve come here like four times? Weird! Maybe subconsciously I wanted this place all for myself. 
So this most recent time that I went to Sassafras really put the icing on it. I&#39;ve been raving about it to my friend and every time we try to go for brunch the wait time is almost 2 hours! This Thursday finally we got the chance to go! It was 20 minutes before they closed (yeah, sorry, we were THOSE people). Since we didn&#39;t want to be an inconvenience (and because it wasn&#39;t my first time there) we ordered real quick. I had the BBQ Mac &#39;n cheese and my friend had the Chicken fried eggs &amp; buffalo hash (because it is a signature and you can not go wrong with it!). We also ordered a milkshake and a smoothie.

Let me talk about the service real quick... PHENOMENAL! Our server Jeffrey was amazing and accommodating and totally acted like we were not an inconvenience to them. He also didn&#39;t judge me for eating a full order of the mac n cheese even though I asked for a half order (which they do not do). Everyone was so friendly and we didn&#39;t feel rushed by them.

Ok back to the food: chicken fried eggs &amp; buffalo hash is a must-try if you haven&#39;t already (along with the beignets, this is Sassafras 101). I&#39;ve never been a big fan of mac &#39;n cheese, but the BBQ mac &#39;n cheese made me a believer, perfectly smoky and cheesy (not too cheesy) with some fried pickles, collard greens and pulled pork.

I also want to say that I preferred the smoothie (Pb3 smoothie) over the milkshake, it tasted fruity with peanut butter infusions; like a peanut butter jelly sandwich, but healthier...(wishful thinking...)

Oh and the house was really cool, very unique. I felt like I was in the south at my grandma&#39;s house (disclaimer: my grandma isn&#39;t from the south).

I will be back."

  I really enjoyed myself and had a great meal. Very unique flavors and dishes inspired by the South. I was actually more impressed with the techniques of how some of the dishes where prepared. The Buffalo Hash was a very inspiring spin on eggs Benedict. I think I sat for several minutes trying to think of how they deep fried a poached egg with thier light flavourful crust.

  A cute place, neatly decorated. I loved looking at the salt and pepper shaker pairs that were throughout the whole restaurant. 

  A hoppin place, we waited a while so I would recommend being ready for a long wait. But a must try.

I was visting Denver and a friend recommended this spot so it was on my to eat list while in Denver.  We came on a Saturday around 11 and the wait was about 25-30 minutes. Wait was longer than we expected, but when the food came out we would of waited longer if we had too! Definitely worth sticking around for. 

Best beignets in town! Crunchy on the outside and super fluffy on the inside with no shortage of powdered sugar. I was also never a fan of bloody mary&#39;s until I tried one of theirs!  

For the main brunch dishes we got the Eggs Sardou and Chicken fried eggs and buffalo hash.  The Eggs Sardou is absolutely delicious, tasty, fulfilling, and unique. The fried oysters was a stand-out among that dish.  Oysters tasted fresh and the batter was crispy golden.  I personally didn&#39;t like their buffalo hash- it had a weird aftertaste.  The waiter said they were the only place (in the whole world...) to have deep fried eggs so that&#39;s why we decided to get the dish.

The very comprehensive a la carte menu at breakfast really allows you to create exactly the brunch you want, which is really fabulous. I would say the collards are a bit sweet (dear god why?!?) and the biscuit is cakey rather than being light and biscuity. Otherwise very solid, and the dining area and patio are really pleasant.

Did I mention free refills on iced coffee and free wifi?"

MIRANDA was my server and she was by far the best I&#39;ve had in way too long. She took the time to fully explain the daily special as well as her personal recommendation.. also gave a description of the jams and hot sauces on the table... SHE ROCKS!! And I&#39;ll definitely be back! Thank you!"

After all, there is no reason you need to wait until after 10am to have a satisfying and fulfilling meal on a Sunday (lookin&#39; at you, Miami!). 

I walked in at 9 and it was buzzing but I had my choice of tables. By the time we left closer to 10, there was a wait so early birds definitely get the worm (or eggs, in this case). After dining at the other Sassafras on Colfax, I was familiar with the menu but still had a hard time deciding what to eat! From the breakfast po&#39; boy and biscuits and gravy, to the eggs sardou and all the benedicts, everything looked so good. Not to mention, you get 50% off an appetizer for checking in on Yelp! 

It&#39;s a Southern spot after all, so I decided to go with the shrimp and grits, while my friend got the breakfast mac. The grits were perfectly cooked but became a little too runny once the eggs were cracked. It had bacon and pickled jalpeños but once those were gone, it was really missing a little kick of flavor that led me to douse hot sauce on top. It was filling, but I&#39;d probably go for something else next time. The breakfast mac was super rich but good. I&#39;d definitely recommend ordering some for the table to share if you&#39;re lucky enough to be with a group! 

The entire staff was especially nice here! My water glass was constantly refilled and we were checked on throughout. Add on the cozy decor, ample parking and enticing menu, I&#39;ll definitely be back for more soon!"

Four of us brunched here--all had something different--and all were extremely pleased with our selections. If you can stand the heat, the Voodoo Bloody Mary had a humorous presentation, and came with a lovely &#34;chaser&#34; in case the heat was too much. I enjoyed my chicken fried eggs with buffalo hash, and was pleasantly surprised that the dish was larger than the pictures I saw here suggested. It was also quite rich, and I found myself full well into the afternoon. 

We had a 45 minute wait on a Sunday at 12:30. I saw several people waiting with coffee, and there is a bar, so you can somewhat escape the wintry breeze every time someone opens the front door. 

What really stood out for me was the service. This was my first visit, so I&#39;m not sure if this was particular to our waitress, or a Sassafras standard, but she did such a good job of explaining the menu. (I didn&#39;t catch her name, but she was a blonde sweetheart with what I&#39;d describe as Texas-style hair). When we told her what dish we&#39;d like to order, she eloquently described every detail, like they do as if it were the day&#39;s special, to make sure it still sounded like something we wanted. Let me tell you--after a 45 minute wait, and then hearing every scrumptious part of the dish, my stomach was aching just hearing how good everything sounded! Thankfully, it didn&#39;t disappoint!"

The menu read like a Mark Twain novel, full of delicious southern delights that were sure to please. I had the country breakfast that was eggs,bacon, grits, and a giant biscuit. The flavors were on point and transported me back to my childhood. I knew a place like this would fill up fast, so I arrived shorty before they opened and was seated right away. The service was fast and the waitress was friendly. I look forward to the next time I can come to this place and have another wonderful taste adventure."

A marathon of some sorts downtown. All roads leading to their other branch was blocked. In frustration and hunger we decided to drive to this location instead.

It&#39;s such a cute place. Small parking lot on the side. Lots of residential parking available close by. Small area to wait outside while you wait for your table. A few spots to wait outside. 

We scored a sunny spot by the window. Our server was cute, warm and very efficient. Mea culpa I don&#39;t remember her name. She had some awesome tat and was wearing glasses.

I knew what I wanted having looked at their menu online before hand. I was informed that my order Chicken Fried Eggs and Buffalo Hash $13 is their most famous dish. It&#39;s local Buffalo smoked over Pecan wood. Fried six minute eggs. House made Corn Bread. Fresno Chile Hollandaise. 

Upon presenting the order our server proceeded to advise me how they would  suggest you to start with the dish: Slice the eggs and let the yolk flow over your Buffalo and likewise over your cornbread. The fried eggs sits on top of the Smoked Buffalo and Corn Bread. Those eggs...they&#39;re perfect! My server managed to put one of them in the box intact for me to take home. The Smoked Buffalo had a slight hint of a kick to it and an evenly balanced flavor. 

I noticed that they don&#39;t overdo anything here flavor wise. It&#39;s a delicate balance that they managed to attain and made me a fan. 

I&#39;ve never had breakfast that was plated so beautifully that is fitting for dinner! 

We shared an order of their beignets. This was worthy of a comeback as well. Delicate, fresh creations bathe in that mountain of snow like sugar. Very impressed. 

They have two flavors in their mimosas. I never say no to one. An apple and a regular one. Add a third to that because the server offered me a special mimis. This was their Achilles heel to me. At $6 it was weak. The flavor described to me wasn&#39;t that distinct but nevertheless it was ok. Although a weak sauce is a weak source.

If you&#39;re dropping in don&#39;t forget to give the hostess your name. Wait for a text. It will involve a question asking you if it&#39;s ok to sit outside. If you prefer to sit inside text back with this: &#34;Inside&#34;. Wait for another text informing you this time when your inside table is ready!

P.S when my dish came I looked for my fried chicken. It&#39;s not like that. Lol! It means they fried the chicken&#39;s eggs! Hence, Chicken fried eggs. Duhh!

Not a pro tip: but from someone who asked before driving. This branch has the small parking lot. The other one Does Not!"

Sassafras brings some things to the table that other &#34;Southern&#34; restaurants forget or don&#39;t know about but here the flavors and ingredients exemplify the mixed history of the South.  It&#39;s a hearty mix of Cajun, African, English, Scottish, Irish, German, and French.  

It&#39;s modestly, incredibly tasty with a serene patio to relax on with a full belly and beignet-sweet smile.

I guess thanks to the magic of Facebook, they had coordinated a rendezvous while she was visiting.  I was the one driving her around, so I figured I could get a meal out of it.  Her friend had suggested Sassafras, which I had no idea what in the hell it was, or what it was about.

I noticed it was mostly a brunch/breakfast place in a Victorian house.  Was I in the south and I didn&#39;t realize it?  I did some more research on my trusty Yelp app, and the more photos and reviews I read, the more my mouth watered.  

We arrived first, and decided to sit on the patio.  When the weather calls for it, it is a great place to enjoy the scenery.  The parking lot is small, so it doesn&#39;t take away from sitting out there.  There are about 15 or so tables on the inside of the house as well.  This gave me plenty of time to look over the menu, as there was a LOT to choose from.  That time, I ordered an app, and the bbq mac n cheese.

I was immediately in heaven.  The food was amazing, and opened my eyes to some great food ideas.  I was absolutely full though.  However, I noticed they had milkshakes- and not just your everyday flavors.  They had a twinkie milkshake.  You better believe I got one.  I even got it in a to go cup.  My sister was still catching up, so I ended up drinking the whole thing sitting at the table.  I will never forget that milkshake.  My sister ended up driving back.

My friend then came into town not too long ago.  I suggested we go- as it has the southern influence.  She obliged.  This time, there was a 30 minute wait.  They took my cell number, and we sat outside and caught up.  I then got the text letting us know the table was ready.  We sat inside this time, next to the bar.  Yes, a breakfast place has a bar- but they mainly specialize in exotic bloody marys and mimosas.  

We ordered a plethora of food this time, hell I don&#39;t even remember.  But I do know this- everything we ordered, we ate- and enjoyed.

I enjoy this place so much, but the biggest downside is they usually are closed by the time I get out of bed.  I also hear that they have a location in Capitol Hill, but I have no idea how that compares.  In my book, not to be missed!"

Service was very friendly and efficient;  they utilized text messaging to advise you of your table availability which I thought was nice. 

Ordered the Rendezvous Mimosa which had different fruit juices and was delicious.  My son had Queen Marie Bloody Mary which he really enjoyed.  Awesome coffee.

My mistake for not reading the menu thoroughly as I thought biscuits were included with the breakfasts like Lucile&#39;s.  We did order the Beignets which were delicious;  per our server&#39;s recommend, we tried it with their homemade jams which really made the experience like eating a jelly donut!

Quick bullets on breakfast:

Homemade bacon....wow!  Need I say more?

My Eggs Sardou were really good.  However, I wasn&#39;t paying attention and kept waiting to have the highlight of my meal, the fried oyster which I didn&#39;t get,  I was 1/2 way through before I stopped and thought about it.  At this point, I am not going to contest it was missing because I had eaten 1/2 the meal.  If it was there, it was negligible. I was expecting a piece much like the one in the Cajun Benedict my son had.

My son had the Cajun Benedict and really enjoyed it.  He did say he wished the crab was more distinguishable.  The overall crabcake he described had the consistency of hashbrowns, and the hollandaise sauce was uneventful.  He loved the oyster though.....bummer for me.

Wife had the Stuffed French toast and it was as good as it sounded...no complaints.

The highlight meal had to be the Chicken Fried Eggs and Buffalo Hash.  Chicken fried egg was intriguing to say the least all by itself.  All the flavors together in one bite per the chef&#39;s recommendation....awesome.

Sorry for the length of the review.   I almost felt compelled to explain why I didn&#39;t give it the trending 5 star rating it has been getting.  Can&#39;t wait to go there again!"

The food is amazing. I ordered the crawfish etoufee which was awesome, but after trying a bite of my friend&#39;s macaroni and cheese, I had to have a cup of my own. The drinks are also fun and inventive! Two words: mimosa flights. They serve these flights in cute little mason jars and you can try any four you want at once! My personal favorite is the Magic Potion #9. It spins the traditional mimosa on its head and adds an interesting green pepper flavor. 

I cannot recommend Sassafras enough! And that goes for both locations!"

First of all, make a reservation, because they seem like they are always really busy (went a week ago and was told we&#39;d have to wait 45 minutes). I had the Bloody Maria (unique flavors for a bloody mary) and the Blackened Chicken Mac and Cheese. Everything tasted great! I also love the eclectic country charm of the decor. Overall, nice experience and a lot of flavor!

On a side note, I had perused the reviews of this place before we went and saw a hilarious discussion between two yelpers regarding &#34;blackface&#34;/&#34;Black Americana&#34; salt and pepper shakers. I showed the discussion to the table, and we were dying of laughter. Unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t find them anywhere in the restaurant. :-("

It did help cut down on the wait time. Instead of 45 minutes it was 15. A definite to-do if you are going here! Otherwise you will wait and wait and wait. 

We started with the beignets - super soft, fluffy, powdering, don&#39;t count-your-calories, must eat! (5.00). 

My husband had the buttermilk biscuits with mushroom gravy, buttered grits (perfectly cooked) and a poached egg (12.00). Smoky, peppery and soft, if you like a bit more flavor go with a fried egg. I love poached eggs. 

I had the fried green tomato benedict (11.00). Marinated green tomatoes, sun-dried tomato vinaigrette, arugula, poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and corn-bread. So yummy is all I can say about this! If you have a hankering for fried green tomatoes get &#39;em!

I did have the spicy chai tea, I would not get again, it was small and not so spicy but if you have a hankering for it, go for it. My husband had the coffee and enjoyed it (3.50). 

An interesting place to rest a while with a folksy art collection. Little dust collectors is what my nana used to call them all around the restaurant. Did not really notice the music that was playing. On a cold day do not think I would want the table we had, right by the door. Our server, Jennifer, was very helpful and friendly.

There was a bit of a wait when we arrived, so we sat outside in the shade and looked over the menu.  I&#39;d seen someone with beignets when we were walking back outside and I was immediately hit with food envy and knew I was going to order them.  

With plenty of time to debate over the menu, when we received the text that our table was ready, we pretty much knew what we wanted.  Our server was friendly and helpful and made my day when he said that fried green tomatoes were available as an appetizer, so I didn&#39;t have to get the Fried green tomato po-boy.  

I ended up getting beignets, fried green tomatoes, and an awesome french toast dish called Lost Bread...  Their drink menu looked great but I stuck with water.  

The beignets were good... they were coated to death in powdered sugar that I wasted everywhere.  They were fried well, but just a tad denser than other beignets I&#39;ve had before, but they were still good.  The fried green tomatoes came out next and were piping hot.  They were actually lightly breaded which was okay, it gave a chance for that delicious tomato to shine through, but I would&#39;ve like just a little bit more crunch with some more breading, but it was still a good app.

Next came the lost bread and it was not only delicious to my eyes but my tummy as well...  The bread was fantastic, the pecans and blackberries were great toppings... would&#39;ve liked a few more berries, but again it was super yummy... And that satsuma syrup, quite a different spin on syrup for me when I&#39;m use to thick maple syrups from Mississippi, but it was light and delicious and it worked well with everything...  There was nothing about that dish I did not like and would order it again if I ever get the chance.  

So here&#39;s to a great brunch in Denver.  Eating in that cozy restaurant/house made me feel like I was still in the South.  The only issue I actually had were the flies... and they were everywhere, trying to get some good food...  This casual spot kept the door open and they were letting not only customers in but flies as well.  On nice days such as the one we came on, having a fan by the door to blow away bugs would be a keen idea or have a screen door so outside air can come in but the bugs will stay out would help as well.  Other than that... the food and service were awesome but the flies were a little annoying...  However if/when I&#39;m back in Denver I&#39;ll be back to Sassafras... just shoo fly don&#39;t bother me."

We all loved our food and not one person wasn&#39;t blown away by the dish they ordered. we all agreed we planned to come back in some way or another.

The interior decoration is absolutely adorable and it just feels like I&#39;ve been transported to a southern New Orleans kitchen. We were seated inside because the outside was full, but it was totally fine. The tables are wooden which added even more to the homey feeling.

If you check into good old yelp, you get 50% off appetizer and you can use multiple coupons per table. They ran out of deviled eggs sadly but we ordered the fried pickles. Omg they were delicious. Perfectly crisp, the pickles were sour, and the sauce it came with was amazing. I also got a spiced iced chai which came out in a mason jar. Extra points!! The chai was so good that I finished mine and wanted more. 

For entree, I got the cajun benedict. It was a great choice. It came with 3 crab cakes, 2 eggs and fried okra. Everything was just wonderful. The crab cakes were very savory and the egg was perfectly runny just how I like it. The okra I didn&#39;t care for so much but I was pretty full after eating this. This entree also comes with a side of either grit or potato casserole and I went with the potato which was just like a hash brown with cheese on top. I definitely want to come back and try the beignets and their other southern foods like gumbo and jambalaya."

From grits to fried it just puts that home feeling in your belly. Sassafras does just that. The atmosphere itself feels homey and the food does not disappoint! My grandpa has preached about grits since I can remember so whenever I stumble upon a restaurant that had them I get a little excited lol. Alone, grits can be bland and tasteless but here they mix in jalapeños and cheese to make your taste buds dance a bit. We started with the fried pickles, we really wanted the devil eggs but they were out for the day. So I can only assume they&#39;re a hot seller. For a main course I had the Deep South Benedict. As Shia would say &#34;DO IT, JUST DO IT&#34; so good. The pulled pork on a biscuit with a perfect hollandaise sauce with some collard greens is something special. 
I definitely recommend coming here and filling your stomach with some delicious southern comfort!"

The server was helpful, but their food is prepared en masse, making modifications to it impossible.

She directed my attention to the side items, and indicated I would need to find vegan items there, so I elected to have the granola, fruit, and brussels sprouts.

The fruit and granola was adequate, but not what I wanted. I wish they would offer foods that happen to be vegan-

The brussels sprouts didn&#39;t taste right for vegan, and I was about to ask if they were fried in butter, when I bit into a piece of pulled pork. I flagged the server over with obvious questions. She assured me it wasn&#39;t prepared that way, and said a &#39;stray piece&#39; got into it. I grudgingly accepted that, and she went away, just as I found another piece in a different part of the bowl. It became clear that it was cooked on the same grill. The server said it wasn&#39;t supposed to be done that way, was supposed to be in a separate pan. Personally, I think the cook &#39;seasoned&#39; it that way..

I&#39;m a vegetarian for ethical reasons, so finding part of a pig in my food would be a little bit like finding human meat.. I was so revolted, I could not eat the rest of my food.

When I found the pork in my food the first time, especially after the lengthy discussion surrounding it, they should&#39;ve OFFERED to take it back. They did take it back ultimately, at my request. To their credit, they did not charge us for my food, as I couldn&#39;t eat it, and also didn&#39;t charge us for my associates&#39; drinks. This saved them from my giving them only one star.


It gets worse though. This is s southern restaurant, with good, old-fashioned, southern cooking, which should be great!

On their walls, they have all sorts of clever decor, which harkens to the south. Southern decorations, pictures, cute salt shakers.. Kitschy, fun, regional decorations. You get the idea-

On one wall, beneath a picture, there is a set of horrific, racist, blackface salt and pepper shakers. I have included the picture below.


As a white man, I was offended, appalled, and upset- These things are a part of our history, and shouldn&#39;t be hidden or put under a rug. We need to address them. -But they belong in a museum, with an explanation, not publicly displayed in a southern diner. In the north. With only white customers.. I can imagine how I would feel as a black person seeing this. I know it would affect me differently, and more personally. I think I would FEEL it..

I don&#39;t appreciate that in our community. I don&#39;t appreciate it anywhere.

Perhaps I was made more sensitive to this after the mass shooting in a gay club in Orlando, but it isn&#39;t right.

If you go to this diner, please say something about this to them.

Especially if you are black.

Especially if you aren&#39;t.

I attached a picture below.


This restaurant has a lot of potential. The concept is great, with fresh greens, and an eclectic and varied menu. My associate mentioned that the &#39;hard lemonade&#39; was delicious. But seriously...

If they would develop that potential, and take the integrity of their menu items seriously, catering to a more varied crowd, it would only benefit them.

The first time was with some co-workers a couple of years ago. Don&#39;t remember what I had on that visit, but I remember it was good, so I decided I&#39;d try and bring my friend back.

This proved easier said than done. My next two visits went like this- I put my name in, waited over an hour, and then we gave up and decided to go elsewhere. I understand waiting for a delicious meal. What&#39;s frustrating is when you&#39;re told the wait will be 45 minutes, then you check your status in said 45 minutes, and are then told it will be 30 more minutes.

Anyhoo, fourth visit is a charm I guess. Probably because it was a Wednesday. Morning. Finally got to eat here again. My friend and I started with the beignets. They were pretty good, but I think Lucille&#39;s are better. I had the Fried Green Tomato benedict. It was amazing. The tomatoes were perfectly fried, and the eggs were cooked exactly to my liking. The &#34;pumpkin spice&#34; latte I ordered just tasted like a regular latte, but it was still a very good latte. 

Overall, the food and drink was delicious, but don&#39;t go here if you&#39;re starving or short on time. Be prepared to wait for at least an hour on a weekend for brunch. If your stomach can hold out, it&#39;s worth it."

It seems every time I dine here the service is worse...why? Are they losing star servers? Is it management? Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know the answer.

We ordered two of their specialty teas. 
Which took at least ten minutes to get to our table. 

We had ordered the biscuits and gravy which we asked if we could have two of the three options. Yes of course our server said.

I ordered what I order 90% of the time I dine here- the Cajun Benedict. And I can&#39;t recall what my boyfriend ordered. 

Our biscuits and gravy got to our table before our drinks did. And when the gal described what they were they had put all three gravies on. We looked at each other across the table, which the runner noticed, we didn&#39;t send it back- but come on- we watched our server write it down. 

He didn&#39;t check in to see how they were. 

Our food took quite some time, which is fine- I believe the inside was mostly full and there were four tables outside. Two of which had already eaten and one which was sat after us. 

Our server was constantly weeded and I&#39;m not entirely sure why. Was he hungover from the night before? Who knows. 

Back to the food. Like I said I&#39;ve had the Cajun Benny many times and I love it, that&#39;s why I keep coming back. When I took my first bite it was less than warm. I ate a bit more and it was absolutely cold. I checked the temp of the plate and it was also cold. If you work in a kitchen you keep your plates on the line to keep them warm if not hot so as to keep the food warmer longer- clearly this didn&#39;t happen today. 

I stopped eating my dish because unfortunately it was just not enjoyable. 

My boyfriend had finished his entree which was just warm by time our server came around. He asked if I wanted a box. I told him no. I explained I love this place and the experience was a real bummer. I told him we just wanted our check. What I assume was a manager came out and basically defended themselves- saying the Cajun Benedict is not a hot dish. I said I&#39;ve had it plenty of times to know the quality of it and this was not it. I mentioned the plate also being cold. They kept offering to get us a drink but all I wanted was to leave.

They brought the check and had taken off the biscuits and gravy, which I thought was ridiculous- that was not the biggest problem and we also ate 85% of. The problem here was my entree which I ate 25% of. 

I don&#39;t appreciate the way my experience was handled. 
I spoke with a friend of mine who served here in the past and said that since she has left the quality of the restaurant FOH and BOH has decreased and she believes it is because of management. 

Truly a shame. I LOVED this place. Now it&#39;s just another place I won&#39;t be going for breakfast. 

Maybe I&#39;ll give the one on colfax a shot."

It looks like a converted house, and the furnishings inside are adorable. We were seated immediately and our server was super inviting and polite. 

We ordered a strawberry basil lemonade - super refreshing. I loved that it wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly sweet. The basil flavor was almost undetectable, but it is a delicious drink. 

Shrimp and grits: came with two beautifully poached eggs, I love that runny yolk. The grits were nice and buttery. 

Deep South Benedict: toasted cornbread, collard greens, and pulled pork made a very flavorful and hearty breakfast. 

Portions here are a good size - not too big, but I was pleasantly full with my one entree! 

Would definitely recommend a visit here!"

First thing first. The service is AMAZING. From the first step into that place all the way up until we took off it was nothing but exceptional service. Do you have to wait for two hours on a Sunday? Yes. Is it worth it? YES. 

Second, the drinks menu is excellent. I had the Jamaican Me Crazy coffee and it was an absolute treat.

Third, and most important, the food. I won&#39;t lie, I had extremely high expectations coming here and not only were they met, they were surpassed. I had the buffalo hash and chicken fried egg. I still can&#39;t stop ranting and raving about it.

In conclusion, check this place out. Call in advance, do what you hotta do, but try it. Because it&#39;s totally TOTALLY worth it."

We have found a new breakfast place!!

This is the other establishment of Sassafras American Eatery. We went to the one on Colfax yesterday. This one is just as good, just in a different location, and it&#39;s in an old historic house, built around 1881 or so. There is a private parking lot connected to the restaurant, so this helps. 

Once again, we both ordered the Country Breakfast, as I like my traditional bacon and eggs.  Our order came, and WOW! The bacon was Incredible! It was thick, and excellent, the way bacon should be! The wheat toast was good, thick, and toasted just right! I wish I had asked what brand of break they use, it was good! The eggs were very good, cooked to order just right (yes, I&#39;ve had some bad eggs, no pun intended!). They have their own homemade jams, one regular with triple berries, and the other a spicy version.

All of the food on the menu looked wonderful! It was so hard to choose, but when I go to a new breakfast place, I always order bacon and eggs, so I can compare. I was not disappointed today.  WOW! The coffee was very good, and the waitress informed us that we could purchase some, if we wanted, either ground or whole beans. 

Interior - When you walk in the front door, after walking around the front and side porch areas (with several outdoor heaters, nice thought by the management), you are right there in the restaurant, with patrons enjoying their meals at various tables. There is no &#34;inside waiting area,&#34; like the other Sassafras on Colfax has. This was a bummer, even though we didn&#39;t have to wait, as there were two tables left that we could choose from. The place rapidly filled up, with lots of people waiting. The seating area is the main room on the first floor, there is no second floor, and really no room to expand (at least I don&#39;t think so), which is a shame, as the food is really very good! Bummer, I guess they will have to open up a 3rd Sassafras, and we&#39;ll have to go to that one too! LOL

Service - excellent!

Prices - very good, about $2 more than some other local establishments, but the food here is so good, and it&#39;s so worth it!


We loved (both) Sassafras, and will definitely be back! 

Well done!!!  Thank you!"

I was very excited about this place, due to the really great reviews and the word of mouth from fellow eaters. I started off with the drink special, a peach bellini. It was gritty and pulpy, which threw me off, as it was supposed to be a bellini, not a mimosa. I got to sample many food items due to most of us ordering different dishes, so I feel like I get to review based on more of an overall knowledge of the brunch rather than just one dish. That is probably for the best, because the dish I ordered was not very good. I got the biscuits and gravies. I was really excited, because this place is supposed to rival Lucille&#39;s, and I am a diehard fan of their biscuits and gravy. I&#39;m not sure if this was an off day, or if the biscuits are always hard as rocks, but they were almost inedible. They were not only hard, but dry dry dry. Another diner in our party had to order extra gravy just to get his down. Why didn&#39;t we send them back, you may ask? Well, we had already waited an hour for our table and another 40 minutes for our food. We were HONGRY. (this after we called ahead, arrived early, and were promised a table at 10am, only to be seated more around 11) The gravy tasted fine, and the eggs that came with the dish were not seasoned at all. I am NOT a salt adder, but I had to in this case. Additionally, they forgot my potato casserole, which turned out to be bland too. The saving grace of my experience was definitely the mac and cheese that I ordered on the side. If I was rating this solely on that one item, it would get 10 stars. Best mac and cheese EVER. Other dishes had were the shrimp and grits, eggs sardou, beignets, and deviled eggs. The bites I had were good, but not great. Everything seemed a little underseasoned. I did, however, really enjoy the drink selection, and the lavender pineapple cranberry mimosa was spectacular. All in all, I will probably not come back here. I can go to Lucille&#39;s and wait for an hour or more and actually have food that is worth my time."

The wait was about an hour, but we just decided to chill at Prohibition, which was about a block away. The food was so worth the wait. We got seated about 30 minutes prior to closing but we weren&#39;t rushed in any way and there were still patrons taking their time. I&#39;m definitely going back if I&#39;m in Denver again."

Both eggs served on top of the hash and cornbread with a hollandaise. I highly recommend this dish! It appears to be their signature dish from what I read in other reviews. I downed that  dish slowly. I had to enjoy every single bite. The cornbread was delicious! And with real corn nibs inside! Another first for me! I&#39;m so used to packaged corn bread that I will never do that to myself again! I will make my own from scratch! The mimosas are served in mason jars and are so tasty!

Food - The food was sub-par. There was almost no gravy on my biscuits. I have to say that the biscuits tasted homemade, but the sausage gravy was bland and lacked much sausage. Ask for some Tabasco sauce!!! Maybe it just seemed like it lacked sausage since there was a shortage of gravy on my biscuits! Just take a look at the pics - does that look like a $10 plate of food to you? I also ordered a side of bacon. The ends of the bacon were burnt and black. Pretty much inedible. The eggs were okay. The diet coke comes in a can, so - no refills. Make it last.

Service - The waitress was clearly interested in treating us to some great service. She was friendly (a little over-friendly) and seemed interested in meeting our needs. These intentions became just that - intentions. They forgot my side of bacon and my potato casserole and one of our party wasn&#39;t served until about 10 minutes after the rest of the table (there were five of us). This party was disgusted with the buffalo hash and sent it back uneaten. It took forever to get service on our check.

I will never go back to this restaurant. I know it&#39;s a trendy and seemingly eclectic place, but, trust me, the food and the service DO NOT make this a pleasant experience. It felt like a rip-off."

Love the ambience, outside patio, interesting menu options and the Sassafras Tea.

I had the roasted veggie grits with an extra egg over easy. So good and perfectly portioned so that I didn&#39;t leave feeling like I ate a bowling ball. I love that Sassafras tea, it&#39;s a concoction of black tea with root beer extract, c&#39;mon that&#39;s awesome!

Ok so food- lots of southern deliciousness. I had the breakfast grits with pulled pork. Loved it. The grits were delicious!!  Plus a biscuit on the side. You really shouldn&#39;t eat here with out having a biscuit! It&#39;s amazing with their fantastic homemade jam. 
The hubby got CHICKEN FRIED EGGS &amp; BUFFALO HASH- he says on its own each thing would be mediocre- together they are a flavor explosion!
The only downside is the wait..an hour 15 for 4 at 9:30.  If they would take reservations on open table I would make a weekly reservation!"

They have free beignets with yelp check in which are huge and crazy delicious, especially paired with the jams they have on the side of the table....so fricken good. My friend and I also split the grits and eggs and the benedict, with the benedict being way tastier than the grits, but both were fairly good. I also had to try the Mac and cheese and we got some corn bread....yes, we are ridiculous. It was all so good, I completely overate and didn&#39;t want to eat anything else for most of the day....but it was so worth it! Highly recommend this place!"

- Southern style eats done very well. The biscuits and gravies are amazing, the breakfast mac and cheese is phenomenal. Do not skip the beignets, did you hear that, do no skip them. 

- The menu is really creative, I love the quirky offerings they have and they way they&#39;ve made traditional dishes their own

- The staff is honestly one of the big reasons I come back. Don&#39;t expect aloof hipsters like you&#39;d get at Jelly, or service snobs like Root Down. The staff here is always smiling and kind and willing to give suggestions!

- The wait usually falls in about 45 minutes or so every time I&#39;ve been on the weekend. I think this is pretty standard for weekend brunch spots in Denver."

Loved the option of getting the free beignets with a Yelp check-in, and while they&#39;re not the best I&#39;ve had, they were still very delicious. I ordered the chicken fried eggs and buffalo hash, which looks like a small plate upon arrival but is still very filling. I would love to be able to replicate this dish at home! Every other dish that was ordered at the table looked wonderful as well, and the menu selection overall was plenty to make us question what we would finally settle on. I will certainly be returning here to try more dishes as well as take them up on their brunch drinks next time. One of my girlfriends ordered the mimosa flight, which is not only a great idea but was well presented!

One key thing to note is that Sassafras only has a small parking lot and any immediately nearby parking becomes Residents Only at noon on the weekends, so unless you have a permit for that nearby, please be aware of this and plan accordingly. Fortunately one of my girlfriends mentioned something, otherwise I may have not enjoyed my Sunday brunch as much as I did!"

I tried the:

1. BEIGNETS: divine doughnuts that I&#39;ll be dreaming about.

2. CAJUN BENEDICT + GRITS: the fried oysters are amazing. the grits are so buttery!

3. FRIED GREEN TOMATO BENEDICT + POTATO CASSEROLE: this was delicious, although i thought the tomatoes were going to be presented on top of biscuits! had to order one on the side for good measure. the potato casserole is by far the BEST.

4. A BISCUIT ON THE SIDE: buttery, fluffy, fresh. so good!

I had the Cajun Benedict...it was &#34;ok&#34; but not as great as I expected based on all the reviews. The poached eggs were room temperature and I was not a fan of the crawfish hash and the fried oysters. The crab cakes were good but I would not call them &#34;lump&#34;...did not see any lumps.  The Benedict sauce was the highlight of the dish. 

She has the sausage biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were huge! However, the sausage was sparse.  The dish arrived with a cold plate of potato casserole...which we found really strange...never had cold potato casserole.

The food is not good at all.  Lots of better places nearby.   Not that its bad but everything taste like its pre-packaged.

Lets start with the Salsa. it soupy and near flavorless.   Its like they cut up all the ingredients, put it in a blender then strained out the tomatoes, chiles, cilantro, etc and used the liquid as the salsa.  Not fresh tasting or looking at all.

I ordered a combo plate that came with a Hard Shell Taco, Tamale, and Shredded beef burrito, rice and beans.

The hard shell on the Taco is one of those pre-made shells, you get off the shelf at the grocery store.  No effort and it tastes like it. The ground beef in the taco was flavorless lacking any real spice. Not even salt and pepper.  

The Tamale also tasted like one of those pre-made ones you buy in the frozen section of the grocery store.  At least it was it was warm.

Shredded Beef Burrito -  Again, seems like no spices are were put in the meat.  

The spanish rice could only be called that cause it had a hint or red from tomatoes.  Like they put a can of tomato soup in when they were cooking the rice, and viola, Spanish rice!

Beans were lack-luster as well.  Opened a can of refried beans, heated it to just barely warm and served to you.

Just poor quality food all the way around."

We still decided to eat here though. My chili rellano was the most disgusting thing I&#39;ve ever had. My margarita was like watered down tequila with a little lime juice. Not good at all.

The good: salsa was delicious!  Very flavorful, right amount of spice. The chips were warm and the tri-color was a nice detail. The queso was also pretty good, though it was just your basic Velveeta and Rotel combo. The rest of the food was okay but a bit bland for Mexican. 

The bad: this restaurant is badly in need of a face lift. There are what appears to be bullet holes partially piercing the bullet-proof windows on the south side of the building. The interior is too dark - we came at lunch but it felt like we were eating at night. And it seems like about half the booths have torn up seats - not very comfortable or welcoming. We didn&#39;t have any real problems with the service but our server was not particularly friendly or attentive, either. 

Overall, this is a decent place to catch a bite, especially if you&#39;ve got a coupon, but there are better choices in the same neighborhood - check your Yelp app!"

The sound system must have been broken, as there was someone there attempting to play music. Not terrible, but very out of place. The service while friendly, was quite slow. It took nearly an hour to receive our meals. I ordered the chili relleno plate. It was very small, with large portions of rice and refried beans. The taste was average. The margaritas were okay, but not spectacular. Overall, the service was slow, the food was very average and everything was overpriced. I would definitely avoid this place."

The only two (2) plates I enjoyed were the molcajete meat bowl and the chicken torte.  The sopapillas are really tasty though and they come with a complimentary squeeze bottle of honey which makes the lunch/dinner better. 

Now here&#39;s the secret: Sunday Brunch!  Yes, Sunday Brunch is a delicious mixture of American favorites which include pancakes (freshly made), bacon strips, biscuits and gravy along with Mexican favorites including breakfast burritos, hot (and I mean hot!) green chili, fajitas, and tacos among other things.  You can also get awesome desserts that include a chocolate fountain, brownies, and mini muffins.  The cost is decent for an all you can eat Sunday brunch so I don&#39;t think you can go wrong.  

My only other concerns are the drinks are pretty average- the diet coke is pretty watered down and the ice tea is average.  Also the doors on the men&#39;s room are broken and the one (1) door to one (1) stall doesn&#39;t even close to lock and stays open, so just be advised.  

However despite the concerns, I will keep coming back- from Sunday brunch that is!"

Everyone there was paying with a groupon or yelp deal, seriously all the other tables except the one that just left because the service was some of the slowest around. Luckily I enjoy the company of my date because it took about two hours. The queso wasn&#39;t impressive, however my steak enchiladas were really good.

My friend and I just got chili con queso and multiple margaritas, so I can&#39;t speak to most of their food, but what we had was good.

We were seated promptly and our server took pretty good care of us.  The queso was delicious, as always.  (As I&#39;ve said in other Armadillo reviews, they would get 5 stars if it was solely based on queso!)  The margaritas were ok.  I tried 3 varieties - house, midori, and ultimate.  Both the house and the midori had a very sweet taste, likely from the mixer.  In fact, the midori one almost tasted like a jolly rancher - not really what I was looking for.  The ultimate was good, but a bit too strong on the alcohol flavor for me.

Our server was very patient (as we were there for multiple hours catching up) and kept the drinks and water flowing.  Overall, a good experience."

My first visit was awesome.  I had a Groupon for the fajitas, and they were amazing.  The margaritas were decent, no complaints, and the service was pretty good that day.

I went another time, and the food was good, the service was fine, no major complaints.

However, all of that good was undone on Saturday, June 16th.

I went in for lunch with my boyfriend.  The waitress didn&#39;t pay us a whole lot of attention, which isn&#39;t normally a big deal, but we were the last people in the dining room to get our food after ordering.  It is a huge pet peeve of mine when I get my food after everyone else without an explanation of why.  A nice young man noticed apologized, and had our waitress inform us that our food was coming soon.  I ordered a quesadilla, and my boyfriend ordered enchiladas.  Nothing special.

So, then the food comes out.  My quesadilla has too much filling or not enough cheese, and I flag the manager.  First, it was a lovely see through white blouse she had on.  Second, she said, &#34;You do know it&#39;s white cheese, right?&#34; I said, &#34;I know, but there&#39;s not much, and I was under the impression that&#34;  At this point, she looks to my boyfriend to fix the issue.  He tells her &#34;more cheese&#34;, which was the wrong answer, but I will discuss that in a review of him on a more personal website.

So, she takes my plate, saying &#34;We&#39;ll have a new one out to you in one or two minutes.&#34;

My boyfriend was about done eating when my food reappears.  I was disgusted, because there were fork marks in my sour cream, I thought that they had given me the same plate.  At this point, I deal with it, which I shouldn&#39;t have done, but I was hungry.

So, the nice waiter comes by and asks how it is.  They hadn&#39;t fixed the problem at all, it didn&#39;t have more cheese, it was the same thing I&#39;d been given 10 minutes before, and I inform him as such, saying &#34;But I guess I&#39;ll deal.&#34;  He tells me he&#39;s sorry to hear it, and gets my waitress for me.

When she appears, I tell her about the same thing.  Normally, you don&#39;t want to hear &#34;It sucks, but I&#39;ll make it work.&#34;  If you&#39;re striving for a high level of service, she may have stuck around for a few seconds after dropping off the second one to make sure it was ok instead of running away before I could even ask about the fork marks in the sour cream.  I waited what seemed like an eternity (which was honestly, probably 3 minutes, but on top of everything else, it was too long) to have her come back, and at this point, because of the lack of cheese, I already dug into the sour cream to try to make the thing edible, but I did not succeed.

So, she drops off the bill.  My food is on there (after sending it back, complaining about it, and still not eating it?  No, I&#39;m not paying for it).  So I had the manager come over again.  We explain that we waited a really long time for our food, that my second quesadilla took so long that my boyfriend was done eating.  And that I was disgusted that it was served to me on the same plate.  The manager informed me that it wasn&#39;t and I said, &#34;That&#39;s even worse, because now I don&#39;t know who put the fork marks in my sour cream.&#34;

She informed me that there were not fork marks in my sour cream, that she still had my other quesadilla in the back.  I became insistent, she finally said. &#34;Well, I don&#39;t want to argue anymore&#34; so she huffed off with the receipt and removed my meal from it.

I have never been treated so poorly by a manager in my life.

I called the comment line twice since, my calls have not been returned.  I sent an email through the website, no return email.  So not only did I get awful service, but nobody seems to care about it.

It&#39;s too bad---it was my favorite Mexican restaurant until that fateful lunch that Saturday afternoon.


Update:  Called the restaurant directly.  Spoke to the manager.  According to the manager, I didn&#39;t pay for the food, she didn&#39;t see what the big deal was.  Claims her boss will call me, but she does not have a direct line for him or have any idea when he will drop by.  Also, she claims not to have been there, and I could be wrong, but she sounded very similar, and her name rang a bell.  Hopefully it&#39;s because of a different, more positive visit, but I guess time will tell."

I will not bias this revue based on any past good or bad feelings as a result of having been employed here...it&#39;s been 10 years now since I left the company, and I&#39;ve returned as a customer numerable times since those days.

If you go in with the mindset that this is &#34;Rocky Mountain Chicano&#34; food and not authentic Mexican, you&#39;ll be fine.  The Lucio family recipes for their original menu items are good.  They have the best green chili in Colorado, in my opinion (regular, extra hot or vegetarian choices.)  Their fajitas are stellar, as is the addictive and fattening con queso dip.  Their signature item, the Burrito Supreme, is very very good, a huge portion of beef or chicken and refried beans inside and smothered generously with the wonderful green chili, shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, diced tomato and sour cream and guacamole.

The chicken soup, menudo and tortilla soup are all good, as are their fried ice cream, flan and apple chimichanga desserts.  Nachos are great.  I don&#39;t recommend salad or seafood here; it&#39;s just not their forte (nor authentic to the whole Rocky Mountain hispanic family experience.)

Anything that might seem slightly adventurous (and newer) on their menu is generally not the best choice, so just ask your server what the most popular items are, and they&#39;ll steer you in the right direction.  They have pretty good margaritas, but go top shelf.

Service is generally pretty good; just understand that this is a low-priced old school Colorado Mexican food haunt and as such, don&#39;t expect anything out of the ordinary.

Very kid-friendly, and their chips and salsa are strangely addictive, even though not &#34;authentic&#34; by any means (too much oregano and black pepper.)"

We went there because my boyfriend purchased a Groupon and we were both looking forward to trying a new local place.
Waited a little while (too long, in my opinion) for our waiter.  So long, in fact, that i walked to the bar myself to order a margarita!
Food was so-so, nothing special at all. The queso app had obviously been microwaved which was a huge disappointment (it was very runny and the cheese was glued to teh side, like when you overcook in the micro...).  Our main dishes were okay, we each got enchiladas with rice and beans.  The menu was quite extensive and had a lof of choices, so that&#39;s a plus.
Service was friendly enough, re-filling our waters and chips, but we really didn&#39;t see our waiter after ordering.
May go back, just because it&#39;s within walking distance of our place.
Having the Groupon made me feel better about dinner, too (not paying full price for mediocre mexican food)"

Proceed with caution.

My husband loves Mexican food so we occasionally venture out for it. We&#39;ve eaten at various &#34;chain type&#34; places from here to Tampa, FL (maybe that is our mistake) and are typically disappointed in what we find. And since we&#39;re not IN Mexico, we live with it. This place is really no exception. 

We were seated right away, which was no surprise because there were a total of 6 people in the place (first warning sign, I know). But our server took her time playing around behind the bar (not serving anyone, not restocking...just moving glasses around and nonchalantly wiping things off) before she wandered over to take our drink orders. We were given AMPLE time to go over the menu (read:  it took her 15 minutes to bring carbonated drinks back to the table), at which time we ordered our food. The typical warm chips and salsa were served. And yes, I am not Mexican, but I know what salsa is or isn&#39;t. And it ISN&#39;T tomato PASTE with tiny &#34;might be&#34; onions in it. Right? Right.

My 5 year old ordered a cheese quesadilla and it was awful. It was nice and hot when it was served, but the cheese had a &#34;sour&#34; taste to it. He didn&#39;t finish it. My husband ordered the tri-color enchilada plate. One was cheese, another chicken and finally a beef. He only enjoyed the chicken enchilada, the others were sadly lacking in flavor. I (being extremely conservative with Mexican fare) ordered the two combo enchilada plate with one cheese and onion and one spinach enchilada. The cheese and onion was excellent, I loved it. But the spinach was really, really bland. But I guess that is what I get for ordering a spinach enchilada, eh? All of the dishes were served with refried beans that were very tasty and Spanish rice that was sort of bland. A little bit of good and bad with every bite. LOL

Overall, this place didn&#39;t stand out but neither did it completely disappoint. It was pretty much on par for a chain type Mexican restaurant. Perhaps next time we go out for Mexican food we should try a tiny, hole-in-the-wall, stip mall place. Any suggestions?"

I was terrified that the &#34;shrimp bucket&#34; wouldn&#39;t actually come served in a bucket (hey when it says &#34;bucket&#34; it better be delivered in a bucket) and it did much to my relief.  Anyway the shrimp was lightly battered and plump and the bucket was impressive.  Been here a few times in the past five years and I&#39;m pretty sure based on that experience that we&#39;ll be coming more often assuming we all still are employed in &#39;09.  I think there&#39;s going to be 17 people employed in the US by the end of the year and we&#39;ll all be living in yurts or something.

I&#39;ve never been to the Armadillo before, but on recommendation from my uncle we decided to go.  The food was filling, fast to arrive at the table, although I will agree with some of the other reviewers in that the salsa and queso could have been spicier or at least a bit more flavorful.

The chile rellenos was great, the rest of the main course and dessert was quite good as well.  I&#39;ve tried many different styles of Mexican/tex-mex and &#39;southwestern/new-mexican&#39; food, from the chains to the smaller hole in the wall run by immigrants places. Denver has a wide variety of such food abounding.  Although the Armadillo serves up what is definitely an americanized style of cuisine, it is a reasonably priced tasty place to eat a quick dinner or lunch.  I was very happy with the quality of the food I was served knowing full well I wasn&#39;t going to get the selection found in a burrito van or a hole in the wall place but rather something more sanitized for the american palate.  For this style, the food is rather good. 

Although there seems to be more seating than customers, (the place seems second only to Casa Bonita in cavernous-seating alcoves) they seem to know what they&#39;re doing, as they&#39;ve been around forever.  Late on a Friday night there were about 6 different groups eating. I can imagine there is more of a crowd around lunch and and I for one look forward to going back during lunch some day to find out.

I rate it high up on the kitchy/campy coolness factor as well.  The mariachi music was quite pronounced all throughout dinner :)

To those who say make mexican food yourself, I agree; I can cook up an amazing bean/beef burrito dish in a crock-pot that will make any of these places pale in comparison. But for when I just don&#39;t want to cook? I&#39;ll go here ;) 

Their margarita selection was rather impressive. I forget what I shared but it was very tasty indeed."

I don&#39;t mind going here though.  I actually really like the salsa.  I like that it doesn&#39;t have chunks of  anything...it&#39;s minced well.  I just don&#39;t like chunky salsa...chunks of tomato, onion, jalapeno...gross.  Seems like a simple recipe and fresh...sometimes simplicity is best in my opinion. Every once in a while you&#39;ll get a chunk of garlic, but, I don&#39;t mind that.  They used to sell mole, and it was so good.  Unfortunately they don&#39;t anymore...they kind of americanized the menu.  I mean, it was pretty american before, but, now...even more so.  As far as dessert, I always get the flan which is really good if you happen to enjoy flan like myself.  Oh yeah!  I almost forgot!   The wings are surprisingly very good!  I definitely recommend them.  The chicken soup is good too.  But, definitely try the wings some time!"

They have some unusual items that I haven&#39;t seen at other Mexican restaurants (meat sopapilla, anyone?) and a decently sized selection.

One star gets removed because their queso was only average and the meal itself was a little greasy, even by Mexican food standards.

The decor was cute, the atmosphere was friendly, and the service was quick.  It would be a fun place to take a group of friends without spending much."

First of all I found a shard of glass in my Margarita, I almost swallowed it thinking it was a piece of salt.  I took it out of my mouth and grabbed it with my fingers and it stabbed my finger.  Now for the food.  I had the carne asada and the meat was overcooked and so tough it was inedible.  AND it had no flavor.  The rice was tasteless and so were the beans.  Casa Vallarta or Guadalajara or soooooo much better.  The only reason we even went to Armadillo is because we were headed to Nickel a play (which is amazing, my kids love it) but the food here was so disappointing, my son almost choked on the meat because it was impossible to chew and I almost swallowed a sliver of glass!!!  The margarita was terrible as well, too much sweet and sour -it was rather disgusting- minus the glass.  If you want an award winning margarita go to casa vallarta on parker road.  I am sick and tired of bad businesses being allowed to remain open in Colorado. There should be some kind of standard!"

The food: not the best but not the worst. The duck fat fries are worth every decadent calorie, as they were some of the crispiest fries I&#39;ve had in a while. The fried green tomato caprese salad was the perfect combination of crunchy, tangy and sweet. And, oh, the mac &amp; cheese. This is by far some of the best mac &amp; cheese I&#39;ve had at a restaurant and you should definitely get it if you visit. The only reason that I say the food wasn&#39;t the greatest, is because their sandwiches and entrées seem subpar. That&#39;s just a personal opinion, but I&#39;d stick with appetizers.

The beer: limited. They only had about six beers on tap, from what I remember and I personally would have liked to see more variety from a brewery. They also didn&#39;t have any beers that were truly unique, which is what I&#39;ve come to expect in Colorado.

The service: slow. I don&#39;t know if they were just busy or having a bad day, but once I sat down with my group, it took 20 minutes to order a drink. I also had to flag down our waitress twice just to order some food.

Overall, I would definitely come back for happy hour  and it&#39;s worth checking out if you haven&#39;t been."

I went there once and had a terrible chicken salad, bland and boring. They are turning it around and have started a great lunch special that includes a meal and a beer or cider for $12. 

I went there with a large group of friends, almost everyone ordering the special and I opted for something lighter, a salmon sandwich. It was delicious! The beer and cider there is good and I would much rather stop in for a beer than a bite to eat. I hope their menu evolves and really starts churning out some different food. It can be overpriced and it is competing with a lot of places to eat and drink. Huge place and nice location, hopefully they can handle the area."

Housed in a former book binding warehouse in Denver&#39;s River North Art District, the Rackhouse isn&#39;t the easiest place to locate. The restaurant is located on the second floor (cider production occupies much of the first), a fact that some signage would do well to illuminate. Once you find the place, however, the industrial décor stands out: the tables have (decorative) electric switches, and you can get a view of giant barrels down below.

The menu here is somewhat limited, but even with relatively few choices (and Bierstadt unavailable while the next batch was in production), we still found some appealing options. A starter of mac and cheese (you can also get this as an entrée with a different meat, veggie, or seafood each day) was excellent. The six-cheese recipe was creamy and gooey, and it paired well with the pork dust topping. My wife also enjoyed her Not Bacon LT, which featured mushrooms, fried green tomato, and lemon ricotta on brioche: the lemon notes were an unusual but welcome addition. I went with the Turducken, which combined roast turkey, seared duck breast, and chicken spread on brioche. Though the sandwich successfully evoked Thanksgiving, it sounded better on paper than it actually tasted. Leaving off the accompanying cranberry chutney made it rather dry, and it took an addition of (very good) house-made mustard to impart some needed flavor. Among the available ciders, there is something to suit every palate from dry to semi-sweet to infused with aromatics. The ciders are bereft of added sugars and preservatives and have a clean, refreshing flavor.

Service at The Rackhouse was fairly speedy, and the pricing ($5 for our cup-sized mac and cheese starter, $9 and $12 respectively for our sandwiches) was toward the high end of fair. Overall, The Rackhouse as a unique look, efficient service, and a killer mac and cheese, but it needs more consistency, more signs, and perhaps more options."

Seating is upstairs, but bathrooms are only downstairs. Big plus that ladies room had tampons (sometimes that time can sneak up on you). 

Mac &amp; cheese is just as good as ever. We went with a side of the regular. They have weekly special versions: veggie, meat, and seafood. None of the special offerings appealed when we were there. BBQ chicken sandwich was ok, but bread was too thick for my taste. Jägerschnitzel was very good - thin pork cutlet over absolutely delicious mustard potatoes. &#34;Big ass pretzel&#34; was disappointing. Pretzel was only ok and Obatzda was more like Camembert spread rather than a good blend of Camembert, butter, and paprika (not like the good stuff in Bavaria). I did like the sweet cider. They were out of a liqueur I wanted to try and only had 1 of the 3 desserts on the menu - apparently in process of changing menus. 

Overall it was fine &amp; food was good, but it&#39;s not a place I&#39;d seek out and go out of my way (last location I would have)."

Pluses: That location...larger parking lot, cooler area suspended over the cidery. Love the use of old printmaking equipment and the just awesome vibe of the new place. They even kept their kick-ass Big Lebowski painting.

Minus: Some aspects of the new location are a bit annoying as the whole bar is on the second level, so you have to walk up stairs to get to it and walk back down if you want to say go to the bathroom.

Pluses: Cider is better than whiskey any day in my opinion...love C2 ciders. And they still have a good selection of craft cocktails.

Minuses: I feel the beer list is a actually a little lacking. They didn&#39;t have a porter or stout for example on my last visit. But as it is in a cidery, I guess that should be expected.

Pluses: The food is still great, chef-inspired pub food. I really like the duck-fat fries and many of their sandwiches are fantastic. They kept the legendary mac and cheese from the old place as well, which is great. The bacon on their bacon cheeseburger is a gift from the bacon gods, I&#39;m pretty sure.

Minuses: They also got rid of their amazing beer-cheese pretzel and replaced it with something not as good in my opinion. I like Rackhouse&#39;s food generally, but it is very messy/greasy. I had a chorizo taco and squeezed enough grease out of two tacos that it left a pool that filled my plate in grease (of course chorizo is notoriously greasy, but still). The bacon cheeseburger was also super-messy with sauces and grease coming out all over the place and getting on my hands. Good thing they have cloth napkins, cause you&#39;ll need that and then some to clean up after eating here.

Pluses: The service here is great as always. Chris is a great owner who has come and chatted with me on one visit and the servers are knowledgable and friendly. Same was true with the old Rackhouse, so I am glad that hasn&#39;t changed at all. 

The old Rackhouse was one of my favorite bars/restaurants and while the new one isn&#39;t the same, I think it is still one of my favorites."

Glad she did because we got two free beers and some delicious food in a repurposed paper mill with great views of the Rockies. Super cool industrial vibe and they make their own ciders which were really good. They are jsut getting their brewery operation started. We only had the duck fat fries and kimchi meatballs. Both were quite good. Staff really friendly too. We wanted an empty growler (glassware was really neat) and even though the pricing for it empty was not on the list, he was able to enter it manually."

My return to the new RHP meant my expectations were high and the moment I started reading the menu expectation took the path of disappointment - quickly. Between me and the manfriend we ordered: side salad, mac n cheese, a pretzel, the brick chicken, the dip sandwich and mussels. The mac n cheese was good, not great; the pretzel came with the strangest cheese concoction and was rather off tasting; the brick chicken left a lot to be desired, such as moisture; (not going to review a side salad); manfriend reported the dip and mussels were delicious. 
If RHP&#39;s menu was haunted by the ghosts of the old RHP, bringing back the delicious ribs and bbq, I&#39;d be returning promptly; but, it doesn&#39;t have these key features and unfortunately I won&#39;t be hurrying back for mac n cheese."

NOTE: the action is all upstairs, there is a chair lift but it is by no means universally designed nor obvious. And the restrooms are downstairs, along with a store that sells shirts and to go booze (at crazy prices, crazy high).

I loved the old Rackhouse and I love cider, so this is a no-brainer. But, it isn&#39;t quite up to snuff. Yet, I hope. First off, you can&#39;t do a cider sampler. What?! Ridiculous, but our server hooked up some &#39;tasters&#39;. Regardless, their ciders are all delicious, despite their heavy price tag (around $6 for about 14 oz maybe?). 

They have some beers available too and I think they are going to expand to brew on site at some point. They have a large bar area and a variety of tables for seating. There was also a fun large screen showing old timey silent films and an oversized antique liquor sign. I like the vibe and feel, plus we had a great server.

The menu feels like it is trying too hard. Burgers are a solid bet, but I got a salad with a crab cake and it wasn&#39;t great or large. What happened to the old menu of amazingness? Can we at least have less &#39;burned&#39; items with trendy ingredients and no real substance? Throw some wings or nachos on that list for the rest of us who need to build a base for drankin!

Plus, being it is a new business it would&#39;ve been nice if the managers walked around and chatted us up. Our lovely server pointed out that the two gentlemen arriving shortly after us were owner/manager types and that they often come hang out at the bar. There were only a handful of others there when we arrived and these guys went straight to their spot. Lucky for them, our server was amazing.

I think this place can become amazing if they want to make some improvements. It is a large space that can host events or parties, but I hesitate to recommend it currently due to the high prices and small menu."

They had a short-but-decent tap list awaiting the lagers. New chef with the &#39;brew food&#39; concept. No more pizza or chili on the menu. My fave was the chili-mac :( We ordered the pretzel. It came with tangy course mustard and this amazing cheese spread that had chunks of brie in it and topped with pickled red onion (SO GOOD). We split the porchetta sammich. The meat/veggies/bun were very fresh. The candied bacon was a great compliment. I suggest asking for a side of the course mustard for this sammich. The mustard tang, sweet bacon, tender pork and buttery brioche-type bun all combined perfectly. I&#39;m really looking forward to heading back for lagers. 

Also, the baby devoured the mac n cheese."

It&#39;s all hipsterfied now with a bunch of things that sound fancy but don&#39;t really taste all that amazing.  The mac and cheese is still great but i can&#39;t really say the same for anything else.  The burgers used to be the best in the metro, but now there is only one and it is less-than impressive. Maybe I&#39;m one of those old geezers who longs for the days when RINO really was industrial and where the metro wasn&#39;t a gentrified, overpriced maze of superficial condo hell.  Or maybe the Rackhouse just really ain&#39;t all that great anymore. What do I know?  I only know what my tastebuds tell me, regardless of what fancy name you give it or how many creative, artisan adjectives you can fit into the description.

When I ordered my food, I couldn&#39;t even finish my sentence and he was walking away, assuming I was done making my order. I had to ask him to come back so I could order a side, and as I did that, he did the same thing. Halfway through my meal he announced his shift was ending, and that the bartender would be taking care of me. 10 minutes later the bartender came by, and at the end of my meal, I had to approach the bar to pay my bill.

I always had a great experience.  There was plenty to drink and eat and the service was usually very good.  It was a place that I would go out of my way for and I often did.  I would bring people there from out of town and they would rave about it.

The new Rackhouse is gorgeous on the inside.  The seating area and bar area are both on the second floor and it overlooks a brewery and cider company operation below.  It has that modern industrial feel that&#39;s everywhere now.  The windows facing west offer great views.  It was a little dark and it wasn&#39;t crowded.  The service was excellent.  Everyone was helpful, informative and excited about the place, which is great to see from the staff.  There are TV&#39;s in the bar area, but from where I sat by the west windows we couldn&#39;t see them.

For food, I started with the pretzel which was perfect.  The mustard and cheese that comes with it were both excellent.  I had the Schnitzel for my main course and while it was good and an interesting take on a classic dish, it had it&#39;s flaws.  I don&#39;t think the pork was thin enough and it was tough in some places.  Probably not tenderized the way it should be.  It was served with some potatoes which weren&#39;t very tender so maybe they weren&#39;t not cooked enough, but they were flavorful.  The dunkel mushroom gravy was really tasty and I found myself wishing I had more.  For dessert I had the Smores which was pretty good.  I did manage to sample the O.G. mac n cheese and it&#39;s very good.

Overall, if you liked the original Rackhouse you need to go try the new incarnation so you can decide for yourself.  Personally, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be coming back to this location as often as it&#39;s farther away and I feel like it offers less.  I applaud them for coming back and making it truly their own slice of paradise, but I left still missing the old Rackhouse."

We went for the Chateubriand with a side of duck fat fries and mac n&#39; cheese. While good, it was not in the same ballpark as the ribs were. It was solid, but not outstanding. Mac n&#39; cheese was great, but that will never be something that will drag me to a restaurant.

Sad to see that some of our other favorites from the original menu were gone though, but I guess it&#39;s to be expected that some things would change. 

All in all, the food was good, but nothing to write home about. Our pretzel came out so crispy and hard that I was concerned about breaking my tooth on it. I was told the By the Earth (veggie) mac of the week was broccolini, but it came out with zucchini and onions. The mac and cheese itself was good. I missed the amazing garlic bread they served with it at the old Rackhouse though. 

Service was mediocre at best. It wasn&#39;t busy so I don&#39;t understand why everything took so long. Our server was friendly, but had absolutely no sense of urgency and wasn&#39;t very attentive.

I hope they can work out their kinks. If we go back again it will probably only be to try Bierstadt when it opens in there."

The new location serves the same exact mac and cheese as the old location and it is literally the best I&#39;ve ever had! They are newly opened so they&#39;re still working out a few small kinks (like poor lighting at a few booths) but once they get it figured out, it will be worth it! Go now and try to tell me this isn&#39;t the best mac and cheese you&#39;ve ever had! I dare you! Plus, the drinks (I&#39;ve noticed they have decided to theme some of them after The Big Lebowski, one of my favorite movies) are delicious! I tried 3 of them and they were all fantastic! One with Whiskey, one with Tequila and one with Vodka. All amazing! And our server? I&#39;m terrible with names but I wish I remembered his. He was absolutely fantastic and energetic!

But still gave it a shot...had an excellent cider (since beer list wasn&#39;t so inspiring) and opted for the huge pretzel. It was ok, but definitely not worth $9...maybe 6 or 7 max.

Two young men, possibly brothers, were serving.  They were young, polite and very friendly.  The woman cooking was also very nice and greeted us cordially upon entry.

Now on to the food...I have mixed emotions.  I don&#39;t want to be the only one that has negative opinions, especially when the majority give the place five stars, but here are a few notes on our food:

Menudo - Very tender tripe, but bland.  Broth was so &#34;clean&#34;, I imagine the tripe was cooked separately and the original cooking broth was probably not used in the menudo.

Carne Asada / Lengua Tacos - nice, flavor and the meat was tender with fresh avocado and tomatoes.  Meat looked like it was chopped earlier and held in a warmer, otherwise very good.

Chili Rellenos - Traditional egg battered with rice and beans.  You can taste the flame broiled chiles.  My only pet peeve was seeing her pull out a tray of rellenos from the reach in refrigerator, prepared and cooked, followed by the sounds of likely a microwave.  I have worked in restaurants in my past lives and know you have to take steps to ensure quick service.  However, for Chile Rellenos, I would have preferred they be fresh fried. 

All in all, 3 stars for the food, but 4 stars for the service; I will happily round up to an overall 4 star rating and recommend going there."

TLF is exactly the kind of family-run small business that does things well and that should be supported.

When I first came in they gave me salsa and chips.  It came with a regular salsa and a green chili one.  The green chili was their local salsa. I ordered the steak smothered burrito and it lived up to my expectations.  It was the perfect amount of spice. This is a small cute family run place.  The burrito was made quickly and everyone was friendly.  I only wish I lived here so I could eat here more.

We stumbled upon this place, you guessed it, on Yelp. Wanting to try the breakfast burrito, we made the journey to the Highlands with high hopes. Entering the restaurant lifted our sprits even more. This place is TINY (only 4 tables) and the kitchen is literally RIGHT THERE next to you when you&#39;re sitting. If you eat ethnic food with any regularity, you know that the best restaurants are usually the hole-in-the-wall type places. Needless to say, I was stoked. 

The wait-staff (who I assume are part of the family who own the restaurant) were attentive and quick to help us. We ordered two vegetarian breakfast burritos (not on the menu, but other Yelpers mentioned that they were very accommodating... plus, the sign on the window literally says &#34;vegetarian&#34;). Meanwhile we munched on the chips and salsa, which were quite yummy. 

When the burritos arrived, my heart was overflowing with happiness. These things were works of art, piled high with glorious toppings and soaking in a pool of delicious green-chile sauce. It was the most unique, and most delicious, sauce I have ever tasted--with ingredients like potatoes, zucchini/squash (I think), cheese, and avocado. There was also a heaping pile of super yummy rice service with the burrito. It was one of the most delicious burritos I&#39;ve ever had. 

So why am I only giving them 4 stars, you ask? Well... I had my heart set on a breakfast burrito. And despite the absolute gloriousness of the burrito I received, it was most definitely NOT a breakfast burrito. To be honest, I&#39;m not even sure what type of burrito it was--It was a medley of beans and grilled veggies. Sadly, there were no eggs to be found. 

That mishap aside, I&#39;ve found a new favorite for non-breakfast Mexican food. Whenever I&#39;m craving an out-of-this-world amazing burrito I will come back to Taqueria La Familia without a second thought. 

If you love Mexican food (and even if you don&#39;t) do yourself a favor and GET HERE."

I had this place bookmarked as the reviews mentioned that they can accommodate vegetarians with ease. Now, you need to look past the menu to feel comfortable that you can eat here as a vegetarian. There is not much specifically listed. I think veggie tacos was the only thing. However, they have a huge picture on the window of a vegetarian smothered burrito. Slight discrepancy. 

We sat down and were immediately served with fresh chips and two tasty salsas. This is clearly a family run business and the whole family was chipping in to cook our food and wait on us. We asked if we could get a vegetarian breakfast burrito smothered in the vegetarian green chile (again this was not listed as an option on the menu). They immediately said yes and asked if cheese was okay and which kind of tortilla we liked. The food came out quickly. Upon arrival we were slightly surprised as our burritos did not look like the breakfast variety. 

This burrito though. Damn it was good. I&#39;m not even sure what was inside it since the wonderful spread on top took the show! I think it was beans, cheese, and a medley of grilled veggies (zucchini and summer squash). The burrito was then smothered in a wonderful vegetarian green chile with perfect spice. On top was a mixture of goodness that brought this burrito up several levels. It was a Grinch-heart-growing kind of change. Lettuce and tomato + more grilled veggies + sour cream + avocado + thin sliced potato rounds (these were bomb). From the ingredient list this doesn&#39;t seem like anything insane but it was. Legit insane. 

Yes, it is true that I am not really sure what we ordered. It was not a standard breakfast burrito and may have not been a breakfast burrito at all. I don&#39;t care though. It was that good. I only hope that I can figure out what to order next time to get the same thing. 

Icing on top was that we rolled out of this place super full of amazing burrito for only $12 for two people. Nice!"

So I think people in Colorado grow accustomed to a certain kind of &#34;Mexican food&#34; that is basically our own variation of New Mexican food. So I ordered a green chili plate expecting that the might have Colorado-ized their menu. They didn&#39;t.

The plate seemed pretty authentic. Rice, refried beans, potatoes and meat. It was quite pleasant. They brought us some chips (that I believe are homemade) and some very fresh salsa. It was better than most salsa at Mexican restaurants.

The service was quick and friendly and the food was pretty good. I think you just expect something a little different from a restaurant in Denver. I&#39;d definitely recommend this place, my colleague said it was some of the best (and most authentic) Mexican food she&#39;d ever had."

Instantly, we were greeted with a smile, and seated in this small but cozy space.  An assortment of salsas arrived with some unique chips that looked homemade, and if they weren&#39;t the salsas definitely were.

When we arrived they were out of everything on the menu except for the veggie, tongue, steak and al pastor tacos. Luckily we were in the mood for tacos. I had never tried tongue tacos before, but if I was ever going to do it, this was the place, so I went for it. You get 5 tiny tacos in an order and they are fantastic. Fresh veggies and plenty of avocado which is key. The tongue was super tender and flavorful. The prices are very reasonable too.

The place is tiny and nothing to look at so make sure you sit outside. My husband had a smothered burrito and was super happy with it and I had shrimp tostadas which simply had an incredible amount of fresh shrimp on a tostada with lime and very light seasoning and avocado. My plate was big enough for 2 people and I loved its freshness. The tostada was a bit greasy but I used the free chips to scoop the shrimp instead which made it perfect"

The chips and salsa are delicious, particularly the salsa. It was fresh and spicy with a touch of cumin. Our waitress/cook re-filled our bowl three times. 

I got the chili relleno plate and the hubs got the chicken enchiladas. We both noticed that the food tasted good but wasn&#39;t super salty as so much restaurant food can be. The beans and rice were good, not the very best I&#39;ve ever had, but tasty. 

The chili rellenos were classic egg battered and then covered with green chili. There wasn&#39;t as much cheese as I would have liked (not that my waist line needed it) but the flavor was good. I

Overall, it was a solid meal experience with a super sweet lady serving up tasty food."

We looked at another restaurant across the street which was actually closed, so we came to Taqueria la Familia because they had &#34;vegetarian&#34; right there on the window. 
Background: I&#39;m a vegetarian.
Also background: I freaking love mexican food but have the hardest time finding anything decent on most menus for vegetarians. One bean burrito on an entire menu is super limiting and frankly pretty boring.
CUE TAQUERIA LA FAMILIA.
We sat outside, and our waiter (I am assuming he&#39;s the owner) put down chips and salsa, and then put down chili and, get this, actually asked if we ate meat. WHAT. You rock. I tell him no and he brings out another one that&#39;s identical without meat. Delicious.
I ask what on the menu is vegetarian. He tells me the veggie tacos, or they can just make anything that I want and make it vegetarian, &#34;we could do some enchiladas with cheese smothered in chili without any meat. Oh, do you eat cheese? How about sour cream?&#34;
This guy is easily one of the best, if not THE best waiter I have ever had. Incredibly attentive and sensitive to my preferences. 
Food rocked, we both devoured our meals. Will definitely be back if I get a chance.

This Taqueria offers a very authentic feel, from both the food and the staff.

Service: The staff are friendly and very responsive.  The waiter who served us provided good suggestions about the menu, and was very careful to identify the kinds of food available for vegetarians (&#34;Our green chile is vegetarian...but do you eat cheese?  Can we put eggs on your plate?&#34;).  He was very kind about my dietary choices, which is not my experience at other Mexican restaurants.  He quickly translated our orders to the cook in the &#34;kitchen,&#34; which is pretty much in the same location as the dining area (the whole restaurant is the size of a postage stamp).  Our food, needless to say, came out quickly and was piping hot.  

The food: delicious.  My boyfriend got the chimichanga plate, which was HUGE, and immediately wolfed down the whole meal.  I had the veggie tacos (enough food for two days), and was delighted by the balance of flavors--not too spicy, not bland, not greasy.  Just right.  The veggie green chile was good, but didn&#39;t have the anglicized sweet-saltiness that I&#39;m used to.  My boyfriend raved about it, however.  

The price: probably the best deal in the Highlands.  Meals were about $7-10.  Chips were free.  I recommend tipping well--the staff deserve it.

This place is fun for a relaxed date or for taking out your non-snooty friends for delicious food.  Although it offers some of the best Mexican food in town, this restaurant&#39;s decor is decidedly rundown, so be prepared.  A good place to take people if you want to establish &#34;authentic Mexican food connoisseur&#34; credibility."

I was glad I stopped for a breakfast burrito. It&#39;s a tiny restaurant shoehorned into a space between the theater and the other shops on the block, with room for just several tables, a counter with a large glass serving container of fresh-made horchata and a tray of utensils and napkins. Behind the counter, Maria runs the joint and has cooked up the food alone for &#34;about two years.&#34; She got us a bowl of chips with salsa, then horchatas before cooking up my chorizo and egg burrito, which came smothered with lots of lettuce and tasty, not-too-spicy green chile (which didn&#39;t have a lot, if any chunks of pork but tasted great). The chorizo was in chunks as if it was grilled as a flat patty then cut up -- it wasn&#39;t the typical ground chorizo style. It was mixed with eggs and the balance of flavors was fantastic. When we left, she insisted on giving us a huge second bag of chips (not homemade but good) and filled up our horchatas to go.

We called ahead and ordered about 6 plates, with a specific request to separate the macaroni salad from the rest of the food due to our friend&#39;s kids&#39; food allergies. They gave us an estimated time the order would be ready and when we got there, they really delivered on the time and the request. The guy working the counter even tied all our bags for us and walked the food to our car (we got there a bit early and we waited in the car with our toddler after we paid). 

Super friendly service and delicious food! The kalua pork was amazing and everyone (who could eat it) loved the macaroni salad! The BBQ plates were also yummy but tbh nothing beat the kalua pork. If you can make the trek to Thornton, come here!"

They have two portion sizes for meals, regular and mini, and to be honest, the mini is the perfect size for being satisfied and not overly full.  I ordered the mini sized portion of the Honey Garlic Chicken which had a scoop of rice and the delicious macaroni salad, and I also added an order of the Spam Musubi.  The food was so good and very inexpensive.  The restaurant is small but has plenty of room for seating.  The restaurant is relatively clean, and when we came for an early lunch (around 10:45ish) there was only one person working the restaurant.  She was doing the cooking and taking the orders both from the phone and walk-ins.  I felt bad for her, and didn&#39;t complain that our food took a little time to come out.  We weren&#39;t in a hurry anyways, and it was well worth the wait.  Fortunately, right around the start of peak lunch time, two other people came to help her out.

I definitely recommend this place if you&#39;re passing through the area and want a taste of Hawaiian food.  It seems like the locals come through here quite often."

We tried a cross section of items, and were not wowed by anything we tried. Everything they had was either not as good or about as good as L&amp;L. Their honey garlic chicken is apparently katsu with a sweet sauce. You have to peel the garlic shrimp yourself. They didn&#39;t have any chopsticks. The BBQ ribs were the thinnest I&#39;ve ever had, the entire rack fit in my mouth at once comfortably. No curry for chicken katsu. Won&#39;t be visiting again anytime soon.

I had their Large Kalua Pork with cabbage. First off their portion is much smaller than what I&#39;m used to. Their sliced cabbage too raw for me. What&#39;s up with the the dinky portion? I can only imagine how small their mini portion is.

My friend had the BBQ plate. The biggest piece in there was the chicken. The rest? Not worth it. I suggest to go for a more singular approach. Beef or Pork. You end up more satisfied that way.

As far as service and presentation ( what presentation? You don&#39;t come here for that) this place is good. The one person show was doing good since it wasn&#39;t busy. The styrofoam container still bugs me to this day. In Hawaii it&#39;s ok to serve in a styrofoam because the restaurants answers to a higher demand by their local government as far as cooking oil and waste reductions are concerned and the fix to that is quite expensive! Who has that much money laying around when you&#39;re a small business? But here in the lower 48? Come on! Use regular plates! Styrofoams DO NOT do well in landfills.

Can&#39;t get enough of it so right when we arrived in Denver and on our way to Estes Park, we found Aloha through Yelp. Yes 10am is pretty early for a big meal, but maybe we want to eat this much for brunch! Aloha has a pretty good variety of Hawaiian dishes so it was hard for me to make a choice.  I chose the Kahlua Pork in Regular size. It was amazing and delicious, tasted just like in Hawaii!  OMG, and the mac salad was amazing as well. I only wish they served two scoops of that vs. two scoops of rice. Our cashier/waitress was great. It was only her for about 45 minutes taking orders and serving and she did a good job when handling several phone orders and walk-in customers after we placed our order. Aloha is a very small hole-in-the-wall and it doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside, but don&#39;t let that hold you back.

Aloha Hawaiian Barbecue 
8623 Washington street 
Thornton, Colorado 
I bought 4 tickets at $10 each, for  a BBQ dinner, $40 bucks to support Skyview Highschool Athletics. So, I have gone there a total of three times and they have been closed. So I went yesterday on Sunday, it&#39;s closed! So, I went today at 10 am, since they aren&#39;t open after 7pm. They refused to honor my tickets. I was kind and nice, explained that I have come several times and you were not open. The girl tells if they aren&#39;t busy, the owner will tell them to close early but she can not, honor my tickets! 
To tell you the truth, I don&#39;t think I would even eat there, it&#39;s filthy and disgusting inside and has a foul smell!


Follow up

After checking with the athletic director at Skyview Highschool verifying this was legitimate fundraising between them and Aloha Hawaiian BBQ.  We informed her of the issues and not honoring the tickets sold. She returned my call and said to go there today and they would honor them.  So I called ahead of time, order the four mixed plate dinners. I got there and told the young girl, about 16 years old, I was there to pick up the four dinners, she asked for the tickets. I told the young girl, I was sorry about the misunderstanding, even though she is not involved. She in turn, starts acting all ghetto and talking, telling me &#34;I&#39;m just troublemaker and that didn&#39;t need to be calling Skyview Highschool and starting trouble for them.&#34; And that the owner said to tell me, &#34; To take my dinners and that I was not welcomed in here and to never step foot in there! &#34; I smiled and told her thank you and that I would not be removing my comment on YELP, about them but would be add more about their service. I also point to their front door that says Aloha and told her, they needed to learn what it means and need to learn the Aloha spirit. She then started yelling loudly, 
Mahalo, Mahalo, Mahalo! 

Oh yes and just as I expected the chicken meat was raw and uncooked and not cooked properly. I ended up tossing them in the trash. Out of fear, that it could make my grandkids sick! What kind of business does this!
Please Friends
Stay Away from this place !"

Aloha&#39;s food was really good, the only bad things we had were one of the things in the BBQ mix (I&#39;m not sure which but it was really thin) was way over cooked and the white rice had something funky going on. I gave Aloha 4 stars but the interior of the restaurant took it down at least 1 star. It was dirty, the Hawaiian theme didn&#39;t match half the restaurant (e.g. Orange counter but on the bottom half of the counter it was dark green and black tiles...) When we came to Aloha we were planning on eating at the restaurant but ended up taking it home because the place was so grimy. We aren&#39;t sure if we will come back, the food was delish (most of it) (beware on the white rice!) but the interior decor and just basic things like paint colors and the dirt through us off."

A wide variety of people were hanging out and eating, which is always good sign for a restaurant. The owners put their money into banging out pretty good food quickly, rather than spending money on kitschy Hawaiian ambiance, which is fine by me. I had some pork, with the two scoops of rice and a scoop of Macaroni Salad. For as basic of a meal as that is, it certainly hit the spot and was the proper price for what it was. I know I would go there for a casual meal on my lunch break all the time were it in my neck of the woods. My only regret is I didn&#39;t try one of the Hawaiian sodas they had in their cooler."

The menu is full of all the classics. I got a combo plate with honey garlic chicken and loco moco. Just as you&#39;d expect, it came with two scoops white rice and mac salad. SO GOOD. I absolutely loved the food. The sauce on the honey garlic chicken was perfection and the loco moco came with solid gravy covering the egg and patty.

This place will leave your mouth watering and begging for more. The dishes are huge and packed full of flavor. With Hawaiian restaurants being relatively scarce it&#39;s a pleasant surprise to find an affordable place that offers Grade-A food. The Chicken Katsu was amazing; it was crispy, covered in a honey garlic sauce that tasted heavenly, served with two scoops of rice and a side of macaroni there&#39;s not much more you can ask for.

Additionally the service was great. This place is a bit run down and is definitely a hole in the wall. However as long as the food remains this cheap and delicious I can&#39;t really complain.

The food was good a typical Hawaiian lunch plate at decent prices.
The atmosphere was very hole in the wall as is most of the businesses in this neighborhood but what was strange is that it seemed to be ran by 3 teenage girls and they did a good job. One took our order one cooked and one cleaned.
The food was better at a place I went to in aurora but the wait was ridiculous because everyone and their mother was there and I&#39;m not driving to aurora every time I have a craving.

Food here is pretty legit. Being from California, I&#39;ve had my fair share of Hawaiian BBQ and this place definitely stays true to my standards. Chicken Katsu is pure bliss here. It&#39;s such a simple dish, but Aloha does it right. Crispy and lean cut, and they give you a pretty big portion as well. They also get major props for always giving me two katsu sauces instead of one.

Location is pretty easy to get to, and there&#39;s plenty of parking in its little strip mall. Service has always been friendly as well! The place itself looks a little dated and grungy, but don&#39;t let that scare you. You&#39;re bound to get some good eats here.

Anyhow, we ordered a Portuguese sausage musubi, Kalua pork and the luau plate. Everything came out together and everything tasted good. The Kalua pork was cut with cabbage which kept the price down but also halved the amount of pork. What pork I got was tasty. 

The Mac salad was good and the rice was perfectly sticky. Overall a solid meal for a reasonable $23. It wasn&#39;t what we had in Hawaii by a long shot but decent nonetheless."

The girl at the register is awesome. My husbands first time eating here so we went a little crazy. Manapuas, spam musubi, bbq chicken musubi, chicken Katsu musubi, honey garlic chicken with rice and macaroni salad. We even got an order of their bbq chicken for free because our order came out wrong. The food is amazing. Their rice is light and fluffy like it should be, Mac salad is yum and all their food is made to order. The honey garlic chicken knocked my socks off. It was lightly breaded cooked to perfection and the sauce was just right- complimented the chicken beautifully. Manapuas were light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness- like little cloud breads flying into my mouth. I left there feeling very comforted by the food. The people that work there are all just so friendly. This place is like no other. Not fancy but very homey feeling. Think I got my hubby hooked. Their passion fruit and guava drinks remind me of picking fruit straight from the tree and eating it in Hawaii."

As it is, I&#39;ve only really had the combo plates. They&#39;re awesome, but man, the lunch stuff looks incredible.

The first thing you&#39;ll notice when you enter is how friendly the owner and employees are. Everybody treats you like you&#39;re family and that they&#39;re legitimately glad you came. The only issue with the staff: there sometimes aren&#39;t enough of them. Aloha is, as far as I can tell, a family affair, so you might be waiting a bit if you come when it&#39;s busy.

The food is largely excellent with a couple of misses. The BBQ mix is my favorite, combining short ribs, bbq chicken, and thinly sliced beef in generous portions with rice and macaroni salad for under $10. I tried the seafood combo once and was disappointed that everything tasted a little samey and too salty. Hawaii might be an island state, but stick with the land animals when you&#39;re ordering food here. I&#39;ve also never really liked macaroni salad, and Aloha has done nothing to remedy this, so...it&#39;s probably...just.....normal macaroni salad...?

If you have a big appetite or are looking for something simple to go, try the musubi. Pretty much every musubi item is awesome and works well as a quick snack. 

Finally, the interior is very lowkey, but I have yet to see any of the bug problems many other Yelpers complain about after about four separate visits. I don&#39;t know if they fixed it, I&#39;m blind, or just come at the right times, but it&#39;s something you should certainly gauge for yourself."

Friday November 8th 2013, even with I-270 West Bound and I-25 North driving with very BAD Traffic, we managed to arrive at Aloha Hawaiian BBQ before 18:00hrs.  Actually we visited the Tailor next door, to ask about some alteration at the earlier time slot...

Thankfully we arrived early, coz this establishment is packed to the brim with other patrons, after we arrived.  Yes, you order at the Counter and pay your order.  The lovely lady who is behind the counter, will be the one who take your order and she is also the one who will send your food to your table.

Hubs opt to have #1 Chicken Mix, Hawaiian BBQ Chicken and Chicken Katsu ($8.75), while I opt to have #2 BBQ Mix, Hawaiian BBQ Beef, Chicken and Shortribs ($9.00).  All the Combination Plates are served with 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of Macaroni (Mac) Salad.

Hubs also opt to have Side Orders of Gravy Fries ($2.25). I also opt to have the Mini of Garlic Shrimp that comes with 1 scoop of Rice and 1 scoop of Mac Salad ($5.95).  Hubs opt to have Cola ($1.00) while I opt to have Hawaiian Sun Strawberry Guava ($1.25) as our beverages.

We waited abit since its ONLY &#34;Uncle&#34;, who is cooking in the kitchen.  Yes, the food came out in White Styrofoam Food Containers.  It was WORTH The Wait, Hubs added.  After one bite of the Chicken Katsu, Hubs said, that is one of the BEST CHICKEN KATSU he ever ate.  Wahhh...  I whispered to myself...   The Chicken Katsu that ALOHA Hawaiian BBQ made, was even better than any other Japanese/Sushi Restaurant he compared with.  Hubs even compared to another BBQ establishment the one located in Aurora. Then with the Gravy Fries, Hubs like it ALOT too..  He rate this establishment 3.5 stars and he wants to return in the future to try other items from their Menu.

With my order of the BBQ Mix, Yes, it flavorful.  The Sweet, Peppery, Salty Notes all combined.  The Chicken was tender, and the rest of the Food are cooked just right.  The Mini Box of Garlic Shrimp was A-OK.  Its SHELL ON Shrimp, and there are 4 pieces in my order.  All in all the food is Good, and definitely more returns to Aloha Hawaiian BBQ in the future.  All in all we are a fan of this establishment and we ARE WILLING To Drive from the other side of town just to go to Aloha Hawaiian BBQ!

There were also many phone orders to go while we enjoyed our dinner here, so be prepared to wait.

Left the establishment at 19:20hrs.

But my wife is and she LOVES coming here so I go.  She tries to convert me like she has with so many other foods and I have to say, the food here is pretty darn good.  

I&#39;m pretty picky so I am not a fan of the macaroni salad because it is just too warm to my liking but that is across the board.  It&#39;s a temperature thing for me.  I like my macaroni salad and potato salad chilled so I&#39;ll stick with the Mahi fish and rice and Hawaiian guava nectar juice.  

The people here are extremely friendly.  The owner even gave me a complimentary Malasada for free and it was AMAZING!

So I give them 4 stars because it&#39;s the best Hawaiian food I&#39;ve had.  I want to be a fan, I really do, I just have a picky palette about what I like to eat.  But I&#39;ll keep nibbling when the wife comes to gorge on good Hawaiian.  As long as she&#39;s happy, I&#39;m happy.

I&#39;m a huge fan of Hawaiian BBQ.  This place is *gasp* run by... Hawaiians!!  It&#39;s the Real Deal.  They have that Pidgin Accent, they&#39;re friendly and cheerful and just... Island Style.

The Hawaiian Lunch Plate.  Two Sizes:  Regular (If you haven&#39;t eaten in 2 days, perfect amount.  If you have, Leftovers, Baby!  $8ish)  and the Mini ($.5.95... Perfect size for a one-person meal, especially when paired with a Musubi, or some Malasadas (Sweet fried dough balls tossed in sugar... WHAAT??)  or even a shared Saimin (Hawaiian Style Noodle Bowl.)  Also a few combo plates, only available in Regular Size, for about $9, and really, the way to go to sample a bit of everything.  But definitely SHARE these.  They&#39;re... Big.

Here&#39;s the deal:  Scoop of Rice (2 for the regular) Scoop of Mac Salad (Ambrosial heaven) some shredded cabbage with the protein of your choice on top.  And that protein can be:  Chicken Katsu.  Mahi FIsh. Honey Garlic Chicken.  Spam.  Short Rib.  ChaSiu.  Shrimp.  Loco Moco.  More.  Grab a side of KimChee for an extra Tang... Or some Sriracha or Soy, up on the counter.  They also have Manpua, just your basic Hawaiian version of Char Siu Bao (Steamed white dough filled with sweet roast pork, ChaSiu.)

Sandwiches, too, for about $3.50.  Hamburger, Spam, Spam and Egg, Portugese Sausage, Mahi Fish.  You&#39;ll need (probably) to pair those with something extra, like a side of the (Ambrosial) Mac Salad ($.89), or a Musubi (Rice wrapped in Nori Seaweed with Spam or Chicken Katsu or BBQ Beef... Like a big Hand-Held Sushi.  $1.75-$1.99.) 

Wash it all down with some Hawaiian Sun juice drinks, and you&#39;re good to go.

I will not say &#34;Ono&#34;... I will not say &#34;Ono&#34;... I will NOT say &#34;Ono&#34;!!!!  Because I am NOT Hawaiian and that would just be cheesy.

I&#39;ve only had Hawaiian food at L&amp;L so this place was a departure for me.  

It&#39;s located in a small strip mall and admittedly we drove past it the first time because we didn&#39;t see it.  

Once we entered we were greeted by some of the most friendly people on the planet.  We were the only customers inside and the people working were making sure we got rock star service.  The man behind the counter asked us a few questions and once he figured out I had the Chicken Katsu before he knew exactly what to give us.  He made us two combination plates that included, BBQ Short Ribs, Honey Garlic Chicken, some rice, and the infamous macaroni salad.  

The BBQ Short Ribs were my favorite, salty and sweet and I could eat it right off the bone.  I was licking the sauce from my fingers as I took each bite.  The Honey Garlic Chicken was more sweet than anything and I was craving a bit of spice to balance out the overwhelmingly sweet notes. The macaroni salad has more mayonnaise than should ever be in one dish but somehow it tastes so good.  I found myself mixing the macaroni salad with some of the BBQ sauce to give it more flavor.  I&#39;m a girl that likes to mix her food and combine flavors for the perfect bite, don&#39;t judge. 

Hawaiian BBQ is definitely not an everyday thing for me, but on occasion I would love to eat my way through a combination plate and dream of Hawaii."

I had the Portuguese Sausage, Spam, eggs, and rice.  I had a side of their Macaroni Salad too.  My son and wife had the BBQ Mix.  My other son had the Honey Garlic Chicken.  

The Macaroni Salad was good and reminded me of &#34;Zippy&#39;s&#34; on Oahu.  I tried the pork, chicken and beef on my wife&#39;s plate.  Yummy!  We do the &#34;X out of 10&#34; rating scale at our house.  We each rated our meal at 8, that yields the 4 stars!

Service was friendly and the food was freshly made.  All in all it whet our appetites for a return to the Aloha State.  We all loved it and agreed that we will return again!"

Let me start by saying that I&#39;m fairly new to Hawaiian BBQ. I&#39;ve only been a handful of times, but all I can say is that I could eat this food every day. It&#39;s just too bad this place is so far from my house. Or maybe it&#39;s a good thing for both my wallet and my waistline that it&#39;s not.
 
The restaurant itself is fairly small and tucked away in a small strip in Thornton. It&#39;s pretty easy to miss, so keep your eyes open. It&#39;s family owned and operated with love, and it shows! The staff is super friendly and they always greet you with a friendly &#34;Aloha.&#34;
 
If it&#39;s your first time eating Hawaiian BBQ, you might ask them what they recommend. But honestly, I don&#39;t think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. I typically get the combo plate #1 with Chicken Katsu and Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. All the plate lunches come with two scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad. If you&#39;re feeling adventurous add an order of spam musubi, it&#39;s delicious.
 
Come hungry and leave full.
 
Mahalo!"

I had the Garlic Honey Chicken and that was AMAZING also! There is only one small complaint and that was the rice was a bit to mushy for our liking but because everything else was phenomenal I have 5 stars!

First of all- staff was super nice and super helpful. 5 stars for that. 
The food was presented (to everyone it seemed) in Styrofoam to go containers and then served with more Styrofoam plates. Serve yourself water seems a little unhygienic, but that&#39;s what was available.
As for the food, it was good, but it wasn&#39;t by any stretch amazing. The meat was all cooked so it was tender and delicious, but it just wasn&#39;t 5 star stuff. I have to say that I was disappointed, but only because it was rated so high by fellow yelpers. Sadly, I wouldn&#39;t return since there are lots of other hole in the walls to explore."

The restaurant is tiny, but they offer a lot of Hawaii food choices for decent prices.  This is a nice alternative to L&amp;L&#39;s in Aurora.

I had the lau lau plate and one spam musubi.  The lau lau was done right, the rice was nice and sticky, and the mac salad was true Hawaii plate lunch style.  The spam musubi was good, but it&#39;s spam musubi, you can&#39;t really screw that up.

The food here is great too and the portions are rather big.  Bigger than your average entree.  I actually shared two combos with two other people and we still had some leftovers!  

The BBQ beef mix was my absolute favorite because it reminded me of Korean BBQ.  The seafood combo consisted of fried shrimp and fish.  Still good but I&#39;m not  a big fan of fish other than salmon or sushi.  Otherwise everything was delicious!

It was nice to discover that they use a new applet called &#34;Nowait&#34; that shows you your place in the queue and texts you when your table is ready. This is very handy for restaurants that don&#39;t take reservations.

I had the Kitchen Sink with two eggs over easy, sausage, grits, and a pancake. The price of $10.50 was very reasonable for the amount of food. I was not thrilled with the sausage. It is a little hard to describe what bothered me, but some combination of consistency and flavor was just off. The grits were OK, but not the smooth consistency that I favor. The big issue was that everything was very, very bland. It seemed like the kitchen had used no seasoning at all.

My friend had the mushroom sweet potato hash and eggs with toast. Again, everything was prepared reasonably well, but the food was just very, very bland. She enjoyed her leftovers much more the next day after adding some seasoning.

We were pretty sure the spread we received for our toast/pancake was margarine and not butter. Maybe we&#39;re wrong, but whatever we received came to the table ice cold, hard as a rock, and refused to melt. I tore up my pancake trying to spread this stuff on it. I just hate it when restaurants do that.

This place is desperately needed in the Stapleton neighborhood and the crowds seem to reflect that. I just wish the execution on the food could equal the billing of health, scratch cooking, and all-natural ingredients. Outdoor seating would be a great addition to this place. I don&#39;t know if that is possible, given the location."

Sunny Saturday morning, windows wide open.  Packed, loud, hustling, fun.  I told the waitress I&#39;m only here for the day and wanted the one thing I had to have, and she didn&#39;t hesitate: brisket hash.

It&#39;s big, flavorful, the bbq sauce is smoky with a polite little kick.  The brisket itself was a bit dry, but at 11am I figured it was from yesterday.  I could do without all the shredded cheese on top, but it didn&#39;t hurt things at all.

Service was as you would expect on a full-on Saturday brunchtime, a bit harried but still attentive.

Nice day, nice spot, nice looking menu, I&#39;d eat here again."

What? You didn&#39;t about this feature? Well what are you doing? Download now. Pronto! Without this feature our wait would&#39;ve been about 45-1 HR. Simply put your name down. It will tell you what time you need to check in with the host. It will even tell you the wait time. Once you get to the location and after checking in with the host; you will receive a confirmation on your cell that you will be texted once a table of your choice comes up. For us? It barely took 10 minutes!

Bright, airy and busy! Breakfast here is amazing! I had the Shrimp Omelette with added sausage and pepper. Meaning you pay a little bit more to get that wiener on the plate to party wth the shrimp. The potatoes. Lord! I&#39;m adoring those potatoes and would return for just that! Awesome portion and fast service once things start rolling.  

Also in hindsight it would&#39;ve been best for me to order the Hash. This particular dish is something I&#39;d devour completely. Simply because their hash looks like pork bellys and so tender and tasty.

FF would&#39;ve garnered a five star review from me. The service tho. It was slow and she forgot to bring the Beignets. We surmised that our server is also the bartender. Two hats. Not easy. Especially when she had the bar area to content too.

Overall I highly recommend this for breakfast or brunch.  I tried their mimosa. Yup. Order this. It&#39;s stiff. Although our waitress didn&#39;t mention they had this special mimosa I would&#39;ve loved to try!  Check out the special of the day board. It should be written there. 

Tip: still sunny in Denver. So wanna enjoy eating outside at the bar? You can request your choice on the app Waitlist!"

Unfortunately, the service, although friendly and polite, was lacking in attentiveness.  I noticed that our waitress was also bar tending, inevitably leading to prolong wait for the basic service that takes place during a meal. Granted, the food was prompt and piping hot, rectifying the situation. Overall the staff was above par, notwithstanding the understaffed crew. Hopefully a one time deal, I&#39;m still coming back to try their grits.

The ambiance is bright and inviting, with chic mix of furniture and decor.  This place was slammed with a wait time of almost two hours at 10am on Sunday. Thankfully, a Waitlist feature on Yelp allows you to place your name in the waitlist from your couch. We arrived and waited 5 minutes for our table, as others received the sad news about the wait time.

The food was the star today, I had the Smoked Brisket Hash &amp; Eggs.  The hash was one of the best I&#39;ve had in Denver, the hickory smoked brisket was tender surrounded by awesomeness of house potatoes, grilled peppers, onions and chillies topped with to order over medium eggs. This dish made my day. Also enjoyed a Bloody Mary, it was on the sour side with a nice and balanced spice kick to it."

I wasn&#39;t aware of this place, but had seen it previously on my yelp app when searching the area for possibilities before so I had made it up in my mind to either hit Snooze, or here! We decided to come here and boy were we glad that we did. 

When we were in transit to this place I never remember seeing any signage or are anything from the street, I literally relied on my Google maps to direct in the correct direction, but once inside you see this bustling two story restaurant. When we walked in time door we literally were able to snag the last two seats at the end of the bar available, instead of having to wait for a table. I will say that the menu is very impressive. my girlfriend ordered the kitchen sink, bacon, eggs, house potatoes, toast. I orders the smoked brisket beef hash, with Ancho red Chile sauce. Both dishes were absolutely phenomenal. 

TIP: food came extremely quick...(within 10-15 mins of ordering). Saw the server approaching our seats, and actually thought to myself there is no way that is our food. I was wrong! Kitchen operates like a well oiled machine. I notice the dishwasher actually works behind the bar, probably because the kitchen is just all about the food. They handle their business, and do so very well. Good job!

The real MVP of this meal I must say are the home fries/breakfast potatoes that came with my girls kitchen sink. They are like Jojo potatoes but larger and very well seasoned.  My beef hash was different than I expected. The hash was chunks of potatoes and chunks of brisket. The Ancho red Chile puree is what made this dish so amazing, very flavorful.  Brisket was perfectly cooked, and tender.

My only takeaway from this place is how busy and crowded they get. At one point the bar tender/our waitress I felt was being a little pushy trying to collect our plates and close us out. So that they could turn our seats over. I&#39;m positive that we will be back again, im just hoping that next time I don&#39;t feel so rushed because they are trying to turn seats so quickly."

We decided to give the beignets a try. All that I can say is BEST BEIGNETS EVER! This is not an over exaggeration. They were served with house wild preserves and creme anglaise. They were the highlight of our dining experience. The bar was set high after enjoying that heavenly appetizer.

The meals were good but not excellent. Some of the spices that they use do not exactly agree with my palate. 

On our first visit my husband ordered the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits had excellent flavor and texture. The gravy and the sausage had a strong sage flavor. In my opinion, sage should be used sparingly since it has a dominant flavor. It was not used sparingly with this plate as it had a strong presence.

I ordered the scratch pancakes with bourbon pecan praline. It was pretty good although the bourbon flavor was pretty heavy. I wouldn&#39;t mind ordering the pancakes again but I wouldn&#39;t add the bourbon pecan praline. I would definitely ask to have the wild house preserves and creme anglaise that was served with the beignets added as a topping for my pancakes. I can only imagine how yummy that would taste. 

On our second visit we had the beignets. They were the reason why we came back! They did not disappoint. For our meal, we shared the smoked brisket hash and eggs. Everything was good but we didn&#39;t care for the red chili ranchero sauce. It would taste a lot better with a traditional barbecue or hot sauce.

Overall, the service and food were good. If we find ourselves in the area, we will definitely come back. I would probably opt to have a double order of the beignets as a meal for breakfast. They are phenomenal!"

I ended up with a medley of sides: 2 scrambled eggs, cornbread, house made sausage, and collard greens.

My favorite part of the meal were the collard greens -- they were just acidic enough and very tender. The sausage was pretty good too, with the predominant flavor of sage, though it looked like they were cooked with *extra* oil in the pan. The glistening on my plate was a little disconcerting. The eggs didn&#39;t really taste like eggs to me because they had a little too much something mixed into them -- cream perhaps? The cornbread was really dry and just crumbled with every bite. It took more saliva than necessary to get that down!

The ambiance and decor is really cute though -- very chic cafe.

I had a bite of my friend&#39;s Mushroom Sweet Potato Hash and Eggs, and it was spicy! Mushrooms were more sour than savory. Just a lot of choices I didn&#39;t quite understand."

For breakfast we started with the beignets - while good I think they are hyped a bit based on some of the other Yelp reviews; four were served and between three of us nobody was interested in eating the last one. They were served piping hot, with a side of preserves and creme anglaise - I think you REALLY need to like donuts to find these amazing.

For our entrees we ordered the smoked brisket hash &amp; eggs and the Southwest green chili smothered breakfast burrito. The eggs and hash were good, but the smothered burrito was exceptional; the perfect balance of spice and filling. The burrito was so good that those with the eggs and hash wished they would have ordered the same thing. Coffee was great and was constantly filled to ensure a fresh hot cup."

The food is exceptional and the drinks are great! I am from Southern Louisiana and have struggled to find decent (let alone &#39;delicious&#39;) grits. This place exceeded my expectations.

I went with the crab and fried green tomatoes eggs Benedict which was amazing but I had to take away one star because there was eggshells in my meal. Not enough to complain about but just enough to add some unnecessary crunch. I still ate it all.

We also ordered the shrimp omelette, also amazing. We both ordered a side of barbecue potatoes which was basically like potatoes O&#39;Brien minus the onions and peppers and sprinkled with hickory barbecue seasoning.

The service was OK but only because it seems like they were in the middle of their busiest time of the day. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for some southern style down-home cooking for your breakfast meal."

This place wasn&#39;t amazing for what they charge. I had the four friends grits with fried chicken and, like another review mentions, it seemed as if the chicken was pre-fried and just heated up beforehand.

One star was automatically taken off for not having an espresso bar... That was disappointing, I did have their drip coffee which was pretty good!

This place has a lot of potential considering their location and set up, just need to work on some things. I&#39;d give it a second try if they got an espresso bar:)"

The Beignets are also very good, enjoyed the sauces that are served with. One just has to go into it realizing you aren&#39;t in NOLA.

I was excited to have a brunch spot walking distance to my house, and while everyone I know really likes Four Friends my experiences there have been mixed.

I have tried the Huevos Rancheros, Crab and Fried Green Tomato Benedict, Four Friends Grits, Sweet Heart Healthy Grits, and the Shrimp and Grits.

Now everytime I have been there, it was busy, which is fine I can wait for breakfast at 9am on Saturday. What really rubbed me wrong about the most recent visit was the fried chicken in the Four Friends Grits.. It tasted like the chicken was fried in advance and just kept warm for the dish because it was luke warm and the breading wasnt crispy. I also tried a side of bacon and felt the same way. I am under the impression that they pre-cooked their meats and hold them on top of the oven to try to keep warm to just push them out when they are busy instead of cooking them to order."

In the summertime, there is roof top seating but since I came in January, I had to wait to be seated inside. The wait was over an hour but they were able to take down our phone number and text us when the table was ready and you can even download the app called no wait and check your place in line periodically. I wish I had known about the app before because it allows you to put yourself in line without physically being there....WHAT?! For popular restaurants that don&#39;t take reservation, this is a lifesaver. I will definitely try out the app in the future and see what other restaurants it includes. 

Anyways, I digress. They didn&#39;t have a coffee menu which was one of the few downsides but they had a very unique alcohol menu. After we were seated, we ordered drinks. The regular mimosa was about $4 which I thought was reasonable and it was very delicious and refreshing. My boyfriend ordered this pumpkin latte that has alcohol and espresso. It was topped with whip cream and definitely very eye-catching. 

Our table of 4 also ordered the beignets which were on point. There were four so it was perfect for sharing and it came with this berry sauce as well as condensed milk. You can definitely enjoy the beignets by themselves or dip it in the berry sauce if you want more sweetness to it. I thought both ways were delicious. For entrees I ordered the crab and green tomato benedicts. Let me just warn you, the portions here are HUGE. I only ate half of the plate and took the other half to go. The benedict was very interesting and not like anything I have tried before. It was topped with a heavy cream sauce and the crab cakes were absolutely delicious. I still wished there was an english muffin because instead of that, there were tomatoes. Overall it tasted good. I really liked the potatoes that came with the benedicts since they were cripsy and they gave a heaping portion. 

The service was great. The waitress was confident and remembered all our orders without writing them down. She was also really funny and attentive. The food is a bit on the pricier side as my boyfriend and my meal totaled to around $50 but I thought it was worth it and I would love to come back and try the other dishes!"

Made curious by the number of local breakfast joints described as &#34;Southern,&#34; wonder aroused as to whether Mile High natives really feel that French Toast, Omelets or even Tom&#39;s Urban, truly represents the culinary traditions south of the Mason-Dixon Line, Saturday breakfast saw me arrive at Four Friends Kitchen just moments after 7:30, the soon-packed house proving what families of the Eastern Suburbs are already well aware of - that Four Friends is serving Southern cooking not only more &#34;authentic,&#34; but also far better than most.

Helmed by Chef Larry Shore, a 6:30am opening perfect for early risers seven-days-a-week, the &#34;FFK&#34; menu presents a mix of classic breakfasts alongside modern interpretations, standbys including heirloom corn grits offered with several delicious mix-ins appropriately amongst Shore&#39;s most well regarded, though much ado has also been made about everything from Barbeque Tofu and Benedicts to Waffles with Fried Chicken and Root Beer basted Brisket.

Spacious despite a commercial complex exterior that at first looks particularly grey and drab, those smart enough to enter Four Friends Kitchen are immediately greeted by bright smiles and cozy decoration, late arrivers encouraged to pass the time with coffee at the bar while testing their skills with an Etch A Sketch from the wall.

Offering beer, wine and cocktails starting at eight o&#39;clock, the jarring sounds of impatient children above music perhaps not conducive to a long stay lingering over Mimosas, service fulfills expectations of Southern Charm despite the fact that my middle-aged waitress was ironically from Las Vegas, &#34;everything is great&#34; recommendations clarified when asking about favorites and frequent check-ins pleasant yet never disruptive.

Told of beignets that rival the most famous in New Orleans, a bold claim I personally found to be true as compared to Café du Monde with more levity and far less grease, intrigue is upped through the addition of rich Crème Anglaise and housemade fruit puree, even more sweetness offered by a single Buttermilk Pancake that is fluffy when taken on its lonesome, but far better bolstered by the $2 &#34;Bourbon Praline&#34; upgrade.

A bit spendy as relates to breakfast breads, neither the smallish biscuit nor toothsome cornbread near on par to that at The Universal where prices trend cheaper or the same, fans of a classic are instead encouraged to turn their attention to &#34;Overnight&#34; Grits that come across smooth with just the right amount of textural variance, the eponymous iteration taking a next-level step through the addition of four cheeses, tender collards and smoky red sauce beneath lightly breaded Chicken strips and two medium-poached eggs."

After politely speaking to someone else, my party of 2 were seated within 5 minutes.

The food is decent and I&#39;ll give them another try.  I found the grits to be too soupy.  Except for the fried chicken, seasoning is a requirement.  The drinks &amp; cocktails were very good.  I love the service from Brad, our waiter.

Use the NoWait app and get a head start on your spot in line.  We came early on a Friday morning at 8:00am and there was still a 20 minute wait.  Totally worth the wait.  

I ordered the Bluegrass Benedict which is:

&#34;Buttermilk biscuit, pecan smoked pork belly, poached eggs, collard greens, scallion hollandaise and house-pickled pepper relish 12&#34;

I was sold when I saw &#34;pork belly&#34;.  It was heaven in my mouth.  The egg was poached oh so perfectly.  I loved the way the yolk ran when I cut through the egg with my fork.  The hollandaise sauce was so smooth and creamy.  Loved it.

My husband ordered the Biscuits &amp; Gravy which is:

&#34;Scratch buttermilk biscuits, housemade sage sausage gravy, two eggs your way, and fresh fruit garnish 8.5&#34;

Can&#39;t go wrong with biscuits and gravy.  See picture.

It&#39;s not breakfast without pancakes so we ordered 
SCRATCH PANCAKES which is:

&#34;Made-from-scratch buttermilk or gluten- &amp; dairy-free pancakes with warm maple syrup 6.5&#34; 

Wow. These pancakes melt in your mouth.  It was so fluffy and had a delicate buttery flavor.  With or without maple syrup, these pancakes are worth a try.

There was a wait when we showed up of approximately 30-45. After 50 minutes had passed and we saw multiple groups who arrived after us get tables, we asked how much longer the wait was. The hostess took one look at the list and said oh we can seat you now. When we go to the table, a group of 3 which we saw park ten minutes earlier (so we knew they had gotten there after us) was already seated with drinks. Not a great way to impress to start.

After being seated, we were told that it would take a few minutes to get our drinks because there were a few tables waiting on drinks ahead of us. After we got our drinks (which did take a while like he said), we then ordered. From the time we sat down until we got our food was almost an hour. If we hadn&#39;t of already waited the first 50 minutes to get the table, I would have left after 30 minutes (and should have).

The waiter apologized for our food taking so long as &#34;the kitchen was backed up&#34; when it did finally arrive. Unfortunately, it was not worth the wait. Neither plate had any flavor. Mine was partially cold and a few things weren&#39;t cooked all the way. My husband&#39;s was at least cooked, but it tasted like it was thrown together. When the waiter came over he asked if I wanted to take my food home since over half of it was still on the plate. Of course I didn&#39;t - it was bad enough coming fresh out the kitchen, I couldn&#39;t imagine it heated back up (although at least then it would be warm hopefully). The eggs were watery, the sausage was cold, the shrimp was overcooked, and the biscuit tasted like it was a day old. Not a great meal to say the least.

Overall, super disappointed. If I am going to wait 50 minutes to be seated, I expect at least decent food and timing of the food. To see others get seated before us because they had 3 or 4 in the party rather than just 2 and then to get food that was cold is unacceptable. I will not be back considering how many good places there are in Denver."
four-friends-kitchen-denver,Kimberly S.,QCpSrT3fEDq2uJYy78Ujig,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,297,58,DDBQnT-Zf3IWLMfqakSh0Q,2.0,2016-02-27,"Wow! We have had Four Friends Kitchen &#34;bookmarked&#34; for quite a while, wanting to try it.
We were in the area this morning, and decided to go. Here is what I experienced.

When we walked in, I instantly liked the place. I like the light, lots of windows, two garage doors that can be opened up by the bar area, when the weather is nice outside. You can eat outside at the bar, with about 4 seats. I&#39;m not sure if there is an outdoor patio area.

Inside, there is a high ceiling, with visible duct work. One of the walls is covered in wood, which gives it that &#34;rustic&#34; feeling. There are some indoor planters on another wall, herbs?, not sure. The tables are solid wood (or so they seem to be), with white comfortable chairs. I thought the chair were those plastic ones, until I sat down, comfy, with a soft seat.

There are approximately 15 tables inside, which are tightly packed together. The noise volume is loud, so expect and know that when you walk in. The restaurant has a kid favorite, Etch-a-Sketch, by the front door - great idea! The neighborhood is definitely &#34;family oriented,&#34;  so kudos to the owners for having them.

The restaurant is open for breakfast and lunch. There is plenty of parking, so don&#39;t worry about that. 

I had &#34;The Kitchen Sink,&#34; your basic bacon, eggs, toast.  I ordered my usual over easy eggs, bacon, and toast (gluten free). I didn&#39;t want the bbq potatoes, so I ordered the grits. My husband had the same thing, except he had the housemade sausage, and the cheesy grits.

I was ready, really looking forward to breakfast.  We didn&#39;t have to wait long, and breakfast was served.

I cut into my eggs with my fork, and they were runny, which is what they are suppose to be. But, the part that wasn&#39;t acceptable, was there was water too, that ran out of, or around the eggs. Maybe the restaurant used water to help cook the eggs, fine, I do that at home, but there should be little to no water when the eggs are put on the plate. My eggs were soggy.

I mentioned the plate, specifically I want to talk about my actual plate.  When the cook/chef puts the food on the plate, shouldn&#39;t that person look at the plate, to make sure there are no chips or cracks in or on it? At least, I would hope so. There was a crack that ran through the center of my plate, which looked like a star fish, 5 cracks coming out from the center. Disappointing!

The food:  My eggs were runny, rather, soggy. The bacon was ok. The grits were ok, nothing fancy. I tried my husbands cheesy grits, and they had very little cheese in them, not much difference in taste between the regular grits and the cheesy grits. The sausage was good. The pancake was the best thing about our meals.

The price of our breakfast was fair, actually decent for restaurants today.

Will we go back, not sure, to be honest.  Four Friends Restaurant was a let down. Sorry."

They are really good now. And, you get a healthy portion. The kids like their other breakfast offerings as well. (We have never been for lunch.)

One complaint is that they (admittedly) do not serve or even offer real maple syrup. It tastes Mrs. Butterworths! Blech!  And, they use Sysco&#39;s industrial Smuckers&#39; jam. Unlike Snooze or Lucile&#39;s, which serve homemade or organic jam and jellies, and offer 100% real maple syrup.

Consequently, to the great embarrassment of our kids, I bring our own maple syrup and jams. Ah well, what are parents for but to embarrass their children...:)"

Doesn&#39;t seem like it was open today, that or the waitress didn&#39;t offer to seat us there. I still want to try brunch there sometime. 

On this trip my husband and I tried breakfast cocktails and entrees. I liked the mimosa, but the bloody mary was pretty watered down which is disappointing.

The breakfast burrito was delicious  and french toast was even better! Almost anything with creme anglaise is a win in my book. The omelettes look really good too, I &#39;ll definitely go back and give those a try."

For drinks, we had a Bloody Mary and a mimosa.  The mimosa was good, but the Bloody Mary was just watery tomato juice; don&#39;t bother.  The food was better news.  I especially liked the breakfast burrito although after an extra $3 to get it smothered it was considerably more expensive than anything else on the menu.  My wife&#39;s french toast was good, but not spectacular.

I&#39;d recommend this place as a quick stop to get a decent meal, except after spending $50 it wasn&#39;t the kind of meal I&#39;d usually be happy to spend $50 on.  If you&#39;re looking for the whole experience of a nice, relaxing brunch you can do better than this."

There was a 20 minute wait and it was well worth it. This place is quite popular so YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO WAIT period. Another option would be to use the NoWait app on your way there so that you can &#39;get in line&#39; to cut down your wait time.

We started of with the Beignets. OMG!!! I&#39;ll just have to say that you absolutely have to order these. I can&#39;t even explain in words how good they are. Afterwords, we had the Crispy Huevos Rancheros, Crab and Fried Green Tomato Benedict and Shrimp and Grits. Everything was excellent and seasoned to perfection. We sat on the roof top which made breakfast for us even more enjoyable. The Spicy Margarita is YUMMIES! I didn&#39;t try any of their other specialty cocktails but I definitely will when we visit again in about 2 weeks or so."

Since i was going solo they sat me upstairs right away, which was extra awesome because it was REALLY busy. I got the breakfast sandwich and its all about details. Homemade potato bread, an egg that wasn&#39;t cooked too hard and the &#34;BBQ&#34; fried potatoes were to friggin die for. Thanks staff and Chef for a job well done."

Four Friends Kitchen is a Southern-style eatery. Inside, the atmosphere is crowded and bustling. There was a mix of families, young groups of friends, and older couples. They do not take reservations, but they let you use the &#34;nowait&#34; app to check in and monitor your place in line. This was really helpful as we had some friends with us from out of town and we could walk around outside until it was almost time for our table.

The food is rich and heavy-- you need a nap in the sun after eating here. The classic Beignets with creme anglaise were superb; you&#39;ll feel like you are in NOLA almost. The Down South Trio was really good, though I probably would have preferred just a big bowl of the creamy green chlii mac and cheese. The only sour note was the Bloody Mary; it did not have a very complex flavor and I was dying for horseradish. 

note: I hear they have a great roof deck."

And the food is pretty creative and overall good. However, something really bad happened to my food here! I&#39;m a vegetarian and I don&#39;t eat eggs, so going out to brunch can be difficult for me. I was thrilled to see that they had a vegan dish where they make grits with coconut milk and top it with fried tofu, sautéed kale, butternut squash, and a couple other things. It sounded delicious and was marked as vegan. 

My food came out and looked great. I took a bite of the grits and they were really good. Then I noticed a pinkish piece of something that looked suspiciously like pork. I made my meat-eating husband try it and he confirmed it was bacon. I thought maybe it was just one stray piece that had fallen in, but then I found another piece. This in a dish that is supposed to be vegan! I told the waitress and she was really nice about it. She took the dish back to the kitchen and they made me a new one without bacon. But there was never an explanation for how or why this happened. Also, by the time my new dish was brought out, everyone else in my party was close to being done eating. 

I have been a vegetarian for over 15 years. This is a pretty big deal for me. The thing that bothers me is that they didn&#39;t even bother to then comp that dish. Or even discount it. They probably would have if I had been a jerk about what happened, but since I wasn&#39;t, they didn&#39;t. That kind of felt like a slap in the face. 

So, vegetarians beware!"

I&#39;m really glad I chose this breakfast place as I drove through town. Though I chose the easy pancakes and bacon combo, they were both very tasty. Coffee was very tasty as well. 

They were very busy so I sat at the bar. The service was a little slow due to the volume of people but it was to be expected. I thought for the amount of running the pretty lady behind the bar was having to do, she did great!

I will have to stop in again on my next trip. I&#39;ll definitely choose a more complex breakfast... Unless I&#39;m craving pancakes again :)"

Now that I am aware of this adorable eatery with fast and friendly service and savory dishes like shrimp and grits or fried chicken and grits - I&#39;ll be returning for sure. 

The seating is really crammed in there, giving it almost a New York diner feel without the fast-talking, fast-moving feel. It provides a great environment for kiddos to enjoy breakfast while still being adult friendly enough for two friends to catch up over French toast and coffee. 

I enjoyed the fried chicken and grits (the Four Friends grits) immensely and even would have enjoyed a little more spice to them. All in all, Four Friends is my friend and I like friends that serve me a good breakfast."

This place popped up on Yelp with good reviews.  The reviews were not wrong. We absolutely loved it!

We had to wait about 5 minutes so we drew with the etch a sketch for a few minutes.  They have an entire wall of them ready for people to play.

Our server was wonderful and made some great recommendations.  The menu is southern with much of the offerings leaning towards New Orleans.  I had the Creole Shrimp Omelet with andouille sausage.  It has a wonderful cream cheese sauce.  The flavors were great and the only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the shrimp was over cooked.  My husband had the Smoked Brisket Hash and Eggs and it was outstanding, very tender with that nice smoke appeal.

This place definitely has the southern hospitality down.  Service was phenomenal here.  Four stars for the food and an additional star for the service.  I felt bad because every time I took a sip of my peach ice tea, the server came to fill it.  She was on point and super friendly.  That can actually be said about the entire staff.  

As for the food, I was a little bummed that they didn&#39;t serve breakfast all day (they are opened from 6:30 to 2:30) like must breakfast/brunch eateries.  However, the brunch menu was good nonetheless.  My boyfriend and I ordered the cheese &amp; chorizo beignets, peanut crusted southern fried chicken waffle sandwich, and a side order of cornbread.  They brought the beignets first.  I only had dessert beignets so the savory ones were not what I am accustomed to.  It&#39;s not necessary bad, but I much rather prefer the ones powdered with sugar.  The chicken and waffle, however, was amazing!!  Beautifully presented and the chicken had a great kick of flavor.  The cornbread was also very delicious; it had the right amount of sweetness and was not overly dry.

If I was describe the decor, it is very minimalistic, but chic.  It also has a very modern feel as well.  Four Friends Kitchen attracts many crowds.  It is definitely a nice place and I can&#39;t wait to try their breakfast!!!"

They have a Bluegrass Benedict that was enough to share with someone. Be prepared, it&#39;s heavy but a well made dish. Pork Belly and Collard Greens? Yes please. Oh and the music...They played some of my favorite 80s songs including a handful from the Dirty Dancing Soundtrack. Four Friends, I will be your Fifth."

First, the food here is uniquely Southern and not something you will find at your average, or even above-average, Denver restaurant.  The ambience is industrial sheik.  It is moderately loud which is great for kids as well.

But, the food...excellent.  My wife ordered the trio of green chili/back mac and cheese, collared greens, and fried chicken.  Everything complimented everything else.  I ordered the Bluegrass Benedict, which is essentially eggs benedict with collared greens and some spice.  We finished with the Beignets.  ORDER THEM."

So, the wife and I were in Denver for a visit and on our last day found this restaurant on Yelp. It was on the way to the airport and had good reviews. Only problem was time. Last thing I wanted to do was be late to the airport and miss our flight. We considered grabbing a bagel or swinging through McDonald&#39;s, but I decided against it. I hate, HATE flying and if I was going to get on a plane and possibly perish (irrational, I know), I wanted a good last meal. So, we beelined it for Four Friends and scored a place at the counter - no need to wait the 20-30 minutes they said it would take for a table. 

After two delicious mimosas, a big plate of savory smoked brisket hash and eggs, and two beignets topped with cream and tart berries for balance, we were off to the airport full and happy. Not only did we make the flight with a little time to spare, but I also lived long enough to write this glowing review. We will be back, Four Friends!

When I arrived I there was a wait, but as I was alone I was seated immediately at the bar. I ordered coffee, which was very bitter not sure if it was old or just not my preferred roast. I also ordered Shrimp and Grits which turned out to be delicious!!! I cannot rave enough about the food! I looked around and everything looked great! I did have plenty of time to see several dishes because it took just short of 30 minutes before I finally got my order. My coffee was never refilled despite the server telling me twice she was brewing some fresh. One cup of that coffee was enough for me anyway. After I was finished eating (luckily it was after or I might not have finished eating) the server jumped up and STOOD on the counter on which food was being served and napkins/silverware were being rolled, in order to reach some dishes in a top cupboard. Not really sure if this is a sanctioned common practice here or just a short cut by a poorly trained employee. In conclusion I&#39;m not sure I will be back but I sure did LOVE the Shrimp and Grits!"

The batter is very thin but really crispy/toasty not burnt. The pickle relish on the side is NOT just garnish!! Eat it and eat it all soooo good. The homemade Bloody Mary is a perfect concoction of spicy tomato!! Has to be one of the best I have had in Colorado!! So much flavor and house made!!

So working on the southern trio and unique pain it breaded chicken and a chipotle syrup. A unique crunch that kept the chicken moist and with the sauce you get a wonderful sweet and savory that is a southern fusion NOT hint at Asian. The collard greens are a bit salty but in my experience that is a chef preference but the flavor is good and pairs well with the chicken. The Mac and cheese is great and has almost a spicy flavor to it with the bell peppers. It&#39;s very creamy and just the right size!!

The food has good concepts but isnt  prepared with super quality ingredients or in a way that makes it unique to eating out. I like the app to wait in line but thats about it."

I&#39;ll go back. the food is good. I live in stapleton so it&#39;s close. but unfortunately, you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re experiencing an event when you&#39;re sitting there. Just good food."

Coffee was a few levels above par for being drip coffee and having a &#34;litre&#34; of water on the table helped wash down and clean the palate.

It is located within the 29th Street Mall - parking is in abundance and you can do some errand running afterwards! 

Inside, the space is made of a mixture of lightly colored furniture, retro accents, and plenty of reclaimed wood. Unfortunately, seating is a little tight and cramped which means you&#39;ll probably be overheard and overhearing other&#39;s conversations. Our server was very nice and attentive. Though we came initially for breakfast, we quickly found out that they actually do not serve breakfast past 11 am, so we settled for the lunch menu. The menu is full of hearty, rich, and decadent southern inspired dishes that are just a tad bit overpriced. The food was delicious and I was able to take some home and indulge later! Overall, come early if you want breakfast, expect a wait, and enjoy some hearty food!"

Our server was quick, cool, and funny. She redeemed the host staff.

The host staff quoted us 20-25 min. I had a flight to catch, but that seemed like it would fit my time frame perfectly. Almost 50 minutes later (!!!) they tried to seat my boyfriend and his son and I all at a two top with no room. I said no way, not after such a long wait. Other people were coming up and complaining about tables, waits, etc.They sat us at a six-top table. Obviously having no idea what they are doing at the front-of-house, we almost left, enraged. 

However, the food is the only reason I did not give one star. 

Get it together up front, Four Friends. Your hosts might be your demise, which would be very unfortunate for Stapleton and your restaurant."

First time we checked in and told them we did not have a phone for a page when a table was ready.  They said they would get us and the wait would be 30 minutes.  45 minutes later we asked the status and they responded, rudely, that they had paged us 20 minutes ago.  Than I ordered the burrito and was VERY clear no chorizo.  They put the plate down and I asked, this one does not have chorizo, right?  The waiter said yes it does NOT have chorizo.  I bit into and there was chorizo.  UGH, 30 years as a vegetarian and eating chorizo is not pleasant.

The manger came over and apologized and they brought out another one.  It was good and we thought we would go back two months later.  This time we brought our phone and kept looking at where we were in line.  We went from 13 people in front of us to being paged.  Made no sense but we rushed over there.  Ordered the burrito again.  Now, the burrito has six items in it without the chorizo and then I paid 2.5 for green chili.  Seriously, I was speechless when my burrito came out with three items.  They forgot the beans, the sour cream, the ranchero sauce and cheese.  Honestly, how does a kitchen forget half of the ingredients in a dish?????  It was potato, egg, and the 2.50 I paid for a &#34;smothered&#34; but in honesty barely covered burrito in green chili sauce.   We went through the apology thing again and received another one with the correct ingredients (just one because my husband was so hungry and annoyed that he just ate his wanting to leave.)

So I would say this place has potential, but they just don&#39;t get how to be a great restaurant.  They need training and organization.  They need systems and they need to learn how to run a restaurant.  Comps and apologies only go so far when consistent quality should be the expectation."

Here is a neighborhood eatery for everyone from anywhere. The food is good but not great tasting and the atmosphere is modern but not too over the top. There is also rooftop tables for thoes of you that like to eat outdoors. Joint is also kid friendly and has some friendly staff and not so friendly staff. 

My only major grip would be the food portions for the prices. Example: Chicken and waffels are my favorite here but you get two small strips of chicken, a small waffel, and a ton of fried bbq chips at a arm and a leg price. Why so many chips??? I want more of the main dish!  

Overall i give it 3 stars and will be on the fence about this place."

However, the food was too much. There were few simple choices on the menu and everything was doctored to make it &#34;unique.&#34; I got the breakfast burrito and a side of grits. The potatoes in the burrito were overpowering and the grits were too cheesy (in fairness, I ordered them cheese-less but somehow received the cheesy version anyway). Not terrible, but it won&#39;t be on my list to visit again."

I personally thought the menu was reasonably priced but then again when you&#39;re used to paying for prices on the Vegas strip (where I&#39;m from) $14 for an entree is great! The ambiance is very ethereal. It makes you feel like you transported into a little woodland forest. It has a quiet yet mature atmosphere so please leave the babies and rowdiness at home. 

Looking at the drink prices we decided to split a six person punch three ways, that way we both got two drinks but only paid about $6. I cannot stress enough SPLIT THE PUNCH! We got Othos Brunchapuncha which consisted of vodka, house-made ginger liqueur, cucumber, cantaloupe, mint, fresh lemon, and prosecco. Served with lemon slice and a cantaloupe melon ball as garnish. It was a very light yet flavorful cocktail and they serviced it in a french press, which I thought was a very fresh idea. I could have drank like ten of these.

To start we all split the ricotta toasties; heirloom tomatoes, micro green sprouts, grilled fresh pear served on toasted sourdough which rested upon a bed of arugula. It was quite the spectacle when it came out as I was expected just some cheese on toast, whereas what we received was a mound of sprouty goodness. We ate every last sprout off the plate, it was that good. There was a saltiness in whatever dressing they served on top that balanced perfectly with the sweetness of the pear while the creaminess of the ricotta gave quite an incredible texture.

I&#39;m always a fan of splitting entrees, so my maid of honor and I split the Cotechino Hash; ouse-made cotechino sausage, with a white bean, roasted zucchini, parsley and sage ragout under two sunny eggs with a fluffy, buttery biscuit on top. I absolutely loved this dish, the roasted veggies and white beans were so comforting. When we broke the yolk it mixed in perfectly to make almost a soup, which we dipped the biscuit in. Total comfort food, I highly recommend it if you&#39;re feeling a bit hungover.

I also split the Hamachi Crudo with another friend which was fresh hamachi, grapefruit, blanched green beans, pureed meyer lemon, roasted almonds, and beet boiled hard egg. The presentation was absolutely stunning! It was a beautiful plate (see photo) and the hamachi was very fresh. 

Overall, when we split the bill 3 ways it ended up being under $30 which is less than I spend almost anywhere else I go out to brunch. Beatrice &amp; Woodsley provided a very relaxing and trendy environment where I got to catch up with my friends and enjoy incredible food. If you&#39;re looking for a brunch spot in Denver I&#39;d highly recommend this place."

 I was here for a birthday party, about 6 girls in our group total. I had heard about the restaurant before, never been. One girl ordered a cheese plate, it was ridiculous! I have seen bigger cheese samples given away at Costco on the weekends! I ordered a soup, I went to put my spoon in and hit the bottom of the bowl, nice optical illusion. They put enough soup in to cover the bottom of the bowl and that was it! Of course these mini portions were not reasonably priced. I understand small portions, but this place has a whole new &#34;small portion concept&#34;, I left starving. I heard there was a change in management since, I don&#39;t think that will even get me back in there, if I am going to drop that much on a dinner I am going somewhere else!

I will give them 5 stars on décor, the inside is really cool... but still not worth the small portions and large prices."

The place itself is so cool and unique, I highly recommend everyone checking it out at least once even if it&#39;s just for a drink. Also, the bathroom are very &#34;different&#34; so be sure to check those out when you come.

The food was pretty fancy and for the most part really good.

The Appetizer we got was REALLY good, we got the:
Ricotta Toasties - With heirloom tomatoes, grilled fresh peaches; toasted sourdough

My wife and I decided to get two dished and split them as our main courses:
Ricotta Gnocchi - Fresh ricotta, lemon, and thyme gnocchi; with blanched fava beans, treviso, and roasted chanterelle mushrooms 
Australian Seabass - Pan-roasted Barramundi on beet carpaccio, dried kalamata olives, pea shoots; finished with roasted pistachios, peach puree

The Seabass was a Total Hit! and the Gnocchi was a Total Miss :(

I&#39;m glad we shared because I would have been extremely disappointed had I only gotten the gnocchi because honestly it was not very good. On the other hand I would have given this place 5 stars hands down if I only got the Seabass.

Overall this place is great though, and I think it&#39;s the perfect &#34;Date Night&#34; spot if you&#39;re looking for a fancier night out on the town"

Any place that has real trees just by your table is incredible, right? Even the bathroom has interesting elements. 
I ordered a couple of very good and original cocktails but what stayed in the part of my memory called ¨Delicious Flavors¨ (I am pretty sure that part of the brain exists) is the Braised Lamb Rotolo. 
The waitress couldn&#39;t be better was charming, fast and attentive. The downside is that you won&#39;t get to meet her, she is leaving Denver."

Let&#39;s imagine the designers from Anthropology were told to design a tree house where people could get amazing food and drinks. Ding ding ding we have a winner!  Although Beatrice and Woodsley lacks signage outside their venue, the moment you walk in you feel like you&#39;ve entered into another world. From the white aspen trees, to the pillow/daybed feeling nooks you can eat at, to the AMAZINGLY cool bathroom area everything about the design and feel of the place is a perfect 10!

(Dinner Review)
Service:
A lot of the reviews I&#39;ve seen have been about their awesome brunch, however this will be about their spectacular dinner. First off our waitress was AMAZING and made us feel like we were the only people she cared about. I wish I remembered her name but HUGE props to her. Awesome job!

Food:
While absolutely everything we had their was amazing, there were 2 stars of the night food wise that have to be mentioned. 
1. The Crawfish Beignets. So delicious, these little hushpuppy style biscuits are so incredible and set the tone for the amazing food that is still yet to come. A must have appetizer. 
2. The Tophat Lobster. FOR REAL THOUGH. This. Stuff. Is. Bomb. It&#39;s served as a small plate that&#39;s just big enough to share, however I highly recommend getting your own. Although it is on the richer side, my wife and I contemplated ordering 50 of these and being satisfied with the fact that we&#39;ve tasted the most delicious food item on the planet. Do not go here without trying this item out!

Drinks:
While they rotate their drink menu regularly (which I love by the way), our waitress recommended a drink they wasn&#39;t on their and it was INCREDIBLE! For the life of me I can&#39;t remember the name, but it was a muddled Strawberry Rhubarb cocktail that was to die for. Go there and ask the bartender to whip it up for you and then thank me later!

Sorry, I know this is a long review, but I tend to gush over places that deserve it. Although it is a little pricey, if you have yet to try out Beatrice &amp; Woodsley you&#39;re really missing out here. One of Denver&#39;s finest restaurants!"

Sheer perfection in my book, from its gorgeously zany decor with a romantically sensual vibe, its impeccable service from start to finish, and the food itself, which was just ORGASMIC...like melt in your mouth and moan in sheer ecstasy over how insanely good every last flavorful bite and texture truly is of this ultra fresh fare. 

Did I mention the drink menu yet? Because it was picked with the ultimate attention to detail in proper food pairings and selection for all types of preferences. My dry local cider on draft was exquisite and paired beautifully with all my food selections, which included those addictive crawfish beignets, the gorgeous beet/avocado salad, and the eggplant and veggie entree. Topped off with that banana cream/graham cracker dessert, I was just in Heaven from start to finish. 
What a divine dining experience though; I&#39;m still reeling and salivating in giddy delight---and when even your restrooms are cool enough for me to Snapchat, I&#39;m officially a fan.

It was in the right place and the descriptions fit the bill, but I wasn&#39;t entirely prepared for what we experienced.

The interior is *amazingly* well thought-out.  All the reclaimed locally-sourced hardwoods and fabrics draped between booths create a cozy and earthy atmosphere, and the faux kerosene lanterns suspended over the rock walls evoke images of late 20th-century Colorado mining communities.

The food is the eclectic tapas-style micro-feasts that South Broadway is fast becoming famous for, but I think only Syntax outdoes B&amp;W.  The menu options are varied, the portion sizes are a bit more generous, and the flavors all work wonderfully.

The service here is attentive without being obnoxious and very friendly.  It was relaxing to note that, even in an uncharacteristically non-divey SoBo restaurant such as this, you still get tattoos and casual familiarity from the wait staff.

Now the bathroom.  Okay the decor was goofy and fun and it was spotless.  But the washing stations were outside the bathrooms haha.  And they were this freaking contraption that you had to screw with for ten minutes to figure out how to get water out of it.  And of course the stations being external to the bathroom itself everyone would know if you hadn&#39;t washed your hands ....  It was annoying at first but powerfully funny afterwards.

I will definitely be coming back here for date night cocktails in the future, it&#39;s too good to pass up, but we&#39;ll be laughing at all the newbs exiting the restroom and stopping with puzzled looks on their faces :-)"

The booths take up a lot of space so seating is limited, I recommend making a reservation if you don&#39;t want to sit at the bar. 

Came in for brunch, service was quick and really personable. I really enjoyed sitting at the bar because of the bartender. My friend and I ordered the hoo hee hot brown and pain Morocco. I loved the hoo hee hot brown, the cheesy crawfish stuff they pour over the whole thing is delicious!! The Pain Morocco was good too with unique flavors and toppings.

Aside from the annoying coffee-table level dining experience (it looks cool, and might work for drinks, but is silly for dining) everything was top-notch.  I must admit that I went a bit nuts and over-ordered.  The MONKEY BRAINS here are Monkey Bread, and not the sushi-esque appetizer one might find elsewhere.  These were very tasty.  I also had the GRANDMA&#39;S BISCUITS (with buttermilk and fruit butter).  These were a good example of traditional biscuits and everyone enjoyed them.  For my main dish, I went with EGGS JOHNNY FEVER (Pan fried goetta on toasted onion bread with sunny eggs, mustard hollandaise, peas, and roasted cauliflower).  It was very interesting and flavorful dish.   The PIMENTO CHEESE GRITS with tomato bacon salad was wonderful.  This was a great pairing of elements in one comforting dish.  

For my drink, I went with TEA THYME (Earl Grey Infused Gin, Lemon Juice, Thyme Essence).   The flavors were great, but I wish it had been a bit more generous. The service here was excellent."

First i&#39;d like to say that the owner actually took the time to reach out and find out what happened specifically with my previous dinning experience. It&#39;s rare that you find an owner so invested in the business and goes as far as to follow up from the conversation. Kudos John!

We had the Pate and cheese board as appetizers,both really good. Specifically the Pate I was almost licking the serving dish.

We split the sea bass that had a beet side dish,fish had a crispy with a salty skin!

Drinks.. drinks are PHENOMENAL! Strong without being overwhelming, very unique. I had the garden of jewels, very light and had a very smooth finish. The other cocktail (blanking on the name) had a red Bell pepper garnish, it was SO FRESH and unique.

The second you step inside, you are in a charming woodland forest. The booths are small and intimate, surrounded by aspens and hanging lamps- making you feel like you&#39;re right in the middle of a fairytale. Some booths are more enclosed with white linens draped on both sides and look disgustingly romantic. No matter where your seat is in this place- you&#39;ve got a good one! 

The menu changes seasonally, which I love, and I&#39;ve never had a dish here I didn&#39;t obsess over. We&#39;ve always been greeted with glasses of delightfully flavored water. The menu is written delicately and beautifully to match the ambiance of the restaurant. One of my all-time favorites dishes here is the (garden prep) biscuits and gravy- holy wow! The cocktails are incredible and the mimosas are wonderful at brunch! Also, not important but I am huge on attention to detail and the stemware here could not be more perfect. From the decor to the font on the menu to the cocktail glasses, everything flows together to create the most magical atmosphere for you! 

One last thing- I always judge a location by its bathroom and let me tell you- this place will NOT disappoint, but I will leave the details out and let you find out for yourself. 

To sum up- I don&#39;t think I could find one ugly thing here if I tried."

Fun things:
1. Interior architecture is captivating.
2. Apparently their wine cellar is bomb diggity (we didn&#39;t get to take a look since there was a private party going on the night we dined there).
3. Restroom area is quite interesting! 
4. Waiters are extremely friendly and funny!

Recommendations:
1. Order the Crawfish Beignets! Melts in yo mouth!
2. Artisan Cheese Board goes great with any red wine.
3. Shrimps and Mussels entree is very healthy and that celery broth they cook it in...Oooooo Weeee!!

My unicorn actually ordered the Roast Leg of Lamb Sandwich and wasn&#39;t a fan of it. The lamb was a bit dry and the vegetable chips were pretty soggy.

Besides that one little hiccup, this place is pretty legit for a romantical date night!"

I am sure some of you may be saying, &#34;what did you expect from a small bites establishment?&#34;, to which I would reply &#34;Silly me, I expected more.&#34;

Beatrice and Woodsley is beautifully decorated. Between the lounge-style wooden tables and the chainsaws craftily lodged in the walls of the bar, you&#39;ll likely be lost in the visual appeal. 

As for the food, this place scores highly on quality of ingredients and flavors, but small bites really means small bites. For the group of us, we attempted to order a wide selection from the menu; however, after 6 or 7 dishes, the consensus was that we were still hungry. 

The bottom line: If you are looking for a place with a great drink and just a few bites before you start your night or date, B&amp;W is sure to be your place. But if you&#39;re looking for an establishment as a destination, you might want to consider otherwise."

I&#39;ll keep this simple. The atmosphere is unparalleled. It&#39;s warm and woodsy and filled with a low light. Booths are separated by pale diaphanous cloths, which no doubt make you feel a gossamer lightness yourself as you begin with the wine. 

From the beginning, the service was excellent. Those who worked our table were personable and good humored. We ordered the goat burger, which was unctuous and flavorful, perhaps the tastiest burger I&#39;ve ever enjoyed. The tender trout was served with potato latke, arugula, lemon, and fried capers and was perfectly complemented by a Blanc Malbec (wonder of wonders).  Duck breast with spaetzle and mustard tarragon jus was delicious.  Everything was so good, we ordered more champagne. We celebrated as we ate, dazzled by the experience.

Budget for Beatrice &amp; Woodsley.  It&#39;s a very special place.

N.B. The bathroom feels like a spa. I don&#39;t want to tell its secrets, but make a trip."

Yes. It does look like it&#39;s out of a story book and I would even go as far to say just by being there I felt enchanted, like I was freaking Alice in Wonderland. I just expected so much more from this place, and unfortunately left feeling disappointed.  

Let&#39;s start with the good. The service was attentive, polite and everything you want with good service. The cocktails are creative and fun to sip on being surrounded by tall trees in the yellow tinged lighting. The place itself is beautiful and at the same time just a bit quirky.

Now, on to the not so good. The food is lacking, big time. Not only is it lacking in flavor, but the price? Wow, way too high for the portions they dish.  Three of us tried a wide variety of the small plates, and with each one, we found ourselves asking,  &#34;is that it?&#34; The cheese board consisted of three tiny chunks of cheese - two of them were strong and soft cheeses so the chunks did suffice, but one was a hard and more mild cheese, so it was hard to gauge with such tiny slices.  The craw fish beignets were similar to conch fritters, and not something I would order again. The Most Pretty Salad, while it had very delicious elements and eh hem &#34;pretty&#34;, was not a full salad. It was just a plate of tasty beets and endives. I love these things, but why even call this a salad? The broccoli and cauliflower small plate was just alright.  Unique in flavor but not worth the price. Again, when they say small, they really mean it- I think there were four pieces in total. All of the mains were $20+ on price. We tried the mussels and shrimps and it was forgettable, and not very big. At other restaurants, this would be an appetizer! It was supposed to be served &#34;over fennel&#34; and I think I counted 20 grains at most lingering at the bottom of the plate. 

Now, I want to reiterate that the food wasn&#39;t bad. It was just okay. And just okay, well, is... okay. But when you get the check and are reminded of how much everything costs,  and THEN you see that you were charged for the &#34;whole glass of wine&#34; price (side note: any restaurant that does this is tacky - no one wants a half glass of wine, and if they do, I doubt they want to pay between $6-10 for the HALF and double for a normal freaking pour - this is outrageous and shouldn&#39;t be a thing) you realize that your visit to B&amp;W was a sharp decline from a 4-5 star experience, to a 2. In short, I was not impressed."

It is smack dab in the middle of all my regular stops on S. Broadway in Denver and I never noticed it. It hides in plain sight! 

First, must comment on the decor - fun &amp; outrageous. I loved it.

We did the happy hour from 5-6:30 so we could enjoy more small bites and experience more flavors. We loved it. My favorite was the hamachi. 

The cocktails are inventive and really unique - I love the non-sweet, but really interesting flavors. 

We will be back!"

It&#39;s like a chic, grown-up treehouse. I&#39;d definitely hang here more often if I was made of money. That&#39;s the only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating. Otherwise, the food was delicious, the service was outstanding, and again, the ambiance was just magical. The specialty drinks are really inventive - my Tea Tyme was delicious, light, and unique. Although, having several of these drinks could push your bill up quite a bit. Come prepared to pay. We had brunch, and the prices for the food were very fair - the pimento cheese grits were a table favorite. The biscuits and gravy was interesting....but not bad. The monkey brains (luscious cinnamon pull-apart bread) was moan-worthy. Additionally, you have to visit the restroom before you leave - it&#39;s kind of like a themepark attraction, along with the handwashing station."

We ordered small plates that were around $14 each, and all the offerings were flavorful, but 4 slices of squash when there were room on the plate for several more seemed a little too minimalist for me. The excellent creme brulee made up for the small bites."

The unique decor - trees going up to the ceiling - is very whimsical, yet it&#39;s still pretty classy. Would be a great date spot.

My group of 4 shared a bunch of plates and while everything was delicious, we didn&#39;t walk away full. I definitely recommend getting an entree per person, which is a shame because the appetizers all look so exciting and it would be awesome to be able to build a meal off of mainly starters. Another method would be to come for drinks and apps before heading elsewhere.

The crawfish beignets were amazing - a must order for the table. I liked the rillette and priests ears (pasta) as well, although the priests ears were a stretch to share across 4 people. The chicken was very good, but not the best I&#39;ve ever had, and a really small portion. Loved the vegetable pave - definitely recommend as a good dish to share. 

The cocktails were all excellent! Can&#39;t remember what mine was called but it had Greek yogurt in it. Service was very good."

I would suggest more energy be put into the food and service delivery and less into the fancy pull chain sinks and creative toilet paper displays.

We stopped in for happy hour and sampled a variety of small plates. None of the plates stood out as anything even approaching average, with small portions, hot plates that came out as cold and everything overpriced and undervalued.

The signature cocktails were OK but nothing unique or exceptional. The bartender, while trying to be friendly, repeatedly inserted himself into our private conversations, going so far as to editorialize on a wide variety of subjects that were none of his business or concern. Our entire group was shocked at the audacity and we eventually left dumbfounded and disappointed by both the food and the service.

Beatrice &amp; Woodsley seems to be capitalizing on peoples quest for something hip and unique but I think it takes more than a creative interior decorator and a copy of PDT to create a truly exceptional cocktail and dining experience.  

Plan to leave hungry and with a much lighter wallet."

I would have given 5 stars if the service had been better. It took 20 minutes for us to get someone to begin the discussion about ordering food and our servers (one may have been getting poor training) didn&#39;t ask us if we had questions. When we did ask questions, our waitress seemed put out. 

In regards to the menu - well it is super fancy. I eat out a lot, and at some nice places, and there were so many things on the menu that NOBODY at our table could describe. So given this, I&#39;d say that Beatrice&amp;Woodsley would be doing their customers a great service if they spent some time educating their customers.

Beatrice &amp; Woodsley is the total package. The restaurant served a simple menu of great food. The duck was amazing! The bar tender was very knowledgeable about the wines they have and which one goes well with each of the food items on the menu. The duck paired very well with a rather dry French Pinot Noir. The creme brulee was the most memorable dish of the night - Oats toasted with rhubar jam, topped with macerated red and green strawberry - It was sweet, it was sour, it was bitter, and it was sweet again. As a cherry on top, this beautiful restaurant originated from a fairytale like dream the owner had.      Just.Perfect."

I have been thinking about this place since I left and have been having trouble trying to even begin to describe how incredible it is. It is like walking into a whimsical dream, a fairy tale, the most creative, romantic and dreamlike decor I have ever seen in a restaurant in my life. The way everything ties in together is just genius. 

Long white, clean drapes accompanied with large buttoned pillows give each booth a comfortable and chic look. Smooth pieces of wood go throughout the space as beams holding up the bar. The ceiling looks like bridges. The bar shelves are long cuts of wood supported by old antique chainsaws. Yes, I said effing chainsaws. This was by far the most creative and genius thing I&#39;ve ever seen. My boyfriend was just in awe over them. 

The menu is written like a book out of a never ending story with names like, &#34;epilogue to a prelude&#34;. Just take a peek at their website and menus online, it is so enticing!They even call their happy hour &#34;Nosh &amp; Tails&#34;. 

We got to go downstairs and see the private dining room and just take a look for yourself at how beautiful it is. 

Oh the bathrooms! The sinks are placed outside of each bathroom with chains that hang to turn on the water with fresh clean white hand towels awaiting for you to dry off. The soap is a sugary scrub that smells delightful and leaves your hands oh so soft!

Every single thing in this place is just remarkable and I can&#39;t get enough of it. Perfect for a date, I would love to come back here. We came back one more time before we had to end our trip and chatted with the bartender Dylan. He was very cool to chat with and full of fun facts and stories of his experiences in Colorado.

We came in for just a cocktail at the bar. I tried the apple infused whiskey neat and could never bring myself to mix it with anything it is exquisite! I can;t wait to come back one day and brunch or date night here."

This place is for folks looking for a new spin on classic brunch specials such as biscuits and gravy or monkey brains. You don&#39;t have to look far for options that will appease your palette, but you may need a cell phone to look up the gourmet ingredients included in your morsels of delicious stature.

The ambiance and décor are the best part! You really feel like you&#39;re in a storybook. We came for this alone and were not disappointed. 

The menu is whimsical. The drinks are strong. 

The host service is lacking. We were celebrating and were sat in the front. I would have thought making the reservation so far in advance that every time slot was available would have guaranteed us a romantic space instead of being sat with strangers. Either way. 

We weren&#39;t greeted immediately which always seems to start a night off wrong. However once greeted the service was exceptional. 

The food is upscale. If you&#39;re a picky eater I would not recommend this establishment.

Tonight we sat at the &#34;log&#34; table, a table made from a real (half) log, but placed in a booth made for a full size table, so we had to scoot forward to eat and twist our bodies or spread our legs enough to get our heads over our plates: not comfortable.  We ordered the arabic-influence chicken dish, but the improperly mild spicing on the chicken left it tasting a bit rancid with an overtone of boiled chicken, with the pork sausage slices taking the centerpiece in the flavor department.  My friends ordered the Sea Bass and liked it.  All of us felt that the plates - which didn&#39;t include a carb - were too small.   The lobster beigniets were nice, but the powdered sugar and sweet dough characteristic of beigniets clashed with the seafood, leaving one to enjoy the hope pepper sauce and not what it was on.   For dessert the banana cream pie came in a ramekin and was deconstructed to the point where there was little flavor and the ingredients (crispy crust, bananas, banana cream) in the ramekin seemed to blend into one monotonous mass.

My conclusion is that the chef either experiments on his patrons, or doesn&#39;t have a good sense of taste.  Either way, I won&#39;t be back as long as things stay as they are.  Dinner for 3 with one dessert and one wine came to $135, for which there are better options."

When we walked in my breath was taken away by how gorgeous it was on the inside. Every little detail was stunning and tastefully done. The service was great and everyone was very nice and friendly. My only real complaint has to do with the food, or lack there of. We ordered an appetizer to share, it was basically broccoli and cauliflower. The dish arrived and there were maybe 5 pieces altogether. It was absolutely delicious, but even if one person ate that it would hardly be an appetizer. I was hoping our dinners would be more substantial. I was wrong, at least mine wasn&#39;t anyway. My husband ordered a lamb sandwich that came with a side of vegetable chips. He had a decent amount of food, and if nothing else, bread is nice and filling. I ordered a bone in chicken breast that came with potatoes, rutabaga, and red cabbage. It took up about a 1/4 of the plate. While everything was delicious, I was left still feeling pretty hungry. I&#39;ve been to other equally expensive upscale restaurants that definitely give you your money&#39;s worth when it comes to quantity of food. This place, not so much. We spent over $100 including a tip. It was kind of a lot of money to still feel like I needed to go somewhere else afterwords. 
The other thing I was mildly disappointed in was they knew it was our anniversary yet we were never offered a complimentary dessert. We were shown a dessert menu where the cheapest thing was $10. I was hesitant to order something because I was sure it wouldn&#39;t even be big enough to share. But we&#39;ve gone to places just as nice and as expensive, and we&#39;ve gone to low budget restaurants, and any time it was a special occasion there was always an offer of something on the house. Considering the amount of money you&#39;re spending here it&#39;s the least they can do, in my opinion. 
But if your into decor this place won&#39;t disappoint. The bathroom and hand wash sink are interesting. I&#39;ll definitely come back, except just for drinks after having eaten somewhere else next time. That was about the only reasonably priced thing on the menu."

When I am in Rome I do as the Romans.  So I of course let my Denverite Yelper choose the locale in which we would nosh and I was handsomely rewarded.  This restaurant reminds me eating in a world that is part Narnia part Alice in Wonderland. Dining under the branches and perfectly lit trees (yes inside) we had the most delightful meal!  My personal favorite standouts were the beet and watermelon cold salad, coconut banana dessert and the Billy Goat lamb burger.  I want to drive back to get them all just typing it!  They also have quite the unique wine list full of my favey Pinot Noirs to pair with your meal. 

If mine is the only review you read I won&#39;t spoil it here but my tip is to not leave this place until you have used their powder rooms.  Best time I&#39;ve had with an encounter with the facilities ever.  

Thank you Beatrice for knowing how to cook, thank you Woodsley for setting the scene and thank you David M and his honey for being the best dinner dates a girl like me could ask for."

Crafty ambiance, creative menu, tasty cocktails, etc. I honestly think everything we had from start to finish was really good. I was really hoping we&#39;d be seated downstairs, but there was a rehearsal dinner happening down there so I didn&#39;t get to check it out. Anyway, for starters we had the crawfish beignets, turnip &amp; blueberry salad, and the heirloom tomato salad with ricotta. My oh my were those beignets tasty..and the salads. I honestly don&#39;t know how I&#39;d pick between the three.

For dinner, we had the duck, pasta, and then the boys each got the burger. Bites were shared all around and I really thought everything was great. Even the pasta, which was so simple, was really top notch - I loved the tomato sauce.

To top if all off - we shared the raspberry almond torta and banana cream pie. I hate bananas so I didn&#39;t touch the cream pie with a 10-foot pole, but everyone else said it was yummy. I also had the Hidden Republic cocktail on their dessert menu, and yum! It was a nice twist on the traditional Irish coffee - kind of like a cafe au lait + rum...so in other words, delightful!"

The decoration of the bathroom and sink was unique with toilet paper on the ceiling and a sink that was initially tricky to use, but someone was nice enough to come over and tell me to pull on the handle on the right. Once you get there, you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about ;) Great wine and food selection, and everything was delicious.

This place continues to rain down romance and intimacy. From the waterfall hand washing basins to the curtained booths and woodsy architectural touches, B&amp;W is one of Denver&#39;s most unusually inviting restaurants.

Loved our server, Cory (6 times a burner, so he was our Burning Man buddy, giving us Welcome Home hugs and special bar treats at the end of the night). And we all very much liked the creative food.

The aubergine gnocchi was almost like eggplant falafel; and that&#39;s a good thing. The tortellini with fresh sweet peas and corn, and the watermelon and beet (!) salad both seriously rocked.

For mains we had the chicken roulade (excellent) and the goat burger, and then split 3 desserts--the almond torte, the devil&#39;s food cake, and the banana creme pie (which prolly won that battle of the best (although I&#39;m still thinking about that dark chocolate fudge frosting on the DFC)).

All-in-all, a wonderful night, shared with even more wonderful people. It doesn&#39;t get better than that, and B&amp;W was the perfect setting to have that happen."

I had been waiting to check this place out for months since I moved to Denver in September. I kept looking at pictures and imagining this place to be like a little dream world. With such high expectations, one can easily be let down, but I was not! 

I&#39;m not going to harp on the atmosphere, because the pictures you can see do not lie. The music has a great vibe as well, definitely completes the modern/whimsical feeling of the restaurant.

I ordered an Apollo&#39;s Creed cocktail. It was phenomenal. Let me tell you. It was tart with a lemony kick, but the aftertaste was pure honey. The drink is made with greek yogurt, which sounds a bit odd, but it is true perfection. How someone came up with this drink, I don&#39;t know. 

We were planning on simply having an appetizer, which is what we started with. The Mama&#39;s Goat Cheesecake. Also sounds a bit odd, but also fantastically delicious. It reminded me of what a dessert would be like in Europe. Mildly sweet, but with a few garnishes that balance the sweetness (kale pesto and fried fennel). We couldn&#39;t get over how amazing our food and drinks were thus far, so we ended up ordering the risotto. The risotto was the only thing that mildly disappointed. It was good, for sure, but after such a great build up, good just didn&#39;t seem good enough. We wanted more AMAZING. Oh well. Still 5 stars :)"

Friend and I wanted to try somewhere new, so made reservations for Dining out for Life (1 extra star for that, glad they were participating). 

We were sat in a romantic booth where we sat next to each other. Alright, I get that&#39;s the vibe you&#39;re going for, but it was weird. Cocktails were on happy hour when we arrived, but almost all had gin or bourbon. I&#39;m more of a vodka girl. I did have one with pear vodka, St. Germain, and bubbly. It was ok, but I have no idea why it was served with orange peel - too many flavors. 

For dinner I tried the duck, not something I&#39;d normally get but was feeling adventurous. It was so blah, severely lacking in seasoning. I ate only one piece and friend (who was also going to order duck until I did) also had only one piece. It was served with spaetzle, brussels sprouts, and carrots. This too lacked seasoning. I may not know duck, but I do know spaetzle and this was not good at all. Friend ordered the burger which was much better in the seasoning department. I ate most of a half of it despite it being rarer than I would have ordered. Chips that came with it were heavy on pepper, but ok. 

We also got appetizers. The cheese plate was good, but over priced for two small pieces of cheese. The crawfish beignets were odd. Crispy on the outside but too chewy on the inside, too sweet for me, and no noticeable crawfish in the one I ate. 

I had heard they have good desserts, but nothing attracted me. Friend got the sorbet: sesame, coconut mango, and chamomile. Chamomile was surprisingly pretty good. Sesame she warned me away from. Coconut mango was strong on mango with slight coconut aftertaste. 

Service was meh. It was almost like our server was put out he needed to serve us. Upon removing my plate (with almost all the duck still on it) there was no question as to why and no offer for a box. 

As soon as I got home I felt sick. I didn&#39;t like the duck and apparently it didn&#39;t like me either. 

I will not go back. Really a 1 star experience but again bumping to 2 stars for participating in a worthy cause."

I looked for places on Yelp for our trip to CO and I wanted a nice date night place.  So glad I found this place.  It was great.  Neighborhood wasn&#39;t great, but the restaurant is beautiful inside and I kept finding cool little things like the tag that came on my wine with the wine information and the B&amp;W engraved in the floor just as a couple might do on a tree.  To get water in the sink near the bathroom, you have to pull on a chain and water trickles down a metal string of chains - so cool!   The food was equally amazing.  We had the crawfish beignets for an appetizer.  I had a rose&#39; wine and my husband had a mixed drink.  He thought his drink was just okay, but my wine was great.  I had the Baudelaire Birdnest (chicken dinner) and my husband had the Porc De Belgique (pork dinner) - both were amazing.

After we paid we decided to have a cocktail and the server said they were getting ready for dinner and could not serve us from the bar.

I showed appreciated for the unique &#34;sink&#34; they have and was very clearly berated in front of my date for the inquiry. Not sure why this occurred, but I felt quite mocked and embarrassed to be honest! Employees should be knowledgeable about the uniqueness of the business they represent instead of making a customer feel badly about asking a question and then audibly advising that he has become the &#34;new joke of the restaurant&#34; - you probably don&#39;t deserve that tip so make sure your cooks get a cut."

On my girlfriend and my list of must dine at venues in Denver the meal started off fine. We met a few friends who had been before and enjoyed B&amp;W. 

The decorations of a forest with aspen trees are fun and the tables are mainly booths in a long and somewhat narrow room. 

We started with the mussels and vegetables au gratin. The mussels were tasty, cooked well and in a delicious broth. The vegetables were also in a good sauce but too al dente for me. It was almost like potatoes au gratin with no cheese or crumbs on top.

I ordered the duck as the server said it was great and recommended it rare to medium rare. The others ordered gluten free burger, short rib and trout (waiter&#39;s favorite)

The issues started when only two of the entrees arrived. 

My main complaint is that the chef forgot to cook my duck. It was rubbery, fat not rendered a bit and a huge disappointment for the $28 price tag. My girlfriend&#39;s gluten free hamburger differed from the regular one in that it had no bun and was very very dry. For $19 you can include a bun or make it known this is served . Otherwise leave it off the gluten free menu. 

Our friend&#39;s entrees arrived 10 minutes later. The trout was fantastic, cooked perfectly and accompanied by their version of a potato pancake. The short rib was dry, not covered in enough sauce and not what you expect from a fine dining establishment. 

Dessert was the best part of the meal. 

The manager and waiter were apologetic; my issue is that Denver has many other fine dinging establishments and I&#39;d rather go there than take a chance on Beatrice &amp; Woodsley again."

Thanksgiving prix fixe - we weren&#39;t looking for a traditional meal, but would have liked a better experience. Three extremely small courses for Thanksgiving. Our cocktails arrived at the same time as our teeny tiny first courses, minutes after we sat.  We would have liked a chance to savor our cocktails for a few minutes before the first course. The first choice was soup or salad. The soup was maybe 4 oz., the &#34;salad&#34; was a few tiny, delectable pieces of pear and beet, a sprig of frisée. At first we thought the salad was an amuse bouche, couldn&#39;t imagine it was the first course. None of us are big eaters, but we were seriously worried we would leave hungry!

Next course, they brought the wrong entree for one of us, who had to sit without food for a ridiculously long time. The goose was so undercooked it was inedible and had to be sent back, while three of us waited for a new dish, and the others finished their meal. The vegetarian entree was delicious, and the toffee pudding dessert, again, delicious, but the size of an Oreo. When we asked for bread, they looked surprised at the request. First go around, they brought only olive oil, the next round they brought out butter too.

The atmosphere is lovely, but just an ok experience. So many great restaurants around, this one needs a lot more work. And really, upsize the food!"

I didn&#39;t have food. I did, however, have a drink with flavored of apple and pear that was shaken with Greek yogurt. I was skeptical of that last ingredient, but it surprisingly blended all the flavors together harmoniously.

Good luck using the bathroom and washing your hands. Muah ha ha. Fun to watch people struggle (I know, I&#39;m a bad person, but I must&#39;ve looked pretty funny myself!).

I&#39;ve done brunch and dinner here and the food is outstanding. It&#39;s worth every penny of that hefty check. The Green Chili Stew was fantastic (although the pickled egg in it was a bit weird) and the Colorado Bass was delicious. 

The restaurant decor is based on a poem. Chainsaws hold the bar shelves to the wall and the water for the bathroom sink is accessed by pull chain. Darling.

The service here is wonderful, as well. Our server joked with us and recommended some great wines.

However, the tables being coffee table height is really uncomfortable. You either have to fold yourself in half to eat over your plate or hold your plate in the air, closer to your face. Either way, I felt like an ass. It&#39;s just a very uncomfortable way to dine. It&#39;s unfortunate, because just about everything else about this place is amazing."

Service was impeccable.  Our server came to us when we wanted to.  Because it is tiny, they give you all the attention that you need.   I wasn&#39;t able to try their entrees but I was able to grab some dessert with my girlfriends and the banana cream pie had the perfect texture and taste.  The banana to cream ratio was perfect.  Make sure to dig your spoon deeper though to get the crust (which I didn&#39;t know until I saw it reveal itself as I took a bite of the cream pie each time.  

Presentation was beautiful.  Only downside is that I heard that the banana cream pie was bigger before and had more to it for the same price.  To me, this place is a bit on the pricier side--$10 for a palm-size dessert (yikes!) but worth it if you are trying to impress someone!  Personally, this place is ideal for a dinner with the girls, a bridal shower, or even a baby shower!  

Oh, and also you can reserve the room downstairs if you would like to host a small party or an event.

I had read recently that the restaurant was listed as one of the best brunch spots in Denver, so I thought we&#39;d give it a try.
Overall we had a good experience, but there were some things that bothered me during our time there.
First, we were seated at a table that was not comfortable. The table itself was too low, and the couch-like seat was too far from the table. This was not comfortable, especially for people like my parents and other people who are older. That and the table was really meant for 6 people tops...not 7. The side of the table that held 4 people ended up being very squished. We ended up asking our server if this table was appropriate for 7 people meaning we felt squished...and the response was &#34;Oh yeah we&#39;ve actually seated 10 at this table before.&#34; That is not helpful, and that did not make the 4 of us on the squished side feel any more comfortable.
Second, I did not feel like we had good service. Our server was attentive...but was cold and seemed annoyed every time we had a request or comment.
The food itself was quite good. Two of us had hot browns, two of us had steak and eggs, and two of us had crab cake Benedicts, all of which were great! I had a red flannel hash, which was delicious but VERY small. I felt like I was receiving a half portion with not much duck to it at all. I was done eating about 10 minutes before everyone else was, and I am not a speedy eater. We also started with the crawfish beignets which were good, but relatively bland. Had the aioli not been there it would have been bland to the point of not being able to eat it.
We really did enjoy the decor...very interesting use of reclaimed wood...creative sinks...things like that.

All in all we had a good time at B&amp;W...but I do not think we will be back. When you&#39;re talking about Denver which is a city full of brunch places that I would rate a 5...it&#39;s hard to justify going back to someplace you&#39;d consider a 3. There are just too many places around town that are way better."

Apple Fritters - With House-Made Bay Leaf Sorbet, and Agave Caramel-Apple and Beet Compote

My friend J and I opt to have the Chilled Corn Chowder options, while my friend C, opt to have the Salad option.

Everyone at our table opt to have the Duck as our Main Entrees.  

They were a little swamped that evening, hence the transition wait from our Appetizers and The Main Entrees do take awhile.  Maybe the Kitchen is swamped with other patrons order in ONE GO.  Hence do please be patient on these.

To return, NOT in a hurry... unless someone can blow my taste bud out..  all in all decent MEAL with EXPENSIVE Price tag, SMALL Portions, at least in my books, err in this instant in my tummy..  Not that I am full after the dinner experience.  *SIGH*

Inside the restaurant there are trees everywhere which gives it an enchanting look.  Started off with the crawfish beignets which were good.  Had the blood orange mimosa which was good, but too bad they weren&#39;t bottomless.  My entree was the Farmer&#39;s Delight which had very tender and succulent pulled pork with a side of collard greens, topped off with a sunny side up egg, and corn bread toast.  Probably one of the best brunch I&#39;ve had in recent memory and I can&#39;t wait to frequent this place again!"

I only wished that there was one in California. Amazing food and amazing service. I had the pulled pork appetizer and it was beyond amazing. I couldn&#39;t read or pronounce anything on the menu but all I can say is everything that I had was amazing. I even had a latte and that was fancy two it came with raw brown sugar. I actually felt kind of dumb because I thought it was a biscotti and ate it whole. It was all just so fancy looking. I had the chicken as an entree and it was very tasty and plated absolutely beautiful. For dessert I had the creme brûlée and it was good. I&#39;ve never had bad creme brûlée but this one was plated very uniquely. This place is definitely one of the unique ones. The decor of the place is stunning and the bathroom is so cute the sink is outside and it&#39;s soo cool because u pull it down for the water to come out. This place is a really fancy feel and gives a great rustic outdoorsy feel. Definitely worth the money you spend here.

When I dined here a few weeks ago for brunch, my friend and I were torn between many dishes. We settled on the crawfish beignets for an appetizer, which were nice and sweet with a touch of savory from the crawfish and red pepper aioli. 

For my entree, I ordered the Hoo-Weee Hot Brown, which is smoked turkey, onion, and tomato atop a slice of bread and covered with crawfish and sausage fondue and an egg over-easy. My entree was DELICIOUS and flavorful- especially the fondue- and, in some ways, evoked a modern twist on an eggs benedict. It was heavy, but I knew what I was getting myself into.

Besides the high points of the food, the decor is TO DIE FOR! Literally a woodland dream. My friend and I were saying how we could live in the place all day..... 

The sink in the bathroom was pretty hard to figure out, but definitely cool to look at.

Haven&#39;t had anything but brunch here, but I heard the lunch and dinners are a little less on par with the wonderful breakfast.

Cheers!"

The ambiance is perfect with real, beautiful Aspen trees all throughout the dining room. The restrooms are a little tricky, a system I have never come across before (good luck)! I would recommend having the beignets. They are delicious!"

Personable bartenders &amp; servers, terrific selection of food items, and the decor is just fun!  I couldn&#39;t have imagined a better spot to spend Easter than Beatrice &amp; Woodsley. Colorful eggs at the start of the meal REALLY made my favorite holiday that much better!  

I do feel the restaurant could be in a slightly better location, but that&#39;s not up to me! Haha.  Additionally, I made my reservations MONTHS in advance yet I got there and was not going to be sat where I requested or confirmed when I called the day before. Good thing the Bartenders were able to keep me entertained!  

For first timers seeking a &#34;neat&#34; dining experience - this is as unique as you will find in Denver. Try to be sat upstairs across from the bar in a round booth surrounding by the white draping.  It is just so dang romantic &amp; whimsical!  Great experience!"

Maybe my expectations were too high (shouldnt they be?) or maybe the server just rubbed me the wrong way? Either way, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going back.

Went for Sunday brunch. I was excited that they took reservations and I didn&#39;t have to wait the average 1-2 hours to eat out on a Sunday. 

I started off with the &#34;Garden of the Jewlels&#34; cocktail (pear vodka, st.germain, and bubbly): 4 stars. Strength was spot on but flavor a little dull, I would have preferred something with more flavor or kick.  

For my entree I had the Hoo-Wee Hot Brown (white toast, turkey, tomato, egg, and sausage &amp; crawfish fondue): 4 stars. Was tasty but nothing spectacular for the $13 price tag. Would have liked another ingredient to add more texture.

My husband had the Biscuits and Gravy: 4 stars. He wanted the Pork Cheek Hash, but they had &#34;just ran out.&#34; This would have been helpful information from the server when we sat down. The Biscuits and Gravy was satisfying though. Good flavor (maybe a tad on the salty side) and the the peas gave it nice texture and color. It was missing the smoked onion, as it stated on the menu. I also think a $14 price tag for a biscuit, some peas, 2oz sausage, and some gravy is a bit much.

Service: 2 stars. Server just seemed like he didn&#39;t want to be there. Didn&#39;t take time to explain the menu or specials, wasn&#39;t enthusiastic about answering questions. Server was absent most of the time, thankfully they had good teamwork and other servers refilled our drinks and cleared our plates. 

Atmosphere: 3 stars. I was really excited to see what everyone has been raving about with the decor. Perhaps it looks cooler at night, but during the afternoon the amber coloring and mellow (&amp; strange) music just made me want to crawl back into bed. It also made the food look less appealing as everything turned a orange color (did my turkey, egg, and hollandaise really need to be more orange?). Also the tables/booths up front werea bit awkward. They were small so it was hard to look at the person you were dining with, instead they were set up so you akwardly look right at the table across from you. On the flip side, the aspen trees and rustic feel of the decor were welcoming and unique. I also made sure to check out the bathrooms per the reviews. The sinks were pretty cool and it was interesting that they are in view of the dining room....no one can skip washing their hands here!

Price: 2 stars. Everything was overpriced. I think $8 would have been more than fair for the average cocktail, and $10-11 for the entrees would have been more realistic for the ingredients.

I wanted to try something new for brunch, but next time I&#39;ll stick with my favorites...Snooze, Sassafras or Finleys."

This was a Saturday night date night for me and the girlfriend and it was absolutely perfect for date night! The ambiance here is so unique, and so very Colorado, from aspens to actual oil burning lamps lowered on block and tackle. The bathrooms are some of the neatest and most unique that I have ever seen and the sinks are so cool. On top of the ambiance the setting is incredibly intimate we got to sit next to each other on the bench at the table and they were designed that way. Perfect for date night.

Our waitress was excellent in helping us to select a bottle from the wine list. There were some very unique and uncommon varietals and she was able to guide us toward the flavor we wanted. To start we tried the craw fish beignets as suggested by many others on here and actually were slightly disappointed, they were too doughy and lacked a bit of fish flavor and texture. However this was the only disappointment of the evening. I had the trout for dinner and my girlfriend enjoyed the duck. Both were incredible. I found the trout to be flavorful (despite my mild cold) with a wonderful crispiness from the skin. The accompanying veggies were cooked to perfection. As for the duck she loved it and the bit I had was excellent, a perfect medium rare throughout, warm but not overcooked, juicy and incredibly flavorful.

Finished off dinner with another excellent cocktail, espresso and dessert of a sesame creme brulee. The creme brulee was interesting with the sesame flavor, however we both were of the opinion that it was a little over the top and wasn&#39;t quite the flavor mix that we had anticipated, but despite that it was still enjoyable.

Overall certainly a very good 4 star meal, pushing that 5th star with the incredible ambiance and romantic intimacy inherent in the restaurant. I have never been to such a perfect date locale. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back some day in the future."

They had a room reserved in the downstairs basement area. The restaurant is beautiful and feels very whimsical with the trees and white fabric draping. You feel as if you&#39;re in a fairy tale. Reminds me like a scene from Legend (you have to get in your way back machine for that one). We were a good sized party so the food took a little long to come out which I totally understand. My &#34;Johnny eggs fever&#34; was good. The cauliflower and peas sides were under seasoned though. Others at the table had the cheesy grits which were spectacular. The weird thing of note was the hand washing station outside of the bathrooms. It was a little over the top. There are chains that hang from the ceiling that water runs down after pulling a cord. It&#39;s the sort of thing that is for show but really belongs in a spa and not a restaurant.

My husband and I have come here for drinks, always leaving admiring not only the interior design and atmosphere, but also the sophistication of the drinks. Last night, we finally made the plunge and went in for a full date night meal. We ordered 2 cocktails, The Apollo&#39;s Creed and the Oregonian Express.
The cocktails were on point, with The Apollo&#39;s Creed being especially impressive. Light, delicious, with a hint of sweetness. It was a winner. 

The cheese plate was okay. The cherry compote was delicious and the housemate pickles were good as well. But with only a blue cheese, brie, and a forgettably bland third cheese, it was less than impressive. It was served alongside a few slices of &#34;crostini&#34; bread and apple butter.

When we asked the server about the dinner options, she was refreshingly honest, saying the best thing on the menu was the Roast Leg of Lamb Sandwich. And she was right. I have never ordered a $24 sandwich before, but it was delicious. Thick crusty bread on either side of shredded tender lamb and a house made slaw, it was served with a side of amazing vegetable chips. I will dream about those vegetable chips. It was a beautiful entree, well executed and delicious. 

However, the $33 Braised Veal Short Rib left much to be desired. Swinging on the pendulum between dry and fatty, the veal short ribs were an insult to the braising technique. When I read braise, I was expecting fall off the bone tenderness. Instead, the tops were dry and crusty and the meat closer to the bone was just fat. It was served on a bed of a warm pickled brussel slaw that was alright. The consommé (rabbit broth with mushrooms) was probably the best part of the Braised Veal Short Rib. Yes, it was a great soup. But no, it didn&#39;t save the whole dish. 

After $120, we had a wonderful evening. Great service, great atmosphere, great drinks. But the actual food was a huge disappointment. We will probably come back and only order drinks after having dinner somewhere else."

Everything the other reviewers said were true. This restaurant is both romantic and rustic. The food was amazing! We were a large group and everyone was happy with their entrees and drinks! I was so looking forward to use the restroom since I read it&#39;s an integral part of the dining experience. Sure enough I almost made a fool of myself not knowing how to open the door or turn on the faucet. But fellow diners were happy to give me instructions. I&#39;ve never seen anything of this sort in a restaurant before. This will be a special occasion restaurant for sure!

I feel like these employees are people who would be too cool to hang out with me but damn are they good at what they do. I took my mom here for Easter brunch when we found out Trillium closed (we were looking for traditional Scandinavian cuisine.) We had the prix fixe menu and loved everything except our dessert (whatever the French toast wasn&#39;t...was not good. Basically just baked sugar, I felt like it came out of a plastic wrapper from Mexico.)

I stuck with the veggie options (broccoli rabe, kale) and my mom went heavier, but we tried each other&#39;s and weren&#39;t disappointed with anything. The Mary Verde is easily the best bloody I have had. All they needed were a few more garnishes (bacon, shrimp, cheese, etc). 

This place is NOT kid friendly OR non-food snob friendly. Keep in mind when making reservations for family events that it is for the food forward and palette passionate. 

Made rez on open table, overall quite pleased with our experience."

So the good: atmosphere was amazing!! Staff was very nice. Kitschy bathrooms and saw blade held bar shelves were great. 

Food: meh. Got a cheese plate which came out with 3 cubes of cheese smaller than you&#39;d get on a toothpick. 

Drinks: ARGH!!!!! Just bad. :( Way too sweet for starters on both I tried (Violet and Worm&#39;s Wild Ride). Plus, you couldn&#39;t taste the alcohol anymore. Um..... For those of us past wine coolers, the TASTE of alcohol MATTERS.

My boyfriend and I went for a work dinner and were very underwhelmed. In fact, everyone with our party seemingly had the same thoughts.  It&#39;s a great place to go once given the unique decor and trendy appeal, but the food and drinks are highly overpriced, portions are tiny, and the dishes themselves just weren&#39;t that good."

Like I am in a Terry Gilliam film or a film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Its nice.  I like it.  A Lot. It feels like a fairy ran away with an enchanted walden-esque artist/lumberjack (who lives in the cellar) and Beatrice and Woodsley is their love child.  Its just so magical.  They always have some interesting hipster strangest bartender making your drinks who genuinely seems to want to please you.  Its nice, and refreshing.  I always use the washroom at least twice and look at the ceiling often.  I love washing my hands there, and I love just looking at the place. 

I had brunch here, and I have to say, the food is a little too foody for me.  I love this place, but sometimes I feel my palette is not as hip as the food in the world. I have had an amazing mushroom &#34;restorative&#34; (B&amp;W for SOUP) that was to die for and the desserts are lovely. 
 
That said, I do love the happy hour here.  I love it because you can enjoy the loveliness of B&amp;W without a huge dinner/brunch bill.  They have 6.00 cocktails which are handcrafted and amazing. They have small plates which are fantastic, and not such a big gamble for the non-foody norm. 

In a world of Auroras and stripmalls and other yuckiness I am just happy there is a place where the aesthetic is paramount.  Its so fun."

In the grand scheme of things, I thought B&amp;W was very creative. The layout of the restaurant - beautiful, whimsical, and like a fairty-tale. That said, it&#39;s a small space and should you have the misfortune of dining next to a large group of 20-something 30-something women desperate to wine it up during their happy hour........ it will be loud. 

We came for my parents&#39; anniversary dinner and everything was good... just not great. I didn&#39;t think that the menu was necessarily creative though it tasted okay. Everything was just... ok. 

We ordered the Artisan Cheese Board, Billy the Burger, Parsnip Steak, Chicken Roulade, and the Catfish. Dessert was Sesame Creme Brulee and the Pear Ricotta Crepes. The complimentary after dinner ports were given to us for my parents&#39; anniversary. 

The highlight of the dinner: Pear Ricotta Crepes."

The atmosphere is no frills, the staff is upbeat and really friendly and the food is down home come comfort food, simple yet very good and satisfying.

The location may be kind of tricky for some to get to, but if you are a light rail,user, the 27th and Welton station on the D line is right in front on the cafe, so it can&#39;t get any easier than that!

I went for chitterlings but the waitress said they didn&#39;t have them at this time and told us about their oxtail special which came with 2 sides and a bread. The food was great! I guess it&#39;s a southern thing to eat rice and gravy with everything but the oxtails came by themselves with greens, macaroni and cheese and cornbread. I also ordered a peach cobbler to go.

I usually call in ahead, around 30-45 min before I want to pick it up. It does take awhile to cook. But it is fresh and delicious. 

Yesterday we decided to eat in the restaurant. We had the fried chicken dinner, it comes w/ 2 sides. We chose the red beans and rice and the fried okra as our sides and got an additional side of Mac n cheese. Wow it was so good. We were there for almost an hour before our food came out, so if you are dining in and getting the chicken you better not be in any rush. It was enough for 2 people and only $23. 

They have a sign by the door that says &#34;delicious food takes time&#34; it&#39;s totally true. Check them out and enjoy some delicious soul food in the heart of 5 points."

Chicken wings were fresh and juicy, just too oily for me and the honey hot was way too sweet, almost like candy.

Greens were on point. Cornbread was tasty. Fried okra was damn good. 

Still a bunch of things on the menu I wanna try. So next time it&#39;ll either be the jerk pork or the fried chicken or pates.

Prices are reasonable. Service was super friendly. Yea, it&#39;s a little disorganized and there&#39;s always a wait, but as my Hawaiian aunt says, &#34;Just get yourself on island time... you&#39;ll live longer.&#34; Awesome diners. Love the overall character of the place.

The chefs here know how to put their foot in it. And if you love good soul food, you know what that means.

Welton St., Café has the fried chicken dreams are made of. Only my mother and grandmother have made better fried chicken. This is no exaggeration. Those who are patient will be well rewarded.

The fried chicken dinner comes with four pieces of chicken. We needed to wait 20 minutes, but it was well worth it. The chicken was not only hot, but crispy and perfectly cooked and moist inside. I was so excited to eat I forgot to take a photo before I dug in.

The side dishes should not be forgotten. Most restaurants have side dishes as a sidenote. Usually they are slapdashed together and simply the supporting player. Here sides are fairly generous and well seasoned. The black eyed peas, greens, and red beans and rice standout for the extraordinary taste. The mac &amp; cheese was calling me with creamy sauce and macaroni that was not overcooked. Even the fry bread and corn bread were on point. The Beef Pate (pasty) had ground beef that filled the pastry and could almost be a meal by itself.

Last but not least is the staff! From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted enthusiastically. At every turn we were cared for and treated as a valued customers. We were checked on as we waited for our food and our drinks were refilled very quickly (refills after the 2nd are charged). 

Because the food is freshly made, it does take time. If you are in a rush this is not the place for you! 

I repeat ... If you are in a rush this is not the place for you!!! But if you&#39;re someone who appreciates fresh cooked food made with heart and soul that as well seasoned this is the place for you."

In the final analysis, there just is nothing better than good, old-fashioned, down-home Southern cooking. Nothing. And, there is no better place for this type of delicious food than Welton Street Café.

I have tried most items on the menu -- from fried chicken (which many consider to be the best in Denver) to fried catfish to smothered pork chops. And everything I have eaten at Welton Street Café has been exceptional.

In addition to tremendous food, the staff is friendly and warm. They make me feel welcome ... and at home ... each time I have had the privilege to eat at Welton Street Café. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!"

I absolutely love this restaurant. I am so satisfied. I am stuffed full. I am content. I am delighted. I am happy and smiling. 

Everything was hot and fresh! I had Mona&#39;s honey-hot wings. They were not too drenched in sauce and crispy delicious. They rival any wings in town. The hearty portion cornmeal breaded fried catfish was hot and crispy. It was laid on the plate atop pieces of white bread. Fried okra and coleslaw were my side dishes. Both tasty good! 

What delighted me most was the frybread. I lived off frybread in college and it brought me back to my youthful days. I gobbled it up and almost got another one.

The staff was super friendly. The restaurant was clean. The music on the speakers was soft and soulful. 

Overall a great dining experience! You really need to patronize this business regularly. You&#39;ll be so super glad you did."

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Just to get it out of the way.

Now I must admit I am a simple man. I love food done in a simple and delicious manner. A manner infused with a lot of love and passion for that food. This place.. THIS PLACE. They do it. They do it well. Up and down. Front to Back. Lip Smack. I miss you already..

Gold. Pure. GOOOLD. This is the best fried chicken I have ever had besides my own MOMMA. Seriously, eat this chicken and this catfish right now. Honey Hot sauce is foolproof tastylicious. The place was getting packed quickly with people waiting for to-go lunch orders; but the staff was incredibly quick and courteous. Attentiveness to table liquid levels was on Beast Fleek Mode.

The only thing about this place that can rival the food and service I received during my experience here was the quite possibly best in-restaurant playlist ever witnessed. I&#39;m talking every major 90&#39;s hip hop and R&amp;B hit you can think of.

-The Fried Catfish Dinner with Red Beans n Rice, Fried Okra and Corn Bread.

Now as a Southern gal, I love soul food so this place was a must to come by and critique. To my amazement I was pleasantly surprised and delighted all at the same time! Everything tasted fresh to order, I have said this twice so it is important to me that food does not have that after/can taste. 

I would highly recommend if you are having a moment where you need some good comfort food. Located right off of the light rail there is no reason to not visit. Come on by and check them out, I promise you, you will be glad you did."

I&#39;ve never had fried chicken this good. It&#39;s perfect. Seriously. Seasoned to perfection with a crisp delicious skin and juicy tender chicken underneath. Perfection. 
I peaked in my box when I got to the car to make sure the order was correct, but when I saw it in all its glory, I had to give it a taste. I spent the next minute and a half contemplating if I should hunker down and just devour my meal or drive all the way home. Next 5 minute drive home was the longest of my life.

My sides were the greens and cabbage which I thought were done perfect.

Now that my daughter and I are both vegetarians,  we were quite pleased to see a veggie burger on the primarily-soul-food menu at the Welton St. Cafe.   We ordered one veggie burger (priced quite reasonably at $4.95) and shared it.  It was grilled perfectly,  with tasty grilled onions and other veggies on it,  + mustard and mayo.   Soooo good!  

We also ordered 3 side dishes to share:  okra, mac &amp; cheese, and yams.  All were marvelous.   This was a challenging day for both of us, and neither of us had eaten all day,  so this mid-afternoon shared meal really hit the spot!

And I&#39;m telling you, since the closure of M&amp;D&#39;s and Pierre&#39;s a few years back, I had mistakenly thought that there was nowhere in the Downtown/Uptown area to get me some of that wonderous soul food that I had as a youngin&#39;. Except--I say--except, as I just discovered at the Welton St. Cafe; where their hushpuppies taste of the cornfields of Georgia, and their catfish is so light and fresh  that it probably swam straight up the Platte and jumped in Chef Dickerson&#39;s skillet just before I sat down to order it.  

I hear that the chicken&#39;s the next thing I&#39;ve gotta try, and I also hear that right up the street there&#39;s some competition laying in wait at Cora Faye&#39;s. But having just discovered the Welton Street Cafe, all I can say is . . . praise the Lord and pass the hot sauce. Their catfish is corn-battered-ly deeeeelishous."

I am never disappointed with Welton Street Cafe.  Only in my dreams could I imagine making fried chicken this good, so I&#39;ll just leave it to the experts.  I typically get my food to go, so I can&#39;t really comment on the dine-in service.  But everyone is very friendly whenever I go to pick up my order.

Another thing that most people don&#39;t really think about is the hot sauce.  Their recipe is perfect, like a thicker and more flavorful version of Tabasco.  Not everyone eats fried chicken with hot sauce (it&#39;s helps cut through the grease and fat), but this is a great place to start doing it."

It came with 3 HUGE pieces of fried chicken, fries, corn bread and macaroni n cheese (you can change up the sides) it was so much food, I couldn&#39;t eat for the rest of the day.

It took about 30 mins to get my order to the table. 

The atmosphere is pleasant and friendly but ordinary.

Fried catfish, macaroni &#34;n&#34; cheese, and homemade cornbread were just a few favorites of my childhood and still show up on my plate when I visit back home. 

This craving had me in its grip and forced me to reconcile with it at the Welton Street Café. The reasons were not only the positive reviews online, but also the word of mouth I received from close companions. The location is in the heart of Five Points while being next to the RTD light rail that carries some of Denver&#39;s most inquisitive. 

As I pushed through the doors, I was met with two gracious smiles from the women who worked the front counter. I picked up a southern vernacular and charm in their voices as one of the women gave me a menu so I could dine in. I selected to sit at one of their pink salmon booths. Much to my delight, the booth was properly wiped and cleaned; there is nothing worse than sitting in the last person&#39;s crumbs or having residue stuck on my elbows. 

The room had a classic cultural vibe that sunk in as soon as I sat down, a comfortable and relaxed feel, almost as if I was dining at home. The walls were decorated with African art and some smooth R&amp;B played softly in the background. This was delightful to me, but may deter some who are looking for a more elegant or upscale appeal. 

After I received my drink, one of the kind women from the front took my order. The catfish on the menu already captivated my eyes and just to be sure I asked the waitress if this was the right choice. She gave a confident head nod and a southerly &#34;Um humm,&#34;reassuring me of my order of the catfish sandwich ($ 6.55) with a side of macaroni &amp; cheese ($ 2.85).
 
I received my meal in a timely manner with my catfish on a large white plate and my macaroni &#34;n&#34; cheese in a saucer on the side. I started with the macaroni &#34;n&#34; cheese and for me, it was not that impressive. The noodles had a great texture, but a runny cheese sauce saturated it. The sauce had a mustard yellow coloring and could use more salt and pepper to bring out the flavors. Some may not mind this extra sauce, but I could do without it. 

The catfish sandwich, however, stole the show. Sinking my teeth into the sandwich, the crispy fried catfish broke apart and lavished in my mouth. It had all the right components. The fish had a light creamy texture in the middle (probably from being soaked in buttermilk) with a crispy cornmeal coating on the outside. The bread was slightly toasted with lettuce and tomato, and had a sweet and tangy tartar sauce on the bottom bun that complimented the fish perfectly. The cornmeal breading was so good, I dared to not let any go to waste on my plate or napkin. 

This experience is one I would definitely repeat. The staff was excellent being attentive, polite, with quick service. But the catfish is what would keep me coming back. It is hard to find comfort food cooked right and the Welton Street Café did this fish justice. My savory indulgence was met, and that is all I could ask for."

The sides are on the small side. The Mac n cheese was too cheesy, and my pork chops were a little on the tuff side, and salty. My greens were good, and I loved the beans and rice. I would return to give it another shot, so I can give an update and rise the 3 stars to a 5 star!!"

I had the catfish along with okra and collard greens. These guys must have their fryer temperature just right because there was not a drop of grease on my plate. Considering that almost everything was fried, that&#39;s pretty impressive. Same goes for the fried chicken.

Jamacian jerk chicken was not something we expected to see on the menu. A friend ordered it, and it was the surprise winner of the night. It was really tender with just the right amount of spice.

Sides and desserts were all ok, but I think that the main dishes are what warrant coming back."

I&#39;ve been here a couple of times and really enjoyed my food and the experience every time.  The interior is no frills, with a mix of booths and tables.  Service is great.  They make you feel at home.

On my most recent visit, I had the jerk chicken with macaroni and cheese and yams as my sides, and fry bread too.  The jerk chicken is moist and flavorful and has a good kick.  The mac and cheese is solid and of the creamy variety.  The yams are nice and sweet, but not too sweet.  The fry bread comes in the form of a very dense cylinder, and although a little bland on its own, it&#39;s great with honey.  The platter of food was enough for two good-sized meals.  

I&#39;ve also tried the fried catfish, which is served atop pieces of white bread and is especially good with hot sauce.  If you get the catfish dinner, you get two sides and still more bread, with your choice of cornbread, fry bread, white bread, or a dinner roll.  The seasoned fries are good, kind of like Arby&#39;s fries without the curl.  The hush puppies are good too, with a nice amount of seasoning, a good crunch on the outside, and moist goodness on the inside.  

They don&#39;t have sweet tea, unsweetened tea only, so I tend to go with Diet Coke.    

It takes awhile to get your food, but they forewarn you, and good food is worth the wait, right?"

Friendly and helpful staff especially with the Pates, &#34;pick it up and eat it like a sandwich!&#34;  The Catfish was simple but tasty, and I enjoyed the Smothered Pork Chops with Red Beans and Rice with Mashed Potatoes. Today&#39;s special was Ox Tail but will have to go back to try out the rest of the simple menu with plenty of tasty choices for sides.  Overall a great experience on a beautiful Saturday!"

There was some good food during my visit, there was some not so great food during my visit, there was some good service and there was some bad service. 

I came here with my family at a weird time, around 3:00-4:00 on a weekday afternoon, but it filled up as I was leaving so maybe it&#39;s more popular a time than I thought. Initially we were almost the only people here. As we were eating it seemed like one of the employees made themselves food and sat down. She was.....exceptionally loud. The way she spoke to other people working, (IE: Rudely) made me think maybe she was an owner or family member. At one point while we waited for our food, two younger guys walked in and tried to sit down, and this woman barked &#34;pull your pants up or go back outside.&#34; Partially, I totally admire this, but partially, her volume and ascerbic tone made the environment really uncomfortable. 

For food, my dad and I split jerk chicken with collard greens, red beans and rice, and cornbread. The jerk chicken was overall good, though some pieces were very small and mostly made of cartilage and/or bone. Several pieces had large chunks of very slimy skin, which was also a bit unpleasant. The collard greens were good but dare I say, overcooked? I know a green has to be cooked for quite a while but they seemed like they&#39;d given up. The red beans and rice needed some seasoning, and tasted exactly like the black eyed peas, which we also tried. The fried okra that my mother ordered was very good, and maybe actually didn&#39;t come from a Sysco bag!!

I know cornbread is a very personal preference, but for me, a crumbly cornbread is a bad cornbread, and my piece was so crumbly I basically had to hold it completely vertically over my mouth. On the plus side, prices are pretty reasonable (though $13 for a plate is a bit steep for lunch) and the portions are big. Our server was very nice as well. I would also add that although I am not the type to be swayed by a sketchy neighborhood, I&#39;d probably leave this as a lunch spot, and probably wouldn&#39;t come here after dark for dinner. That&#39;s a total personal preference- if you are coming here using light rail, the Welton stop is right outside the front door of this cafe, which makes it really accessible. For the downtown/Five Points area, especially if Tom&#39;s is closed, this is probably your best bet."

I stopped here for lunch basically because of my long wait at the DMW.  I ordered the Perch sandwich, fry bread and mac and cheese.  The previous reviews are completely right about the long wait.  I waited almost an hour for my food.  The perch was really salty and the mac and cheese was just OK.  The food was nothing special.  

The service was good.  The waitress sat down with her friends for a while and didn&#39;t follow up with how my food was.  At one point I needed hot sauce and honey and I basically had to get up and get some hot sauce from another table myself.  Then I had to remind the waitress about the honey a 2nd time.  

I ended up missing my number being called at the DMV.  I then had to wait another hour for my next number to be called.  Going to lunch at this place wasn&#39;t worth that extra hour at the DMV."

It&#39;s definitely a little pricey but you guys, the food is incredible. So beautiful and flavorful and delicately plated and wondrous. That makes it sound super fancy but it&#39;s not super fancy, you can totally have a casual lunch here. 

I had no idea how big this restaurant was because I usually sit on the patio, just a few tables and umbrellas. Gotta love the lights and people watching at Larimer Square. But I finally sat downstairs and was able to see the rest of Osteria Marco. Tons of space, low lighting, all wooden everything, beautiful wine bottles all over the place. 

Make sure you order the house made burrata, whatever you do. It&#39;s INSANE. Creamy and rich and perfect and drizzled with olive oil, salt, and pepper. I also love the caprese salad and the whole roasted artichoke. House olives. Any of the meat or cheeses. Of course there&#39;s a gorgeous selection of pastas and pizzas, but I usually stick with apps and the house red wine for $7. Can&#39;t go wrong. 

Can&#39;t wait for a special occasion when I can come here and have an excuse to order every single gluten free item on the menu."

The photos on yelp gave me the impression this was a nice restaurant. Upon arrival, it seems that&#39;s what the owners had in mind, but didn&#39;t hit the mark. 

You go downstairs to find a big, open space. The service was sufficient, as was the food. The rabbit gnudi was good. It was $27. I wish there had been more gnudi and vegetables/greens in the dish. The proportion to meat was off for me. The scallops tasted a bit off to me as well... not very fresh. I&#39;d expect more at $30 The grilled ciabatta bread was $5-6 and came cold. The caesar salad was OK at $7 nothing on it except a few croutons and a small sliver of white anchovy. I saw someone eating a quinoa spinach salad that looked very good. 

It was a thoroughly underwhelming experience overall, especially for the price."

The restaurant was very busy, but he didn&#39;t seem rushed at all. He gave us amazing recommendations and never steered us wrong. We started with the braseola and burrata. It was insane. So delicious! Order the burrata!!!!!Next, we had the rabbit and the mushroom pizza. Holy cow. Probably the best pizza I have ever had in my life. It was so flavorful. The rabbit was also delicious. We finished with butterscotch bread pudding which was also great. So happy with our evening! 

ETA-
Osteria Marco used to be my favorite restaurant when in Denver. Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience the last time I was there. My friend reserved a table for 10 to celebrate a bachelorette party. We arrived in a limo and were wearing matching outfits. I believe that the staff discriminated against us from the moment we walked in the door. After a day at the spa and a wine tasting, we went into the restaurant eager for a delicious meal. Our server (who I have had before) was very unpleasant and rude. He clearly did not want to be assigned a table full of women. Then, when one of the girls tried to order wine for the table, we were told that we had been &#34;over served&#34; and may not order alcohol. My friend very calmly tried reasoning with the manager, but was still not allowed to order drinks. We decided we would prefer to bring our business elsewhere. As we were leaving, another friend overheard one of the servers telling her table, &#34;sorry about those ladies, they&#39;ve been drinking all day&#34;. Mind you, we were a group of 30-something young professionals and mothers. We were not drunk. We were very frustrated with the terrible service we encountered at a restaurant that had previously been a favorite for most of us. Unfortunately, Osteria Marco has lost business from all 10 of us, and our families and friends."

But family behind me they gave a table without any restrictions. 

I asked host if I wait when will a table be available , he said 9. So I left I said never mind. Host says &#34;Well make a reservation next time!&#34; 
Very unprofessional! 

I understand it is Friday night and it&#39;s very busy, but offering a table with a time limit is uncalled for as I don&#39;t know how how it will take to cook the food, etc. 
Then to insult me for not making a reservation was not necessary! 

I&#39;m very disappointed as I was visiting Denver and on vacation."

Again, we were lucky to get seated right away and the service was fast and the food was hot and delicious.  

We got the Grilled Ciabatta Bread and the Seasonal Bruschetta for appetizers, both were top notch, I only got one picture of the destroyed plates because we dove right in.  The highlight was the pesto dipping sauce that came with the Ciabatta though, it really made the taste-buds feel good and happy. 

As for the pizza two of us ordered the Margherita which was fantastic, and two of us (me) got the Carne (Sausage, Meatball, Pepperoni, House Ricotta) and for it was ridiculously good!  I don&#39;t think I could even venture to try another type of pizza it was so good and I would order it again &amp; again! 

All in all I highly recommend this place if you love pizza, and fresh appetizers. There are a lot of choice in Denver on Larimer but I think we hit the jackpot here."

We went here to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We were given complimentary champagne to start our meal, which was a nice touch! We started with the burrata which was, as everyone else has said, amazing. Our second course we split the fried green tomatoes and the calamari. The calamari was flavorful and plentiful and we both said we could have ordered it individually for a meal it was so good.

We finished with the sausage pizza, which was perfect to split after all that food. A nice touch of spice to it. 

Finally, we finished splitting the butterscotch bread pudding. Also as awesome as everyone else has said. 

All in all, the perfect night out for us. Not too fancy, not too pricey, but delicious food and generous servings. Good for celebrations or just a night out for pizza. We shall return!"

First and foremost, if you can sit outside during your lunch hour, please do so. It is so pleasant and makes for wonderful people watching Osteria Marco is on Larimer Square which is easily one of my fave places in Denver.

The food is divine. This last time I went we ordered the calamari. It was definitely a different twist, more of a salad with calamari then just calamari. I loved the presentation and it was a great combo of seafood and greens. I also ordered one of the paninis and it was so good. The bread was soft and crusty at the same time and all of the ingredients inside were fresh and delicious. Prior times, I have ordered the pizzas and they are fabulous as well.

The service is great. All the servers are polite and attentive - both in the downstairs restaurant and outside on the patio. I have always felt welcomed and that the servers wanted us there.

If you&#39;re looking for good Italian downtown - this is your place. It&#39;s also fabulous for date night if you&#39;re looking for something intimate."

Besides the AWESOME A** name, this place has wonderful food and excellent service.  

I&#39;ve eaten here several times and EVERY time they kill it.  

It can get VERY busy so ALWAYS call ahead and get reservations.  Especially during peak hours.  They do have some cool group bar seating and the patio is fun if you can get a spot.  Super people watching!

Pizza- great! Pasta-yum! Salads-wonderful- no REALLY wonderful! Fried Green Tomatoes- aaaawesome! 

But the best, the wholly grail of yummy, their Chicken Parmesan Sandwich Marinara- wait, no seriously- wait, tears are forming in my eyes and I can not longer write for a moment.....

OK, I&#39;m back.  You MUST try this sandwich.  Its on a house focaccia bread- and they butter the bread and grill it.  WHAT?!  The chicken is fresh the mozzarella fresh stretched daily and the marinara MAMMA MIA! 
It&#39;s heaven on buttered focaccia. 

Just go.  Go right now and eat there.  And if you get the beautiful deliciousness that is their chicken parm sandwich, you may message me and thank me. ;-)

First of all, there were so many selections for each category and second of all, they give you a very big portion of every course. 

I wish that wine is included in the list but it wasn&#39;t. Nevertheless, I cannot pass on the Lambrusco here so my girlfriend and I each ordered a glass. For starter, you can choose your typical appetizers like calamari or mussels or you can go with their cheese and meats. My friend and I shared the prosciutto and organic goat cheese. It came with ample bread and the combination tasted phenomenal together. I couldn&#39;t stop eating!

Then came the salad. There were honestly more than one choice I would have liked to try but I went with the poached pear and candied walnut since that&#39;s a more unique option. My salad was really good and I was able to try my fitness couscous and kale salad which was super delicious and filling. 

For entree, I got the carbonara pizza. It comes with bacon and a runny yolk egg in the middle. Super unique and the cheese was delicious too. The only thing I would change would be the crust it&#39;s not the best I have had. I tried my friends lamb meatballs which were super good and also my other friend had the whole pig and that was very savory as well. Everyone was super full and had to take their food to go. The pizza was a full size and I only ate 3 slices before I gave up and had enough food to last another meal. 

Dessert was $4 extra which would have been lovely but we were all too full to indulge and my parking meter was running up. My total was $50 with gratuity included due to our large group which is decent for this experience."

I wish I lived down the street, because this would be a place my girlfriends and I would frequent once a week. It is perfect for sharing and small bites. I tried the following and they were all phenomenal: Chef&#39;s Assortment from the salumi bar, grilled ciabatta bread with pesto, meatball sliders, whole grilled artichoke, calamari, wild mushroom and robiola pizza, prosciutto pizza, and the short ribs.

Also, we had the burrata for the table, and it wasn&#39;t like any burrata I&#39;ve ever had, it was more like a ricotta if anything...

Made dinner reservations for a Saturday night dinner with friends we haven&#39;t seen in years. One thing that really intrigued me about this place was that it was located on such a beautiful street and that their menu says &#34;Osteria A humble restaurant where friends gather to casually enjoy their wine with food&#34;. This just hooked it! 

Our reservations were for 8:30pm, as soon as we arrived we were seated right away by a friendly hostess. The only downside was there were 6 of us and we felt a little crammed at a booth. We made do, and ended up having a great time. Our server was great at explaining the menu to us and recommending drinks. We started off with a bottle of red wine and some glasses of white wine. The wine was delicious! 

For food, we started with the cheese plate and added the burrata that everyone on Yelp seems to be raving about. It was delicious! All of the cheeses were delicious but the burrata was the best. We also ordered the meat plate which was amazing as well. You can&#39;t go wrong with ordering these two as appetizers. For dinner, I ordered their house salad with chicken. I wish I would have taken a picture of the salad because it was HUGE and so delicious. People at the table were raving about the rabbit, the lamb meatballs and the chicken parmesan sandwich.

No?

Ok then this is the place for you. It easily lives up to the hype of the 1000-plus reviews here, 10 percent of which currently call out this dish. And it&#39;s everything a burrata lover wants -- fresh, high quality cheese with a light coating of olive oil and a dusting of salt and pepper. The bread it comes with is very good (a little salty close to the crust) and accompanies this cheese well.

I also had a short rib neapolitan pizza, which was also amazing. And I was in Rome 36 hours prior to my meal here, and can say that this pizza even beat some of the pies I had there. Seriously! I am in Denver for another couple days and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I log another check-in here before I go back home."

PIZZA: If you need to pick a pizza go for the wild mushroom and robiola.. It&#39;s delicious. 

SALAD: The apple and fennel salad!!! SO GOOD. 

DESSERT: the cobbler which was the special of the night literally made my taste buds melt. I was in heaven!!!"

Reading about it&#39;s below the street level location only fueled my curiosity. Besides that it&#39;s located in the Larimer section of downtown Denver that I&#39;m currently enamored with. 

The mere mention of freshly made burrata everyday is another reason I can&#39;t pass going here any longer.

I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Even though my order was based 100% on our awesome waiter Rick&#39;s(?) recommendation it was on point. The Braised Short rib was amazing! It was so flavorful and tender. I am definitely in love with this dish. It looks small but it&#39;s not and it packs it&#39;s wallop in the flavor it possesses. 

Their Butterscotch bread pudding was excellent. 

Our starter was the Meat and cheese platter. I had to order this. I must try their creamy Burrata. I wasn&#39;t disappointed. The Burrata was one of the best! The rest of the meat and cheeses were all top notch and fresh! 

My prosecco was a drink made to match my mood and our company&#39;s bubbly personality. I was very pleased with everything. 

The location was one of the sought after not the normal street level restaurant. It sits below the street with a flight of stairs that takes you down to the bar on your right and it opens up to the main dining area. The wall of wines just captured that spirit of Italy where you just want to eat, drink and be merry!

The outside seating would be great to people watch. It&#39;s my next target. If you have trouble parking don&#39;t even bother. Valet it! $10 with validation. That&#39;s the Larimer style way to have a relaxed and mellow night!"

I was told that by a saleswoman from the nearby Overland store at 16th Street mall which was another amazing store to shop at!!!

Excited to come to this unique area for the very first time we walked the block to check out the various restaurants, shops and boutiques. Because it was after six in the evening many of the shopping boutiques were already closed but that&#39;s okay as my hubby wiped his forehead of imaginary sweat for the umpteenth time!

Parking doesn&#39;t come easy even though we were here early. But to drive a car rental humongous Suburban we just decided to park at a nearby parking lot to play it safe! The block has metered parking until 8pm plus there was valet parking as well.

They do have seating outside but because it was later in the evening the several tables were already occupied. Friends of ours shared their dishes especially the cheese and cured meat!  If you never had burratta this is definitely the place to try it because they make it fresh everyday and it&#39;s out of this world! 

I had ordered the grilled shrimp salad with spinach leaves, red onions, ricotta cheese, baby cherry tomatoes with a sweet corn vinaigrette dressing which was awesome. My husband&#39;s rotisserie chicken salad was even yummier than mine of course bc it wasn&#39;t my dish! Lol! Friends of ours ordered the shortrib plate which was magical; the meat was so tender and so flavorful! Why didn&#39;t I order that? And Adam ordered the lamb meatball with polenta which also was so very tasty! Butterscotch bread pudding with vanilla gelato &amp; dulce de leche was sweet and so delicious too!

I highly recommend coming here. The food and cozy atmosphere were excellent. If you have issues with stairs it may be a issue for you bc that&#39;s how you get to the major portion of their restaurant which lies in the basement of the building. I didn&#39;t check out the bathroom sorry but I know it&#39;s available there if needed. I know if we had another chance to visit this area we would definitely try out the outdoor patio seating unless its horrible weather. So there you have it another five star restaurant! Don&#39;t you be hesitant to come here bc you will be definitely missing out!!! I&#39;m so happy we did!"

As I perused the menu (and specifically having a taste for pizza) I had trouble deciding between the short rib, wild mushroom or any number of other tempting tastes. After asking the waiter to select for me, I ended up with the fig and goat cheese pizza (with a glass of the house red that was a great compliment). Boy was I glad! The flavor echoed a smokiness, sweetness and decadence all in one. And if that wasn&#39;t enough, the chef saw fit to strategically drizzle this masterpiece with truffle oil giving the already pillow soft crust a little something extra. Aside from their expertise creating pies to die for, this restaurant boasts eclectic flavor combinations in all of their features and entrees.

As far as ambiance is concerned, the downstaris dining room is a welcome surprise coming in off the busy Larimer street. The warm brick walls give it a sense of coziness reminiscent of a city loft or even a speakeasy from decades ago. The dim lighting is a perfect fit for a girls night or a romantic date. All in all, this restaurant with its great service and interesting combinations has inched into my top 10 to date. You will not be disappointed with a stop here. Bon Appétit!"

We came in on a Friday night without a reservation and sat at the bar. The bar service was excellent. Drinks were great. We did the meat and cheese platter and ciabatta with an amazing basil pesto - it rocked!

The later courses - really dropped the ball. They were way over seasoned. I appreciate well cooked Italian foods in which you can really taste the food. We did the lamb meatballs - ok, but very spicey and the eggplant parm - for me this was the biggest disappointment. The eggplant parm was cooked well, a great consistency but terribly seasoned - I think I tasted anise??? Ugh! I couldn&#39;t eat it. My husband loved it (but he loves Chili&#39;s). If I were to return I think I&#39;d stick to drinks, apps, pizzas or paninis - entrees were unimpressive for the price."

The food is pretty good, the staff is fantastic, and it&#39;s right in the heart of the Larimer Street swanky spot area.

There are a few things to note if selecting Osteria Marco as your dining option:
- It&#39;s loud.  I mean, probably not when it&#39;s empty, but on a Thursday night during the dinner hour, loud.  That might be largely due to the fact that a ton of self righteous loud a-holes have moved into Denver in the last 20 years, and feel the need to be the center of attention all the time.  
- It&#39;s in the basement.  Not a critique on any level, but don&#39;t come for the view.
- The menu is either $$, or $$$$, dependingon your eating habits.  Go with the Cubano?  $12 bucks.  Select an entrée? $30.  Go for a good bottle of wine?  Well..."

Atmosphere: 4.5
Value: 3

Had a taste of three different menu items: the sopressata picante, short rib, artisan pizza, and butterscotch bread pudding dessert. Of the three, two were a pinch too salty. The sopressata picante had a good combination of flavors, and the saltiness added a strong kick, but it was still a bit overwhelming. The short rib was not much better. The meat was incredibly tender (a big plus), and the presentation was great, however again the saltiness brings the taste rating downwards.

The dishes almost get it right, but just barely miss the mark.

The Artisan pizza needs special attention, however, and it was made rather well. It had a good mix of flavors, and had a tasty sauce to compliment it. One of the best pizzas I have had in Denver.

The bread pudding was also quite good. So if you find yourself here, get the pizza and the dessert!

Overall, it should also be noted that that food quality/taste in relation to price earns this establishment a low value rating. For the expense I expect a more well-rounded/quality meal.

If you want to try something new, I would still recommend this place. However, if you have also never been to the Odyssey then I recommend that over this place."

I take all my out of town guests here because its reasonably priced, has a great atmosphere and is on Larimer - which is the best street downtown.  However, this weekend I did the Dining Al Fresco and I was so disappointed in our service.  I called in the morning to ask if they could surprise my table with a dessert as it was my friends anniversary. The host was less then helpful.  She had no idea what the dessert options were and had no idea how to coordinate this so she told me to just do it when i arrived. 

 After we got to dinner and were sat, it took our waitress 10 min to greet us - which was far from a happy greeting. Then when I approached our waitress privately about an Anniversary dessert she gave me a hard time and told me they didn&#39;t do that during the Dining Al Fresco and I said well i spoke to the host this morning and she didn&#39;t mention this. She reluctantly agreed to do it, so i chose a dessert and asked if they could write &#39;Happy Anniversary&#39; on the plate and she said ok.  The dessert comes out and no happy anniversary. The waitress seemed less then thrilled to be working and to be helpful. I am just disappointed in the staff. Food/Wine, Dining outside was awesome - but where was the customer service?"

However, after coming here a number of times, service is spotty.  Last time the waitress was spot on.  Table for two and we split a couple dishes.  She made suggestions and was smiles all through the night.  Then we showed up about a week ago and I felt like I was on Shark Tank getting grilled cause I was hungry and the waitress wanted me to answer the 5 W&#39;s of hunger.  Last time it was all business and we tried to crack a couple jokes but this girl wasn&#39;t budging at all.  Regardless, 4 stars for the food and service as of last time is a disappointing 2 stars.

The bar crafted a custom cocktail for my friends and the kitchen was very accommodating in delivering a clean (ie diet friendly) entree for my coach who was not able to indulge quite as much as we could.

I had the opportunity to try several dishes,  every entrée exceeded every one of my expectations! The pizza was fantastic, they offer a variety of specialty flavors that will fill any cravings that you may have. However the pizzas are somewhat inconsistent, some were cooked perfectly sadly one of our pizzas were under cooked and a bit soft.

If you are in an adventurous mood and are looking to try something unique and new, I highly recommend trying their rabbit. Keep in mind the portion is on the smaller side but I can promise you that you&#39;ll be having dreams about eating this dish!!

I highly recommend this place! Might be a good idea to make reservations, this place gets very busy and it&#39;s not uncommon to wait 2+ hours."

This restaurant&#39;s located in Larimer Square so parking is difficult u unless you opt for the garage. I like how the restaurant is underground and cozy. The pizza was delicious &amp; super fragrant in truffle oil. I ate it @ home the next day &amp; it was super greasy but still tasty. I liked the pizza more than the scallops. For an appetizer I had the PEI mussels with spicy sausage, tomato &amp; fennel. It was delicious &amp; was served with a side of uberly DELICIOUS bread. I also had the poached pear salad with candied walnut &amp; thought that it was perfectly seasoned and well balanced with sweet, sour &amp; salty. For my drink, I had the cucumber lavender rickey (Hendrick&#39;s Gin, Domaine de Canton Ginger Liqueur, Cucumber, Basil, House Made Lavender Sour). This cocktail was refreshing &amp; yummy.

We first attempted to eat here on a Friday evening but they had just closed 20 minutes before we got there. One of the chefs David expressed his apologies that we missed it and packed up some warm bread and their house made burrata for us to take with us in case we had trouble finding somewhere to eat. We figured at that point this was a pretty special restaurant. 

We came back the following day around 530, and shared the house salad, Caesar salad, maple braised pork belly, meatball sliders and the short rib pizza which all were delicious. David also sent out a meat and cheese plate for us that was absolutely fantastic. Two of our party had glasses of wine and they came back out and refilled them free of charge. It was the type of service that made you feel like you&#39;d been going to the restaurant for years, pretty amazing. 

We shared a cannoli for dessert but I can&#39;t recall what kind, it was delicious though. Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot, it was an amazing experience and the staff was just wonderful."

The dark wooden interior is dimly lit and has a pub-like atmosphere. The service was solid and I liked my standard kale salad. 

My husband wanted to eat here as it was one of the higher rated Italian restaurants in Denver. Let me start off by saying my husband is very, very particular about his pizza, his favorite being New Haven, CT style.  He grew up in New England where waiting an hour in the winter cold to enjoy Pepe&#39;s and Sally&#39;s pizza was normal. That being said, he was very unsatisfied with his pizza. He said the crust wasn&#39;t crispy or chewy and was a little soggy in the center and the toppings were not flavorful. 

If you crave good pizza or Italian food in Denver, I highly recommend Panzano&#39;s. We ordered room service many times while staying at Hotel Monaco and their pizza was always served hot and crispy, fresh from the oven."

They can add cheese or meat at your request too. It was very good and we all enjoyed it. For dinner, I had the veggie panini.  It was a small portion and I&#39;d say that was typical for all the entrées. The smaller portion is, however, reflected in the price as everything seemed fairly affordable to me.  I probably couldn&#39;t name a veggie in the panini. It was pretty unremarkable as was the potato salad that came with it. I don&#39;t recall beer on the menu but I&#39;m sure it was there.

The waitress had told us it would be about an hour wait, so we to walk around the area. About 20 minutes later, we got a call that they had a table for us. Hooray!

The place has a nice atmosphere, but still keeping it pretty casual. We ordered the Lobster Fonduta to start. My friend got the lamb meatball Panini and I got the House Sausage Pizza. The lobster fonduta was amazing! The dip was very cheesy and had lots of lobster meat in it. I almost wanted to order another one... I got to try a bite of my friend&#39;s Panini and it was definitely decent. The portion of the meat was pretty big and the bread was well-toasted. For my house sausage pizza, I loved the cheese on it. The only thing that I picked out on the pizza was the chili peppers and that&#39;s because I can&#39;t eat very spicy. They give you a chili infused olive oil to use on the pizza, which is quite nice. 

I ordered the bread pudding dessert because everyone seems to love it and now I know why. The edges of the bread pudding were crispy but the insides were moist and warm. It is topped with a scoop of ice cream and has butterscotch drizzled over. IT WAS SO GOOD! Be sure to save some stomach space for this amazing dessert!"

osteria-marco-denver,Rich M.,tSSVTDquqBIfk2j4fVeANw,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,1,1,22,439,UPt_Czy6gZ3jjk1W50Z9WA,3.0,2015-10-06,"Upon a recently trip to downtown Denver, CO for a conference, I jumped on Yelp for a restaurant recommendation and based on reviews, I ended up at Osteria Marco.  Several of the reviewers said that it was a cozy, comfortable place with good italian/american food....so I walked a few blocks and below is an honest overview of my experience.

The restaurant is located on a nice, busy street (Larimer Square) with a lot of restaurants, bars and stores.  It looks a lot like Little Italy in NYC or Philly during the holidays, with rows of lights that are strung over the entire block (see pics from others). One nice thing about the block is most restaurants have outdoor seating, so it&#39;s a nice option during this time of year (late Sept/early Oct) to catch a bite, while people- watching.

Upon entering the restaurant a few steps off the street, I was greeted by the host who asked if I had a reservation (@6pm).  I didn&#39;t, so she said that I could wait 20 minutes for an outside table, 15 minutes for a booth inside or grab a seat at the bar without a wait, so I chose the bar.  I proceeded downstairs to the restaurant/bar area and grabbed a seat at a beautiful, spacious bar (@ 20 seats).  The bar has two TV&#39;S (with sports on each), nice selection of liquors and micro brews (bottled and on tap).  The bartender was friendly (provided me with a glass of ice water upon introducing himself) and gave me a drink and dinner menu.  Remembering that others recommended a few food items, I ordered the Burrata  (appetizer) and Short Rib (main), remembering that their twist on Burrata is &#34;ricotta&#34; inside fresh mozzarella, which was intriguing, so I had to try.

The Burrata arrived with a few slices of warm, sliced, toasted bread, drizzled with olive oil.  It was delicious and I really enjoyed spreading the fresh mozz/ricotta filling on the bread.  That being said, it was overly salty...I mean REALLY salty.  I thought it was good, but just beware of the saltiness before ordering.  The Short Rib arrived a few minutes after I finished the Burrata and the overall presentation was nice.  The short rib was very tender and had a great corn mixture side.  As tender and delicious as the short rib was, again, it was OVERLY salty.  In fact, as I finished the meal, I started to feel quessey and couldn&#39;t stop drinking water throughout the meal (3 glasses).  I have eaten in restaurants all over the world and expect my food to be seasoned properly, but the salt used here on both dishes distracted from the quality of both.  Maybe this is an anomaly, but I owe it to  you to describe my experience, both good and bad.

I think the restaurant is a good choice for a quick bite, maybe for pizza, micro brew or other items.  If I went back to Denver, I would try another restaurant, but wouldn&#39;t hesitate to give it another try...maybe I would have a better experience.

Let me know what you think?"

I had surgery 2 weeks ago and have numerous dietary restrictions.  The waiter last night was beyond accommodating tweaking the menu to meet my special dietary needs.  I could not have been more pleased with the food or service.

I had a most delicious tomato bisque with a unique sour taste.  It was cold last night downtown Denver and this delicious flavorful soup hit the spot.  Also enjoyed flawless Polenta with a delicious tomato sauce.

The reserve wine list is exceptional.  We enjoyed a couple of elite Italian wines, properly derved and decanted (as they should be.)

My dinner associates immensely enjoyed the meals.  It was a lovely experience and a restaurant I will most definitely return to in Denver."

I was told that they start filling up about 7 pm but because I was there at 5:45, they said they could give me a table so long as I was done by 7. Okay, no problem: I was in town on business and dining solo. The server was helpful in providing some advice on the menu. He brought my glass of wine quickly but unfortunately the &#34;salumi&#34; I ordered as a starter took a ridiculous amount of time. I waited over 20 minutes for an appetizer when they were not yet busy. That&#39;s a problem..... Perhaps they could have brought a little bread? 

Ambiance is nice, though. So the long wait was less bothersome than it might have otherwise been. 

Anyway, my ciccioli eventually arrived and it was tasty. Although.... $8 for a tiny plate of pulled pork and some bread crust?  Uh oh... I mean it was okay as far as pulled pork but nothing special. 

So for my entree, I took my server&#39;s suggestion and went for the rabbit.  There was another excessive delay on serving my main: by then I was getting a little annoyed, given the place was only at one third customer capacity by that point. What&#39;s up with the service? 

The rabbit was tender and had a rich, hearty flavor. I did think it might have been better balanced with a few more greens. Still, it was good. 

Overall, a decent experience but I am baffled by the reviews that describe this place as &#39;amazing.&#39;  I would give it 3.8 to 4.2 stars. I might return but I would be in no hurry. Total price for one with 15 percent tip: $46."

Our favorites are the burrata and mussels and they have never disappointed, until our latest visit on October 28. I am sad to say both the mussels AND the burrata (it feels like blasphemy to even say this) were not up to Osteria&#39;s usual standards. There were a few very fishy mussels and not enough broth (which is the best part!). And the burrata was not it&#39;s normal delicious combo of creamy, slightly salty deliciousness (it was bland and firmer than usual) and we were given only two decent slices of charred bread with a couple pieces of crust to eat with the cheese. Let me put it this way, usually once the burrata arrives at our table, my husband and I devour it in silence as quickly as we can- this time we ate slowly AND my husband offered me the last bite. The food wasn&#39;t BAD per se, if we didn&#39;t know what Osteria was really capable of. I really hope that whatever happened that night was a fluke because we LOVE this place!!"

Entree: Rabbit meat over mashed potatoes - JUST OKAY. The rabbit meat was not as tender as I thought it would be. It almost tasted like chicken, but tougher. Not as good as I expected.

Entree: Lamb meatballs over grits - JUST DECENT. This dish is served as 2 very large meatballs in a red sauce. Not as good as I expected.

Drinks: Colette beer (fruity) and Hoss (highly recommended). 

Ambiance: Very hip and trendy. Make sure to make a reservation on weekends. If not, try to go early and find good walk-in tables near the bar (areas with stool seating).

Service: Very polite and good service. There&#39;s a HOT male bartender!!!

We ordered the crab, corn and asparagus pizza. That pizza was okay. I was hoping for it to be thin and crispy but instead it was thin and soggy. So it was hard to eat it was more like a fork and knife kind of pizza. The chefs appetizer plate was a nice touch. Perfect for 2. It came with a few slices of meats, different cheeses, bread and crisps and a yummy jam.

My only suggestion is to fed the chickens more, other than that, thank you for the awesome pizza and keep it up!"

Crust is too breast and sauce is not enough. Inconsistent from one pizza to the next. Delivery drivers usually expect a tip even after putting a tip on the bill to start.

I ordered a large order of pizzas, 7 to be exact, for an end of season party at my house.  My only complaint, they arrived 15 minutes earlier then I was anticipating them.  However, the pizzas were all very good and all of my guests raved at how good they were.

We probably order at least 2 to 3 times a month from Marcos and I have to say the inconsistencies that we experienced early on have gotten better.  Orders are correct and the pizzas good.  

I will also add the delivery people working now are very friendly and much better then they had when they first opened."

Upon eating, our cheesy bread was really good and not as greasy as the other chains like dominos or papa johns. 
Pizza- we got a large deluxe uno and a small thin crust garden. I LOVE the toppings! They put as many toppings on as I expect and hope for, and I love that they are literally fresh--the bell peppers had a crunch to them and sausage were like mini meatball size. Thin crust was pretty good. We will be trying them again."

I made the order online and it was a quick, seamless process.  My pizza was ready faster than advertised.  Upon consumption, the pizza had good flavor and I liked the texture of the crust.  I do think they were a bit cheap with spreading out the ingredients though as the crust with no toppings on it was 1-11/2 inches all the way around.  Seems a bit cheap.

Finally the third time I said that I had been on hold and the girl had the snottiest attitude. She told me that it was going to take another thirty minutes for the order to get to my house and that I could either wait or cancel it.

I called to order a pizza for carry out via phone cause I knew that they take a long time from previous times I tried to order. I was told that it would be ready in 30 minutes which was great. I got there half an hour later only to wait an additional 35 minutes to get my order and walk out of the door, not to mention people there who were also complaining about how long they were waiting which was weird considering the amount of staff working there.
1 hour is an awfully long time to wait for a pizza, and yes I do understand that place to get busy at times but the customer is not the one that should pay for your bad time management. No matter how good your food is, making a customer wait for more than they expect at least would leave them pissed off and not enjoying it at all.
Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t end there, once I got home I was not pleasant to find out that there was barley any tomato sauce used just cheese and dough."

Thank you, Los Carboncitos. 

Boyfriend wanted Mexican food after a long morning of grocery shopping for lunch so we dropped by this very, very hole-in-the-wall place on our way home. It didn&#39;t disappoint. We actually came early in the afternoon and it still had a decent number of customers - sure sign of good food. The restaurant was also clean and well-kept, despite being in the strip mall. Before we even sat down, our waitress had chips on the table along with five different salsas. PSA: don&#39;t mess with the orange one. It packs a lot of spice, even for someone who grew up eating spicy stuff like me. All of them were great though, super flavorful and fresh!

I ordered a smothered chicken burrito and my boyfriend had four tacos with pork, beef and chicken. They had our food out under 10 minutes, which was impressive. The tacos are street-style, so you don&#39;t get that pointless clump of shredded iceberg lettuce - just cilantro, onions and perfectly seasoned meat. From the few bites I tried, they were solid. The burrito was the best ever. Our waitress recommended the chicken and I wasn&#39;t completely sold, simply because I hate dry, shredded chicken in Mexican food, but this burrito was perfection. The chicken was perfectly good, there was a good ratio of rice and beans, the guacamole melted into the gravy... I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t think about this burrito multiple times at work today.

I&#39;d come back here in a heartbeat. The best part about this place is that now I&#39;ve tried it and had a really good experience, I want to eat everything on the menu. If you&#39;re a Mexican food fan, this place is a must."

Can&#39;t Stop, Won&#39;t Stop!

This is DEFINITELY a hole in the wall, I went alone at night, and had to fight my way past bikers in the parking lot with their boom boom music going and their leather chaps a&#39;flapping.  I&#39;m SO not kidding!!

But it is SO worth it!

Based on you lovely Yelpers&#39; photographs, I could not resist trying their Enchiladas Mole.  And I&#39;m SO glad I got them!  Shredded chicken tossed with their very chocolatey and definitely spicy Mole sauce, rolled in Corn Tortillas and topped with more Mole sauce, crema, and queso. Que Rico!

And if you&#39;ve been reading my Yelps lately, you know that I am on a Taco Kick. So of course I had to try some.  I ordered an Al Pastor and a Chorizo up front, and as soon as I sat down to wait for my food (I ordered ToGo this time) I saw that they had Lengua.  WELL BRING ME ONNA THOSE TOO!!  I scarfed that one down in 20 seconds while waiting for my order.  Again with the awesome Green Salsa!!   At Los Carboncitos, you&#39;ll get 4 house salsas.  Verde with jalapeño and cilantro (Similar to a chimichurri), Avocado Verde, smoky orange and holy hella hot red.  They&#39;re all solid.  As were the rest of the tacos, and the Al Pastor had my requisite Pineapple, so yay!

Everyone was very friendly, and I even teased the cashier because she said she had never tried Lengua.  I told her next time I&#39;m there, she better have tried it!! So when y&#39;all go in, make sure to ask if she&#39;s tried Lengua yet!!

A lot of places that serve good street style tacos usually don&#39;t have a full menu to compliment them and leave you with limited options, well not here. 

They have a slew of house specialties along with all the classics you&#39;ve come to know and love. 

They start you off with some house made tortilla chips and salsa, before we get much further you need to know something about the salsas and sauces here.....

They don&#39;t play around, if it looks hot, it probably is. This is one of the few places that satisfies my heat levels with the delicious bevy of sauces they bring to the table. They may be a little spicy for most, but if you like the heat, you&#39;ll be right at home. 

I had a sample taco order, one shrimp, one carnitas and one Barbacoa. All were great and they have avocado on the menu, a lot of places don&#39;t and it&#39;s a shame.

We&#39;ve been in Colorado now for about a year and a half and had yet to find a place with as great of food, authentic, well seasoned and honestly made as our favorite, Casa de Leon, down south in Texas..... Until now. 

A-mah-zing! So many reasons why: 

(1) Family owned... Super friendly and laid back. Gotta love supporting local businesses. 

(2) Fresh, house made chips... Yes, house made! Not greasy, not too thick and def not stale.

(3) The place has character... Def a Hole in the wall, a bit of sketch... but didn&#39;t feel unsafe and everything was really clean and well kept.

(4) Five salsas.... Each really yummy and if you&#39;ve got a taste for spice and a touch if bite, these salsas won&#39;t disappoint. 

(5) Authentic, fresh food. I ordered the Verde Enchiladas. The verde sauce was so good, I could have had it solo. My guy ordered five tacos of different varieties. Radio silence for a good 10 minutes. Smile to smile, we traded bites and the horded the rest, lol. 

We will definitely be back. No alcohol at the moment, but margaritas are coming soon to my new favorite Mexican place in Colorado.

You can tell how family oriented this restaurant is by just looking around and seeing the kids pitching in bussing the tables. Our waitress was bubbly and sweet and made great recommendations. They immediately served our table with fresh corn chips along with five different variety of salsas. The bright orange one was crazy spicy and my favorite! 

The menu was bright, filled with vivid pictures of each entree. The guac was fresh, cold and was filled with tons of colorful peppers. (Only $4) I ordered the el pastor alhambre meal with the homemade corn tortillas. These corn tortillas were the BEST I ever had! Seriously. They were delicious and not grainy like most places. Sometimes corn tortillas can have a taste so overpowering that takes away from the flavor of the meat. Not here! 

This place is definitely one of the TRUE authentic Mexican restaurants in Denver and is worth a try. You won&#39;t be disappointed with the service, prices or your meal-ESPECIALLY if you are a hot sauce enthusiast!"

I had a huarache with steak and bacon, and added two scrambled eggs on top. My wife had carboncitos, which are basically small tostadas with steak, cheese, and tomatoes. 

The food was muy sabroso (delicious)!

This is like taking a step into Mexico for sure. The menu is in English but on a busy Sunday you&#39;d better have some conversational Spanish experience or you&#39;ll find yourself in a culture gap. It made us want to go back to Latin America.

Definitely a great spot tucked away just north of 6th Ave on Sheridan. (East side of the road tucked back in a shopping center.)"

I would recommend just about anything on their menu, my bf and I frequent this place almost weekly, it&#39;s our guilty pleasure after coming from the gym. The tacos are my favorite, I love the tripa (tripe), chorizo (sausage) and their al pastor is the best!! My bf loves their carnitas and al pastor as well, he also really enjoys their carboncitos with the al pastor. Their flan and churros (with or without crema) are also delicious - all home made. Their corn tortillas are homemade and that makes a big difference too. They also have a lot of great salsas to try, but be careful - the red ones are REALLY SPICY! They serve menudo on the weekends - also really good if you like menudo. To top it off, the restaurant is family owned and their customer service is awesome, they always come over to greet us and make sure everything is good and really make us feel welcomed."

My friend and I were debating between Vietnamese and Taiwanese dumplings. Well... the dumpling place had closed, and so I pulled out my trusty yelp for more options... 

LOS CARBONCITOS. I had gone to the northern location a few weeks ago with a bunch of other yelpers on a Taco Tour and remembered that it was DELICIOSO.

This spot might scare you off at night. It is sort of hidden in a strip mall that looked kinda shady at night. But I was undeterred because I had taco on the brain. My friend is a picky (let&#39;s say, unadventurous) eater, but I told her that there were no strange ingredients, just delicious flavors. We both ordered three tacos: carnitas, bistec, and al pastor. With cheese and onions. We didn&#39;t talk for about 10 minutes because we were way too busy eating. I prefer mine with just a few drops of the orange salsa and a bit of the mint green salsa. 

I&#39;ve yet to try any of their other offerings, but I can not imagine that they would disappoint. The fajitas look fabulous and enough to feed a family of four. I&#39;m saving a star until I try some of their other food. For their tacos, definitely a 5 star joint (unless you&#39;re looking to impress someone with atmosphere. Then you should stay away). 

To sum up:
1) Super delicious. 
2) Friendly service.
3) Cheap! (each taco was $2 b/c we added cheese)
4) not shi shi. at all. but clean."

I went at 10:45 am on a Sunday and there was no breakfast menu even though they open at 9:00 am. The salsa served with the chips was very good. It&#39;s sneaky hot but very good. Also, my server was very nice and on top of it. I had the carnitas and pollo tacos and both meats were very dry. Also, the cilantro was very dry. It definitely was not chopped fresh that day or in the last 2 days. The tacos were maybe the worst I&#39;ve ever had at a traditional sit down Mexican restaurant. The place was also slow. Not even half full on a Sunday. I&#39;m sure they have many things on the menu that are very good. My tacos weren&#39;t one of them. My tacos were a 1 but I&#39;ll give the place a 3 for the sake of the salsa, service, the fact I assume it&#39;s a small family business and because I assume there are better menu items then what I received. There are so many great restaurants in Denver so I doubt I&#39;ll ever be back."

The interior is clean and warm and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Jaime, our server even took my wife&#39;s barrage of questions in stride.

The restaurant looks filthy and smells like old kitchen grease, it&#39;s walls looks confirm the smell.
First of all let me tell you that I am born and raised in Mexico City, so I know what I&#39;m talking about on how Mexican food is supposed to taste and look like.
Yesterday, my wife and I ordered tortilla soup and it was terrible, the broth was watery and tasted like nothing; the &#34;tortilla&#34;soup had a few tortilla chips inside. This was really a tomato tea served in a bowl garnished a few tortilla chips. While we ordered our food we asked for an extra order of cream and chopped onion to go with it, since we like to add more of this ingredients, the cream and onions came after we finished the soup, we were trying to get the attention of the waitress but our soup/tea was getting cold so we had to eat it as is.
Don&#39;t get tricked into getting tacos al pastor, you will see a picture of how they are supposed to look like but you will get something different in looks and taste. Their argument is that they slice the meat and finish cooking it on the grill, but how about the flavor? That is not supposed to change even if you cheat and finish cooking the meat on the grill. My wife and I ordered two tacos al pastor each. Just by looking at them, we decided to try the meat first and we each ate two pieces of meat; again, to try them just to give them the benefit of the doubt. Great mistake, it tasted like poor quality pork meat marinated in something with red pepper flakes. Both of us were starving however we didn&#39;t had the nerve to eat the tacos. Long story short, the tacos al pastor are at best poor quality pork tacos.
I also asked for two shrimp tacos. The shrimp in the tacos tasted like when you get a lobster that has been inside of a fish tank for a while and the fish tank hasn&#39;t been cleaned ever, just exactly like that.
Maybe the worst shrimp I&#39;ve ever been served.
If you want real Mexican food go to any other of the many options Denver has to offer but this place."

The salsa selection was amazing.  The menu was very unique for a Mexican restaurant, they had a few items I&#39;d never seen before such as Huercha&#39;s and Alambre&#39;s (sp?).  My girlfriend tried the latter, which is basically like a mess of peppers, onions, meats, and melted cheese that you scoop onto your corn tortillas.  Basically like a taco version of a Philly Cheese Steak.  Delish!

I went with the Torta Carboncito and two Al Pastor tacos because I was unsure how big the torta would be.  Well... it was about twice as big as I was counting on... not that I&#39;m complaining!   The taco&#39;s were amazing and the pork was well marinated and seasoned.   

My only beef with this place is that they didn&#39;t have black beans (refried only), but that&#39;s a minor complaint at best.  For a Hole-in-the-Wall Mexican Restaurant I&#39;m really not sure how it could get much better.  I&#39;ll be back!"

Was here with Hubs, on SUNDAY October 2nd 2011.  Time was 1305hrs for LUNCH.

Hmm, how shall I start this.  Okies, when we arrived, it happen a group of Mexican singers also arrived at the FAITHFUL time.  Perhaps it was a BIG MISTAKE, in which that I feel did and might deter on what Hub thinks about this establishment.

While the BLARING Mexican singers making their rounds singing, I feel the sunken kind of feeling coz this made our lunch &#34;date&#34; when sour.  Perhaps it was due to our mistake too.  Okies, here was what we ordered that afternoon :

Hubs order : Burrito De Bistec ($5.75) + $1 coz Hubs wants his burrito to be smothered with GREEN Sauce, and 3 Tacos ($1.50 each)

While I opt for Pescado ($2.00), Camaron ($2.00) and Tripa ($1.75) Tacos.  I wanted to try that &#34;MEAT&#34; dish I was eyeing for, but because the weather was FREAKING HOT, I decide for Tacos instead.

The service was prompt and efficent.  The bathroom when I have the chance to go, was also kept clean though I can sense aka smell the BIG dosage of CLOROX fills the air.

When our entrees arrived, I think due to the miscommunication due to the BLARING &#34;noise&#34; from the Mexican singers, I think either Hubs order was messed up or either the waitstaff cant hear the proper order from Hubs.

Hubs did not fancy the burrito he has.  He like his Tacos though, but when I realized he &#34;accidentally consumed&#34; something he was NOT supposed to eat.  Oh well, Oh God please forgive us aka Hubs.

I like the Tacos I order coz for one, it came piping hot.  The flavor of Camaron and Pescado is there.  That goes for the Tripa.  YES, the Tacos are still on the small side for our taste bud.  Both Hubs and I still like the 4 different kind of sauces.  This time around MAN, that ORANGE colored sauce, was indeed FREAKING hot, make me SWEAT kind of HOT aka Glowing.  Hubs also like the Chips and Salsa too.

Between 3 to 3.5 stars for this establishment.  If its not because of the Mexican singers, I think Hubs might like this establishment more.  I hope and pray the next time I am here with Hubs or with my other friends, there wont be any other &#34;distraction&#34; that can &#34;spoiled&#34; our appetite."

Service can be a little slow, only because there&#39;s only one or two waitresses. However, why would you rush a good meal anyways?

As a standard, chips and salsa are served, though I&#39;m particularly fond of their salsa. It&#39;s super easy to get addicted to, so restrain yourself from getting full off that before your meal.

The usually bring out a variety salsa plate  and lime for your meal and chips, which is awesome!

I usually have the tasty al pastor and bistec tacos with a wonderfully chunky side of guacamole. Also, their corn tortillas are home-made and delicious! 

I totally recommend this place for anyone who has tasted real Mexican food or at least appreciates authenticity."

Service was friendly and efficient (two servers tag teaming all tables).

And the food was really good.  The salsa offered an nice selection from med spicy to very spicy.  The tacos on homemade corn tortillas were all excellent, with Al Pastor being my favorite.  Burritos are huge and tasty, really can&#39;t go wrong with one of those.

There are many other interesting menu options that look worth a visit back in the future."

 I have ordered several other menu items and they were all pretty unappetizing. If you are looking for good service avoid this place as well. I went here with 2 friends and all of our orders came out seperatly about 10 minutes apart from each other. One of my friends&#39; order was completely forgotten. By time we finished our meals (well 2 of us got to eat) we had to wait another 10 minutes before the last dish was brought out. At this point we asked the server to make it a to go order because we did not want to sit at the shaky table anymore. About10 minutes later we got our check and had to go through another lengthy process to pay our bill. In addition, there was chopped up hot dog in my friends entree and when we asked our server what it was she said chorizo. It was not chorizo, it was blatantly hot dog."

First of all, can&#39;t somebody come out in the parking lot for 10 minutos and sweep up all the broken glass? I appreciate &#34;hole-in-the-wall&#34; but risking flat tires for tacos? not so much...

Anyway, the food. They bring out chips and 5 different salsas. They are all delicious but 2 of them were too hot for me. The house salsa is the best by far. 

I had an Al Pastor burrito because so many yelpers had bragged on it and my GF had one carnitas taco and one al pastor taco with a side of beans. 

They must have been having a bad day or serving what was cooked at lunch for dinner.

The best thing served was the beans which were delicious. 

My Al Pastor burrito featured a store bought tortilla packed with plain dry rice and tiny, dry,  hard nuggets of &#34;meat.&#34; For every ten quarter inch cubes of way-overdone pellets of pork there was one larger pellet of pure disgusting fat. It was horrible. No sauce inside, no sauce outside (smothered 1.00 extra) and a tiny sad pile of lettuce next to it. I know that it was microwaved because the tortilla was flaky and dry and I could barely cut through it with the steak knife provided. Everyone knows what a microwaved tortilla is like. It&#39;s like leather. Imagine you sit down, you&#39;re impressed by the chips and salsa and the vibe in general (this ain&#39;t my first taco rodeo) then a microwaved, crispy-in-all-the-wrong-ways dog food burrito arrives. Horrible.

Moving on, my girl said the carnitas was alright but she had the same notions as me with the al pastor. Don&#39;t know if you know this, but all pastor means &#34;way of the shepherd&#34; and it means the meat is stacked and cooked over fire on a spit like gyros or similar. It doesn&#39;t mean cut your meat into BB size pieces then char until tasteless and hard to chew. 

Overall, bad. really bad. Right now my hatred for this place is burning like a thousand suns. I would rather cross a desert for a thousand years on a lonely road lined with the impaled heads of my forefathers on posts to mark the way, than ever eat in this shithole again. 

Two stars for the chips and salsa which were great. Wish I would have stopped there."

According to Carboncitos, it&#39;s a flat, oblong piece of fried masa, topped with ingredients straight from heaven. I am not sure how they import said ingredients from heaven, maybe it has something to do with NAFTA? I&#39;m not complaining.

On the advice of my enthusiastic server, I chose the Cuban: Insane. No hyperbole. I literally went crazy.

We brought home a taco al pastor, pechuga borracha (chicken breast with bacon, onion, and other flavors), and a huarache con bistec &amp; nopales.  Every ingredient was delicious, from the tortillas to the meat, to the sauces and salsas.

I also love their &#34;build your own&#34; chicken tortilla soup. They bring out about 6 toppings (jalapeños, cilantro, green onions, tortilla strips, cheese, sour cream) and you can add them to your liking.

I got three tacos (two veggies and one beer battered), but was only able to finish two. My favorite was the veggie taco with the melted cotija cheese. My bf&#39;s favorite taco was the one with pork and potatoes.

Proved to be an amazing decision made by yours truly. 

North County is a Denver restaurant that&#39;s filled to the brim with that San Diego soul. This is the kind of hybrid cuisine that Denver is starving for. The food here was so good. I got myself a medley of tacos. Their fish tacos were great. Such an interesting combo of flavors ranging from the sweet mango slices on top to the sneakily spicy salsa. Their al pastor tacos were pretty delicious as well. 

Highlight to me was the Carne Asada fries. Now, it might just be my wild cravings talking here, but I probably could have eaten this entire appetizer by myself. And it was only common courtesy to my dining partners that I didn&#39;t just scoop up that whole damn dish onto my plate right then and there and just buried my face in it. So good. Oh man my mouth is watering as I am typing this I need to finish this review quick before those cravings start back up.

Our server for the night was super nice and friendly. I believe Adrienne was her name and she was definitely one of the best parts of the experience. A+ grade to her for being a great server! Also, the location and restaurant are so cool. It&#39;s right there around Hanger 2, and it just feels like you&#39;re driving into a whole new world once you get a little close by.

North County came highly recommended for the fish tacos and drinks so I stopped by with a group of friends and wasn&#39;t disappointed.

If you&#39;re into alcoholic sodas, they have a few here for around $6. I ordered the Paloma which had some grapefruit flavor and had me wanting another.

I ordered a few of the original crispy fish tacos ($4) and they were packed with flavor! The mango salsa was a good combination of spicy and sweet mixes with the perfectly breaded fish.

Let me just warn you, the Mucho Macho Nachos with steak ($16) are HUGE! You get what you pay for on this one. I really wanted carne asada fries but when I saw how large this plate was I ordered the nachos. The server was able to sub for the topping so I could get the carne asada I wanted too.

My friend told me about the grilled oysters ($2.50 ea.) and they were so delish I needed more! The bacon and cheese cover the seafood taste but add flavor.

My buddy ordered the seafood boil ($19) special and it was so small for the price! The flavor really wasn&#39;t there for a nearly $20 dish. I would skip it and go straight to the fish tacos.

I&#39;ll be back for sure!"

When you see the massive hangar/storage facility, you know you&#39;re there! North County has dog-friendly outdoor seating, as well as a charming interior. Having spent a fair amount of time in &#34;north county&#34; San Diego, it&#39;s kind of funny to have this theme be a &#34;thing.&#34; But I&#39;ll be damned if it isn&#39;t close to impossible to find good fish tacos in Denver. Until now.

The service here was great, though unconventional. Server took our order, checked on us, etc. Food and drinks were brought out by different people, however.

We ordered two Drunken Burros, their boozy sodas. They arrived 5 minutes apart, even though they&#39;re bottled (maybe they&#39;re making them, capping them, and serving them as they go?) and both were perfectly, perfectly flat. Decent, though the serrano flavor was lacking--I&#39;ll be excited to make my own version at home, and at $10 a pop, they&#39;re not really worth it. Docking a star for the dranks.

The pound of peel and eat shrimp were cooked perfectly, and seasoned so well! The tacos were fantastic, actually. The al pastor flavor is on point, the ancho brisket was to die for, and the swordfish tacos were so fresh and amazing. I&#39;ll be back for the fish tacos, for sure."

-$12 for an unseasoned / no-flavor hamburger was disappointing.    
-The mussles from the mussels and fries appetizer were VERY overcooked.  They were terrible and we sent them back to the kitchen.  
-There were a lot of bugs flying around inside that were very annoying.
-A Mexican resturant that charges for chips and salsa???  
-Music was very loud and made it impossible to carry on a conversation at the tabe.  Waitress could not hear us when we ordered.

Pros:
-The food came out fast

Save your money and go someplace with better food and ambiance."

My favorite here was the Grapefruit Margarita, simply delicious.   The four of us chowed down the Carne Asada fries like no other.  By the time the tacos came, I was a little tipsy from my second margarita.  Not sure if it was due to the alcoholic influence, the tacos didn&#39;t taste too special.

My husband and I went with a friend for dinner here since it was recommended to us by one of my husband&#39;s coworkers.  We all ordered an adult beverage and were completely satisfied with them - the bartender makes a good Gin and Tonic. 

Our waitress, Angela, was so fun - the chef could have spit on our food and we&#39;d probably still enjoy out time there. The wait staff was on par - we sat outside and the older couple at the next table started to get cold, so the staff brought them each a blanket! Who the Fu** does that???   It was amazing!!  

We were all very satisfied with our food - except for the Ceviche. After reading all the reviews about it - we had to try it! The flavor was great but the octopus was chewy. But of course the amazing staff made us new ceviche without the octopus. We had the Mussels &amp; Fries, if you like mussels you&#39;ll like this dish!

What we ate: 
Fried oysters - OMG so good Cooked perfectly and the breading was delicious
 
Carne Asada Fries - what is this magic?  The fries were so crispy that they held up to the cheese explosion on the plate. We were also happy that we had extra fries from our oysters to sop up that cheesy mess!

Slow Roasted Tequila Duck Quesadilla - who ever decided to put rice on a quesadilla was a genius and deserves a beer. The dipping sauces weren&#39;t super flavorful but everything inside that heavenly HOMEMADE (!!!!) flour tortilla more than made up for that.  

Chips &amp; Salsa - chips are bomb and we could have eaten the salsa all night long.

I had the duck confit that comes with sweet potato hash, corn succotash, eggs, and fresh fruit.

What&#39;s wrong with Thursday Tacos instead of Tuesday Tacos? Well, I was craving some Mexican food and I have heard really great things about North County. I am so glad I decided to come here. 

I called ahead of time to check the wait time and they said it will be around 30-45 minutes and I was able to make a reservation over the phone. When I arrived, I only waited about 5 minutes before my boyfriend and I were sat down at a spacious table. There are plenty of parking in the lot and this place is super chic and modern.

I ordered a grapefruit margarita which was rim-coated with delicious spicy mexican powder. The drink itself was very refreshing and not too strong and the waiter shakes it and pours it at the table for you. My boyfriend got the paloma soda which is also a grapefruit based soda. He really enjoyed it as well.

We got the carne asada fries with a side of pork green chile for $1. Omg it was one of the BEST carne asada fries I have ever had. The perfectly cooked carne and salsa topped with guac and cheese. Omg so good. For the main course, I ordered 3 tacos. The duck confit, pulled pork, and carne asada. They also give you two types of chili. The red is FIRE. it was crazy so beware. The green one is an avocado based one that is absolutely delicious but if you eat too much, it can get really spicy. I would caution you to put too much.

It was flavorful and had incredible toppings.  All the tacos were very filling and the best part...the tortilla was built to withstand the weight of all the deliciousness (I hate when they break in half mid bite).

Atmosphere was chill and comfortable and the outdoor patio has misters to enjoy the outside on a hot day. They also had a decent Margarita which was served in a shaker which always adds a little theatrical measure to getting your drink!"

I got one of the homemade bottled cocktails (something with grapefruit I think) and it was really tasty, not too sweet with the perfect amount if tart. 
Started off with some chips and salsa. So yummy. I secretly judge a place by their chips and salsa even before I&#39;ve had the actual food, so I was impressed. 
I ordered the vegetarian tacos (dirty rajas and queso a la plancha). Both were tasty! I really liked how vegetarian friendly this place was. 
Defiantly not legit &#34;taco shop&#34; Mexican food but I was pretty impressed by their modern take on Mexican food."

For appetizers we had the Shrimp and Octopus Ceviche and the Carne Asada Fries. Both were very very good but the Ceviche was the better of the two. For my main course I had the Ancho Chile Beef Brisket Tortas w/pepper jack cheese and fries on the side. The tortas came with this chili dipping sauce and the server said it was their version of a French Dip. It was pretty good but not great. The fries came with a jalapeño ketchup that was phenomenal. My wife got the Do It You Way Hamburger and fries. She really enjoyed it but I thought it was also good but not great. Our friend got a burrito version of the Carne Asada Fries (couldn&#39;t find it on the menu). Much like the fries it was also very very good. With her burrito she got a Crispy Beer Battered Taco and I have to say this was my favorite thing we all ordered. If you didn&#39;t catch on, we were definitely passing each other&#39;s food around the table. The place is very trendy and modern with great service. There are a ton of other very intriguing menu items so I think it&#39;s safe to say we&#39;ll be back!"

It&#39;s a South of the border casual dining restaurant with a very vivid and open atmosphere and reasonable prices. Two things that specifically caught my attention, was the  cool wall paper posted all over the restaurant with an overview shot of a populated beach and the garage style opening at the front of the restaurant (connected to excellent patio seating options) that gave an openness feel to every table; the openness really set in when we got a full view of the beautiful sunset towards the end of our meal! 

Before I get to the food and drink, I must say that the service we received was some of the best I have had the pleasure of experiencing! Our server, Jesse, was a rockstar! She accommodated our every need, was super personable, and gave us multiple recommendations  for what to order that were all splendid!! And the service itself was incredibly fast, each entree we ordered magically appeared after only a matter of minutes. I usually get through a couple of drinks before the meal ends and I hadn&#39;t even finished my first by the time our appetizers and entrees had come out, which as I&#39;ll get to towards the end of the review, was the reason we had margs and shots as our desert! Haha 

One of the more unique features they offered for drinks were bottled alcoholic combinations of tequila or vodka mixed with other tasty ingredients. I got the Drunken Burro that was made with vodka, homemade ginger beer, mango and a Serrano pepper. The flavor was divine with a refreshing fruity taste followed by a very subtle spiciness from the pepper! My girlfriend had the Paloma which she really enjoyed  and I honestly would have tried any of their other bottled concoctions. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! 

We started with oysters that were great and could tell they were quality! We followed with the shrimp and octopus ceviche which was one of the only items we ordered that we weren&#39;t to impressed with because it lacked serious flavor. Ceviche is supposed to have that citrus acidic flavor but neither of those tastes were apparent, forcing us to order tons of lime to zest it up a bit. The shrimp and octopus were quality but again, needed to be seasoned better. 

With so many delicious options, we decided to share multiple items, tapas style haha here&#39;s an overview: 

Mussels with French fries: the mussels were cooked perfectly and the beer sauce it was soaked in, although it tasted more like white wine and garlic sauce, bursted with tons of flavor. My girlfriend and I had to hold ourselves back from slurping it up like soup haha As for the French fries, crispy with the seasoning on point. 

Green Chile: Tasted very good but could have held back on the salt. And the meat in the soup was good but should have been cut into smaller pieces. 

Tacos: The sweet saltwater fish option was ok but seriously mediocre compares to the Ancho Chile Beef Brisket taco we ordered. The meat was excellent but surprisingly the avocado and beans were the stars of the dish because you could tell how incredibly fresh the ingredients were to a point that they melted in your mouth! 

Lastly, we decided to do the liquid desert and when I say that we finished with a shot and a Smoking Sangrita Marg! The Marg was strong, in the good way though! The flavors were very unique leaving me  wanting to scream &#34;wowza&#34; after every sip! The Blanco tequila was good but what I really liked was the chaser it was paired with, a Sangrita ( recommended with every shot), a pineapple, fruity juice that made the shot that much more enjoyable! 

I really enjoyed my dining experience at north county and would recommend it to anyone."

It was fairly busy. It was raining so we did get to sit on the porch, but it looked nice, dog friendly too. 

We ordered the Queso Fundido and two beers. The beer came only a few minutes later and the Queso a few minutes after that. The Queso was sizzling in a cast iron pan. There were chips and a tortilla to eat it with.  The chips were thick and Queso was amazing. About half way through we ordered the nachos with chicken. 

The nachos came and were huge! The chicken was juicy, the chips were crispy, and the cheese was goey. There was guacamole, black beans, black olives, and jalapeños on them too. They were layered so you never ran out of toppings for the chips. 

After the nachos we were stuffed. Our server was attentive and very nice. I would highly recommend this place!  I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the tacos. 

You have my seal of approval!"

It made the overall experience very enjoyable. The appetizers were fantastic, I especially loved the thickness and crunch of their chips. I could probably finish an entire order of their nachos by myself, that&#39;s how good they are.I ordered a pulled pork torta which was gigantic. It came with a pot of &#34;jus&#34;, which more like green chile than jus. But since the sandwich itself already had so much going on, I just left the jus aside. 

The food was on the pricey side though, and this may be on account of their fresh ingredients and all-things-homemade mission. But $4-6 per taco seems very expensive, especially because taco carts sell them for around $1.25 a pop. Everything else from the menu is pretty affordable though. I would love to come back here again. :)"

Trying out the alcoholic sodas tonight, I got the cucumber lime margarita. Yee haw it was delicious!

The queso fundido is great, and charbroiled oysters are awesome, but they sometimes run out of them! 

Lots of Mexican food besides seafood if you&#39;re not into it. But great seafood selection for Denver! And my husband and I are seafood fanatics just returning from the East Coast.

The only downside is it is a little pricy and the music can be too loud. 

Check it out before it becomes too popular, I can imagine the line starting to get pretty long for the patio!"

It has a Mexican and seafood based menu that is great! We ordered all sorts of things: Carne Asada Fries, tacos, nachos... We really enjoyed all of it. I liked all of it but the Pork Al Pastor Taco was a highlight for me.

North County has a breakfast/brunch menu, a full bar and a small but excellent beer menu.

Random thing: There is a map on the menu that shows the San Diego area. There was a typo... &#34;Leucadi&#34; should be &#34;Leucadia&#34;. I know this because I used to go boogie-boarding there. Like I said, random."

best french fries (http://www.westword.com/best-of/2015/food-and-drink/best-french-fries-6612399) 
best green chile (http://www.westword.com/restaurants/the-ten-best-places-for-green-chile-in-denver-2016-edition-7591364)
and also the fact that I lived in Cali before moving to Colorado and know that the food scene is legit. I live in downtown Denver so the only downside to visiting was having to travel to Lowry - not a huge deal but this Denver traffic....
So, last Friday, on my birthday, my husband and I visited for dinner. The restaurant was pretty packed. We found a seat at the bar within 15 minutes of being there. The bartender was our server and he was great. The hostesses were friendly as well. Service wise they get an A.  

Below are the items we ordered and what I thought about it:

To eat:
Chips, Salsa &amp; Guacamole - salsa is nothing to get excited over, guac was good, chips were good. 

Mussels &amp; Fries (with a side of bread for dipping) - Wouldn&#39;t order them again. I love mussels and used to go to Le Central for them before they closed down. Maybe its unfair, but the mussels don&#39;t even come close to being as good as what I&#39;m used to. I was excited to taste all the ingredients listed on the description but instead they were pretty bland. I ordered the bread to dip into the juice but it wasn&#39;t very flavorful so it was unnecessary. 

Carne asada Fries (with the green chile) - Definitely shouldn&#39;t be on the top 10 best green chile list, or best fries. I&#39;d honestly prefer to get carne asada fries at Tacos Rapidos. Here&#39;s why: They use cheese sauce that tastes like nacho sauce even though the menu says &#34;Mexican cheeses&#34; and there barely any carne asada on the fries. 

They do however make a couple of homemade hot sauces which are both interesting and complex - one is Serano based and the other a tomatillo based. I enjoyed dipping my fries in both of the sauces and was impressed especially the tomatillo one - never had anything like that as a &#34;hot sauce&#34;. 

To drink...
Rise &amp; Shine - house bottle alcoholic soda - amazing. 
and a special drink that the bartender made me called &#34;Evelyn&#34; for my birthday. - delicious and creative.

Overall, the service is great, the atmosphere is pretty cool, the food is okay. I guess if you live the neighborhood its nice to have a place like this to have a drink and catch up with friends but don&#39;t believe the hype of the Westword reviews on this one."

They&#39;re reasonably priced and there is a wide variety. The ambience is wonderful, as it is with any restaurant in the Hangar 2 area. 

What will keep me from returning here was the mediocre and inconsistent service. The first time I was here the service was fine, but nothing to write home about. This time, it was a disappointment. For the prices you pay - I spent $60 at happy hour alone - I would expect to be asked if I would like another drink, more food, or dessert before our check is dropped in front of us. Our server never smiled, never made eye contact. I had ordered a second glass of wine, which she forgot. Wouldn&#39;t be a big deal, but the sum of the early check drop, no personality, and complete disregard when I asked her about my second glass of wine, left a salty taste in my mouth. 

I&#39;ll stick with Los Chingones from here on out."

I&#39;m always a fan of Mexican food, so I was on board from the start. The restaurant is tucked away in the Lowry area, near the Lowry Beer Garden. The hostesses were quite polite, but you could tell that they were overwhelmed with the Friday night crowd. I got there around 6:30pm and the restaurant was super crowded and busy. I put my name in and was told that it would be a 45 minute to one hour wait. I was told that I could go to the beer garden to wait and they would call me, but I just chose to wait there. I wasn&#39;t too upset with the wait, because I feel like this is what Denver is like nowadays, but I wish there was somewhere to sit.

When we finally did get our table, we ordered margaritas and chips with guacamole and salsa. The chips were thin and crispy, while the salsa was tangy and not overly spicy. The guacamole was good, but nothing amazing. The margaritas were also good, not too sour and not too sweet. I think my favorite thing was the fact that they came in their own mini shaker -- super cute!

My friend and I both ordered tacos from the a la cart menu. I had the Chicken Tinga, the duck, and the baja fish tacos. All three were very good, but I think my favorite was the duck. They were all served on corn tortillas with a side of salsa.

My friend got a chicken taco and two El Pastor (pork) tacos. She had been to the restaurant before and said that her favorite was the El Pastor. 

In the end, I&#39;d like to come back for brunch, or to try their steak fries, which I understand are a lot like nachos, but with fries instead of chips."

It is in a pretty cool location next to the old hangar that has been turned into storage. The inside décor is pleasant and uncluttered with a nice layout. The place was very clean so I passed on my customary bathroom inspection.

The service was a little slow considering they weren&#39;t real busy but the manager fills in the gaps by his visits to tables to address needs. The staff seemed friendly and were able to answer our questions with confidence.

We all shared the fries smothered with green chili and cheese. The fries were just normal fries but add that real good green chili and they were delicious. For my meal I ordered 3 tacos, chicken, mole short rib and beef. The tacos are small but neatly presented with an appropriate amount of protein. The chicken and beef tacos were ok as tacos go, I have had better and I have had worse. I loved the mole short rib taco, it was succulent and had just the right balance of flavors. 

I will return for the mole short rib tacos and a bowl of the green chili on a Saturday morning again. The prices were a little high but it&#39;s sort of a trendy area and they can get away with it."

When we got settled at the hotel around 10pm, we were hungry.  Thanks to Yelp, I found North County which had great reviews.  Yelp did not disappoint!  A party for my mouth with exotic flavors that are fresh and delicious!  It was a perfect late night eat, and our waiter, Conner, was awesome and had fantastic suggestions!

Menu: 5 stars
They have a little of everything: soups, salads, Baja fish tacos, breakfast all day, desserts, and of course, TACOS!  They also had an impressive bar with just about any liquor we could think of.  Hubby is a tequila snob, and he was impressed with their selection of high end offerings.  They also serve Boylan&#39;s Gourmet Handcrafted Sodas and lots of yummy looking drinks.

Service: 5 stars
It was pretty dead when we went (only 3 tables total), but the service was top notch.  Conner answered questions we had about the menu as if he was the chef himself.  He was able to describe flavor and sauce combinations perfectly.  He also had great recommendations based on our like/dislikes, and he was spot on.  We had been traveling for 5 hours, so we were somewhat dehydrated and going through water quickly.  He never let us run out!  He also made sure we liked everything, but was never in our way.  His upbeat attitude and friendliness was a great welcome to Colorado.

Atmosphere: 5 stars
The restaurant is very trendy and interesting.  Hubby and I found ourselves not talking much and looking around and taking it all in.  It&#39;s bright, fresh, and fun, just like the food.  The bar looks very impressive, and is well lit.  Everything was also very clean.

Food: 5 stars
I ordered the Da Baby El Pastor ($3), Chicken Tinga ($4), and the Cumin &amp; Coriander Slow Roasted Pork ($4) tacos.

The Da Baby El Pastor was really, really unique.  The charred pineapples complimented the slight spiciness of the rotisserie pork with the salsa verde in a perfect marriage I wasn&#39;t expecting.  I finished it wanting more!

The Chicken Tinga was probably my favorite.  Moist, flavorful, and everything you expect form a great chicken street taco.

The Cumin &amp; Coriander Slow Roasted Pork was another interesting flavor combo.  I got it with the Jicama cabbage slaw on the side, but the banana chips, much like the pineapple on the Da Baby El Pastor, along with the banana-habanero agave nectar cream, added an interesting sweetness and texture to the slightly spicy taco.  The meat was a bit dry, but it didn&#39;t ruin it.

The corn tortilla... it deserves a paragraph for itself!  I didn&#39;t verify, but these seemed like fresh, homemade corn tortillas.  These were not the rubbery and bland type you expect to come in big stack in a plastic bag.  These had chew, texture, flavor, and were sturdy to hold it&#39;s ever so important fillings.  They added a nice compliment to the texture of the taco fillings, and helped make the tacos filling. 

We also ordered a Boylan&#39;s Gourmet Handcrafted Cream Soda ($4, bottomless).  This was some smooth cream soda.  It was very rich!  And Sweet!  I rarely find things too sweet or too rich, but this was one of those rarities.  I don&#39;t think I could drink even a half on my own.  But it was delicious.

I don&#39;t recall which tacos hubby ordered, but he enjoyed them all as well.

Price: 5 stars
The prices were fantastic considering the quality of the food.

Overall: 5 stars
This was a solid 5 star restaurant for me.  I only went the one time, but I&#39;ll be sure to go again the next time I fly to Denver.  After writing this review, I want to fly there again, now!  I can&#39;t say enough cool things about it.  Oh, it was too cold to sit outside, but they had a cool looking patio area with a nice little fire feature (not big enough to add warmth) in the center.  This is worth a stop!"

Wait staff and manager had some blathering idiotic spiel about &#34;company policy&#34; that it&#39;s &#34;like this everywhere&#34;. We walked out on the food that we&#39;d ordered.

I don&#39;t think I can tell you anything the Yelp! community already hasn&#39;t. The Rock Lobster tacos have so many things on them (slaw, mango salsa, I know there&#39;s got to be more!), the first time the waitress listed them all, I thought she was offering me side dishes! You&#39;ll need 2-4 to fill you up depending on your hunger level and if you have sampled anything else from the HH menu, but they are fresh, delicious, and worth much more than two bucks!

As dark beer lovers, my husband and I do not love their beer selection. Can&#39;t really fault them for that though, because that&#39;s not what they&#39;re trying to be. And they rotate their taps, so there&#39;s always a chance something better will come. Their deal on Modelo Bombers is sweet enough, that halfway through your beer, you forget about having wanted a stout to begin with! 

My husband had a personalized Tequila sampler one night from an awesome bartender. Not a tequila fan previously, our bartender took the time to find a representation from different styles of Tequila. It was a great introduction beyond the tequila shots and sunrises of our &#34;youth&#34;. And the chaser they make is phenomenal. I wish they&#39;d make an entire cocktail with it!"

This restaurant brings the pride of San Diego to Denver. The fish tacos are amazing. They were well seasoned and the mango salsa is to die for. The other great part; are the homemade chips. The chips come out with either salsa or guacamole. I suggest the guacamole. It is seasoned right and compliments the chips very well. 

We are also given two types of salsa. A verde and a hot. The is not for the faint of heart. The verde however is very good on chips and your fish tacos. 

The regular tacos are also declious and are served with corn tortillas. I have had tacos in a small town of Mexico (where a lady made them fresh everyday for us). I never thought I would be able to find tacos like that again until I found this place. 

The scenery is nice, the patio is fun, and the service is great.

My only compliant is that they do not serve ice with their water. That however can be an easy fix."

It is a nice location and their staff are super attentive and friendly.  However, the best part are their food and drinks.

I had their strawberry margarita and it certainly did its job!!!  It was cute because it came with its own little cocktail shaker (enough for two glasses).  The waitress who poured me my first glass asked if I was excited for it and I was.  I was also very excited for their taco tuesday special which is a $1 off all tacos.  My boyfriend and I ordered the da baby el pastor, mole braised short rib, and the rock lobster taco.  Our favorite was the braised short rib.  We also ordered chicken empanadas and carne asada fries.  And oh my gosh, the carne asada fries were the best I ever had!!!  I am actually craving it right now.

We were one of the only tables at around 430 but by the time we left the place was packed. They have a decent happy hour. Their adult sodas are $1 off but they are still about $7 a piece and they have $6 strawberry margaritas. 

We order the half pound of rock shrimp which was incredibly fresh and tasted delicious. If I remember correctly it was about $11 on happy hour. I had three tacos for dinner: el pastor, beef brisket and red snapper. I would definitely get the el pastoe and brisket tacos again. They had a good mix of traditional and unexpected toppings and it all was fresh. The red snapper taco was just alright. It didn&#39;t have as much flavor as the others and tasted pretty fishy. 

I will agree with others that this place is a little pricey. Between the four of us we somehow managed to rack up $170 bill. It was enjoyable but I think next time we will scale it back a little bit."

A few friends and I decided to venture out for dinner and drinks and had heard good things about North County so we made our way over on Saturday night and it was 100% worth it!!!

First - they were really busy. We did get there during the dinner rush but we only had to wait about 20 minutes and we did so at the bar which was more than okay with us. They have a great patio but the weather wasn&#39;t really cooperating so we decided to dine in. Despite being slammed, the hostess was incredibly polite and apologetic for the wait.

After we were seated, our server Suzy was by our table immediately and made some recommendations for appetizers and she nailed it! We had the queso fundido (and while this comes with tortilla chips, I asked for some flour tortillas too and it was a perfect combination). She also recommended the Carne Asada fries - yes, you&#39;re reading that right and they were AMAZING (this was definitely my favorite app). Steak cut fries covered in steak and queso - how can you go wrong? You can&#39;t. And as a last minute add-on, my friend got the duck quesadilla - unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get to eat much of this as I found it a bit too spicey but if you have read any of my other reviews, I am a complete baby when it comes to spice so this could have just been me BUT both of my friends who ate it (and loved it) had very red faces, so I am pretty sure it was just spicey.

While we waited for the apps to come out, we decided to try a few of their alcohol infused sodas which are made in-house. I had a strawberry lemonade one and it was delicious!!! They had about 5 different ones to choose from. 

Again, our awesome waitress Suzy made some taco recommendations to include the Chicken Tinga and their famous fish tacos. All of which were SO SO good! They are smaller, of course, so I recommend at least 2 per person (if of course you dont gorge yourself on apps to start like we did but I would recommend doing that too because did I mention the fries?!?!)

Overall, an AWESOME night and can&#39;t wait to go back!!!"

When we arrived the wait for two was about 30-40 min. Luckily we were quickly informed the bar was first come first serve and they served their full menu. Starving, we took that option. Our bar tender was friendly and fast without being too pushy. We ordered chips and salsa to start, the salsa was tasty and the portion size was right for two. We each went on to order three different tacos. I had the el pastor, duck confit and veggie rajadas, all delicious. I honestly couldn&#39;t pick a favorite and I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the other varieties listed. I&#39;ll also note the food came quickly, which was a nice surprised since the restaurant was packed! It was too cold for the patio but they have a nice set up there I&#39;ll have to check out soon!"

The staff the management and the owner treat you the same kind and like your family they truly know how to get me to come back.

We were disappointed that there weren&#39;t free chips and salsa because we were really hungry.  The service was quick and food came out quick.  The al pastor taco was the best of our dishes.  My mussels were over cooked, but the fries were great.  The waitress graciously offered to take it off our bill. My kids didn&#39;t like the hamburger and were disappointed because the pickles were spicy.  Our friends liked their chicken nachos.  It was very loud in the restaurant, which was good and bad.  Great because my kids didn&#39;t have to be totally quiet and it was past their normal dinner time.  But it was tough to hear anyone talking across the table."

Also, I&#39;m sick of the parking situation in Cherry Creek these days. Construction is not your friend. Anyway, my husband, Cheryl, and I all had a delicious lunch today.

We started with an order of nachos and added the slow cooked pork. The chips were nice and sturdy, which I wasn&#39;t sure about at first, but they really grew on me. It was nice not to have SCS (soggy chip syndrome). They said they use a lighter chip for their chips and salsa. Good call North County, good call. The cheese was a liquid cheese, and they had delicious jalapenos, beans, pico--the all of the usual suspects. Needless to say the plate was clean by the end of our meal.

For my meal I ordered a bowl of the green chili. It was a thick version of chili and had a substantial amount of pork in it. The pork was broken into smaller chunks, unlike some chili that have big, tough pieces that you have to eat with a fork and knife. It is thickened with masa, so it is quite hearty and has just the right amount of heal, IMO. It is served with house made corn chips and a house made flour tortilla. Since I had already indulged in the nachos I decided to try the tortilla and it was pillowy soft and delicious. And not too big. Perfect for dipping, but even good by itself.

We were too full for dessert and didn&#39;t try any of their adult beverages, but we will definitely be back. They have daily specials and an awesome happy hour!"

This place is close to home, with an ok beer selection, and some other interesting things going on. Chorizo is my go-to when it comes to taco places, but I either had very little meat or too much of everything else to even taste it. My wife&#39;s green chile was sub par at best, with only tiny fatty chunks of pork and only a single flour tortilla to enjoy... And the tortillas were actually good enough to want a second! I&#39;d give them a second chance, but I didn&#39;t feel like we were wanted there to begin with. All the other tables had full bottles of water, but we had to ask a second time for a glass of water, and received just two tumblers of water. Reminded me of Margaritaville with the music and atmosphere.

I will be fair and say that if we do come back, it&#39;ll be to try something else on the menu. This place has potential, but probably no need to be any better because there&#39;s a solid throng of Lowry clientele who are there for the patio experience and to see friends and fam."

At 19:00hrs ish, man this establishment is indeed packed to the brim!  Is this a GOOD SIGN??  I do hope so.  We went here for Dinner coz it was the closest establishment in this part of neighborhood after running some errands.  That recent visit was on Saturday December 20th 2014.

Since it was packed, we are seated near to the entrance/exit of the &#34;Garage Door&#34; in which can be chilly for some since the weather outside was slightly COLD!  Hence just make sure you wear &#34;layers&#34; in case you seat near this area during the WINTER.

From the Menu, it has something for all..  err for this case for Hubs and I.  THANK GOD FOR THAT!  From the Menu we ordered the following items :

*  Shrimp and Octopus Ceviche ($11.00)
*  Ancho Chile Brisket Taco ($4.50)
*  La Hamburgesa Classic ($13.00)
*  Carne Asada Fries ($8.00) DAILY SPECIALS for Saturday
*  Grilled Fish Po Boy (Specials Of The Day) ($15.00) 

For beverages we opt to have Large Coffee ($8.00)

I like my order of Shrimp and Octopus Ceviche.  Its doable though the price can be a little steep.  Hubs like his order of Brisket Taco, the Hamburger and the Carne Asada Fries.

For my main Entrée of Grilled Fish Po Boy, it tends to be a little salty for my taste bud.  Perhaps so with what they put a little of Cajun seasoning.  

Our Main server his name is Isaac.  He is indeed informative, inviting and answers all our questions we had from the Menu.  He make sure that all our food, include the Main Entrees do not contain PORK that we cannot consume.  For his service alone he get 5 stars!  Overall, this evening, from the food, and the ambience it received 3.5 stars at best for this establishment.  We don&#39;t mind returning when needed.  Left this establishment at about 20:25hrs ish.

What a great spot! North County, inspired by coastal North San Diego, was incredible. It is also by the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Lowry which is a plus. I&#39;ve always loved the atmosphere in this neighborhood and haven&#39;t found a bad restaurant here yet!

Between my friend and I, we ordered the Shrimp and Octopus Ceviche (one of my favorite foods!), the chips/salsa/guac, and 3 different types of tacos - Da Baby El Pastor, Mole Braised Short Rib, and Chicken Tinga. Really no complaints with anything! I highly recommend the ceviche, which was on point and was uniquely served with jicama slices which made it incredibly refreshing. All the tortillas are homemade and meats are delicately cooked, so definitely get the tacos! The El Pastor was especially AMAZING. 

It&#39;s not the cheapest place, but the flavors you get definitely come with a territory. I will certainly be back!"

North County is pretty new and I&#39;ve been four or five times. It&#39;s got a really cute interior, a nice patio and friendly enough staff. I love the handmade sodas, especially the spicy one Drunken Burro. I will say the menu itself, is altogether pretty spicy. So, be careful what you order so there is some diversity. The churros come with delicious hot chocolate and is beautifully displayed. Overall, certainly a place worth visiting in Hangar 2"

I went there and ordered the Avocado Guajillo Caesar Salad, which is what I generally always order.  

On the menu itself, it says the salad is $9 and says &#34;add any protein you want.&#34;  Nothing is listed for the price of any protein.  This was probably the 4th time I&#39;ve ordered this salad, and I have never been charged for the fish that I add, until this time when I was charged an additional $5.

When I pointed this out to our server, he said he&#39;d get the manager.  The manager then proceeded to tell me that &#34;There&#39;s no possible way you&#39;ve never been charged for a protein. There&#39;s just no way&#34;  Well, yes it is possible.  In fact, that&#39;s why I kept ordering the salad because it was $9 (I would not pay $14 for a Caesar Salad.)

I even pointed out to him that there were no indication about protein prices on the menu, which he then turned around and told me, &#34;Well, that is a mistake.&#34;  Ok, that&#39;s perfectly fine, but he proceeded to STILL charge me the additional $5.  

I realize that it&#39;s only $5, but the fact that I had previously never been charged (for which he then basically told me I was lying), and then still charged me after admitting  the mistake on the menu simply showed poor professionalism.  I was SO disappointed because I really liked this place."

There are multiple drinks and tons of food on the happy hour specials list!
Buuuut the food could use some work.

Margaritas: delicious. Just a good old marg. (also the strawberry marg looked good!)
Carne Asada Fries: Also very good. Super cheesy. Kinda like fry nachos covered in steak. (although to be honest, steak could use some more flavor. so could the green chili actually)
Duck Quesadilla: NO. I was so excited about this dish and the it turns out that the duck is flavorless, cheese is boring flavorless, and its stuffed with flavorless rice. Also, the sauce that they claimed was an orange teriyaki sauce...wasn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what it was. Also flavorless. Was so bummed about this because this thing cost 15 bucks! And I was really hoping it would blow my mind.

Overall, menu is sick (as in ill...as in awesome)! So many cool things on it! But I&#39;m concerned about the taste...maybe they need a little time to beef up their kitchen staff and spices? Its still a fairly new spot."

But I&#39;m from San Diego and this is not truly representative of So-Cal mexican food I&#39;m use to.
It definitely has the North County vibe in terms of using duck meat in a taco.
At least they could use fresh queso as their cheese instead of nacho cheese or shredded american cheese.
I&#39;ll definitely come here for the tequila, but I&#39;ll settle for Colorado-style mexican food at Santiago&#39;s."

In fact I believe they are tied neck and neck with flavor! From the chicken Tinga to their traditional fish tacos this place hits everything on the head. Do not skip the infused beverages, I repeat don&#39;t skip the infused beverages. I had the strawberry lemonade which was so refreshing and not overly sweet either. The Paloma is awesome but strong. My main compliment to North County is how despite an app, 3 tacos, dessert and 2 drinks we didn&#39;t leave in a food coma but healthy full which is rare when eating Mexican style food. I will say though $8 for salsa, chips and guacamole is a little overpriced given its free in other Mexican restaurants with an up charge for guac being $4-5 dollars, that one was a little hard to swallow for sure. Never the less we will be back!"

We had the nachos and the chips were nice and thick and they were generous with the toppings. The house-made hot sauces were fantastic. The only thing that took it down to 4 stars instead of 5 was the sticker shock we got when we received the bill and saw that our draft beers were $10 each. This place is right next to the Lowry Beer Garden and other restaurants and we just couldn&#39;t see why their draft beers were so overpriced. No one else in the area charges that much, especially for local draft beers, even the fancy ones."

I don&#39;t care if you didn&#39;t know it was single occupancy or not, just don&#39;t do that.

And if you do, don&#39;t look at me like I&#39;m supposed to accommodate you because you have a tiny human being starin&#39; at us both-- in a bathroom, with her askin&#39; &#34;Daddy, why are we in the boys bathroom?&#34;

&#39;Cuz I&#39;ll stare in you straight in the face and say, &#34;Yeah, Daddy-- why ARE you in the boys bathroom?&#34; then look down at your daughter, then back up to you. 

Yes, this happened.

Typically, I don&#39;t dock points on establishments for their clientele, and I&#39;m not here, but fools gotta know what they&#39;re gettin&#39; into walkin&#39; into a joint, and walkin&#39; in here just know that there will likely be some entitled, obtuse Lowry families you&#39;ll have to deal with.

Like the elderly folks sitting next to me at the bar, the ol&#39; handbag of a broad (of the two) gesturing so wildly with her hands that she kept bumping me-- with a good 8 inches of space between us. Finally, I turn and ask her if she has enough room and she says to me, &#34;Oh, sweety-- you&#39;re fine.&#34;

&#34;I know I&#39;m fine,&#34; I reply. &#34;I&#39;m askin&#39; you.&#34; Handbag&#39;s hubby did not like this, but if I&#39;m trying to politely let you know you&#39;re muckin&#39; up, don&#39;t say something stupid like &#34;My bad.&#34;  I know it&#39;s your bad. &#34;Your bad&#34; is the whole reason we&#39;re even talkin&#39;.

BFF cooled the situation with a quip about how a few glasses of tempranillo make me a little antsy in my pantsy (a genius &#34;Super Troopers&#34; reference totally lost on those dinosaurs (she&#39;s so clever, BFF)).

Now I can concentrate on how slammin&#39; the joint is-- the all-day happy hour on Monday is amazing. Get at those rock lobster tacos (but don&#39;t you dare make a B-52s joke like the idiot that yells BINGO! when the first number is drawn (right?!?!)) and-- you have to get ready for this:

They have Modelo bombers.

I&#39;m not a huge fan of talkin&#39; to someone backlit by the open bay doors, but that&#39;s the price you pay for open bay doors (there&#39;s a 2001: Space Odyssey joke here somewhere...). It&#39;s also rad to watch the folks at the cross-fit gym down the sidewalk because those fools are workin&#39; hard. 

All the folks workin&#39; NC were super rad.

When returning-- and I will return-- I&#39;ll go to the bathroom beforehand, and be wholly explicit with patrons who don&#39;t understand personal space by stating &#34;Pardon me, your leathery, decrepit, skeleton-limb is bumping me and I&#39;d rather it didn&#39;t.&#34;"

We had a larger group about 10 people and at first they weren&#39;t sure they could seat us. Two booths ended up opening and we sat next to each other that way.

Our server was less than attentive. I get there were 10 people, but there 6 people at one table and 4 at another, which should necessitate different tabs, so shouldn&#39;t be too crazy to keep up with. We ordered chips, salsa and guacamole right away, which we received pretty quickly and we demolished. It took awhile for us to receive waters (and since we&#39;d just come from a workout, that was tough to deal with). Once we finally put in our drink orders and waited for them, our waiter dropped them off and disappeared before we could give him our orders. Because we were famished, we were becoming unhinged with the wait to even order to then wait for food. 

I ordered a blueberry lavender mojito which was just delicious and served in a mason jar, with a lid. The mojito had lots of fresh mint, which made my night. I also ordered 2 chicken empanadas, a chorizo/potato taco and a rock lobster taco. The rock lobster taco is listed as an item on the happy hour menu, with no description. I asked our server for a description and to say that he was less than helpful was an understatement. He told me that, &#34;It&#39;s exactly what it says it is, rock lobster in a taco.&#34; Really? That statement really annoyed me because I had no idea how it was prepared. He finally told me that it came with a coleslaw like the baja fish tacos, so I decided to get it. One of my dining companions told me afterwards that it was fried, which was more than the waiter told me.

Everyone else seemed to like most of their food. I had no issue with the food and I&#39;m pretty sure I will return. Several of my other friends have been here before and said the food is great, but service is spotty. That was pretty much what I experienced, which is too bad. I hope they can up their service game. The only reason I&#39;m giving them 3 stars and not 4 is because the food was really good."

I had the much praised rock lobster taco, the meat was fried, so of course it was delicious. A bit of a cop out, but hey. 
My husband got the green chili which did have really good flavor. Fortunately their hot red sauce made everything better. We had the fundito which is the best I&#39;ve had and that&#39;s including Machete and Pinche. My husband also got the pork taco which he said was dry. I&#39;m not thinking pork is their forte.
The huge winners were the drink prices and the coconut flan. The flan is made there (not sure where the other desserts are made) and it was effing delicious. Not too sweet, lots of great flavor.
Side note, their receipts were in French. Not sure who was in charge of the language selection in the ol computer."

I&#39;ve come here for dinner, happy hour, and brunch, and it has never failed me. As a matter of fact, brunch, in particular, exceeded my expectations. Their drinks are all incredible and unique. The fundido is delicious, I love the rock lobster tacos, empanadas are great... You really can&#39;t go wrong.
The drinks are definitely the highlight though. My experience at brunch included a blueberry Belgian waffle accompanied with a blueberry mojito. I mean, is there really a better way to start your day? 
On top of a great menu and amazing drink program, the service is always top notch. Whether it&#39;s an hour before close during happy hour, or during brunch rush, the servers at North County are informed of their menu and do a fantastic job. I&#39;ve taken quite a few friends here and they have all loved it. If you haven&#39;t been here, treat yourself ASAP!"

I opened up Yelp and searched for nearby restaurants to walk to during our lunch break. I&#39;m pretty happy that I stopped in here.

Just as a disclaimer, I did not order anything that is seafood-y. I&#39;m not a fan of seafood, but the &#34;Mexican&#34; part of the description is what got me in the door. I, apparently, can&#39;t pass up Mexican food.

Despite not having anything with seafood in it, I really enjoyed the lunch I had. I ordered a chicken tinga taco which was delicious, and then also ordered the build-you-own chicken tortilla soup. I really liked the soup (and am also not able to pass on soup....Mexican soup especially) and the option to add in what I actually wanted. They gave options for add-ins, too: cheese, tortilla strips, jalepenos, chives, and more! It was delicious.

The service was great. I sat at the bar since I was alone and just stopping in for a quick lunch. The girl who helped me was really nice, and ended up giving me a glass of their alcoholic soda, which I didn&#39;t even know was a thing. This alone is why I&#39;ll probably return. She gave me The Sweetest Berry (I believe this was the name) and it was delicious!

The pricing is a little high, but still fun to try out a new place and even a new beverage!"

First, I&#39;m not sure where the name comes from, I was not expecting tacos and seafood given the name North County. But....it gets an extra star for being in walking distance from my work &amp; the reasonable price doesn&#39;t hurt either! The staff was also friendly &amp; attentive. 

We ordered the chips &amp; guacamole and it was very tasty! I ordered the Da Baby El Pastor and the Ancho Chile Marinated Beef Brisket - both were very delicious and a total of $7.50! 

For a quick meal, sometimes we&#39;ll run across the street to Qdoba &amp; the meal is nearly $12. I think I have a new place for a quick, cheap, delicious and fast meal! 

I can&#39;t wait to come here after work &amp; enjoy happy hour! The drinks look yummy."

Carne Asada fries +
Fish tacos were recommended by the wait staff as the restaurant specializes in San Diego area food (the land of fish tacos). We ordered up Halibut, Tuna and Salmon. Halibut was my favourite. I think it was cooked over a charcoal grill and just perfect. The tuna was also the bomb.com. A lot of places these days serve up fish tacos (usually something generic like Tilapia), and anywhere fish tacos are just *meh*, but North County really knows what they are doing. The menu here is fairly simple and straight forward. Restaurants don&#39;t need to be complicated, just do a good job with what they&#39;re serving. 

Dessert? Chocolate cake with chai ice cream, whipped cream &amp; strawberries. Go for it."

I have had several tacos and all have been good. The best in my opinion are the fish tacos that change daily - most expensive, but well worth the extra buck or two!

Friday night special for shrimp - fantastic! Do it, you won&#39;t regret it. 

The two main issues I&#39;ve had with North County: 
- 1. that sometimes the drinks are a little slow to come out when you&#39;re not sitting at the bar (which is frustrating because getting the drinks I&#39;m talking about making consists of putting ice in a glass with a garnish and grabbing the adult soda bottle (pretty easy) (drink is poured table side)
- 2. This is my biggest issue with North County. They only have CA and Mexico beers and they are ALL incredibly overpriced!!!!! Get some"

The restaurant itself is pretty small but had a few spots at the ball since I was a solo.  I started off with some chips and salsa... They were good, as the salsa was clearly pretty fresh and had a bit of spice, it hit the spot.  The $5 price tag attached to them on the tab caught me a bit off guard. 

I had a mix of tacos, short rib, pork and brisket.  They were all extremely good, but the short rib stuck out to me.  It had a bit of spice mixed with the sweetness of the pineapple or whatever was mixed in.  

They also have a nice selection of beer available and a ton of tequila. Not sure I saw much other liquor than tequila but I&#39;d assume they had the main ones for mixed drinks."

For the next try, we went on a Wednesday night thinking it wouldn&#39;t be nearly as crowded.  Well, we were half right - the wait was only 30 minutes this time.  We were ready to do it but just as we were adding our name to the list, two spots opened up at the bar.  We were doubly lucky since not only did we avoid the wait, we were treated to the friendly and knowledgeable service of Assistant General Manager Robby from behind the bar.  Robby had lots of wisdom to share about tequila and helped Mr. P to find a new and delightful sipping tequila that we can purchase locally.

North County has fresh daily seafood selections posted on the big board as you walk in the door.  I was thrilled to see Chesapeake oysters listed.  $12 for a half dozen?  Twist my arm.  Boy, those sure went down fast.  We then ordered the shrimp and octopus ceviche with chips and my new favorite way to eat ceviche: using thinly sliced pieces of jicama as wraps in place of chips.  Genius!  Next up was the duck quesadilla and it could have made a meal all by itself.  It was kind of rich and came with a meaty broth and something reminiscent of ranch dressing for dipping sauces.  We also tried a couple of the house salsas:  a tomatillo with a bit of a kick and rioja, which was super hot with a just hint of sweet.  Most normal people would have just stopped there but we somehow felt obligated to try the tacos.  Grilled hamachi was up on the big board and it was just as delicious as it sounds in a taco, accompanied by mango salsa and the house mild salsa on the side.  Mr. P opted for the mole tacos.  In between courses we were served a palate cleanser juice made (at least partially) from parsley, cilantro, pineapple, and mild jalapeno, if memory serves.  It was quite refreshing.

From beginning to end, everything we ate was fresh and bursting with flavors.  No wonder this place has a 30 minute wait on a Wednesday evening!  And I can&#39;t wait to return."

The barstools outside were not very comfortable and sort of awkward to sit on. overall the patio was pretty impressive. 

I had a margarita that was good but not great. 
I tried the zucchini vegetarian taco and the beer battered fish taco. The beer battered fish taco was excellent but the zucchini taco was lacking in flavor. 

My friend and I also got an order of chips &amp; salsa.. The salsa was very flavorless and on the sweet side the chips were greasy and could have used some salt. At $5 they were absolutely not worth it. 

The service was mediocre.. I was also a little taken back by one of the guys running food.. Most employees were in jeans and black shorts but this guy had on short yellow shorts and a white tank top. 
It was a little strange and unprofessional.

Given the location I don&#39;t think I will come back here. Not worth the drive."

The cup of green chili was very porky, not too hot. She had chicken empanadas, which were another happy hour offering, and they were tasty.
They have a Sierra Nevada tall boy of the Torpedo variety, 7.2 ABV, also available in a bomber, if you can handle it. Her strawberry Rita was good with sugar rim. Troy A Guard does it again with this sea food/mex addition to his local restaurant empire.
Next time I will try the fried oyster Po boy.
The outside seating filled up early on a Thursday.

I was visiting from California, and we were looking for a birthday dinner spot for my brother. I looked up the highest rated Mexican food in Denver. Although this technically wasn&#39;t number one, I decided their menu looked great and it was close to the apartment anyways, so we went.

Ambience: It was raining when we went here, so it looked like almost no one was inside on a Sunday afternoon. This was not the case, we got in and saw the place was packed. The ambience is casual, with a large bar and lots of indoor and outdoor seating.

Food: 5/5. North County is based on San Diego Mexican food, which sounds odd, but rest assured, everything was delicious. I ordered the mucho mucho grande nachos with chicken ($14). Absolutely worth the price. As you can see from the pictures, the nachos are stacked high, wide, and carefully topped and mixed with nacho cheese sauce, melted cheese, olives, jalapenos, guacamole, and other tasty toppings. As a result, I found myself calling the nachos delicious, and truly the best I&#39;ve ever had. That&#39;s a bold statement for me to make, but it was so true. It was so so satisfying, packed full of rich and smooth flavor with every bite. It was simply excellent. Absolutely no complaints. My brother and my dad got fish tacos, which were sized well, and apparently very good, as I got rare nods of approval while they ate. We also ordered dessert, a banana, strawberry, and whipped cream topped caramel flan. This was again, one of the &#34;bests&#34; of the meal. It was simply the best flan I&#39;ve had. It was incredibly creamy, and matched very well with the fruit and whipped cream. I couldn&#39;t stop eating it, the smaller portion size makes you savor the taste indeed. One of the key points about eating here is that everything is FRESH. You can taste the high quality in your food, no matter what you get. 

Service: 5/5. To summarize this quickly, phenomenal service. Our waiter checked in on us probably over 7-8 times throughout the evening, in ways that were not at all fake, intrusive, or annoying. She was a very outgoing, nice, and funny server to us. The same was true to the hostess and the gentlemen who picked up our plates. Everyone was so nice and very helpful. There was nothing I could have asked for more from our service that night. Our waiter was one of the best I&#39;ve had in a restaurant. No complaints whatsoever, she deserved the high tip we gave her. 

Price: 5/5. The prices are very fair for the delicious and high quality you&#39;re receiving in whatever you order. For $14, I was able to get the sky high and very wide nachos. For around $10, my brother ordered three plump tacos, and my dad ordered a bloody Mary and tacos for under $15. No complaints at all, especially with such delicious food.

If you didn&#39;t get the jest of it by now, I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone looking for modern, delicious, and high quality Mexican food, along with great service. Excellent all around."

I ordered the mole brisket, al pastor and chicken tinga. I wasn&#39;t too fond of the mole brisket, but the other two were great! I loved their salsa too.

So why three stars? Their portions are tiny for the cost and come with no sides. These tacos were popularized from street carts for maybe $2. How they get off charging $5 per taco is beyond me. Their diet soda was a little funky tasting too. When we arrived it was a chilly day out and they had the AC on full blast and my poor daughter and I ate our meal with goose bumps even after asking the server if they could turn the air down. :(

I really enjoyed my tacos, but next time I&#39;ll find a taco cart."

I don&#39;t write Yelp reviews but this place has terrible customer service and food. Took over 20 minutes to even greet us and ask for drinks. Totally rude and pretentious staff. If you think your anything like Cali guess again your food sucks. Will never be back. All they serve is street style tacos or breakfast food just plain weird. If your looking for Mexican food, do yourself a favor and skip this place."
